**Belarus Extends Deadline for 'Imushchestvo' Privatization Checks**
The Belarusian government has extended the deadline for the use of 'Imushchestvo' (Property) privatization checks until December 31, 2030. According to the State Property Committee, the checks are a type of government bond that proves a citizen's right to a portion of privatized state property. The checks were issued in the form of records on special check accounts opened for citizens at ASB Belarusbank. Citizens were given certificates confirming their ownership of the checks. The amount of the checks was determined based on a citizen's work experience and age at the time of the law's introduction. Additional sums were allocated to certain categories of citizens, such as disabled people and veterans of the Great Patriotic War. The checks were issued from 1994 to 1997. Citizens who failed to receive their checks within the specified time limit lost their right to do so. Citizens can exchange their 'Imushchestvo' checks for state shares at ASB Belarusbank branches. The shares are offered by 158 open joint-stock companies in various sectors. Citizens can use their own checks, as well as those received by inheritance or gift, up to a total of 250 checks. When exchanging checks for shares, citizens become shareholders and are entitled to participate in the company's management, receive information about its activities, and sell, gift, or transfer their shares. Companies may pay dividends to shareholders, the amount of which depends on the company's performance. Each shareholder receives dividends proportional to the number of shares they own. Once a citizen exchanges their checks for shares, the deal is considered completed, and the checks are considered used and cannot be returned.

**The One Big Beautiful Bill Proposes to Severely Restrict Clean Energy Tax Incentives**
The 'One Big Beautiful Bill' (BBB) passed by the House on May 22, 2025, proposes to severely restrict clean energy tax incentives. The bill would accelerate the termination of the Clean Electricity Investment Credit (ITC) and the Clean Electricity Production Credit (PTC) for facilities that begin construction after a certain deadline. The bill also imposes restrictions on entities with connections to 'prohibited foreign entities' and repeals transferability of most clean energy credits. However, the bill makes no changes to the transferability of the ITC and PTC under Section 6418. The bill also extends the availability of the Clean Fuel Production Credit under Section 45Z for transportation fuel sold through December 31, 2031, but limits the availability of the credit to sales of transportation fuel exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. The bill will face further negotiation and likely modifications in the Senate before being returned to the House and then sent to the President for approval.

**6 In 10 Americans Fear Social Security Will Vanish Before They Retire, As 2033 Insolvency Clock Ticks Louder - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)**
A recent survey by DepositAccounts found that 59% of working-age Americans fear that Social Security will not exist by the time they retire, with 70% of Generation X sharing this concern. The anxiety is driven by the program's main trust fund's depletion in 2033, which would leave incoming payroll taxes covering only 79% of promised checks. Jaime Eckels, a certified-financial-planner, warned that the countdown has moved from abstract to immediate for many savers, saying, 'It's not that far away. We're creeping up on it.' However, not all gauges are as bleak, with the 2025 Retirement Confidence Survey finding that about half of workers remain at least 'somewhat confident' that the government will pay benefits of equal value to today's. Despite this, 60% of workers worry about cuts to Social Security benefits. Analysts stress that insolvency does not equal disappearance, with LendingTree's Matt Schulz saying, 'The truth is that it's highly, highly unlikely Social Security 'won't be available.'

**Sustainability and ESG Advisory Practice Update, May 2025**
The US House of Representatives passed the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act', which includes significant changes to federal energy tax credits. The bill would eliminate various tax credits, including the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit and the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, if construction of the applicable facility does not begin before 60 days after enactment or if the applicable facility is placed-in-service after 2028. Additionally, the bill would end a number of tax credits earlier than under current law. Colorado redefined 'clean energy resource' to include nuclear energy, which may contribute to the state's 2050 net-zero emissions goal. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the registration of the first 'green' stock exchange, Green Impact Exchange (GIX), which will require listed companies to adopt sustainability standards. The European Commission published updated guidance and FAQs on the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and a draft of the Delegated Act, which is open for public consultation until May 13, 2025. The EC also published its 2025-2030 working plan for the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) and the Energy Labeling Regulation (ELR), which includes a list of products that should be prioritized for introducing ecodesign and energy labeling requirements over the next five years. The EC initiated a call for evidence to review the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and plans to revise it in the fourth quarter of 2025. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) consulted on proposed Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) under the ESG Rating Regulation, which aims to improve the transparency and integrity of the business activities of ESG ratings providers.

Abia State Governor, Alex Otti, has stated that he will consult with God before deciding whether to run for office again in 2027. According to his spokesman, Njoku Ukoha, the governor said, 'Just like 2023 was in the hands of God, 2027 will also be in the hands of God.' Otti also emphasized the importance of Aba, the commercial nerve centre of the state, in driving economic growth, stating that his administration's deliberate investment in Aba is 'because we do know that Aba can generate revenue for us to develop other parts of the state.' The governor also announced that December is the deadline for the completion of the Mgboko–Ntigha road project and clarified that the location of Abia Airport in Nsulu was based on technical merit, not political considerations.

**DOSB Receives Four High-Quality Concepts for Olympic Bid**
The German Olympic Committee (DOSB) has received four high-quality concepts from cities and regions interested in hosting the Olympics. According to DOSB President Thomas Weikert, 'We are convinced that with this selection process, we will not only find the best concept for Germany, but also one that will allow us to win in the international competition.' The four candidates are Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, and the Rhein-Ruhr region. Weikert added, 'We are very happy to have four high-quality concepts to choose from. This shows the continued appeal of Olympic and Paralympic Games.' The DOSB will develop the concepts with the candidates until the end of September and present them to the members at a meeting in Frankfurt on December 6. All four candidates plan to let the citizens vote on their plans. The final decision on the German candidate will be made by the end of 2026 and then approved by the DOSB members. The evaluation criteria and the composition of the committee that will make the selection are still unclear. Additionally, it is still undecided whether Germany will bid for the 2036, 2040, or 2044 Olympics. The last Olympics held in Germany were in 1972 in Munich.

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**Washington state House OKs unemployment benefits for striking workers, but adds four-week limit - The Reflector**
The Washington state House has approved a bill to provide unemployment benefits to striking workers, but with a four-week limit. The bill, which passed 52-43, was amended to impose the limit, eight weeks less than the original version. Union leaders were not pleased with the change, but Democratic lawmakers argued that it would help level the playing field for striking workers. Republicans opposed the bill, saying it would incentivize union workers to strike. The bill now goes back to the Senate, which must decide whether to agree with the revisions or stick to its original position. According to Rep. Beth Doglio, 'Fundamentally, this takes a step to level the playing field for striking workers.' However, Rep. Jeremie Dufault argued that 'If you are paying people to strike, you will have more strikes.' The policy would make striking workers eligible for benefits after a one-week waiting period, but any benefits paid during a prohibited strike would be liable for repayment. The changes would take effect on January 1, 2026, and last through December 31, 2035.

**EU Launches Public Consultation for State Aid Reform to Support Clean Industrial Deal**
The European Union has launched a public consultation for a reform of state aid rules, which will accompany the Clean Industrial Deal starting from June. According to the EU draft, the new framework will be valid until December 31, 2030, and member states will be able to grant subsidies based on their national energy mix, both for renewable energy and emerging technologies such as clean hydrogen. The EU also guarantees a timely evaluation of aid for nuclear power 'in line with the treaty and in respect of technological neutrality'. The consultation is open until April 25. The reform of state aid rules will replace the framework adopted in March 2022 following the energy crisis caused by the Russian aggression in Ukraine. With the new set of rules, the EU aims to simplify the granting of public subsidies 'targeted and proportionate', able to attract private investments for projects that contribute to achieving the Clean Industrial Deal's objectives, offering member states 'a longer planning perspective, equal to 5 years'. The proposal, presented in consultation with governments, industry, and experts, provides that eligible projects must be implemented within precise timeframes to ensure an effective acceleration of the clean industrial transition. Specific incentives are planned to support investments 'in all relevant technologies' necessary for decarbonization, with particular attention to initiatives related to batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps, electrolyzers, and carbon capture and storage systems, as well as key components and raw materials needed to produce them. At the operational level, the Twenty-Seven may establish aid schemes based on tender procedures or, alternatively, directly support projects without tendering, but within defined limits. For large-scale projects, governments will need to demonstrate that public funding does not exceed the project's own needs.

**Federation Council to Consider Law Extending Maternity Capital Program**
The Federation Council will consider a law to extend the maternity capital program until the end of 2030. According to the government, approximately 4.9 million families will acquire the right to maternity capital in 2027-2030. The program's current period of action is limited to December 31, 2026. The government estimates that around 2.8 trillion rubles will be needed to implement the program in this period. The extension of the program was previously proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in his address to the Federal Assembly. The Council will also discuss a law limiting distance learning in medical and pharmaceutical education, except in cases specified by federal educational standards, which will be developed by the Ministry of Health. Additionally, the Council will consider the ratification of the agreement with Belarus on security guarantees within the Union State. The agreement states that Russia and Belarus will not direct their relations within the Union State against other countries and will be carried out in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter and other norms of international law. The agreement also establishes that a military attack on a country participating in the Union State will be considered an act of aggression against the Union State as a whole. The agreement also provides for the possibility of creating military facilities and deploying Russian military formations on the territory of Belarus to prevent acts of aggression. The agenda also includes amendments to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, clarifying responsibility for intentional destruction of property, amendments to the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation in terms of establishing responsibility for unauthorized cabotage transportation, and a law on providing children of FSI employees with priority admission to universities.

**Readers respond: Blue states should secede**
Some readers suggest that blue states should consider seceding from the US and forming a new entity or joining Canada, as a response to potential Republican control in the House and Senate after the 2026 midterm election. This idea has already been discussed by several blue state governors, who are working to 'Trump-proof' their states. The author believes that this effort should be expanded to include the possibility of secession, which should be widely publicized and considered if the Republicans maintain control after the election.

**State Duma to Discuss Agreement with Belarus on Security Guarantees and Extension of Maternal Capital Program**
The State Duma plans to discuss the ratification of the agreement with Belarus on security guarantees within the Union State, as well as consider in the second reading the draft laws on extending the program of maternal capital until December 31, 2030, and on the right of the Central Bank to annually determine the list of foreign currencies for the payment of the charter capital of credit organizations. The agreement with Belarus on security guarantees, signed in Minsk on December 6, 2024, was submitted to the State Duma for ratification in February by Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the text of the agreement, nuclear weapons of the Russian Federation may be used in response to the use of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction against Russia or Belarus, 'as well as in the event of aggression against any of the parties using conventional weapons, creating a critical threat to its sovereignty or territorial integrity.' The sides consider a military attack on a participant in the Union State as an act of aggression against the Union State as a whole and will take corresponding countermeasures using all the forces and means at their disposal. As noted by the Chairman of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, the task of the deputies is to implement the decisions made at the level of the heads of the Union State. He emphasized that in the conditions of modern challenges, questions of ensuring security within a common defense space acquire key importance. The extension of the program of maternal capital The draft law on extending the program of maternal capital until December 31, 2030, was submitted to the State Duma by the Russian government in December 2024. Changes are proposed to be made to the Law 'On Additional Measures of State Support for Families with Children.' As stated in the explanatory note, about 5 million Russian families will have the right to maternal capital from 2027 to 2030. According to preliminary estimates, the implementation of the draft law will require additional expenses from the budget in 2027-2030 in the total amount of 2.776 trillion rubles. Volodin previously emphasized that support for families with children, future parents is a priority in the work of the deputies. He said that despite challenges, threats, and Western sanctions, the state fulfills not only all its obligations but also implements additional measures of support for citizens. The Chairman of the State Duma noted that this is the result of the work of the political system and the economic model created by the President of the Russian Federation. The right of the Central Bank to determine currencies for bank capital The State Duma will also consider a draft law granting the Board of Directors of the Central Bank the right to annually determine the list of foreign currencies that can be used to pay the charter capital of credit organizations, insurance organizations, and non-state pension funds. The document is initiated by a group of deputies and senators led by the Chairman of the Committee of the State Duma on the Financial Market, Anatoly Aksakov. The list of such currencies, presumably, may include the currencies of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries - Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Belarus, the currencies of the BRICS countries, including the Chinese yuan (currently allowed for use) and the Indian rupee, as well as the currencies of Brazil, South Africa, Argentina, Egypt, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Ethiopia.

**The Democrats' plan to counter Trump at the state level**
The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) has identified ten states as key targets for the 2025-2026 election cycle to resist Donald Trump's agenda and protect key rights and freedoms. The DLCC aims to defend its one-seat majorities in the state Houses of Virginia and Pennsylvania, and both chambers of the legislature in Alaska, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Democrats are also hoping to chip away at GOP state legislative majorities in Arizona, Georgia, New Hampshire, and North Carolina. DLCC President Heather Williams said, 'State legislatures are the only ballot level with the power to fight back against Project 2025 and the Republicans' takeover of Washington.' Democratic state legislative candidates outperformed the party's dismal performance at the top of the ticket in 2024, and Democrats want to continue making gains through 2030, when new redistricting maps will be drawn following the decennial census.
