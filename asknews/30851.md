**Iran-US Talks Resume in Muscat Amid Deep-Seated Disagreements**
The fourth round of Iran-US talks in Muscat, facilitated by Oman, aims to reach an understanding on Iran's nuclear program before US President Donald Trump's Middle East tour. Both sides reaffirm their commitment to a diplomatic solution, but deep-seated disagreements remain on nuclear enrichment and future guarantees. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is attending the direct talks between Washington and its historic adversary. The main negotiators from Iran and the US will resume their discussions on Sunday to address the disputes related to Iran's nuclear program, in an attempt to reach an understanding before Trump's tour of the Middle East. Trump has warned that he may resort to military action against Iran if diplomatic efforts fail to resolve the nuclear file. The US envoy to the Middle East, Stephen Biegun, said that the US position is clear: 'No enrichment, no nuclear arms,' which means, according to him, a complete dismantling of Iran's nuclear facilities. Biegun added that this round may be the last if no results are achieved. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi emphasized that Iran will not compromise on its nuclear rights, stressing that it is participating in the talks with a good intention, but not at the expense of its legitimate rights. According to Iranian sources, Tehran is willing to discuss imposing some restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, but it categorically rejects stopping uranium enrichment or transferring its stockpile. A senior Iranian official close to the negotiating team explained that there is a difference between what the US demands publicly and what is being discussed in closed rooms, and that things will become clearer after the upcoming round on Sunday, which was postponed due to logistical reasons. Iran has also stated that it will not discuss its ballistic missile program and has demanded clear guarantees that the US will not withdraw from any potential agreement again, as Trump did in 2018. It is worth noting that Trump announced during his first term that the US would withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed strict economic sanctions on Tehran, over three years ago. Since then, Iran has begun to relax its commitments under the deal, including raising the level of uranium enrichment to a level close to that of weapons production, according to estimates by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

**Iran and US Engage in 'Good Faith' Talks on Nuclear Issue**
Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi stated that Iran is willing to engage in 'good faith' talks with the US. He emphasized that if the talks aim to ensure Iran will not obtain nuclear weapons, a deal can be reached. However, if the US tries to deprive Iran of its nuclear rights or proposes unrealistic demands, Iran will firmly defend its legitimate rights. Araghchi also criticized Western countries for their double standards on the nuclear issue, saying that some countries are concerned about Iran's peaceful nuclear plans while remaining silent about a 'occupying, invading, and genocidal' regime possessing large nuclear arsenals. The US and Iran are set to hold their fourth round of indirect talks on Sunday, after three previous rounds in April. The talks aim to address Iran's uranium enrichment activities and its nuclear stockpile. US Special Envoy Vitkovsky has stated that Iran must dismantle its uranium enrichment facilities, calling it a 'red line.' Iranian President Rouhani has repeatedly denied allegations that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons, insisting that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

**US Demands Iran Dismantle Nuclear Program in Next Round of Talks**
The US is going into the next round of nuclear talks with Iran with a maximal demand, according to US Special Envoy Witkoff. He stated, 'We believe they should not be allowed to enrich uranium, possess centrifuges, or have anything that enables them to build a weapon.' This would mean a complete dismantling of Iran's nuclear program. Currently, Iran is enriching uranium to a purity of 60%, whereas over 90% is required for nuclear weapons. The Vienna nuclear agreement allowed Iran to enrich uranium to a maximum of 3.67% and hold a stockpile of up to 300 kg of uranium. Experts believe it is unlikely that Iran will agree to the US demand and import fuel rods for its civilian nuclear program in the future. The nuclear program is a symbol of national pride in Iran, and the government hopes that a new deal will bring economic relief and an end to military tensions in the region.

**Iran Confirms Direct Negotiations with US to Prove Peaceful Nuclear Program**
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi announced that his country is engaging in direct negotiations with the United States to prove its commitment to developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes only. Raisi stated, 'We will never seek to possess nuclear weapons,' and emphasized that Iran 'will not compromise on its right to peaceful nuclear energy.' Raisi added, 'We are negotiating to prove that we do not seek war.' This comes as the Iranian nuclear file is experiencing rapid developments, amidst international concerns about the possibility of Tehran reaching levels of enrichment that would enable it to produce a nuclear weapon, despite its repeated denials of such intentions. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh described the fourth round of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington as 'difficult but beneficial.' Khatibzadeh wrote on his official X account that this round provided 'a better understanding of the positions of both sides and a search for realistic and rational solutions to the disputed issues.'

Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has stated that a complete withdrawal from the country's nuclear program is impossible.

**Iran and US Begin Fourth Round of Nuclear Negotiations**
Iran and the United States have begun their fourth round of nuclear negotiations in Muscat, Oman, according to Iranian media on May 11, 2025. The Iranian Foreign Minister stated that the country's right to enrich uranium is not negotiable. The Iranian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Abás Araqchi, will negotiate with US envoy Steve Witkoff in Muscat. The US has demanded that Iran stop any type of uranium enrichment. Araqchi said, 'The capacity to enrich uranium is one of the honors and achievements of the Iranian nation,' and added that it is a 'non-negotiable' issue. He expressed hope that this round of talks with the US will reach a 'decisive moment.' The two countries have held three previous sessions of talks under Oman's mediation since April 12, aiming to conclude a new agreement to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting international sanctions. Iran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the US and other Western countries fear it may be seeking to develop nuclear weapons. The US has warned that Iran is approaching the level of uranium enrichment needed for nuclear weapons. The negotiations are taking place in a context of intense scrutiny of Iran's nuclear program, particularly its stockpiles of fissile material and the pace of its enrichment activities.

**Israel Rejects Iran's Nuclear Ambitions, US-Iran Talks Resume**
Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid emphasized that his country will not allow Iran to possess 'the most dangerous weapon in the world'. He said, 'It is not acceptable at all that the most dangerous regime will have the most dangerous weapon in the world, it must be dismantled.' This statement came as the fourth round of negotiations between the US and Iran on the Iranian nuclear program began in Oman. The US and Iran have been negotiating since April 12, with Oman acting as a mediator. The two sides have held three rounds of talks so far, with the fourth round scheduled to take place in Rome on May 3, but was postponed 'due to logistical reasons'. The negotiations aim to reach a new agreement that would prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting sanctions on the country. Iran has been enriching uranium to 60%, close to the 90% needed for military use. A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found that Iran has increased its stockpile of enriched uranium 'in a very worrying way'. Youssef Al-Baloushi, head of the Muscat Center for Research and Policy Studies, said that the two sides have not achieved a breakthrough yet, but he is optimistic that it will happen eventually.

**Report warns Iran nuclear threat ‘extreme’ ahead of US-Iran talks | Fox News**
A report by the Institute for Science and International Security warns that Iran's nuclear threat has reached an 'extreme' level, ahead of US-Iran talks. The report states that since February 2024, Iran's nuclear capabilities have worsened, with a shorter time frame to build nuclear weapons and growing normalization of internal discussions favoring building nuclear weapons. According to the report, 'The possibility of Iran deciding to build nuclear weapons has been increased by the ongoing military conflicts in the Middle East.' President Donald Trump has stated that the US will not let Iran have a nuclear weapon, and when asked about the potential for military action if Iran does not make a deal, Trump said, 'Absolutely.' The report also warns that Iran still possesses military capabilities that threaten the region, including large stockpiles of drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. 'Iran still possesses military capabilities that threaten the region. It has large stockpiles of drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles that it can employ against Israel and its allies,' the report states.

Putin mentioned that Russia and the US need to resolve the issue of extending the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which expires in February 2026. Russia suspended its participation in the treaty in 2023. Trump has previously stated that he considers the use of nuclear weapons and the expansion of the nuclear club to be unacceptable. He has also expressed his commitment to working with Putin to address nuclear disarmament.

**Iranian Commanders Propose Lifting Fatwa Banning Nuclear Weapons**
Several senior commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iran have proposed to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, to lift the fatwa banning the development of nuclear weapons, according to The Telegraph. The commanders made this proposal after the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States. 'We have never been so vulnerable, maybe this is our last chance to get it before it's too late', said one of the officials. The fatwa, a religious decree, was issued by Khamenei in 2005, banning the production of all types of weapons of mass destruction. An official noted that the Supreme Leader has banned both negotiations with the US and the creation of nuclear weapons, which 'were the only ways for the regime to survive', and therefore 'he is leading the regime to its downfall'. In recent months, there has been increased pressure on Khamenei to harden the country's foreign policy, with dozens of Iranian lawmakers calling for a review of the country's nuclear policy in 2024. 'We now have the necessary capabilities to produce nuclear weapons, and the only obstacle is the fatwa that bans it', said Kamal Kharazi, head of Iran's strategic council on international relations, in November. No one is allowed to violate the fatwa, which is mandatory for all government agencies, emphasized Iran's Foreign Minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, last summer. As Iran International noted, the Iranian opposition suspects that the fatwa may be interpreted as advisory in the future, rather than a legally binding document. In December, the IAEA warned that Iran is approaching the possibility of creating nuclear weapons. According to the agency's criteria, Iran already has enough material enriched to 60% to create a nuclear weapon if it continues to process the fuel.

**Ajustaron el 'Reloj del Juicio Final': ¿A cuánto quedó la humanidad del apocalipsis?**
The 'Doomsday Clock' has been adjusted to 89 seconds before midnight, a warning to world leaders according to Holz, the president of the Bulletin's Science and Security Board. The clock was created in 1947 by a non-profit organization in Chicago to warn the public about the threat of nuclear war. The decision to move the clock closer to midnight was made due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, which could escalate and involve nuclear weapons at any moment. Additionally, Russia's updated doctrine allows for a wider range of conventional attacks to trigger a nuclear response, and the country has refused to discuss a new treaty to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which expires in 2026. Other sources of instability include the conflict in the Middle East, China's increased military pressure on Taiwan, and North Korea's continued missile tests. Holz also expressed concern about the growing threat of artificial intelligence, which is being used in military applications and could potentially be used to control nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the changing climate was also a factor in the decision to move the clock, with 2024 being the hottest year on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization. 'We are watching closely and hope that the ceasefire in Gaza will hold. The tensions in the Middle East, even with Iran, remain perilously unstable', said Holz. 'There are other potential hotspots around the world, including Taiwan and North Korea. Any of them could become a conflagration involving nuclear powers, with unpredictable and potentially devastating results', he analyzed.

**Iran Urges US to Adopt 'Realistic' Approach and Return to Negotiations**
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Esmail Baqi, said on Monday that his country hopes the new US administration will adopt a 'realistic' approach based on respecting the interests of the region, including Iran. This comes before the inauguration of Donald Trump as US President, who pursued a policy of 'maximum pressure' on Tehran during his first term (2017-2021). During his first term, Trump withdrew from the international agreement on Iran's nuclear program in 2018, after three years of signing it, and reimposed strict sanctions on Iran. In response, Iran significantly increased its stockpiles of enriched materials and raised the level of enrichment to 60%, close to the 90% needed to produce a nuclear weapon, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran has expressed its desire to resume negotiations to revive the agreement and defend its right to possess nuclear energy for civilian purposes and to possess nuclear weapons. The work of the international agreement, UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which approved the nuclear agreement signed in 2015 between Iran, France, Germany, the UK, the US, Russia, and China, will end in October 2025. The European countries have discussed the possibility of using the mechanism to reimpose sanctions on Iran to prevent it from 'acquiring nuclear weapons.' Baqi added that if this mechanism is used in an arbitrary manner to pressure Iran or to obtain concessions, our response will be the same and will be proportional, noting that there will be no reason to remain in certain agreements, 'the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.'
