**Mpox Infections Rise in Berlin, Vaccination Available**
There has been an increase in Mpox infections in Berlin, with all affected individuals being men. Of the 66 men with available information on their vaccination status, 30 have been vaccinated at least once. Sexual contact with men has been identified as the source of infection for 55 of the cases. Mpox is transmitted through close physical contact, particularly during sex, and can cause skin rash, fever, and muscle pain. While there have been no reported deaths in Germany (as of January 29, 2025), certain groups, including men who have sex with men and frequently change partners, are recommended to receive the Mpox vaccine. Two doses are required for basic immunization. In 2022, the disease spread rapidly in Berlin, with over 1,500 laboratory-confirmed cases reported by mid-August. Vaccination is available in most HIV-focused clinics in Berlin and can also be obtained from a primary care physician or specialist since September, according to the Kassenärztliche Vereinigung. Additionally, individuals without health insurance can receive a free vaccine at the Checkpoint BLN or the Zentrum für sexuelle Gesundheit Mitte, as stated by Rolf de Witt of the Berliner Schwulenberatung.

**Africa CDC Say Sierra Leone's Mpox Surge Raises Alarm Across the Continent**
The Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has warned of a potential regional health threat due to the surge in Mpox cases in Sierra Leone. The centre's Chief of Staff, Ngashi Ngongo, stated that Sierra Leone reported 384 confirmed cases in a week, representing 50.7% of all the continent's cases. He noted that the country has seen a 63% jump in confirmed cases in just one week and has a bed capacity of only 60 beds for Mpox treatment centres, but has 800 active cases. Ngongo emphasized that funding is the main issue, but also highlighted the need to improve contact tracing and laboratory capacity. He added that Mpox cases in high-burden countries such as Uganda and Burundi are on a steady decline, while cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo are showing signs of flattening. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared Mpox a public health emergency due to the continuing rise in cases and geographic spread of the outbreak.

**Montreal Public Health Reports Sharp Increase in Tuberculosis, Syphilis Cases**
Montreal public health officials are concerned about a sharp increase in tuberculosis cases, with 203 reported in 2024, a 53% increase from the previous decade's average. The report highlights that the disease disproportionately affects certain groups, including indigenous people and those born in countries where the disease is endemic. The authors urge the province to develop new programs to reach those without adequate insurance, citing 'significant barriers' to care. Additionally, syphilis cases have risen 60% over the last 10 years, with a growing number of women being diagnosed, suggesting an extension of the epidemic towards the heterosexual population. The report also notes outbreaks of measles, whooping cough, and mpox in Montreal in 2024. 'This significant increase in the last year breaks with the stability observed over the previous years,' says the annual report. 'The growing proportion of people without (provincial health insurance) coverage is an invitation to consider the creation of strategies and programs... to reduce access barriers for the management and treatment of tuberculosis.'

**Measles Could Become Endemic in US if Surge Continues, Expert Warns**
Measles cases are surging globally, with North and South America seeing 11 times more cases in 2025 compared to the same period last year. In the U.S., there have been 935 confirmed cases as of May 2, 2025, with 702 of those cases coming from an outbreak in Texas. The World Health Organization has declared both North and South America to be at high risk for measles. According to a 2025 study, if vaccination rates remain the same, measles could become endemic again in the U.S. and the country could experience 850,000 cases over the next 25 years. However, if vaccine rates decrease further, case numbers could increase to 11 million over the next 25 years. Reversing this trend will require steadily increasing community vaccination rates, with a 5% increase in vaccination rates predicted to reduce case numbers to between 3,000 and 19,000 over the next 25 years. Rebecca Schein, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases, said, 'It was a huge surge compared with the 285 cases reported in 2024.'

**Mpox still a health emergency, says WHO**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that the mpox outbreak is still a public health emergency, citing the continued rise in cases and geographic spread of the outbreak. The WHO's decision was based on the ongoing violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has hindered its response plan. According to the WHO, there have been over 21,000 confirmed cases of mpox since the beginning of 2024, with 70 deaths, mainly in Congo. The new form of mpox, clade Ib, predominantly affects the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, and Burundi, with travel-related cases reported in countries including Thailand and Britain. WHO Director-General said, 'The mpox outbreak is still a significant public health concern, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.'

**WHO Confirms mpox Outbreak as Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed that the mpox outbreak continues to meet the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the recommendation from the WHO's mpox committee that the outbreak 'continues to meet the criteria for a PHEIC' is agreed upon. The PHEIC regime, which has been in place since August 14, 2024, will remain in effect. The WHO's mpox committee has recommended that countries enhance epidemiological surveillance, strengthen cross-border collaboration, and provide information to travelers. The committee has also expressed opposition to 'unjustified travel and trade restrictions that disproportionately affect local, regional, or national economies.' Since January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2024, there have been 124,753 confirmed cases of mpox in 128 countries, including 272 deaths. The PHEIC regime was initially implemented from July 2022 to May 11, 2023, but was lifted due to declining cases. However, on August 14, 2024, the WHO Director-General reactivated the PHEIC regime due to a surge in cases in Africa. From January 1, 2024, to February 2, 2025, there have been 21,113 cases of mpox in African countries, including 70 deaths.

**Mpox Outbreak Still a Public Health Emergency, Says WHO**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the mpox outbreak is still a public health emergency of international concern. The decision was based on the continuous increase in the number of cases and the geographical spread of the outbreak. The WHO also cited violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo as a factor that complicated its response plan. The new form of mpox, clade Ib, continues to predominantly affect the Democratic Republic of Congo, but Uganda and Burundi have also been significantly affected. According to a recent WHO report, cases related to travel have been reported in countries such as Thailand and the United Kingdom. Globally, there have been over 21,000 confirmed cases since the beginning of 2024, including 70 deaths, mainly in the Congo. In 2024, there were also over 50,000 suspected cases and over 1,000 deaths. The confirmation of cases has been a challenge in areas with limited capacity. 'The mpox outbreak is still a public health emergency of international concern,' said the WHO. 'It is a viral infection that spreads through close contact and usually causes symptoms similar to the flu and pus-filled lesions. It is generally mild, but can be fatal.'

**WHO Maintains International Health Emergency for Mpox Outbreak**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that it will maintain the international health emergency due to the mpox (monkeypox) outbreak, despite the increase in cases and areas affected, including conflict zones such as the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the decision was made after the emergency committee reviewed the situation and recommended taking this measure. The committee also reviewed temporary recommendations to address the outbreak, including establishing national and local emergency centers, intensifying case and contact tracing, and developing vaccination plans, without proposing travel restrictions for now. The emergency was declared on August 14, 2024, due to the increase in cases, especially in the DRC, where some areas with outbreaks are difficult to access due to conflict in provinces such as North Kivu and South Kivu. The current alert by the international health agency responds to the rapid expansion in Africa of a new variant (clade Ib) of the virus, different from the one that caused the outbreak in 2022 in Africa and thousands of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions. According to WHO statistics, more than 2,100 confirmed cases of this Ib variant have been detected in the DRC so far this year (compared to 13,000 last year), 1,500 in Uganda, 500 in Burundi, 20 in Rwanda, and 9 in Kenya. Only 11 of these cases have been fatal, all of them in Uganda, while last year 55 deaths were reported in affected African countries.

**Mpox Outbreak in Africa Remains International Health Emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has maintained its highest alert level for the Mpox outbreak in Africa, citing the spread of a new virus variant, Klade Ib. The WHO had declared a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' (PHEIC) in August 2024, but the situation has not improved, with case numbers rising and the virus spreading. The outbreak is being hindered by new conflicts in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Klade Ib variant has been spreading since 2024. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) assesses the risk of the Ib variant spreading to Europe as low, with some isolated cases reported in Germany. According to the WHO, over 15,400 cases of Klade Ib have been reported in the Congo since January 2024, with around 3,500 cases in Burundi and 3,000 in Uganda. A new variant, Ia APOBEC3, has been discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is believed to be more contagious than the original Ia variant. 'The situation has not improved, and the virus is spreading,' said the WHO. 'We need more funding and better surveillance to combat this outbreak.'

**WHO decides mpox epidemic still global health emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global health emergency for the second time, citing a rise in cases and geographic spread of the disease. The decision was made after the emergency committee on mpox advised WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus that the situation still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). According to the WHO, the mpox upsurge continues to meet the criteria of a PHEIC, with cases rising and its geographic spread widening. The WHO had previously declared a global health emergency in July 2022, but lifted the declaration in May 2023 due to vaccination and awareness drives that helped stem the spread. However, a new two-pronged epidemic broke out in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) last August, prompting the WHO's new emergency declaration. To date, community spread of the clade 1b strain has been confirmed in the DRC and five other African nations, and it has been detected in another 15 countries around the world in connection with travel. The DRC has confirmed more than 13,000 mpox cases and 43 deaths in 2024, and over 2,000 cases in the first five weeks of this year, more than half of the cases confirmed globally. 'The mpox upsurge continues to meet the criteria of a public health emergency of international concern,' said a WHO statement. 'The decision was based on the continuing rise in numbers and geographic spread, the violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo -- which hampers the response -- as well as a lack of funding to implement the response plan,' added the statement.

**UNICEF Uganda Humanitarian Situation Report No. 4 (Mpox Level 3): 01 to 31 December 2024 - Uganda**
The mpox outbreak in Uganda has seen a significant rise since the first case was confirmed, with 1,353 confirmed cases reported across 66 districts as of 31 December 2024. The outbreak has disproportionately impacted specific occupational groups and vulnerable populations, with roadside vendors, shop attendants, and salon workers accounting for 69 reported cases. Sex workers, with 39 reported cases, represented one of the most vulnerable groups, with 30.8 percent attributing their exposure to sexual contact. The data highlights the need for targeted public health interventions, community engagement, and tailored messaging to reduce exposure risks within these groups. Additionally, the age group 10-18 years was the most affected, accounting for 54.9% of the total cases, with a likelihood that mpox infection among students will increase resulting in a high risk of school transmission when schools officially re-open on February 3rd, 2025.

**Mpox Outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: 20 Deaths in the First Week of 2025**
According to the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Ministry of Health, 66,063 suspected mpox cases were reported in 2024, with 14,417 confirmed cases and 1,366 deaths. In the first week of 2025, 2,318 suspected cases were detected, and 20 people died due to the mpox virus. The ministry emphasized that the mortality rate of the disease is 2.07%. The mpox virus is transmitted through contact with infected individuals or animals, such as rodents and squirrels. The main modes of transmission include touching the rash, using clothing or other items contaminated with the virus, and coming into contact with bodily fluids. Symptoms typically appear within 5-21 days after infection and include high fever, headache, back and muscle pain, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, chills, and skin lesions resembling chickenpox. 'The virus causes significant discomfort and can lead to serious complications,' said the Ministry of Health. 'It is essential to take precautions and seek medical attention if symptoms persist or worsen over time.'

**Multi-country outbreak of mpox, External situation report #38 – 28 September 2024 - NetNewsLedger**
The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and colleagues have arrived in Beijing to understand the latest developments and strengthen partnership, particularly for response against the respiratory disease. According to the WHO situation report, there have been 2,798 confirmed cases of the disease globally, with 80 deaths reported. The WHO is working with countries to activate their response systems and has recommended basic principles such as avoiding close contact with those suffering from acute respiratory infections, frequent handwashing, and enhanced infection prevention practices in healthcare facilities. Meanwhile, the WHO has published the 38th situation report for the multi-country outbreak of mpox, which provides an update on the mpox epidemiological situation in Africa as of 22 September 2024. The report highlights a total of 6,603 confirmed mpox cases, including 32 deaths, reported across 15 African countries in 2024. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing testing challenges and delays in case confirmation, while Burundi has reported 35 of 49 (71%) districts affected, with children under 5 years of age comprising about 30% of confirmed cases. 'Understanding the time when infected patients may transmit the virus to others is critical for control efforts,' the agency report said.
