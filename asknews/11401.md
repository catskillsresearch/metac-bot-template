**Taiwanese Progressive Party Chairman Warns of 'Ostrich-Like' Mentality Amid China's Military Threats**
Taiwanese Progressive Party Chairman Wang Hsing-huan warned that Taiwan cannot afford to be in a ' ostrich-like' mentality, ignoring the possibility of war. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently stated that China's military action against Taiwan 'may be imminent' and urged allies in the Indo-Pacific region to increase their defense budgets to deter China. Wang pointed out that various US think tanks, frontline Indo-Pacific commanders, and naval combat forces have warned that China will launch an invasion of Taiwan in 2027. China has also set a goal of 'winning a local war' by 2027. Wang emphasized that China's ideal script for invading Taiwan is to 'encircle and blockade' the island, creating pressure on Taiwanese society through localized military actions, and then using pro-China parties in Taiwan to advocate for 'peace talks' and shape international opinion to accept unification. He stated, 'Those who advocate for peace talks are Taiwan's enemies.' To counter China's military threats, Wang suggested that Taiwan must strengthen its military deterrent, solidify its alliances with Indo-Pacific nations, and cultivate an 'unyielding resistance spirit' to prevent China from launching an invasion. 'If China expects a blockade to lead to a long-term war and international sanctions, it will be hesitant to launch an invasion,' Wang said.

**The Realities of an Invasion of Taiwan • Stimson Center**
The narrative of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan has been a driving force behind increased defense spending in the US, but a closer examination by the Stimson Center reveals that this scenario is unlikely. China has built a largely defensive military force, and there is little evidence of military adventurism. The hypothetical war to defend Taiwan justifies massive spending on the US military, including a new navy, air forces, and nuclear triad modernization. However, the Stimson Center's research shows that an amphibious invasion of Taiwan would be the largest and most complex military operation in history, fraught with dangers for China, including nuclear escalation, political upheaval, economic consequences, and a military quagmire. The low probability of success makes an invasion of Taiwan extremely unlikely, and American defense policymakers should choose a different scenario for future military plans, according to the Stimson Center's National Security Reform Program and Defense Strategy and Planning team.

**China rejects US defence chief's warnings on Taiwan invasion threat**
China has rejected US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's warnings about the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, calling them 'groundless accusations'. Hegseth had warned that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan 'would result in devastating consequences'. China's National Defence University vice president, Hu Gangfeng, said the accusations were 'nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region'. Australia's Defence Minister, Richard Marles, pointed out that China's largest conventional military build-up since World War II is happening without strategic reassurance and without a clear strategic intent. Australia is increasing its defence spending, aiming to reach 2.33 per cent of GDP by 2033-34, and is on track to receive eight new nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS agreement.

**China Warns US Not to 'Play with Fire' Over Taiwan**
China warned the US not to 'play with fire' regarding Taiwan, in response to comments from US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who accused Beijing of preparing an 'imminent' invasion of the island and attempting to alter the regional balance in Asia. 'The Taiwan issue is purely internal to China. No foreign country has the right to interfere,' said the spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry in a statement issued after midnight. Beijing expressed its 'firm opposition' and 'deep discontent' with what it considered a 'provocative and inciting' speech by Hegseth, who on Saturday, during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, warned that the Chinese army 'practices daily' a possible invasion of Taiwan and alluded to the supposed intention to do so before 2027. 'Let me be clear: any attempt by the Communist Party (Chinese) to conquer Taiwan by force will result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world (...) The Chinese threat is real. And it could be imminent,' emphasized the Pentagon chief. China has warned the US not to use the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China, and has presented a formal protest to Washington. Beijing has also accused the US of fomenting confrontation between blocs, deploying offensive weapons in the South China Sea, and 'turning the region into a powder keg.' The spokesperson stated that there are no problems with freedom of navigation in the waters, where tensions exist with neighboring countries such as the Philippines, Malaysia, or Vietnam, and that China 'manages its differences through dialogue and in accordance with the law.' In his Saturday speech, Hegseth had warned that China seeks to 'dominate and control' Asia, and assured that Washington will not allow Beijing to modify the status quo by force.

**China 'rehearsing' invasion of Taiwan, warns US**
US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth warned that China is 'rehearsing for the real deal' and building capabilities to invade Taiwan, according to a report by the Eurasian Times. Hegseth stated that the Chinese military is preparing to use force to alter the regional balance of power, with Taiwan at the center of its ambitions. The US has vowed to deter aggression by communist China and will continue to maintain a presence in the Indo-Pacific region. Hegseth accused China of endangering lives through cyberattacks, harassing neighboring countries, and illegally militarising disputed territories in the South China Sea. China has vowed to merge Taiwan with the mainland, by force if necessary, and has intensified large-scale military drills around the island. The US has launched a trade war with China, restricted Beijing's access to key artificial intelligence technologies, and bolstered military cooperation with allies like the Philippines.

**US Defense Secretary Announces China's Planned Invasion of Taiwan**
US Defense Secretary Pita Hegset announced that China will invade Taiwan within two years. He stated, 'The Chinese People's Liberation Army has been instructed to reach the capacity to invade Taiwan by 2027. They are building the necessary military power, training every day, and conducting realistic exercises.' Hegset warned that any Chinese annexation attempt could have devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific region and the world. 'The threat posed by China is real and could become a reality very soon. We hope it doesn't, but it certainly could.' he said. Chinese Military Academy Vice President Hu Gangfeng responded to Hegset's allegations, saying, 'We do not accept any baseless accusations against China. These accusations are fabrications, distorted facts, and claims made by those who are directly responsible for the crime.' Hegset made these comments in Singapore, where he met with US military personnel and participated in a training session.

**US Warns of Devastating Consequences if China Attempts to Conquer Taiwan**
US Defense Secretary Hegseth warned that there would be 'devastating consequences' for the region and the world if China were to attempt to 'conquer' Taiwan. He stated this at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a prestigious security forum in Asia. Hegseth also mentioned that it is public knowledge that Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered his military to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027. However, he added that President Donald Trump has also stated that China will not invade Taiwan under his supervision. Hegseth's goal is to prevent war, make its costs too high, and make peace the only option.

**US Warns Allies of China's Growing Threat: 'Invading Taiwan in 2027'**
US Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, has warned allies not to 'look away' from the 'imminent risk' posed by China, which is investing in high-level nuclear arms and armament technology to 'invade Taiwan in 2027'. Hegseth has reiterated that China's attempts to conquer Taiwan 'by force' would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. China has warned the US that military aid to Taiwan increases the 'risk of conflict'. Hegseth has called for increased defense spending 'to prevent war, make the cost too high, and peace the only option'. Analysts interpret this as a signal from Washington to increase arms sales in Asia. Hegseth has also highlighted the 'risk' of economic dependence on China, which 'deepens its malign influence' globally. This comes as tensions rise, with China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, not attending the Singapore meeting, and instead sending a delegation from the National Defense University.

**US Think Tank Warns of Nuclear War if China Invades Taiwan in 2030**
A recent report by the Atlantic Council, a US think tank, has warned that if China were to invade Taiwan in 2030, the Korean Peninsula could become a second battlefield, and a nuclear war may be unavoidable. The report, titled 'Guardian Tiger II', simulated a hypothetical scenario in which China launches a large-scale conventional war against Taiwan, leading to a US-China confrontation. According to the report, North Korea would play a significant role in this conflict, with China and North Korea sharing intelligence and North Korea launching short-range ballistic missiles at US military bases in South Korea. The report warns that the conflict could escalate into a nuclear war, with China using nuclear weapons to cut off Taiwan's external aid and then invoking a military alliance treaty with North Korea to justify its intervention in the Korean Peninsula. The report also suggests that the US may struggle to make a quick decision on whether to use nuclear force in response to North Korea's provocations, given the complexity of the situation. Experts are calling for the US to reorganize its command and control systems in the Indo-Pacific region and to engage in regular trilateral security talks with South Korea and Japan to address the synchronized threats from China and North Korea.

**China May Attempt to Invade Taiwan Within 6 Months: US Media Report**
According to a report by 1945, a US media outlet, China may attempt to invade Taiwan within the next 6 months. Retired US Army Captain Chuck DeVore analyzed that China's invasion of Taiwan may have three scenarios: gradual blockade, lightning strike, and all-out war. DeVore explained that the first scenario is that China's navy will 'like a steel rope' completely block Taiwan. Since 90% of Taiwan's food and all natural gas are transported by ship, if this lifeline is cut off, Taiwan will face months of food shortages. The second scenario is that China will launch a large-scale missile attack to destroy Taiwan's defense systems and overload its Patriot and other missile defense systems. Beijing's 'patriotic hackers' will destroy Taiwan's power grid and close its internet and phone networks. Meanwhile, 100,000 Chinese troops will land on Taiwan's beaches. DeVore said that considering Taiwan's 12-hour time difference with Washington, all of this will happen 'before the US wakes up.' Therefore, China's goal is 'to capture Taipei in a few days and show the world a fait accompli.' The third scenario is considered the end of the world, DeVore said that China will first try to invade Taiwan, then destroy the US and its allies' defense capabilities. Missile attacks will not only destroy Taiwan's military bases, but also destroy all US bases in Japan, Guam, and the Philippines. When Asia is in chaos, Beijing's over 2 million eligible men will sneak into the US under the Biden administration's open border agreement and start a joint attack with Mexican drug cartels. DeVore believes that for China, launching a war of unlimited scope will divert US attention, giving China time to invade Taiwan and test the determination of the alliance. However, this is a high-risk gamble, especially if it is discovered before it is launched. The US may also use the exposure of the event to spark a global backlash, strengthen its global leadership, and punish China economically.

**China's Possible Invasion of Taiwan in 6 Months: A Three-Scenario Analysis**
A US media report suggests that China may attempt to invade Taiwan within the next 6 months. Retired US Army Captain Chuck DeVore analyzed that China's invasion of Taiwan may have three possible scenarios: gradual blockade, lightning strike, and all-out war. According to the report, China's ambassador made a vague threat, saying that China is prepared for any type of war with the US. Intelligence sources believe that China may attempt to invade Taiwan within 6 months, as China's leaders believe that the current US government may not or cannot stop China's invasion. DeVore explained that the first scenario is a gradual blockade, where China's navy will 'like a rope', completely block Taiwan. The second scenario is a large-scale missile attack, destroying Taiwan's defense system and making its Patriot and other missile defense systems overload. Beijing's 'patriotic hackers' will also destroy Taiwan's power grid and shut down the internet and phone networks. Meanwhile, 10,000 Chinese troops will land on Taiwan's beaches. DeVore said that considering Taiwan's 12-hour time difference with Washington, all of this will happen 'before the US wakes up'. Therefore, China's goal is to 'seize Taipei in a few days and show the world a fait accompli'. The third scenario is considered to be the end of the world, DeVore said that China will first try to invade Taiwan, then destroy the US and its allies' defense capabilities. Missile attacks will not only destroy Taiwan's military bases, but also destroy all US bases in Japan, Guam, and the Philippines. When Asia is in chaos, Beijing's over 2 million eligible men will sneak into the US according to President Biden's open border agreement and start a joint attack with Mexican drug cartels. DeVore believes that for China, launching a war of unlimited scope disperses US attention, gives China time to invade Taiwan, and tests the will of the alliance. However, this is a high-risk gamble, especially if it is discovered before the attack. The US may also use the exposure of the event to spark a global backlash, strengthen its global leadership, and economically punish China.

**Trump v Xi trade war makes world a scarier place – China could launch full scale invasion of Taiwan**
President Trump's trade war with China has raised the stakes, making Taiwan's future more uncertain than ever. Chinese President Xi Jinping may launch a full-scale invasion of Taiwan, taking advantage of the global economic chaos. Trump has made it clear to China that if he reaches a grand bargain with Beijing, he would stand aside and let them absorb Taiwan. This has led to a message from China to Taiwan: 'You can't trust America. Make a peaceful deal with us while you still can.' The US influence in the region is draining away, and Xi may feel that 2025 is his moment to take Taiwan. A conflict would be a huge gamble for China, but they may see it as a once-in-a-generation opportunity if they believe Trump does not care about Taiwan.

**Taiwan's war game to prepare for ‘worst case scenario’ amid invasion fears**
Taiwan has launched 14 days of war games to prepare for the 'worst case scenario' of a Chinese invasion. The war games, part of the annual Han Kuang series, will simulate a full-scale assault on the island and 'grey zone' activities, which are aggressive attacks just short of a full-scale invasion. Taiwan's Minister of National Defense Wellington Koo said the exercises are based on a hypothetical invasion by China in 2027. Institute for National Defense Security Research expert Su Tzu-yun said the purpose of the drills is to assess any shortcomings in Taiwan's readiness for war. The war games come amid fears that China will invade the island as it assembles vast numbers of warships, jets, and barges. China has also been conducting its own military drills, including satellite pictures showing the country's giant D-Day style invasion barges moored off the coast. 'When China is conducting naval and air patrols around Taiwan it normally deploys around six to ten warships,' said Tzu-yun. 'And if each of these were equipped with vertical launching systems, there could be about 500 land-attack cruise missiles ready to strike targets across Taiwan in just three minutes.' The war games will also feature new weapons acquired by Taiwan, including M1A2T tanks, HIMARS rocket systems, and land-based anti-ship missile systems. Taiwan's Minister of National Defense Wellington Koo said, 'This year’s exercises are based on a hypothetical invasion by China in 2027.' Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Wang Ting-yu said that the public used to think that a strike by China would likely come in the form of a missile attack, but now it seems more likely to involve maritime militia vessels, sand dredgers, and drones. Tzu-yun warned that this kind of attack could be even more deadly. 'Taiwan has previously accused China of using generative AI to ramp up disinformation against Taiwan,' said the article. 'The island believes the Chinese leader is using the technology to 'divide' its population.' Beijing has already shown signs of preparations for a potential war, including intensive work in Chinese shipyards suggesting a massive amphibious assault. 'China is already engaged in what experts call a 'war of words' against Taiwan,' said the article. 'Read More on The US Sun'

**China's Taiwan Invasion: A Catastrophic Outcome?**
Dmitry Alperovich, author of the book 'World on the Brink: How America Can Win the 21st-Century Competition with China', believes that China's recent military exercises near Taiwan are a warning to the island and a demonstration of Beijing's resolve to prevent Taiwan's independence. Alperovich predicts that China will launch a full-scale invasion of Taiwan between 2028 and 2032, which would be the most complex military operation in human history. He notes that the US has a secret document that identifies China as the main threat to the country and recommends increasing pressure on Taiwan to increase its defense spending. Alperovich also believes that the US will eventually have to intervene in a conflict between China and Taiwan, which could lead to a catastrophic outcome, including the loss of tens of thousands of American soldiers and the risk of nuclear escalation. He also thinks that Russia will not directly intervene in the conflict, but will act as an opportunist, taking advantage of the situation to further its own interests. Alperovich concludes that Taiwan has the potential to defend itself against a Chinese invasion, but its military is not yet prepared for such a scenario.

**Taiwan's military exercises to focus on invasion preparation**
Taiwan's military is conducting exercises focused on preparing for a potential invasion by China in 2027, a deadline previously mentioned by security experts and military officials. Former US Navy admiral Philip Davidson warned that China could attempt to invade Taiwan by 2027, while Chinese President Xi Jinping has reportedly instructed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to be prepared for an invasion by then. However, Su Tzu-yun, a fellow at the Institute for National Defence and Security Research, noted that there is no clear indication a formal decision has been made to resort to force by then. Security analysts worldwide have urged their governments to prepare for a possible conflict, and the Han Kuang exercises' focus on 2027 is a logical response to these concerns, according to Su. 'It could create a perfect storm,' he said, 'if Xi seeks a fourth term, he may take military risks to justify his leadership.' The defence ministry's 'immediate response drills' were specifically designed to deter China from 'turning exercises into war,' Su added. 'The principle of risk control was followed,' he said. 'It is normal to use timelines as a reference for defence strategy,' Su noted. 'The US military must be prepared for contingencies before then,' said former US Indo-Pacific commander John Aquilino. 'China is accelerating its military expansion, particularly in dual-use shipyards and nuclear weapons launch platforms,' said US Air Force Strategic Commander General Anthony Cotton. 'These developments align with preparations to have the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027,' he added. 'The US should expedite its own military production in response,' Cotton said. 'It is a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and his ambition,' said former CIA director William Burns, describing Xi's directive to the PLA. 'China is accelerating its military expansion,' Burns added. 'It will continue efforts to weaken US influence in the Indo-Pacific,' said Davidson. 'Whether or not China launches an invasion in 2027, it will continue efforts to weaken US influence in the Indo-Pacific,' he added. 'Alternative deadlines have been proposed, including 2035 and 2049, both of which mark major PLA anniversaries,' Su noted. 'However, if Xi seeks a fourth term, he may take military risks to justify his leadership,' he warned.

**Taiwan's Defense Ministry Predicts Chinese Invasion in 2027**
Taiwan's Ministry of Defense has publicly stated that a Chinese invasion of the island is likely to occur in 2027. The ministry released a document outlining future military exercises, which simulate a Chinese attack, and included the date as a reference point. According to the ministry, the 'Han Kuang' exercises always set a timeframe of one to two years in the future to allow for the acquisition and training of new equipment. However, it is unclear how the inclusion of 2027 will affect the exercise program, or if the date is more of a political signal. China's President Xi Jinping has set a goal for the People's Liberation Army to become a 'modern force' by 2027 and a 'world-class force' by 2047. US officials stated last year that China is preparing to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, citing China's increase in fighter jets, warships, and doubling its stockpile of ballistic and cruise missiles since 2020.

**2027: A High-Risk Period for a Chinese Attack on Taiwan**
Experts warn that 2027 is a high-risk period for a Chinese attack on Taiwan, citing three reasons. Firstly, China's economic and military power is declining due to Western economic and technological encirclement. Secondly, China wants to take advantage of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Middle East wars to divert attention and resources away from Taiwan. Thirdly, Chinese President Xi Jinping wants to use a successful attack on Taiwan to gain legitimacy for his fourth term. According to former Taiwanese Defense University professor Yuzhongji, China has been increasing its military activities around Taiwan, including the deployment of 7 warships in the Taiwan Strait, and has been conducting joint military exercises with Russia and other countries. Yuzhongji also notes that China has been trying to use 'by-play-to-war' tactics, where it conducts military exercises and then suddenly launches a surprise attack. He warns that if China were to launch a large-scale military attack on Taiwan, it would be difficult for the US and other countries to respond in time. The US has also warned that China may attack Taiwan in 2027, citing the country's increasing military activities and its desire to take advantage of the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Taiwan's defense minister has also warned that China has the capability to blockade Taiwan, but not necessarily to successfully invade the island. Taiwan is preparing for a potential blockade by China, including stockpiling essential supplies and developing a 'hedgehog defense' strategy to counter China's military actions.
