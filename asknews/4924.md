**Chinese Same-Sex Couple Marries in Thailand Amidst Growing Acceptance**
With the legalization of same-sex marriage in Thailand taking effect in January 2025, a Chinese same-sex couple, Wang Zengyi and Owen Zhu, have tied the knot in a ceremony in Bangkok. Wang said, 'Thailand is a more free and inclusive country for people like us.' Although China legalized same-sex relationships in 1997, same-sex marriage is still not recognized, and the couple faced difficulties in obtaining the necessary documents and dealing with social prejudices. Zhu said, 'The biggest challenge for us is to get the single status certificate required by the Thai authorities, which is difficult for us as Chinese same-sex couples.' Despite these challenges, the couple is excited about their new life together and hopes that their marriage will pave the way for others to follow their dreams. They plan to return to China after their honeymoon but expressed their desire to eventually retire in Thailand.

Owen Zhu, a real estate agent in Thailand, said, 'The biggest challenge for same-sex couples like us is obtaining the required single status certificates and dealing with social prejudices.' Despite the difficulties, the couple was excited to sign their marriage certificate in Bangkok and hopes that their marriage will pave the way for others to achieve their dreams.

**Pope Leo XIV: Marriage is 'True Love Between a Man and a Woman'**
Pope Leo XIV stated in his Sunday mass for the Jubilee of Families that marriage represents 'true love between a man and a woman.' He emphasized that marriage is not an ideal, but a rule of total, faithful, and fruitful love. The pontiff also cited the example of canonized couples, such as Louis and Zelia Martin, the parents of Saint Therese of the Child Jesus, as a sign that 'the world needs the conjugal alliance to know and welcome the love of God and overcome the forces that disintegrate society.' He encouraged families to be examples of coherence for their children and to educate them in freedom through obedience. Leo XIV had previously defended marriage between a man and a woman as 'the foundation of a harmonious and peaceful society' in May, a statement seen as a nod to the conservative wing of the Church. However, Pope Francis had also promoted openness to people of other sexual orientations and authorized blessings for same-sex couples.

**On "the Recalled Experience Of Death"**
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has released new resources to help members understand and answer questions on various topics. Meanwhile, the author reflects on the concept of 'near-death experiences' and the term 'recalled experience of death' proposed by Dr. Sam Parnia. Dr. Parnia, an associate professor of medicine, describes the experience as a separation of consciousness and selfhood combined with a vast expansion of consciousness, which is felt as a release and liberation from the body. The author shares a list of 'fifteen distinct components' that are characteristic of the 'out of body' portion of a 'recalled experience of death' as described by Dr. Parnia. The author also notes the distinction between the subjective experience of a dying person and the objective observations of those around them, which is the same that yields 'the hard problem of consciousness.'

**Maybe male critics are not experts on religious women's underclothing**
Meagan, a Latter-day Saint convert, writes about the cultural pressures and expectations surrounding women's undergarments in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She argues that relying on critics like John Dehlin, who has a history of criticizing the church, to discuss women's feelings about wearing garments is 'mind-bogglingly weird.' Meagan suggests that women in the church have a range of experiences and perspectives on wearing garments, and that it's not just about 'pioneer women in long dresses' or 'mermaid hair and plunging gowns.' She cites research that shows women in the church report high rates of well-being and satisfaction, and that participation in religious services is associated with numerous aspects of human flourishing. Meagan concludes that women in the church wear garments for sincere and consciously chosen reasons, and that it's not just about resignation or oppression.

**Bishops respond to same-sex wedding ruling | UMNews.org**
United Methodist bishops have released a statement to clarify the implications of a recent decision by the denomination's top court regarding same-sex weddings. The decision, known as Judicial Council Decision 1516, does not require pastors to perform same-sex weddings, but also does not prohibit them from doing so. The bishops emphasized that the decision's application will depend on local context, and that it does not supersede local laws banning same-sex weddings. They also urged pastors in areas where same-sex marriage is legal to consider the views of their congregations. The bishops stated that the decision does not take away the rights of central conferences to set their own policies on marriage and clergy ordination. In areas where same-sex marriage is not recognized, pastors will not be required to perform such weddings. The bishops hope that their statement will ease anxiety and stress the unity of the United Methodist Church, despite its diverse contexts.

**What the LDS Church and others are doing under a new Utah law to protect kids from sexual abuse**
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is rushing to comply with a new Utah law that requires organizations providing services to children under 18 to check the names of their staffers or volunteers against two databases of registered sex offenders. The church's Utah area president has instructed lay bishops and stake presidents to check both the Utah Child Abuse Offender Registry and the National Sex Offender Public Website before allowing any individual 18 or older to hold a calling that places them in regular contact with young people. The church aims to be compliant from Day 1 and has identified specific members who should be scrutinized, including stake presidencies, bishoprics, and teachers. If a member is found on one of the registries, they are not allowed to serve in any position that puts them in contact with anyone under 18. The church's existing protection measures, including abuse prevention training, remain in place.

**Where the LDS Church stands on IVF, surrogacy and sperm/egg donation**
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints supports in vitro fertilization (IVF) and artificial insemination for married couples, but has reservations about sperm and egg donation and surrogacy. According to the church's General Handbook, children conceived through IVF or artificial insemination are 'born in the covenant' if the couple is sealed in a temple. However, the church discourages sperm and egg donation, artificial insemination using donor sperm, and surrogacy. The church's stance on these issues has 'substantially moderated' since the 1960s, with a current posture of 'proceed with caution,' as observed by Oregon State University religion and culture professor Courtney Campbell. Ultimately, the decision to use these fertility technologies is left to the judgment and prayerful consideration of the couple.

**Does this look familiar? It will be Utah's 31st LDS temple.**
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has released an exterior rendering of the planned Lehi Temple, which will be Utah's 31st Latter-day Saint temple. The single-spired, multistory, 85,000-square-foot structure will be built on a nearly 22.5-acre site near Lehi's 3950 North and Center Street. Utah currently has 21 functioning temples, with several more under construction or in planning stages. The Lehi Temple will be similar to many of the faith's modern temples, and will serve as a House of the Lord where faithful members can participate in their religion's highest rituals, including eternal marriage.

**After five years of construction, take a look inside the new Auckland temple of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints**
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has opened its second temple in New Zealand, located in Auckland's Goodwood Heights. The temple, which took five years to build, is the 203rd in the world and 11th in the Pacific region. Elder Steven Bangerter, assistant executive director of the Church's Temple Department, said, 'The temple is to us a centre place of worship and learning of God and his ways upon the Earth. To us it is the most holy and sacred place on Earth.' The temple will be used by up to 100,000 worshippers in Auckland and surrounding regions. Auckland woman Paula Midgley said having a temple in Auckland means her family can schedule events together without traveling to Hamilton. The temple features opulent decorations, including stained glass doors, high ceilings, and creamy marble floors. It will be open to the public for four weeks before closing to only committed members of the church for ordinances such as baptisms and marriages.

**LDS Church changes its polygamy cartoons for children  --  including the message**
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has revised its cartoons and messaging about polygamy for children, after initially publishing an illustrated explanation of the faith's historic practice. The original chapter on plural marriage began with Joseph Smith's reluctance to take additional wives, followed by his 'obedience' to what he said was a 'commandment from the Lord.' The revised site is much shorter and states that 'usually a man should have only one wife. But sometimes the Lord commanded' otherwise. The changes have been praised by some, including Valerie Hudson, a Latter-day Saint scholar, who said the revised subtitle is a 'great step forward' in indicating that polygamy is a 'time-bound Abrahamic sacrifice.' However, others, such as Exponent II blogger Abby Maxwell Hansen, have expressed frustration that the church did not acknowledge making the changes 'because of public outcry,' and argue that the only way to repair the damage is to apologize outright for the behavior of early church leaders.

**If Christianity were 'more Christian,' scholar says, it would be 'good for the church and great for the country'**
Jonathan Rauch, a writer and scholar, argues in his book 'Cross Purposes: Christianity's Broken Bargain With Democracy' that Christianity has given up its role as a 'load-bearing wall' of democracy, leading to the country's current crisis. He points to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as an example of how to heal a polarized nation by working together and finding creative solutions. Rauch praises the church's 'great compromise' on LGBT anti-discrimination, which included carve-outs for religious groups, and its support for the Respect for Marriage Act, which commits Congress to not forcing churches to recognize same-sex marriages. He believes that this approach is in line with the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Founding Fathers, and that it would be 'good for the church and great for the country' if Christianity were 'more Christian.'

**‘The teachings of Jesus Christ are a whole lot closer to the teachings of Madison,’ scholar says, ‘than to the teachings of MAGA.”**
Writer and scholar Jonathan Rauch argues in his book 'Cross Purposes: Christianity's Broken Bargain With Democracy' that Christianity has given up its role as a 'load-bearing wall' of democracy, leading to the country's current crisis. Rauch, a self-described gay, Jewish atheist, critiques secular Americans who think Christianity should be abandoned and Christian Americans who blame secular culture for their grievances. He points to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as an example of how to bring together Christianity and democracy. Rauch believes that the two systems of thought are interdependent and that society and people tend to be healthier when they are aligned. He praises the church's efforts to pursue the path of patience, negotiation, and mutual accommodation in civic life, as exemplified by senior apostle Dallin H. Oaks' speech at the University of Virginia in 2021. Rauch also notes that the church's support for the Respect for Marriage Act, which enshrines same-sex marriage in federal statute, is a landmark moment in civic peacemaking. He argues that the teachings of Jesus Christ are closer to the teachings of James Madison than to those of MAGA, and that being more Christian would be good for the church and the country.

**Liberian Methodists Reject Gay Marriage**
The United Methodist Church in Liberia has rejected the decision by the United Methodist General Conference to lift bans on LGBTQ individuals and redefine marriage as a lifelong covenant between 'two people of faith'. Bishop Samuel J. Quire stated that the Liberian Methodist Church is not a 'gay church' and will not conduct weddings or ordinations of self-avowed, practicing homosexuals. Quire emphasized that the church will adhere to biblical values and doctrines. A gathering of young people within the United Methodist Church in Liberia protested against homosexual practices in the Church, accusing Bishop Quire of supporting same-sex marriage. The protesters claimed that same-sex marriage contradicts the teachings of God and therefore, church members will oppose it. The youth population of the Liberian United Methodists made it clear that they would not accept any form of homosexual relationships. Bishop Emeritus Kula strongly opposed same-sex marriage and led a campaign against it within the African community, emphasizing the preservation of traditional marriage values in the United Methodist Church.
