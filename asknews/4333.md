**Hamburg Submits Bid to Host 2036, 2040, or 2044 Summer Olympics**
Hamburg has submitted its bid to host the 2036, 2040, or 2044 Summer Olympics. The city's First Mayor, Peter Tschentscher, stated, 'Hamburg is Germany's gateway to the world.' He emphasized the city's experience in hosting international sports events. Hamburg will hold a referendum on the hosting of the Olympics and is confident that it will 'set a great sign of diversity and openness, for peace, democracy, and freedom.' The city is supported by Schleswig-Holstein and has submitted its bid to the German Olympic Sports Confederation (DOSB). Hamburg's concept includes short distances, a modern multi-purpose arena, and unique hospitality. Sports Senator Andy Grote said, 'We invest in an unforgettable Olympic festival that brings together athletes and guests from around the world in a fascinating city and directly addresses the goals of the Olympic Movement.' The city plans to build a new Olympic stadium that can accommodate up to 60,000 spectators during the games and will be used by the Hamburger SV after the games. Hamburg aims for a 'compact and concentrated organization' of the games, with 82% of the venues located within a 7-kilometer radius.

**Current State of the Dollar: A Look at the Latest Developments**
The US dollar/TL closed at 39.2100 on Friday, up 0.3% from the previous day's close. Today, the dollar/TL is trading at 39.2040, a flat trend. The euro/TL is up 0.7% at 44.7880, while the sterling/TL is up 0.5% at 53.1610. The US dollar index is down 0.4% at 98.9. The increasing risk perception due to the possible talks between the US and China, following the countries' accusatory statements, is making it difficult for asset pricing. US President Donald Trump's protectionist trade measures continue to be the main source of uncertainty for the global economy, while questions remain about the inflationary effects of tariffs. Today, investors will focus on the statements made by Jerome Powell, the President of the Federal Reserve, which will provide clues about the Bank's future policies. Meanwhile, concerns about the US economy's financial situation persist, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying that the country will never default. Bessent's statements may have alleviated some of the growing concerns, but they are also causing investors to be cautious. Today, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data from the Eurozone and the US, as well as Powell's statements, will be closely followed.

**US Dollar/TL Trades Flat at 39.2040 Amid Powell's Announcement**
The US dollar/TL is trading at 39.2040, maintaining a flat trend since the start of the week. The dollar/TL, which rose on Friday, is currently being watched by investors for the announcement of US Federal Reserve Chairman Powell. The dollar/TL has been trading at 39.2040 since the start of the week, after starting the week's first trading day flat. On Friday, the dollar/TL showed an upward trend, closing the day 0.3% above its previous close at 39.2100. As of 10:05 am today, the dollar/TL is trading flat at 39.2040. At the same time, the euro/TL is being sold at 44.7880 with a 0.7% increase, and the sterling/TL is being sold at 53.1610 with a 0.5% increase. The dollar index is also trading at 98.9 with a 0.4% decrease. The increasing risk perception due to the possible talks between the US and China, which have become more uncertain after the two countries' mutual accusations, is making it difficult for asset pricing. The uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's protectionist trade measures continues to be the main source of uncertainty for the global economy, while there are still questions about the inflationary effects of tariffs. In this context, the announcement of US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell today will be the focus of investors, who will be looking for clues about the Bank's future policies. Meanwhile, concerns about the US economy's financial situation continue, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying that the country will never default. Bessent's statements may have alleviated some of the growing concerns, but they are still causing investors to be cautious. Today, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data to be announced in the Eurozone and the US, as well as US Federal Reserve Chairman Powell's announcement, will be followed.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**USAID Cuts to Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under five years old. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.' Bill Gates has announced that he will increase his donations to global health programs to $10 billion annually and maintain the investment for 20 years.

**USAID Closure: A Political Decision with Lethal Consequences**
A study by the Global Health Institute of Barcelona (ISGlobal) has found that the decision by the US Administration, led by President Donald Trump, to close the US Agency for International Development (USAID) will result in 14 million deaths between now and 2030. This includes 4 million children under the age of five in poor countries. The USAID, which had a budget of $44 billion in 2024, funded around 43% of global humanitarian aid. The study's findings are 'sencillamente escalofriante' (simply chilling). Trump's decision to dissolve the USAID is a 'decisión política con consecuencias letales' (a political decision with lethal consequences). The USAID was created in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy to promote global economic prosperity, food security, democracy, human rights, public health, and humanitarian assistance. Trump's order to dissolve the USAID is a 'apuesta resuelta por la muerte de millones de personas' (a resolute bet on the death of millions of people). The study also found that the USAID's actions have prevented 91.8 million premature deaths between 2001 and 2021 through its policies against HIV, malaria, and tropical diseases. The world is advancing, but many people still suffer from their needs and are left behind. The situation is 'grave e interpela a otros países' (grave and appeals to other countries), including European countries that are planning to cut their foreign aid budgets.

**The 10 Most Democratic Countries in the World in 2025, According to the Latest International Ranking**
The latest 'Democracy Index' report from The Economist Intelligence Unit reveals that Norway remains the most democratic country in the world, followed by New Zealand and Iceland. However, the report highlights an increase in authoritarian regimes globally, raising serious questions about the future of democracy. The analysis examines the health of 167 democracies, scoring them in five key categories. Although Europe still dominates in terms of democracies, the global index shows a concerning decrease in overall score, reflecting a context of political disaffection that could have long-term repercussions. According to the 'Democracy Index', the most democratic countries in 2025 are: Norway, New Zealand, and Iceland. The report notes that over a third of the world's population lives under authoritarian regimes, with 60 countries classified as 'authoritarian regimes', an increase from previous years. The global score of the index has decreased from 5.23 in 2023 to 5.17 in 2024, reflecting a growing sense of discontent. Civil liberties and electoral processes have been the most affected categories, with significant deterioration since 2008. However, political participation has shown a slight improvement, suggesting that, despite challenges, there is a growing interest in citizen participation. Interestingly, some countries have improved their position in the index. The UK has risen from 18th to 17th place, while Portugal has been upgraded to the category of 'full democracy'. Estonia and the Czech Republic have also achieved this status for the first time in years. In contrast, the US remains in 28th place, classified as a 'defective democracy'. The stability of its checks and balances will be crucial in determining its classification in the future. The 'Democracy Index' of 2025 provides a clear view of the global democratic situation. Despite advances in some countries, the increase in authoritarian regimes and the decline of civil liberties are concerning. The health of global democracy will depend on the ability of countries to address these challenges and promote active and effective political participation.

**Multilateralismo, ¿en agonía?**
The idea that democracies do not go to war with each other, perhaps the only iron law of the discipline, has convinced many that through dialogue and economic interdependence, a stable order could be built. This premise guided a significant part of the foreign policies of the United States and Europe over the past few decades. However, today those foundations are crumbling, and projections for the coming years are even more discouraging. The Global Democracy Index has decreased to a historic low in 2024. Currently, less than 7% of the world's population lives in fully consolidated democracies, while around 40% is under openly authoritarian regimes. The pillars that supported post-Cold War optimism are now cracking. 'The idea that democracies do not go to war with each other is no longer a given,' as the foundations that sustained the optimism after the Cold War are now crumbling.

**South Korea's Democracy in Decline: A Threat to the Country's Future**
South Korea's democracy has been declining, with some even calling it '2 years of authoritarianism'. The country's democracy index has dropped to 41st place globally, with a significant decline in the 'judicial index' which measures the level of public discussion, government respect for opposition, and fact-based debate. The '2025 World Freedom Index' by Freedom House also ranked South Korea 67th, down from 61st last year. The 'Democracy Index 2024' by the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked South Korea 32nd, down from 22nd last year. The country has been reclassified from 'full democracy' to 'flawed democracy'. The main reason for the decline is the government's declaration of a state of emergency, which has weakened institutional democracy. The extreme polarization of civil society and the spread of hatred towards specific groups are also major concerns. 'The role of the 2030 generation, experts, and the media is crucial for social integration,' said Hwang In-jeong, a researcher at the Good Democracy Research Center at Sungkyunkwan University. 'The 2030 generation has a different political orientation than previous generations, with a focus on practical and rational criteria rather than party or ideology.' The researcher emphasized the importance of experts and the media in providing objective information and facilitating public discussion.

**The Democracy Index 2024: A Cry for Alarm**
The Democracy Index 2024 from The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) is a cry for alarm. With a global average score of 5.17 (out of 10), the lowest in years, the message is clear: democracy is in intensive care. In 2024, a year where over half of humanity went to the polls, the result was not a democratic revitalization, but a somber verdict: only 45% of the world lives in some type of democracy, while a chilling 39.2% - over 3.2 billion people - are under the yoke of authoritarian regimes. Confidence is crumbling, governments are fortifying themselves, and citizens, tired of empty promises, are torn between apathy and populism. However, in this landscape of shadows, 25 nations emerge as titans of 'full democracy', a fierce reminder that the ideal is still alive - if we are only willing to fight for it. In the American continent, full democracy is a rare luxury, reserved for three exceptional nations: Canada (8.69, ranked 14th), Uruguay (8.67, ranked 15th), and Costa Rica (8.29, ranked 18th). Canada stands out with a political participation score of 8.89, reflecting a people that does not give up. Uruguay, with a perfect electoral process (10.00), embodies a tradition of inclusion that endures over time. Costa Rica, with civil liberties of 9.71, remains a peaceful oasis in a turbulent region. In contrast, giants like the United States (7.85) languish as 'imperfect democracies', weighed down by distrust and polarization. The rise of figures like Nayib Bukele in El Salvador (4.61) shows how security is negotiated at the cost of freedom. These three full democracies are beacons in a hemisphere where most struggle between hybrid regimes and pure authoritarianism. The Democracy Index 2024 is not a passive diagnosis; it is an ultimatum. Since 2008, civil liberties have fallen a devastating -1.00 and electoral processes a -0.66, while government functioning (4.53 global) has sunk into mediocrity. In 2024, 83 countries worsened, 47 stagnated, and only 37 improved, figures that scream dysfunction. The 25 countries of full democracy are not an elite club; they are a challenge, a mirror that shows us what we could be. For the Dominican Republic, the United States, and the world, the clock is ticking: either we reform our democracies with transparency, inclusion, and real power for the people or we surrender to the 60 authoritarian regimes that already dominate over a third of humanity. This is not an analysis to file away; it is a call to wake up before it is too late.

**Is Latin America Condemned to Lose Its Voice?**
The Democracy Index 2024 by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) is a warning sign. With a global average score of 5.17 (out of 10), the lowest in years, the message is clear: democracy is in intensive care.

However, in this landscape of shadows, 25 nations emerge as titans of 'full democracy', a fierce reminder that the ideal is still alive - if we are only willing to fight for it. These are not just numbers; they are living proof that free elections, effective governments, and guaranteed rights can coexist - but only where there is a will. In the American continent, full democracy is a rare luxury, reserved for three exceptional nations: Canada (8.69, ranked 14th), Uruguay (8.67, ranked 15th), and Costa Rica (8.29, ranked 18th).

This is not an analysis to archive; it is a call to wake up before it is too late. Will Latin America remain trapped between populisms and broken promises? Can the Dominican Republic break free from clientelism and claim its place among full democracies? Or are we all condemned to see how authoritarian silence silences our voices? The future is not yet written, but I firmly believe that we can move towards full democracy.

**Just 6% of the world's population live in a full democracy, new report claims**
A new report by the Economist Intelligence Unit has found that democracy has hit a record low around the world, with a global democracy index score of just 5.17 out of 10. Only 25 countries have been designated as full democracies, out of 167 countries covered in the index. The report warns that the United States remains a 'flawed democracy', with an index score of 7.85 out of 10, and that 2025 may bring changes to the US democracy score with uncertainty around checks and balances. The report's authors also note that political participation has improved between 2008 and 2024, but that electoral processes and pluralism, and civil liberties have both deteriorated in the same time frame. Just 6.6 per cent of the world's population now lives under a full democracy, down from 7.8 per cent in the previous year. 'There is a risk of the president seeking retribution, using the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to go after political enemies, which would also erode checks and balances,' says the report. 'Civil liberties of immigrants, migrants, other minorities and protesters [are] also at risk,' it adds.

**Global Democracy Deteriorates in 2024, According to Economist Intelligence Unit**
According to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), democracy has deteriorated globally in 2024. The EIU's Democracy Index 2024 shows that the average global score has fallen to 5.17, a new historic low. The index assesses 167 countries and territories based on five criteria: electoral process and pluralism, functioning of government, participation, political culture, and civil liberties. The EIU notes that despite being a record year for elections, the electoral process index has decreased by 0.08 points, due to elections that are not always free and fair, and limitations on freedom of speech and association. The functioning of government index has also decreased by 0.13 points, to 4.53 globally. 'This poor performance is the result of fundamental weaknesses that afflict democratic systems, both developed and developing,' the analysts say. 'Immobilism, dysfunction, corruption, insufficient transparency, and lack of accountability have eroded public trust in governments, parties, and politicians.' Only 6.6% of the global population lives in a full democracy, down from 12.5% a decade ago. Almost two-fifths of the world's population (39.2%) live in an authoritarian regime, while the remaining 15% live in hybrid regimes that combine democratic and authoritarian tendencies. The top-ranked country is Norway, followed by New Zealand and Sweden. The United States ranks 28th, while India ranks 41st. The European Union region is the only one to have improved its aggregate score, to 8.38 points.

**EIU's 2024 Democracy Index: trend of global democratic decline and strengthening authoritarianism continues through 2024**
The EIU's 2024 Democracy Index reports a decline in global democratic scores, with a total score of 5.17 (on a 0-10 scale), down from 5.23 in 2023. According to Joan Hoey, Director for the Democracy Index, 'autocracies seem to be gaining strength, while the world's democracies are struggling.' The decline was driven by reversals in every region except Western Europe and North America. The functioning of government and electoral process and pluralism categories registered the biggest declines, with the latter score declining by 0.08 compared to 2023. The report highlights the factors contributing to popular dissatisfaction with democratic systems, including gridlock, dysfunction, corruption, and a lack of accountability.

**South Asia 2040**
South Asia in 2024 saw significant democratic changes, including the ousting of Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh and the election of President Anura Dissanayake in Sri Lanka. However, the region is also facing challenges such as the rise of populist anti-migration climate deniers and the breakdown of the post-World War II global order. The report 'South Asia Democratic Futures' by International IDEA and the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) presents four scenarios for 2040: Decline, Continuation, Disciplined Improvement, and Transformation. The scenarios predict a decline in democracy, business as usual, disciplined improvement, and a transformation into a 'solarpunk' society. The report concludes that the future of South Asia depends on the leaders elected or removed in the coming decade and that policy reforms and action today will determine the region's fate in 2040. 'Fifteen years is not too far away to determine our collective democratic destiny,' as stated in the report.

**Can AI Save Democracy? Linda Zervakis Explores the Future of Politics**
Linda Zervakis explores the question of whether artificial intelligence (AI) will shape our democracy in the future. In her new reportage, she asks 'Can AI save democracy?' and conducts an experiment with AI, wondering if a computer can make future political decisions. Politicians are considering the possibility of AI replacing them, and a survey found that 51% of Europeans would prefer their representatives to be replaced by an AI algorithm. This is because AI, with access to personal data, could potentially better represent citizens' interests than current politicians. Zervakis' AI duplicate, 'KI-Linda,' is a central part of her investigation, which also includes interviews with politicians such as Jens Spahn, Katrin Göring-Eckardt, and Lars Klingbeil. The reportage raises questions about the future of work, with 60% of professions expected to be replaced by AI by 2030, and the potential for AI to take over leadership in politics.
