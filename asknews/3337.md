**Pensioners are smoking weed in huge numbers with one in 17 now blazing dope - Daily Star**
A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that cannabis use among pensioners in the United States has reached a record high, with around 7% of adults aged 65 and over reporting use in the past month. This represents a 45% increase in just two years. The study also found that the profile of cannabis users has changed, with pronounced increases in use among older people who are college-educated, married, female, and have higher incomes. Study senior author Professor Joseph Palamar said, 'Our study shows that cannabis use among older adults continues to increase, although there have been major shifts in use according to demographic and socio-economic factors.' The research team analyzed data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2021 to 2023 and found that current cannabis use among older adults grew to 7% in 2023, up from 4.8% in 2021 and 5.2% in 2022. Prof Han said, 'If we look even further back to 2006 and 2007, less than 1% of older adults used cannabis in the past year. Now, we're seeing that 7% have used it in the past month alone.'

**Frazzled Brits admit 'doom scrolling' on phone is part of their 'self care routine' - Daily Star**
A recent survey of 2,000 UK adults found that despite 97% of people agreeing that taking time out is essential for their wellbeing, many are struggling to prioritize self-care. Two-fifths of Brits consider 'doom scrolling' on social media as a form of self-care, while 14% struggle to remember the last time they did something indulgent just for themselves. The top barriers to self-care include work (25%), lack of time (13%), and looking after kids (13%). Fox's Fabulous Chocolatey is encouraging Brits to put themselves first and ditch the guilt, with the help of Craig Revel Horwood. As Craig said, 'Darling if you're not treating yourself, then what are you doing? Life's far too short not to take time for yourself to indulge and unwind.'

**Brits spending less than ever on 'me time' as two in five admit 'doom scrolling' - The Mirror**
A survey of 2,000 UK adults found that despite 97% of people agreeing that taking time out is essential for their wellbeing, very few are doing so. In fact, half of Brits (47%) are getting less 'me time' than they managed five years ago. Shockingly, two-fifths (38%) of Brits consider doom scrolling as a form of self-care. The main barriers to self-care are work (25%), lack of time (13%), and looking after kids (13%). Fox's Fabulous Chocolatey is encouraging Brits to put themselves first and ditch the guilt, with the help of Craig Revel Horwood. 'Darling if you're not treating yourself, then what are you doing? Life's far too short not to take time for yourself to indulge and unwind,' Craig said. Fox's Fabulous Chocolatey is launching a competition to give one lucky winner £1,000-worth of luxury spa vouchers.

**80% of People with Obesity are Women, Says Nutritionist**
According to Daisy Rivas, a nutritionist at the Teófilo Dávila hospital, there is a high percentage of obesity in the country, with at least 10-13 out of 15 patients she sees per week suffering from obesity, and the majority of them are women. Rivas emphasizes that this problem affects people of all ages, from children to adults and the elderly, with around 80-90% of patients presenting with obesity. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 1 billion people (1 in 8) worldwide suffer from obesity, a figure that was expected to reach 2030 but has already become a reality in 2024. Rivas highlights the importance of education in preventing obesity, suggesting that parents, especially mothers, learn and teach their children how to eat a balanced diet. She also warns against the dangers of processed and ultra-processed foods, as well as fast food, which can lead to weight gain and other health problems. Rivas recommends consulting a nutritionist for a personalized treatment plan, rather than following 'miracle diets' that can cause imbalances and harm. The Ministry of Public Health (MSP) promotes strategic lines of action through public policies and intersectoral interventions to address obesity as a national problem.

**Over 25% of U.S. adults don't have dental insurance**
A recent report by the CareQuest Institute for Oral Health found that over 25% of U.S. adults, approximately 72 million people, do not have dental insurance. The report analyzed data from a nationally representative study of U.S. adults' oral health attitudes and behaviors, conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. The study found that adults ages 18 to 29 and those 60 and older were more likely to lack dental insurance compared to middle-aged adults. Additionally, individuals with lower education and income levels were more likely to be uninsured. However, 12% of adults without current dental insurance reported losing it in the past year, with higher loss rates among younger adults and those with less education. According to the report, about one-third of Medicare and Medicaid recipients lack dental insurance, and over 80% of adults without health insurance also go without dental coverage. Dr. Burroughs stated, 'It’s time for policy solutions that address our nation’s oral health, starting by preserving Medicaid adult dental coverage.'

**Most Americans Experience Chronic Health Issues, Survey Finds**
A recent survey by Talker Research for Doctor's Best found that only 28% of Americans feel completely healthy, with the remaining 72% experiencing physical discomforts such as fatigue, headaches, mood swings, and digestive problems. On average, people feel tired 12.9 days a month, experience mood swings 10.1 days, have stomach problems 9.8 days, and headaches 7.5 days. This means that only 19 out of 30 days of the month do people feel truly healthy. Katie Lucas, marketing director of Doctor's Best, said, 'When the intestine is out of balance, everything else starts to deteriorate: work, sleep, intimacy, and even the joy of living with family.' The survey also found that 48% of respondents reported that their digestive problems make them less willing to have sex. Dr. Ali Rezaie, a gastroenterologist, warned that normalizing chronic symptoms can delay the diagnosis of conditions such as SIBO, irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, and even colon cancer, which has increased among young adults.

**Take a pause from the daily grind**
According to the American Institute of Stress, 80% of adults in the United States experience stress on a regular basis, while the World Health Organization reports that over 75% of adults worldwide experience stress at some point in their lives. To alleviate stress, individuals can consider taking a break from their daily routine by seeking a new job with a better work-life balance, focusing on self-care, making time for hobbies, prioritizing exercise, and utilizing personal and sick time. As the Mayo Clinic notes, exercise can alleviate stress and release endorphins, which can improve mood and reduce anxiety. A 2023 survey by Sorbet found that 62% of American workers did not use all their personal time off, with 5.5% not taking any time off the previous year. In contrast, Europeans take an average of 24 days off per year, compared to the average American's 14 days.

**Despite Misinformation, 50% of Americans Still Find Plant-Based Diets Healthy**
A new survey by Morning Consult and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine found that 50% of Americans believe that plant-based diets are healthy, but lack guidance from healthcare professionals to adopt them. Xavier Toledo, a registered dietitian, stated, 'What's missing is support and guidance from health care professionals.' Only 1% of Americans follow a vegan diet, and 91% of respondents eat meat at least once a week. The survey revealed that when Americans are shown evidence of how plant-based diets can enhance their health, their willingness to try such a diet jumps by 15 percentage points. Dr. Shireen Kassam, a consultant haematologist, noted that nutrition training in most non-nutrition healthcare courses is still lacking, with education on plant-based diets being even less well covered. The poll comes at a time when health is in full focus in the US, thanks in part to the continued post-Covid wave of wellness and nutrition.

**US Survey Reveals Rising Food Prices Complicate Healthy Eating**
A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that 90% of adults in the United States believe that the rising prices of food in supermarkets are making it harder to eat healthily. This is due to the increasing cost of healthy foods in the country. Those with fixed or low incomes are the most affected. 'It's a bigger challenge for low-income adults, but it's not like middle- and high-income Americans are completely exempt,' said Eileen Yam, director of scientific and social research at Pew. This is partly due to the reliance on a Westernized diet that focuses on expensive animal-based foods, such as meat and dairy, said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive medicine. According to the survey, over 1 million Americans die each year from diet-related diseases, such as obesity, cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes, while unhealthy diets and food insecurity cost the US approximately $1.1 trillion in medical expenses. Objective measurements of the quality of the US diet show that the American diet is deficient. More than 50% of adults do not meet the dietary recommendations of the American Heart Association, according to an analysis conducted in April.

**Half of US Adults Acknowledge the Health Benefits of Plant-Based Diets - vegconomist - the vegan business magazine**
A recent survey found that 65% of US adults are willing to try a plant-based diet if shown evidence of its benefits. Young, non-white, college-educated adults from urban areas who earn a higher annual income are most open to making the change. However, only 1 in 5 people recall their doctors discussing the benefits of a plant-based diet. Xavier Toledo, a registered dietitian with PCRM, noted that more needs to be done to translate positive attitudes into meaningful changes, stating, 'What’s missing is support and guidance from health care professionals.' This represents a huge missed opportunity to turn interest into action and reduce the risk of chronic diseases that affect millions.

**America: Obsessed with Image, Drowning in Excess**
The United States is a nation obsessed with image and excess, yet struggling with a health crisis. Nearly 40% of adults are obese, and over 10% battle diabetes. The author argues that honesty is necessary to address this issue, rather than guilt or shame. They propose that real wellness requires commitment, not quick fixes, and that change starts at a personal and cultural level. This includes prioritizing education around nutrition, pushing for better food options, and shifting the traditional American diet towards lean proteins and fruits. The author concludes that America's future depends on recognizing the crisis and committing to real, lasting change.

**Table for one? More people say they eat all their meals alone.**
A new analysis of the 2025 World Happiness Report found that 26% of US adults surveyed said they ate every meal alone the previous day, a 50% increase from 2003. The trend is attributed to the rise in people living alone, irregular work schedules, and remote work. The report found that sharing meals is a stronger predictor of well-being than income or unemployment, and that dining alone has a greater impact on life evaluation than unemployment. The US ranked 24th in the report, its lowest ranking in 13 years, partly due to the rising number of people eating alone. The report also highlighted the US's high and increasing rate of 'deaths of despair' from suicide, alcohol abuse, and drug overdose.

**Access to affordable and healthy eating – a basic need still to secure**
According to Eurostat, 9.5% of the EU population struggled to afford a meal with meat, fish, or a vegetarian equivalent every second day in 2023. Edenred, a leading digital platform for services and payments, has been advocating for access to food for over 50 years. Their FOOD Programme, celebrating its 15th anniversary, promotes healthier eating habits by encouraging balanced diets for lunch. However, budget constraints arise as a significant barrier, with 43% of workers prepared to cut their food budget in times of inflation, and 67% of restaurants finding preparing balanced meals to be more expensive. Edenred's initiatives aim to bridge the gap in access to nutrition, including working with local authorities and schools to promote and support access to food. As food insecurity remains a pressing global challenge, the European Union should keep this issue high on its agenda.

**60% Americans favor defending Taiwan when the time comes: Report - The Taiwan Times**
A recent survey titled 'Order and Disorder' found that 60% of Americans support the US defending Taiwan against a possible Chinese invasion. The survey, conducted by YouGov from August 28 to September 6, gathered responses from 1,000 adult US citizens. According to the results, 18% strongly supported intervention, 42% somewhat supported intervention, 27% were somewhat opposed, and 13% were strongly opposed. Republicans were more likely to support taking military action than Democrats or Independents. The survey's findings suggest that the US may be willing to commit troops to defend Taiwan, which could potentially lead to a global conflict, including the possibility of World War III.
