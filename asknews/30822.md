**Judge Suspends Trump's Order to Eliminate US Department of Education**
A federal judge in Boston, Myong Joun, has suspended a presidential order by Donald Trump to eliminate the US Department of Education. The decision was expected by the US right-wing, but required Congressional approval. At least 20 states and teacher unions challenged the decision in court, arguing that the government is violating the principle of separation of powers by interfering with Congressional prerogatives. The judge agreed with them, suspending the presidential decree and ordering the reinstatement of hundreds of employees who had been fired. According to the judge, 'We cannot ask this court to turn a blind eye while employees continue to be fired and their units are transferred, effectively turning the Department into an empty shell.'

**Federal Judge Suspends Trump's Decree to Eliminate US Department of Education**
A federal judge in Boston has suspended a decree by former President Donald Trump to eliminate the US Department of Education, as well as a decision to lay off hundreds of its employees. The decision was expected by the US right-wing, but required Congressional approval. At least 20 states and teacher unions challenged the decisions in court, arguing that the government is violating the principle of separation of powers by interfering with Congressional prerogatives. Judge Myong Joun agreed, suspending the presidential decree and ordering the reinstatement of hundreds of employees who had been fired. 'The impact of this dismantling is not comparable to that of a country where education is centralized and managed at the national level,' the judge wrote in his decision. 'In the United States, this responsibility falls on local authorities.' The Department of Education plays a crucial role, particularly in distributing federal subsidies to schools in low-income areas that rely on social and economic programs. The department cannot be dismantled without the adoption of a law that would require 60 votes in the Senate, where Republicans currently hold 53 seats.

**Linda McMahon challenged by Democrats over US Education Department cuts**
US Education Secretary Linda McMahon faced challenges from Democratic lawmakers over a proposed budget cut of more than 15% to the Department of Education. McMahon stated that the goal is to 'make education better, fairer and more accountable by ending federal overreach and empowering families, schools and states who best know the needs of their students.' However, Rep. Rosa DeLauro argued that the budget 'leaves every child behind' and that McMahon and President Trump are 'explicitly' seeking to eliminate the Department of Education. McMahon pledged to abide by the law, but Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman expressed skepticism, stating that the administration 'doesn't care anything about the law and operates outside it.'

**Education Secretary Linda McMahon vows to abide by the law in push to dismantle department**
Education Secretary Linda McMahon testified before a House Appropriations subcommittee, stating that the proposed 2026 budget, which would eliminate the Department of Education, would spark innovation and better outcomes in the classroom. The budget would reduce the department's funding by 15% or $12 billion, replacing funding for 18 K-12 programs with a block grant. Critics argue that this amounts to a $4.5 billion cut to those programs. McMahon said the proposal includes 'smart spending that will help improve student achievement, not serve bureaucratic interests.' Republicans have largely applauded the administration's effort, while Democrats have expressed concerns about the administration's 'unlawful' withholding of education funds and the potential impact on students. 'Our goal is clear: make education better, fairer, and more accountable by ending federal overreach and empowering families, schools, and states who best know the needs of their students,' McMahon said.

**Federal Judge Blocks Trump's Plan to Close Education Department**
A federal district court judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to close the Education Department and lay off half of its employees. The decision was made by Judge Myong Joun, who stated that the plaintiffs 'have detailed the potential harm of mass layoffs, which could prevent the Education Department from fulfilling its duties.' The judge has ordered the Education Department to restore the positions of employees who were laid off and to halt plans to transfer student loan and disability services functions out of the department. The lawsuit was filed by two Massachusetts school districts, Somerville and Easthampton, and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), among others. The decision also noted that the layoffs have impacted the operation of the federal student aid system (FAFSA), causing delays in the disbursement of funds and harming students. The Education Department's Deputy Assistant Secretary, Madi Biedermann, stated that the government will 'immediately appeal the decision.' She criticized the ruling as 'an injunction issued by a left-leaning judge based on the plaintiffs' complaint,' emphasizing that Trump's administration has the authority to reform federal agencies under the law. Education Secretary Linda McMahon also expressed her support for the appeal, stating that the reform has been carried out in accordance with the law and that she will continue to push forward with the department's reorganization plan. The president of the American Federation of Teachers, Randi Weingarten, welcomed the decision, calling it 'an important step towards ensuring education equity.' The Trump administration's goal is to reduce the size and functions of the Education Department before Congress passes legislation to formally dissolve it. 'It's a practical adjustment, or is it weakening fairness?' the Epoch Times asked its audience.

**Federal Judge Blocks Trump's Plan to Fire Education Department Employees**
A federal judge Myong Joun, from Boston, blocked on Thursday (22) the mass firing plan of Education Department employees that was being executed by the government of President Donald Trump. According to American press, the judicial decision today suspended the executive order of the president that provided for the dismissal of employees and obliges the immediate reintegration of employees who had already been laid off since the announcement of the cut, made in March this year. The measure met the request for a preliminary injunction made by school districts in Somerville and Easthampton, Massachusetts, and by unions such as the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the second largest in the US. According to the action, the dismissals would represent an 'illegal paralysis' of the Education Department, making it impossible to execute functions determined by Congress, such as support for special education, financial aid distribution, and application of civil rights laws. Judge Joun highlighted in the ruling that the authors of the action presented 'an alarming picture of the irreparable damage that will result from the financial uncertainty and delays, the impaired access to vital information for students and educators, and the loss of essential services for the most vulnerable student populations in the United States.' The judge added that such cuts 'will probably paralyze the Department.' The judicial order requires the Education Department to immediately restore the employees laid off since March until the case is completely judged. In defense of the plan, the Trump administration told the court that the dismissals aim to promote administrative efficiency, denying any attempt to paralyze the Education Department, as argued by the authors of the process. 'The reorganization of the agency may impact certain services until the reorganization is completed,' declared the administration in a statement, assuring that the government remains committed to fulfilling all legal requirements of the department established by Congress. With the court's decision, the mass firing plan is suspended until the trial is concluded, preserving, for now, the jobs and continuity of services provided by the Education Department of the United States.

**US Court Blocks Trump Administration's Order to Close Department of Education**
A US court has blocked a Trump administration order to close the Department of Education and reduce its staff by half. The court ruled that the mass reduction of personnel made it impossible for the department to perform its mandated functions. The court also ordered the department to reinstate hundreds of employees who were fired after Donald Trump took office in January 2025. The Department of Education's spokesperson, Medie Biederman, said that the department will appeal the court's decision 'in an emergency manner.' 'President Trump and the Senate-confirmed Secretary of Education (Linda McMahon) have the right to make decisions about the reorganization of the department, not an unappointed judge with a political agenda. This decision does not serve the interests of American students and families,' Biederman said. The court's ruling also prevents the Trump administration from implementing a plan to transfer student loans and disability programs outside of the Department of Education. The lawsuit was filed by representatives of the Somerville and Easthampton school districts in Massachusetts, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), and other education organizations. 'Today, the court justly rejected one of the first unlawful actions of the administration - the cancellation of the federal role in education. This decision is the first step towards reversing this war on knowledge and undermining broad opportunities,' said AFT President Randi Weingarten. The elimination of the Department of Education was one of Donald Trump's campaign promises. The order to begin the department's liquidation was signed on March 20, 2025. On April 15, the Department of Education announced the freezing of $2.2 billion in long-term grants and $60 million in long-term contracts for Harvard University. On April 16, White House Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt said that President Trump wants Harvard University to 'apologize for its screaming anti-Semitism.' On April 21, Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration. University President Alan M. Garber said that the recent escalation of the administration's actions against the university 'has serious real-world consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, researchers, and the authority of American higher education worldwide.' The Trump administration has threatened universities with reduced federal funding due to pro-Palestinian protests following Israel's military actions in the Gaza Strip. On April 22, more than 100 university presidents, colleges, and scientific societies published a joint statement opposing the Trump administration's treatment of universities. On May 2, the Trump administration presented a bill that proposes reducing federal spending by $163 billion in 2026, primarily in the areas of education and US housing construction. At the same time, the White House plans to increase spending on defense and border security in 2026.'

**Judge Blocks Trump's Plan to Close Department of Education**
A federal judge, Myong Joun, has blocked the execution of President Donald Trump's executive order to close the Department of Education. The judge also ordered the agency to rehire employees who were laid off in a massive personnel reduction. The decision is a significant setback for one of the Republican president's campaign promises. The judge granted a preliminary injunction that restricts the Trump administration from moving forward with two plans announced in March to dismantle the department. The plaintiffs, including the school districts of Somerville and Easthampton in Massachusetts, the American Federation of Teachers, and other educational groups, argued that the layoffs were equivalent to an illegal closure of the Department of Education. They claimed that this measure left the agency unable to fulfill its congressional responsibilities, such as supporting special education, distributing financial assistance, and enforcing civil rights regulations. Judge Joun emphasized that the plaintiffs presented a 'warm portrait of the irreparable harm that will result from the financial uncertainty, the obstructed access to essential information that students and educators depend on, and the loss of critical services for the most vulnerable student communities in the country.' He also noted that the layoffs 'will likely paralyze the Department.' Furthermore, the judge ordered the Department of Education to reinstate the federal workers who were laid off on March 11. The Trump administration argued that the layoffs aimed to improve efficiency, not close the department. Although Trump has mentioned his desire to close the agency, he admits that this must be authorized by Congress. The administration also emphasized that the reorganization may affect certain services until the reorganization is complete, but it committed to fulfilling its legal obligations.

**A President, An Executive Order, and the Department of Education...**
The U.S. Department of Education allocated $268 billion in the 2024 fiscal year, but despite this investment, the nation's math performance lags behind other developed nations. Reading proficiency within Chicago Public Schools also remains a concern, with only 30.5% of students in grades three through eight meeting proficiency standards in the spring of 2024. A presidential executive order could initiate significant restructuring of the Department of Education, potentially streamlining operations and reducing staff, but it would not abolish the department. The abolition of the department would likely eliminate its non-legislated guidance on civil rights, school discipline, and data collection, potentially creating a fragmented landscape of standards across states. The debate surrounding the potential abolition of the Federal Department of Education presents a complex contrast between advocating for decentralized educational governance and maintaining federal safeguards.

**States Are Chomping At The Bit To Overhaul America's Broken Education System**
President Donald Trump's plan to eliminate the Department of Education bureaucracy and return education policy to the states is a long-overdue correction that will empower parents, educators, and local communities to shape the future of learning in America. Despite the Department's presence and spending for decades, fourth- and eighth-grade reading scores have fallen since the Department started tracking them in the early 1990s. State-driven education reform has already demonstrated remarkable results, with West Virginia's Hope Scholarship Program expected to be utilized by 60,000 students in the 2026-2027 school year, and other states like Florida and Arizona showing similar success. Critics claim the plan will strip funding from schools, but the reality is that federal education dollars will be allocated more effectively, and programs will be transferred to other agencies that are better equipped to administer them. This approach ensures that critical services remain intact while cutting unnecessary administrative costs and streamlining government operations. Lisa B. Nelson and Patricia Rucker argue that the states are ready to lead in education and are 'clamoring' for this change.

**Conservatives Celebrate Start of Department of Education Dismantling**
Conservative leaders celebrated the start of the dismantling of the Department of Education, calling it 'an incredible moment in history'. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to officially begin the process of closing the department. Republican leaders, including Mike Johnson, Byron Donalds, and Marsha Blackburn, expressed their support for the move, stating that education is better managed by parents and teachers, and that the federal government should not be involved in the classroom. The governors of Florida, Ron DeSantis, and Virginia, Glenn Youngkin, also praised the decision, saying that it would allow states to take full responsibility for K-12 education and make better decisions for students, parents, and teachers. However, it is unclear whether the Department of Education can be completely eliminated, as it would require a presidential reorganization authority, which has not been granted since the 1980s, and would need to be approved by Congress.

**US Department of Education to Lay Off Nearly Half of Staff**
The US Department of Education has announced the layoff of nearly half of its staff, a move criticized by Donald Trump and conservatives. The department stated that its workforce will decrease from over 4,100 to approximately 2,200. According to Education Secretary Linda McMahon, this is the first step towards a complete dismantling of the department. 'It is clear that we are not eliminating education,' she said, explaining that the president wants to 'eliminate the bureaucracy of education.' The department has already seen around 600 employees leave in recent weeks as part of a federal workforce reduction plan, and 1,300 more will be placed on administrative leave starting March 21. The department's programs, including student loans, will not be affected. McMahon stated that the restructuring will save $500 million per year. Donald Trump had promised during his presidential campaign to abolish the department and transfer its responsibilities to the states.

**Trump Plans to Close Department of Education, According to Sources**
US President Donald Trump plans to issue an executive order to close the Department of Education, according to sources close to the government. The order would require Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to 'take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education' as allowed by law. The document argues that the federal government's control over education has failed and it's time to return education to the states. The White House has not responded to requests for comment on the possible implementation of the measure. 'The experiment of controlling American education through federal programs and dollars has failed our children, teachers, and families,' reads the text. Eliminating the Department of Education would require Congressional approval, which could face strong opposition. Key programs of the agency, such as funds for students with disabilities and student loans, are protected by law and have significant political support. The plan follows the 2025 Project of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative strategy to redistribute the Department of Education's functions to other government agencies. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon confirmed that the Trump administration is moving forward with the closure plan. 'Trump and the voters have tasked us with the mission of eliminating the bureaucracy of the Department of Education, and we will do it carefully and responsibly,' she said in an email to staff. During her confirmation hearing, McMahon assured that the intention is not to reduce federal programs, but to make them more efficient, although she acknowledged that Congressional approval is needed for the complete restructuring.

**Dismantling The Department of Education**
President Trump has called for the dismantling of the US Department of Education, established in 1980 to ensure equal access to education regardless of background. Trump has ordered the department to eliminate DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) within two weeks, with potential consequences. The move may impact Title 1 funding, affecting low-income students and those with special needs who rely on federal dollars for essential services, such as free food and amenities. This plan is part of Project 2025, a reorganization of the Federal Government, which aims to reshape the country's education system.

**Trump's Plan to Eliminate the US Department of Education: A Complicated Process**
The US Department of Education (DOE) has a budget of $238 billion for 2024, which is less than 2% of the total federal spending. Donald Trump argues that the DOE is an example of federal overreach and accuses it of imposing progressive ideologies in schools. He claims that his administration will 'drain the swamp of government education' and 'return control of education to the states.' However, the DOE's programs are already under the control of state and local governments. Trump's proposal to abolish or merge the DOE is not new, as he previously suggested merging the DOE and the Department of Labor, but the idea did not pass. Eliminating the DOE would involve redistributing its functions to other agencies, but the process could be chaotic and harm essential programs. According to Kevin Welner, an expert in education policy, the reorganization of the DOE 'would be a complicated process that would harm millions of students.' Dan Zibel, a former DOE lawyer, warned that any attempt to transfer educational programs to other agencies would require Congressional approval, which could block Trump's plan. The plan to eliminate the DOE is part of the controversial Project 2025, a 900-page document prepared by the Heritage Foundation, which proposes a radical reform of the federal government, including the elimination of the DOE and the transfer of its functions to other agencies, such as the Department of the Treasury.

**Consequences of Eliminating the US Department of Education**
According to Kevin Welner, a professor of Educational Policy and Law at the University of Colorado Boulder, 'this process of reorganization would likely be complicated and chaotic, and would harm important programs for elementary, secondary, and university students.' Trump has proposed reorganizing the Department of Education, possibly by merging it with the Department of Labor, or by having the Department of the Treasury handle student loans and other financial aid. This proposal is part of the 2025 Project, which Trump has attempted to distance himself from during his campaign, but whose ideals are closely tied to his own.

**The Department of Education is Now on the Chopping Block, Dozens Placed on Leave [WATCH]**
The Trump administration is planning to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education through an executive order, which would eliminate all functions not explicitly mandated by law and transfer some responsibilities to other federal agencies. The move aligns with President Trump's pledge to reduce federal oversight and shift more control to the states. According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, the order may also call for developing a legislative proposal to abolish the department entirely. The effort is part of a broader initiative to reduce the size of federal agencies and eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy. President Trump said, 'I will be closing up the Department of Education, Washington DC, and will send all education BACK TO THE STATES.' The proposal has been met with criticism from conservatives who have criticized the agency for policies implemented under the Biden-Harris administration. The Department of Education has placed dozens of employees on administrative leave, with some believing it is connected to their participation in the department's 'Diversity Change-Agent Training Program.' The employees will continue to receive full pay and benefits for the duration of their leave period. The restructuring of the Department of Education is the latest federal agency to face changes under the Trump administration's efficiency efforts.

**Trump considers executive action to dismantle education department**
President Donald Trump is reportedly considering executive action to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, potentially eliminating some programs and shifting others to different government agencies. This move aligns with Mr. Trump's goal of downsizing the federal government, a shared objective with Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency. However, no immediate action is expected. The Education Department plays a critical role in administering federal financial aid, compiling educational data, and enforcing anti-discrimination policies. Its funding represents less than 10% of overall public school financing, primarily coming from state and local tax revenues. Some programs, established through federal legislation, would be uncertain in their future should the department be eliminated or restructured. Mr. Trump has a longstanding position on dismantling the Education Department, stating, 'One other thing I'll be doing very early in the administration is closing up the Department of Education in Washington, D.C., and sending all education and education work and needs back to the states.' Linda McMahon, Mr. Trump's nominee for Secretary of Education, is awaiting Senate confirmation. Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation has proposed alternative approaches to restructuring federal education programs through its Project 2025 initiative. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds has introduced legislation aimed at abolishing the Education Department and shifting certain loan programs to the Department of the Treasury.
