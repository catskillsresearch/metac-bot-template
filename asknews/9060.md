**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**2.8 Billion People Worldwide Lack Access to Suitable Housing, UN Report Finds**
According to the United Nations' Habitat Programme annual report for 2024, approximately 2.8 billion people worldwide lack access to suitable housing. Of these, 1.1 billion people live in poor or informal settlements, which is 'the main challenge for sustainable urban development', as stated in the report. Around 90% of the population of these poor settlements live in Africa and Asia, where there is a shortage of housing units of around 170 million. Anna Claudia Robisch, Executive Director of the United Nations' Habitat Programme, said in the report that 'climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters continue to force millions of people to leave their homes in search of safety, stability, and better living conditions.' The report estimates that 318 million people are homeless, equivalent to the population of the United States. Globally, 'one in four people lives in conditions that harm their health, safety, and well-being', according to the United Nations' Habitat Programme report. Only 14% of urban residents and 40% of rural residents have access to clean water, and two in five people do not have access to sanitation services. The report states that 'safe and managed sanitation is a fundamental element of human development and is often used as a measure of progress in reducing poverty, diseases, and premature deaths.' Anna Claudia Robisch called for 'rethinking urban policies, land use, laws, and financing to prioritize housing and basic services as key drivers of climate action and sustainable development.' By 2040, it is expected that 2 billion urban residents will be exposed to significant temperature increases. The United Nations' Habitat Programme member states adopted the programme's strategic plan for 2026-2029, which focuses on access to housing, land, and basic services, such as clean water and sanitation.

**Egypt's Expanded Vaccination Program Achieves Over 95% Coverage Rate**
Egypt's Ministry of Health announced that the expanded vaccination program has achieved a high coverage rate of over 95% of routine vaccinations, contributing significantly to the elimination of several infectious diseases, including diphtheria, tetanus, and polio. Dr. Amr Qandil, Deputy Minister of Health for Preventive Medicine, stated that the program has successfully reduced the rates of morbidity and mortality caused by targeted diseases, in addition to the digital transformation of the vaccination sector, which has improved the efficiency of service delivery. The ministry has also confirmed that it will continue to expand coverage and reach all segments of society. Egypt has become the first country in the Eastern Mediterranean region to achieve the regional goal of controlling hepatitis B, according to a new certificate from the World Health Organization. Dr. Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, Deputy Prime Minister for Human Development and Minister of Health and Population, said that the achievement of the regional goal of combating hepatitis B came after a review and study by the Regional Committee of the World Health Organization on the file submitted by the Ministry of Health and Population. The World Health Organization has confirmed that Egypt has achieved the regional goal of controlling hepatitis B, as the Ministry of Health and Population has reduced the rate of hepatitis B transmission to less than 1% among children aged 5 years or older, while maintaining a coverage rate of 90.8% or more for the third dose of the hepatitis B vaccine for over 10 years, and a coverage rate of 90.8% or more for the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine for 5 years.

**Climate Change Adds a Month of Extreme Heat to 4 Billion People, Report Finds**
A new scientific report reveals that human-induced climate change has added a full month of extreme heat to approximately 4 billion people, or 49% of the world's population, from May 2024 to May 2025. The analysis, conducted by researchers from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central, and the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre, found that 67 heatwaves occurred during this period, all of which were directly influenced by climate change. The report defines 'extreme heat' as days where temperatures exceed 90% of the values recorded at the same location between 1991 and 2020. The regions most affected by this phenomenon include the Caribbean, where the island of Aruba recorded 187 days of extreme heat, a 142-day increase from expected levels in the absence of climate change. Other regions, such as Central Asia, South Sudan, and the Mediterranean basin, also experienced unprecedented heatwaves that would not have occurred without the effects of global warming. The report highlights that climate change has doubled the number of extreme heat days in 195 countries and territories worldwide, leading to increased mortality and disease rates, crop damage, and strain on energy and healthcare systems. The researchers emphasize that heatwaves are among the most destructive natural disasters, often receiving inadequate media coverage. Professor Frederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London and a contributor to the report, stated, 'Heatwaves kill silently. People don't die in the streets, but in their homes or hospitals, and often their deaths are not linked to the heat.' The report warns that continued reliance on fossil fuels will exacerbate these phenomena, with each degree of temperature increase increasing the likelihood of more severe and prolonged heatwaves. It calls for urgent action to reduce carbon emissions and enhance climate resilience, particularly in vulnerable and fragile communities that suffer disproportionately. This report comes at a time when many countries are preparing for a summer that is expected to be one of the hottest in history, highlighting the urgent need to accelerate international efforts to combat climate change and mitigate its devastating impacts on human and environmental health.

**Global Report on Food Crises: Persistent Crises Exacerbated by Humanitarian Funding Shortfall**
The Global Report on Food Crises highlights that persistent crises are now exacerbated by a more recent issue: a dramatic reduction in vital humanitarian funding. 'This is not just a failure of systems, it's a failure of humanity,' according to the report. The report attributes the ongoing food insecurity and malnutrition to conflicts, economic shocks, extreme climate phenomena, and forced displacements. Notably, forced displacements are a major contributor, with nearly 95 million people displaced, including internally displaced persons, asylum seekers, and refugees living in countries experiencing food crises such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Colombia, Sudan, and Syria, out of a total of 128 million forcibly displaced people worldwide.

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**The Global Crisis: A World in Peril**
The world is facing a global crisis, as countries like Canada and Norway, which are known for their democratic values, are abandoning the principles of human rights and freedoms. This shift will lead to increased vulnerability, reduced protection, and a decline in trade, ultimately resulting in a possible recession. The effects will be devastating, particularly in countries with limited resources, where millions of lives will be lost, especially those of children. In Gaza, over 15,000 children have been killed or trapped under rubble, while 900,000 are currently under siege and without food. The US has also decided to halt all international aid programs, which will lead to 14 million deaths in the next five years, with a third of those being children under the age of five, according to a study by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health. As the world's leading source of global health funding, the US's decision is a catastrophic blow. As the author notes, 'I doubt that Musk, Trump, or Netanyahu will lose a single minute of sleep over these deaths, nor will they regain empathy for saving innocent children from a cruel death.' The world is becoming a very dangerous place, and it's essential to take these consequences into account.

**CIA Report Warns of Global Catastrophe by 2030: A Countdown to Disaster**
A 2003 report by the CIA, 'The 2030 Spike: Countdown to Global Catastrophe', written by Colin Mason, describes six factors that will converge in the next decade, leading to a global catastrophe. These factors include energy scarcity, demographic disparities, global poverty, climate change, food shortages, water scarcity, and international anarchy. The report proposes over 100 measures to mitigate the consequences of this crisis. According to the report, 'estimates place available petroleum resources at less than one billion barrels, and global consumption at 28 billion barrels per year, indicating depletion in as little as 34 years.' The report also cites studies by the International Water Management Institute, predicting that one billion people will face absolute water scarcity by 2025. To avoid this, the report suggests using science, particularly genetics and climatology, to address climate change, water and food scarcity. However, some measures proposed in the report are more controversial, including: diverting scientific effort from arms, space research, and 'doubtful' technologies to practical goals for humanity; establishing a global authority to define priorities and advise on implementation; forming a 'censor' body to examine new technologies and identify potential harm; creating a specialized international penal law body to prevent the application of harmful technologies; and establishing research institutes with secure funding. The report concludes that these objectives may not be achievable, but can be approached.

**Turkey's Climate Law: A Comprehensive Approach to Reducing Emissions**
The world is a delicate balance of physics, chemistry, and other sciences. Despite experiencing numerous disasters, the Earth remains a habitable planet for humans. However, the planet's physical size, limited oxygen and food source capacity, and the need to conserve these resources are directly related to the efficient use of natural resources, the use of environmentally friendly technologies, and the fair distribution of resources. The Industrial Revolution increased production capacity and efficiency, and scientific advancements have made farming more effective, leading to a significant increase in food production. Despite the world's population growing from 1 billion in 1800 to 2 billion in 1930, 3 billion in 1960, and 8 billion today, there is less hunger compared to the past. However, some countries face difficulties accessing resources, while others hoard them for future generations. The Industrial Revolution led to an increase in fossil fuel consumption and a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions. The Earth's natural capacity to convert carbon dioxide into a harmless substance has been exceeded. The balance of gases in the atmosphere maintains the Earth's surface temperature at a habitable level. The rapid increase in technology production after World War II has led to a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions, with the atmosphere's ratio increasing by two times compared to pre-industrial levels, resulting in a global average temperature increase of over 1°C. As a result, glaciers are melting, snowfall is decreasing, and heavy rainfall and flash floods are becoming more frequent. The increased carbon dioxide has also led to a decrease in ocean pH by 0.1, making the oceans more acidic and affecting marine ecosystems and seafood habitats. In response to scientific warnings, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has established the Kyoto Protocol, which aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 4% compared to 1990 levels. However, the United States did not ratify the protocol, and Canada withdrew later. The countries that ratified the protocol achieved their targets, but nine countries used flexibility mechanisms to meet their targets. Between 2008 and 2012, the average emissions of these countries decreased by 24.2% below the 1990 level. However, this decrease was largely due to external factors such as the collapse of the Soviet Union and the 2008 global financial crisis. When including the United States and Canada, the total decrease in emissions was 11.8%. However, the 36 countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol were responsible for only 24% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010, while global emissions increased by 32% between 1990 and 2010, making the Kyoto Protocol ineffective in protecting the atmosphere. In response, the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015 by 194 countries, aiming to reduce global warming to 1.5°C below pre-industrial levels, with each country setting its own targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and updating these targets every five years. The agreement also aims to achieve zero net emissions by 2050, with developed countries committing to provide $100 billion annually to support developing countries in their climate change efforts. Germany has been successful in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with a 30.5% reduction between 2005 and 2023, and aims to reduce emissions by 65% below 1990 levels by 2030. However, Germany's efforts are hindered by the country's reliance on fossil fuels for heating buildings and transportation. The country has implemented a comprehensive plan to reduce emissions, including increasing the use of renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and promoting electric vehicles. Turkey, on the other hand, has a draft climate law that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but lacks a comprehensive strategy and clear targets for reducing emissions. The law also fails to address the issue of waste management, with Turkey importing waste from Europe and processing it, resulting in unnecessary carbon emissions. In contrast, Germany and other developed countries have designed their green transition plans to strengthen their technological capabilities, while also supporting their economies. Turkey needs to adopt a strategic and comprehensive approach to reducing emissions, taking into account its current technological capabilities and ensuring effective coordination between government agencies.

**Global Crises Hinder Efforts to Convince Millions to Quit Smoking**
According to a report presented to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the global crises have hindered efforts to convince millions to quit smoking. The report states that the delay has affected approximately 95 million additional tobacco consumers, who were supposed to stop smoking by 2025. Despite the success of governments in reducing the number of smokers, the failure to reduce the number by 30% means that 1.207 billion and 800,000 people are still smoking worldwide, instead of the target of 1.112 billion and 400,000, according to a Reuters report using smoking rates and population numbers from the report. As the report notes, 'this delay... has affected approximately 95 million additional tobacco consumers, who were supposed to stop smoking by 2025'.

**Global Crises Hinder Efforts to Convince Millions to Quit Smoking**
A report supported by 57 organizations and groups has stated that the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and wars have hindered global efforts to reduce tobacco consumption and convince approximately 95 million people to quit smoking. The report noted that the delay in achieving the goal of reducing tobacco consumption by 30% among those over 15 years old by 2025 has resulted in an additional 95 million tobacco consumers, who were supposed to have quit by 2025. Despite the success of governments in reducing the number of smokers, the failure to achieve the 30% reduction goal means that 1.207 billion and 800 thousand people still smoke worldwide, instead of the target of 1.112 billion and 400 thousand, according to a 'Reuters' estimate, based on tobacco consumption rates and population numbers in the report.

**Gaza's entire population faces critical risk of famine, global...**
The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has warned that the entire population of Gaza, approximately 1.95 million people, faces a critical risk of famine, with half a million at risk of starvation. The IPC analysis found that 93% of the population is experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity, with 244,000 people in the 'catastrophic' category. This is a significant deterioration since the IPC's last report in October, which found 133,000 people in the 'catastrophic' category. The IPC projects that 470,000 people will fall into the 'catastrophic' category by the end of September, with over a million more at 'emergency' levels. The IPC has called for 'urgent action' to save lives and avert further starvation. Israeli officials have disputed this, claiming that enough aid has entered Gaza to sustain the population, but the IPC has stated that the proposed distribution mechanisms are 'highly insufficient' to meet the population's essential needs.

**Surviving global catastrophe is a matter of community, not commerce**
A recent study published in PLOS One suggests that even in the event of a catastrophic event, an average-sized city's population can survive with minimal nearby farming space. The study, led by Matt Boyd and Nick Wilson, analyzed the city of Palmerston North in New Zealand and found that with strategic urban and near-urban agricultural practices, the city could provide about 20% of the food needed to survive. However, if the community dedicated at least 4.4 square miles of surrounding land to additional agricultural projects, that would close the gap for adequate food stores. Boyd emphasizes the importance of community-level cooperation and measures to ensure resilience, rather than relying on 'billionaire bunkers' or high-tech solutions. He encourages people to consider the possibility of a global catastrophe and to focus on simple, low-tech options such as community farm projects and community members petitioning local leaders to support agriculture.

**Expert Predicts Global Collapse and Mass Extermination if Electrical System Fails**
Basquecraft, a survival expert, appeared on Jordi Wild's podcast and discussed the possibility of a global electrical collapse. He stated that if the electrical system were to fail now, 'the civilization would collapse completely and there would be a huge extermination of humans. I think 80-90% of the population would be affected.' He also mentioned that the lack of resources worldwide would lead to chaos and the collapse of cities. Basquecraft noted that gasoline is not infinite and has a shelf life of one year, contrary to popular belief. He suggested that people living in rural areas would have an easier time surviving than those in cities. 'I would go to the village. If I'm stuck in the city, I would go to the village... Help those who can. Today for you, tomorrow for me.'

Streamer Jordi Wild recently discussed a hypothetical global blackout with survival expert Basquecraft, asking what would happen to society if the power grid collapsed. Basquecraft responded, 'If the electrical system collapses, civilization would likely collapse completely, and there would be a huge extermination of humans, with around 80% to 90% of the population not surviving.' Basquecraft also highlighted the importance of being prepared, stating, 'Many people are not aware that gasoline expires within a year, unlike in movies.' He recommended that in a situation like this, people should seek refuge in a village where they can rely on neighbors and family for support and resources. 'We are too dependent,' Wild said, echoing Basquecraft's concerns about the consequences of a global blackout.

**Alexander Kirsh: Trump's Global Financial Catastrophe - Brief and Clear**
Alexander Kirsh writes, 'While the World Government (or the FRS, or whoever is in charge) is sleeping, committing a crime and an embarrassment, a monkey with a financial grenade (and also a nuclear bomb, but that's not the topic now) is ruling the world and wants to bring it, including the US, to a near-immediate total catastrophe due to neglecting the global division of labor (West - 'services', East - goods). For example, the US plans to impose a 20+34+50=104% tariff on Chinese imports, which would increase the price of all Chinese goods in the US by two times. If the US were to produce all goods domestically, the price would increase four times due to the difference in labor costs. As a result, the American population would be able to buy 2-4 times fewer goods on their salary, and the dollar would lose its economic value, falling to around 10 hryvnias, from its current level of 20.7 hryvnias (according to the Big Mac Index). If wages are increased to combat poverty, prices for all goods produced in the US would rise, and the process would repeat itself until the US becomes so poor that it can no longer import anything, and the trade deficit would disappear, but the world would not follow the US, and they would fall to the level of a poor country.'

**If I Were God:**
The author, in an imaginative scenario where they are God, presents a choice to humanity: stay on Earth and build a world where all thrive, or leave and follow the 2% who control the systems that perpetuate 95% of global suffering. The author argues that most of humanity has been complicit in its own oppression, driven by internalized aspiration, fear, and cultural indoctrination. The 75% of the population who enable the 2% are encouraged to wake up and reject the system's values, demanding justice and creating a world where suffering is no longer inevitable. The author suggests that those who choose to leave and colonize Mars will be consumed by their own greed and power struggles, while those who stay will rebuild a world where equity and compassion prevail. The choice is presented as a cosmic joke, where the 2% will devour each other in a desperate bid for dominance, and the Earth will finally be free from their exploitation.

**Scientists Warn of Three Hidden Threats to Humanity**
Scientists have identified three potential causes of a global catastrophe that seem unlikely but could lead to the extinction of the human species. The first threat is a demographic crisis, with the United Nations predicting that the global population will exceed 10 billion by 2050, leading to a severe resource shortage, famine, and subsequent collapse of civilization. The second danger lies in the development of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, which, although promising significant breakthroughs, may get out of control. As John Skelton and Craig Wheeler from the University of Texas point out, powerful gamma-ray emissions from supernovae explosions could cause significant damage to the Earth's biosphere. If such a burst were directed towards Earth, the consequences would be catastrophic. Researchers from the University of Otago have also considered the worst-case scenario of a global catastrophe - a possible nuclear winter. They believe that only five countries would be able to survive in such conditions. 'We should consider not only obvious risks but also less predictable factors to ensure our future,' says the 'MediaPotok' news outlet.

**Climate Catastrophe: A Third of the Earth Could Become Uninhabitable for Humans Over 60**
A team of international scientists has calculated that if global warming exceeds 2 degrees Celsius, a significant portion of the Earth's landmass would become uninhabitable for humans. According to their predictions, the area where humans could no longer safely maintain their core body temperature during heatwaves would triple, covering six percent of the planet's landmass, equivalent to the area of the United States. This alarming forecast highlights the severe consequences of exceeding the 1.5-degree Celsius threshold, which is crucial to preventing catastrophic climate change.
