**US Lawmakers Propose Accelerated End of Electric Vehicle Tax Credit**
The US House of Representatives' Republican lawmakers have introduced a bill to accelerate the end of the electric vehicle tax credit (AMPC) under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has benefited Korean battery companies. The bill proposes to end the tax credit in 2027, a year earlier than the original deadline of 2032. The tax credit will be phased out for electric vehicles purchased in 2026, and production companies that sell over 20,000 electric vehicles in the US between 2009 and 2025 will be excluded from the tax credit. This means that the tax credit will effectively end this year. The impact of the accelerated end of the tax credit on the electric vehicle market and the battery industry is expected to be significant. Domestic battery companies, such as LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, and SK On, have invested heavily in the US market and have benefited from the tax credit. However, if the tax credit is phased out, their profitability may be affected. The bill also includes a provision that requires production companies to meet certain supply chain conditions to be eligible for the tax credit, which may be beneficial for Korean companies. However, the bill has not been finalized and still needs to pass through the Senate. The IRA has been criticized by Donald Trump, and the bill is seen as an attempt to implement his tax cut promise. However, the bill's passage is unlikely to be easy, as most of the lawmakers who benefit from the tax credit are Republicans.

**US IRA Modification to Reduce Electric Vehicle Subsidy: Impact on Korean Battery Companies**
The shares of battery-related companies in South Korea are experiencing a decline due to the news that the US Republican Party has proposed a modification to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that would reduce the electric vehicle subsidy. According to Korea Investment & Securities, the IRA modification would shorten the period for electric vehicle purchase tax credits from 2032 to 2026, and exclude models with over 20,000 units sold between 2009 and 2025 from the tax credit starting in 2026. Additionally, the modification would abolish the tax credit for commercial electric vehicles that do not meet the origin requirements starting next year. The Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (AMPC) would also be shortened from 2032 to 2031, and its payment scale would be reduced gradually. Korea Investment & Securities analyst Choi Moon-sun said, 'The tax credit for well-selling models and some commercial electric vehicles will be abolished starting next year, and the entire subsidy will be abolished in 2027, which will have a negative impact on US electric vehicle sales.' He also added, 'The reduction of AMPC is only 1 year ahead of schedule, but the payment scale will be reduced gradually, which will be negative for battery companies.' Specifically, LG Energy Solution is expected to be severely affected by the reduction of AMPC, with its operating profit expected to decrease by 16.4% next year and 12.6% in 2027 if the AMPC is reduced from $45 to $40 per module.

**US House Republicans Propose Bill to Eliminate Electric Vehicle Tax Credit**
The US House of Representatives' majority party, the Republican Party, has proposed a bill to eliminate the electric vehicle tax credit (30D) under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) by 2027. The original tax credit was set to expire on December 31, 2032, but the new bill advances the deadline to December 31, 2026. Additionally, electric vehicles purchased in 2026 will no longer be eligible for the tax credit if the manufacturer has sold over 200,000 electric vehicles in the US between 2009 and 2025. The IRA allows taxpayers to claim a maximum tax credit of $7,500 for purchasing electric vehicles assembled in North America with key minerals and battery requirements. However, to finance Trump's tax cut pledge, the Republican Party must cut other business budgets. As a result, the proposed bill is expected to eliminate not only the electric vehicle tax credit but also most of the clean energy support projects initiated by the previous Biden administration. The bill also plans to eliminate the '45W tax credit' for commercial electric vehicles after December 31, 2025. The '45W tax credit' is an exception that allows commercial electric vehicles, such as leased or rented cars, to claim the tax credit even if they do not meet the origin requirements. This decision is seen as a response to the requests from the Korean government and industry, as Hyundai has been expanding its electric vehicle leasing business in the US to apply for this tax credit. However, some Republicans have criticized this exception as a 'loophole' that goes against the intent of the law. The tax credit for used electric vehicle buyers will also be eliminated.

**US House Republicans to End Electric Vehicle Tax Credit a Year Early**
The US House of Representatives' Republican majority has decided to end the electric vehicle tax credit, which is based on the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a year earlier than planned. According to the Wall Street Journal, the House Ways and Means Committee included a provision in the tax bill to repeal the IRA's electric vehicle tax credit (30D) by 2027. The original deadline for the tax credit was December 31, 2022, but it was moved up to December 31, 2026. However, for electric vehicles purchased in 2026, the tax credit will be eliminated if the manufacturer has sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles in the US between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2025. The IRA allows taxpayers who purchase electric vehicles assembled in North America and meet certain battery and mineral requirements to claim a tax credit of up to $7,500. However, as President Trump is negative towards electric vehicles and needs to raise funds for his tax cuts, the Republican Party is expected to eliminate the electric vehicle tax credit, along with other clean energy initiatives from the previous Biden administration. The Republican bill also includes a provision to eliminate the '45W tax credit' for commercial electric vehicles after December 31, 2025. The '45W tax credit' is an exception that allows commercial electric vehicles, such as leased or rented vehicles, to claim the tax credit even if they do not meet the origin requirements. This exception was introduced to accommodate the requests of the Korean government and industry, but some Republicans have criticized it as a 'loophole' that goes against the intent of the law. The tax credit for used electric vehicle buyers will also be eliminated.

The original plan was to gradually reduce the tax credit amount and phase it out by 2033, but the Republican bill will maintain it until the end of 2031. Additionally, products from prohibited foreign entities will no longer be eligible for tax credits, which is seen as a measure to prevent Chinese companies from benefiting from the tax credit.

**US House of Representatives Announces Tax Reform Plan to End Electric Vehicle Tax Credit by Next Year**
The US House of Representatives has announced a tax reform plan that will end the electric vehicle tax credit by next year. According to the Wall Street Journal, the plan aims to reduce and abolish certain provisions of the 'Inflation Reduction Act' (IRA) passed by the previous Biden administration. The tax credit for new electric vehicle purchases will end on December 31, 2025. However, manufacturers who sold fewer than 20,000 electric vehicles in the US between 2010 and 2024 will receive a one-year extension. The tax credit for commercial electric vehicles and used electric vehicles will also be provided until 2025. The IRA law had planned to maintain the tax credit for new and used electric vehicles until 2032. The tax credit for battery and renewable energy component production will also end in 2032. However, the tax credit for wind energy components will be maintained until 2027. The tax credit for renewable energy production or investment will be gradually reduced from 2029 and completely abolished in 2032. The tax credit for clean hydrogen production will end in 2026, but projects started this year will still receive benefits. The plan also prohibits tax credits for employee retention during the COVID-19 period and prevents some small businesses from avoiding state and local tax credits. The tax credit for university and foundation donations will be significantly increased. The annual tax rate for investment income generated from donations will be increased from 1.4% to a maximum of 21%. The tax rate for foundations will be increased from 1.39% to a maximum of 10%. The plan also introduces a new tax credit for tips and overtime, which will be provided until 2028. A 'MAGA account' worth $1,000 will be provided for children born between 2025 and 2028. The standard deduction and child tax credit will be temporarily increased, and the tax exemption for inheritances and family-owned businesses will be expanded. The highest tax rate will remain at 37%. If passed, it is estimated that the federal tax revenue will decrease by $490 billion. The House Ways and Means Committee will begin reviewing the tax plan on May 13 and aims to pass the bill by the end of the month, with the goal of receiving the president's signature by July 4. However, the Journal predicts that the bill may be defeated if there are some defections from the Republican Party in the House of Representatives. Some Republican lawmakers from districts where low-carbon energy projects are located are arguing that some tax credits should be maintained.

**Energy Production, Investment Credits Phased Out in GOP Tax Bill**
House Republicans proposed phasing out clean energy business breaks and repealing electric vehicle and clean energy home improvement credits in their tax bill. The move aims to pay for extending tax cuts from the 2017 law, which is set to expire at the end of the year. The proposal targets the clean electricity production and investment credits, also known as 45Y and 48E, by phasing them out and restricting their use. This decision comes after Democrats unleashed billions of dollars in tax credits for clean energy projects in their 2022 tax-and-climate law. As one of the key provisions of the 2022 law, the credits have been a crucial incentive for clean energy investments.

**House GOP unveils bill text for slashing Biden energy tax credits**
The House GOP has unveiled a bill that would terminate and modify clean energy and manufacturing tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was passed by Democrats in 2022. The bill would eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, terminate the Clean Hydrogen Production 45V tax credit, and block wind energy from the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax. The legislation also subjects the Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits to a phase-out period and restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) criticized the bill, saying it would 'jack up prices on American families,' 'kill jobs,' and 'create chaos in the business community.'

**Importers: Mandatory Dossier to be Deposited before May 14**
The Direction du commerce de la wilaya d'Alger has issued a call to action for importers in the state of importation, holders of valid authorizations between January 1, 2024 and March 30, 2025. They are invited to regularize their administrative situation by submitting a complete administrative file before May 14, 2025. The file must include: The operators can present themselves either to the regional trade inspection services or directly to the headquarters of the direction at the 5th floor - service of control of commercial practices and anticompetitive practices. This initiative aims to strengthen transparency and regularity in import operations, in the context of deep reforms of the external trade sector. The reminder comes after the announcement by President Abdelmadjid Tebboune of the official end of ALGEX, a structure considered obsolete in the face of the new economic dynamic. Two new entities are being created: one for importation and the other for exportation, both under the tutelage of the Prime Minister. Their mission is to structure commercial flows, ensure better oversight, and establish a more transparent business climate. In this transitional framework, the Minister of External Trade and Export Promotion, Kamel Rezig, supervised the delivery of bank domiciliation certificates to several operators in the importation of bananas sector, with the aim of ensuring regular supply of essential products to the national market, pending the effective implementation of the new importation structure. The ministry also stated that this operation of delivering bank domiciliation certificates will continue in favor of other importers in the coming days. Through these measures, the authorities aim to establish a more equitable and better-regulated commercial environment, where regulatory compliance becomes an indispensable requirement. The transition to new regulatory institutions should allow Algeria to modernize its exchanges, while ensuring greater stability of the domestic market. An essential step in the country's economic strategy to strengthen its commercial sovereignty and attract durable investments.

**New Tax Return Requirements for Employers of Domestic Workers in 2025**
The 2025 tax return campaign for 2024 income will begin on April 10, but one major change has already been announced. The approximately 4.7 million households that employ domestic workers will still be eligible for tax credits, but they will need to fill out a new section (case 7DB) to specify the total amount of expenses related to these workers. They will also need to complete annex 2042 RICI and detail the corresponding amount for each type of domestic employment expense (gardening, childcare, etc.). Additionally, they will need to indicate to whom they have entrusted these tasks, whether it be a physical or moral person (employee, association, company, or other organization). This change is a result of an amendment adopted during the examination of the finance bill, which aimed to improve the evaluation of the fiscal device. The tax credit is worth half of the expenses incurred, up to certain thresholds (12,000 euros and 20,000 euros, depending on the situation, with possible additional charges). This represents a significant budget: nearly 6 billion euros in 2023. This amount has been constantly evolving since 2012, when it was only 2 billion euros. The Court of Auditors had previously criticized the fiscal device in a report published last year, stating that the services involved were focusing on the 20% of households with the highest incomes, for which public aid is likely less decisive. The report also pointed out the lack of a 'comprehensive strategy' and the absence of 'systematic and rigorous evaluation'. This new measure aims to provide 'better visibility on the effective use' of these tax credits, as justified by the amendment submitted to the Senate. 'Such a measure facilitates a more rigorous control of its effectiveness and responds to the need for increased transparency of public finances.' Adjustments may still be made to ensure a better use of public funds.

The US Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service have issued final regulations for technology-neutral tax credits for clean energy projects under Sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code. The regulations provide additional rules and guidelines for calculating a facility's greenhouse gas emissions rate and boundaries for performing lifecycle analysis. The technology-neutral production tax credit (45Y PTC) and technology-neutral investment tax credit (48E ITC) will replace many existing credits, and are available for facilities that are placed in service after December 31, 2024. The regulations also clarify the definition of 'hydrogen energy storage property' and provide updates on eligible components and boundaries between storage and transportation infrastructure. Additionally, the regulations introduce the Incremental Production Rule, which allows for additional tax credits after a property is placed in service, and clarify the domestic content bonus credit, energy communities, and prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.

**IRA domestic content bonus uncertain under Trump government – CEA**
A report from Clean Energy Associates (CEA) says that the impact of the new Republican administration on the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is uncertain, but potential legislative changes could alter the domestic content guidelines for solar PV projects. Currently, the domestic content bonus offers a 10% bump on top of the IRA's 30% investment and production tax credits if projects meet the minimum 40% threshold for domestic components. However, CEA said that this could change in the future, with the potential for domestic content to become 'required to achieve the base 30% ITC'. The report also noted that the safe harbour method under the domestic content bonus could be eliminated, making it harder for solar projects to qualify for the 30% base credit. CEA said that a repeal of the entire IRA remains unlikely, despite proposals to change the domestic content guidelines.

**The Solar Policy Scoop: February 2025**
The US Treasury has released final rules for the 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit, which now includes hydropower, geothermal, and other zero-emissions technologies. The Treasury has also published final rules for the IRA low-income bonus credit program, expanding the list of qualifying technologies and clarifying eligibility requirements. The ITC has made an affirmative determination in its preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty investigations concerning active anode material from China. The ITC has also terminated the Sec. 337 investigation between Shoals and Voltage concerning solar panel connector products. Five solar companies have been added to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) Entity List, including Donghai JA Solar, which was investigated by European solar supply chain experts and found to have ceased production efforts in 2018. The Dept. of the Treasury and IRS have released additional guidance on the IRA's domestic content bonus, giving more weight to American-made solar wafers. A coalition of 17 attorneys general has asked Congress to protect the IRA, highlighting its benefits to states across the political spectrum. The Dept. of Labor has approved national guidelines for Registered Apprenticeship programs for the solar industry, and the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority has updated its Energy Storage Solutions program. Massachusetts Sen. James Eldridge and Rep. Jack Patrick Lewis have proposed two new bills to prioritize access to local solar projects and distributed energy resources, and two democratic state legislators in Washington State have introduced the Fair Access to Community Solar Act.

**Maximize Your Section 45X Tax Credit Ahead of Tax Season**
The section 45X tax credit, introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, aims to incentivize domestic clean energy manufacturing by rewarding manufacturers for producing qualifying advanced energy components. The credit is calculated based on specific metrics, such as production volume, electrical capacity, or cost, and is fully transferable, allowing manufacturers to sell unused credits for immediate cash benefits. The program offers full credit benefits through 2029, with a phased reduction beginning in 2030. To claim the credit, manufacturers must meet the IRS's definition of 'substantial transformation,' which requires significant processing of raw materials or components to become a new and distinct product. The credit is also subject to eligibility and domestic manufacturing requirements, including the sale of manufactured products to unrelated third-parties. The IRS has emphasized rigorous oversight of tax credits like section 45X to prevent misuse, and manufacturers should carefully evaluate their processes and maintain meticulous documentation to validate their eligibility.

**US state attorneys general urge Congress to keep IRA clean energy credits**
A coalition of 17 US state attorneys general has sent a letter to Congress urging them to retain investments under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Since the IRA's passage in 2022, businesses have invested nearly $500 billion in low-carbon energy and domestic manufacturing, with private investment exceeding public spending five- to six-fold. The coalition is concerned that repealing certain tax credits, such as the Section 45X credit for advanced manufacturing, the Section 48C credit for investments in advanced energy, and the Section 48E clean electricity investment credit, could stymie important projects and leave gaps where jobs and revenue streams were expected. The letter highlights several large projects already benefiting US communities, including a $150 million investment by Siemens in a power transformer factory in North Carolina, which will create over 550 jobs, and a $1.6 billion investment by Our Next Energy in an electric vehicle battery gigafactory in Michigan, which will employ over 2,000 people by 2027. 'Our nation is strengthening domestic energy security, reducing energy costs, diversifying our domestic energy resources, rebuilding our domestic manufacturing economy, bolstering and modernizing critical infrastructure, and creating well-paying jobs while simultaneously reducing harmful pollution,' the letter said.
