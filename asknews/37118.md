**After Operation Sindoor, India to give intel on Pak camps to anti-terror watchdog**
Following the success of Operation Sindoor, India plans to submit fresh intelligence to the FATF regarding terrorist infrastructure operating within Pakistan. This move comes after Pakistan's removal from the FATF Grey List in October 2022, but FATF emphasized the need for ongoing cooperation to strengthen Pakistan's AML/CFT framework. Historically, Pakistan has been greylisted multiple times due to strategic shortcomings in targeting UN-designated terrorist groups. India has already appealed to global economic bodies to stop funding Pakistan, claiming that Islamabad has used these funds to support terrorism. India intends to raise this issue in international forums, citing new evidence of continued state patronage of terror groups by Pakistan's government apparatus. As one source said, 'India plans to submit fresh intelligence to the global terrorist financing watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), regarding terrorist infrastructure operating within Pakistan.'

**India to apprise FATF of the latest evidence on terror infrastructure in Pakistan**
India is set to share the latest evidence of Pakistan's terror infrastructure with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in the coming days. According to a government official, the gruesome killings in Pahalgam have necessitated the sharing of information about the existing terror infrastructure in Pakistan with the international watchdog. India will highlight the latest evidence about the patronage being given by the Pakistani State machinery to banned terrorist organisations at all international forums. This comes after the FATF Plenary removed Pakistan from the Grey List in October 2022, but reminded them to continue working with the Asia Pacific Group (APG) to improve its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing system. Pakistan was previously placed on the Grey List in June 2018 and was told to implement an action plan, which included demonstrating effective action against UN-designated terror outfits. However, Pakistan failed to implement all the action points fully and was again retained on the Grey List on October 21, 2021. The FATF Plenary noted that Pakistan had completed 26 of the 27 action items in its 2018 plan, but was still required to demonstrate that terror financing investigations and prosecutions targeted senior functionaries and commanders of UN-designated terror outfits.

**IMF seeks roadmap as Pakistan moves to eliminate interest by 2028**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has emphasized the need for a clear strategy and guidelines to prepare market participants and investors for the removal of 'riba' (interest) from the Pakistan economy by January 2028. The IMF stated that 'the authorities' financial sector strategy should clearly identify and prepare for the implications of the mandated removal of 'riba' (interest) from the economy by January 2028.' The global lender also advised Pakistan's authorities to develop a strategic action plan that supports further capital market development and enhance Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) effectiveness.

**Auditor General’s 62nd Annual Report Exposes Nepal’s Deepening Fiscal Crisis**
The Auditor General's 62nd Annual Report has exposed Nepal's deepening fiscal crisis, revealing alarming trends of financial mismanagement, mounting government arrears, and institutional failures in oversight. The report highlights a significant rise in unpaid government arrears, which have ballooned to levels threatening the government's liquidity and creditworthiness. The Auditor General calls for immediate corrective measures to halt this growing problem, stressing that without robust fiscal discipline, Nepal's financial health will continue to deteriorate rapidly. The report also criticizes the lack of a systematic monitoring mechanism for arrears, the absence of coordinated efforts to reconcile arrears data across ministries and agencies, and the superficial parliamentary debates on financial reports. The Auditor General recommends establishing a centralized arrears management system, improving transparency in financial reporting, and enhancing parliamentary scrutiny. The report's findings have significant implications for Nepal's fiscal environment, contributing directly to liquidity crises, delays in project implementation, and disruptions in public services. The country's placement on the FATF grey list in early 2025 has compounded the challenges, restricting Nepal's access to international financial markets and increasing transaction costs. The Auditor General's report signals a challenging path ahead for economic reforms, and urgent action is needed to address both fiscal mismanagement and compliance gaps to restore Nepal's financial health and regain international confidence.

**South Africa Makes Strides Towards Removal From FATF Grey List**
The National Treasury has expressed satisfaction with South Africa's progress in addressing its anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) deficiencies.

According to the National Treasury, South Africa has now addressed or largely addressed 20 out of the 22 action items outlined in its Action Plan. The FATF Plenary noted South Africa's progress in its public statement, stating that the country has taken steps towards improving its AML/CFT regime, including demonstrating effective sanctions and access to accurate beneficial ownership information. However, the FATF emphasized that South Africa should continue to work on implementing its action plan to address its remaining strategic deficiency on demonstrating a sustained increase in investigations and prosecutions of serious and complex money laundering and terror financing activities. The National Treasury emphasized that South Africa continues to address both outstanding action items by June 2025 to enable an exit from grey listing by October 2025, stating, 'Our investigation and prosecution teams are working closely in terms of a prosecution-guided investigation strategy to ensure that we demonstrate the sustained progress as required by FATF.'

**Nepal Placed on 'Grey List' by FATF**
Nepal has been placed on the 'grey list' by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) due to lack of progress in implementing anti-money laundering laws, financial crime investigation, and other areas. FATF President Elisa De Anda Madrazo announced the decision at a press conference after the organization's second plenary meeting in Paris. According to her, 'This plenary has added the Democratic People's Republic of Laos and the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal to the list of countries subject to increased monitoring.' However, the Philippines has been removed from the list after two years. 'Countries subject to increased monitoring have made commitments to implement the action plan within the agreed timeframe,' she said.

**UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist**
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has removed the Philippines from its 'grey list' following a successful on-site visit, according to the organization. Meanwhile, Laos and Nepal have been added to the list of jurisdictions subject to increased monitoring. The FATF also reaffirmed its suspension of Russia's membership, citing the country's invasion of Ukraine. The FATF's 'grey list' marks jurisdictions with issues in their anti-money laundering (AML) rules, which can lead to financial issues such as reduced international investment and increased borrowing costs. The FATF's decision-making body, the FATF Plenary, meets three times a year to discuss key AML developments and updates to its 'Black' and 'Grey' lists.

**BSP hopeful of exit from FATF grey list**
The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) remains hopeful that the Philippines will exit the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list after the upcoming FATF Plenary and Working Group Meetings in Paris, France. BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr. said, 'We won't really know until the plenary in Paris. We are hopeful that we will hear good news.' The Philippines was placed on the grey list in June 2021 for inadequacies in its targeted financial sanctions framework, but has since addressed the 18 action plan items required to exit the list. FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo said that an onsite assessment will be conducted to verify the country's progress and decide on its exit from the grey list. The visit is expected to take place between now and February. If successful, the country will benefit from faster and cheaper remittances and other cross-border transactions.
