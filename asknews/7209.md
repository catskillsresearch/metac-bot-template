**Czech Minister of Justice Resigns Over Bitcoin Scandal**
Pavel Blazek, the Minister of Justice in the Czech Republic, has resigned due to criticism of his ministry's acceptance of a gift in the form of Bitcoin from a convicted felon. The ministry later sold the cryptocurrency for 1 billion Czech koruna (approximately $45 million). According to Blazek, he decided to resign 'I have decided to resign from the position of Minister of Justice. I am unaware of any illegal activity. However, I do not want to damage the reputation of the government or the ruling coalition,' Blazek wrote. The Czech media reported that the Bitcoin was received from a convicted narcotics trafficker. Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump believe that the price of Bitcoin will rise to $170,000 before the end of 2026. They made this statement during a presentation at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. According to Eric Trump, the growth in the price of Bitcoin is due to a high demand that currently exceeds supply. '0.1 BTC will soon be a significant asset,' he noted. The Trump sons also stated that more investors around the world are developing Bitcoin reserve strategies, including royal families and private offices.

**Mysterious Case of Torture for Bitcoins in New York**
A mysterious case of torture for bitcoins in New York has shaken the city. On May 23, a man, barefoot, ran to a police officer near Mulberry and Prince streets in the Soho neighborhood of southern Manhattan, claiming he had escaped from a luxurious house where he had been held for 17 days by two men. The police arrived and arrested John Woeltz, a 37-year-old 'crypto king' from Kentucky, who has been accused of 'kidnapping, criminal possession of a weapon, assault, and illegal detention.' His 24-year-old assistant was also detained, but not charged. A second suspect, William Duplessie, a 33-year-old from Miami and founder of the start-up Pangea Blockchain International, turned himself in on Tuesday and appeared in court on Friday wearing a prison uniform. According to the prosecution, the alleged victim, Italian cryptocurrency entrepreneur Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, visited the house rented by Woeltz, which he paid $30,000 a month, after arriving from Italy on May 6. Woeltz and Duplessie confiscated his electronic devices and passport and asked for the passwords to his bitcoin account. When he refused, they tortured him, beating him with a rifle, pointing the gun at his face, drugging him, and threatening to throw him off the balcony, according to the prosecution. Woeltz's lawyer, Wayne Ervin Gosnell, said, 'He is a 37-year-old man who has never been detained, has no criminal record, has a university degree in philosophy, and has been very successful in the technology sector.' The defense has requested Woeltz's conditional release in exchange for a $2 million bond and the commitment not to leave New York State. Both have pleaded not guilty. If found guilty of the main charge of kidnapping, they face a sentence of between 25 years and life in prison. 'Contrary to what has been reported, Woeltz does not have a private jet or a helicopter,' his lawyer said. However, according to the New York Post and the specialized website TMZ, which published images of the two suspects at the New York nightclub 'The Box,' they had a lavish lifestyle. 'These attacks are not new, but their frequency and cruelty are increasing,' said Adam Healy, president of Station70, a company specializing in cryptocurrency protection. 'Before, if you wanted to kidnap someone with a significant fortune and, for example, extract $10 million from their account, it was very difficult. You couldn't just go to the bank and withdraw the money. With cryptocurrencies, all you need is a username and a password,' he explained.

**Czech Opposition Demands Government Resignation Over Bitcoin Scandal**
The Czech opposition parties ANO and SPD are calling for the resignation of the government after the Ministry of Justice was involved in a scandal over a 1 billion crown (approximately 45.5 million dollar) bitcoin donation from a convicted drug trafficker, Tomas Irzikovsky. The Ministry received the donation from Irzikovsky, who was sentenced in 2017 for embezzlement, drug trafficking, and illegal possession of firearms. He was released from prison in 2021. 'We want the government to find enough self-analysis and resign,' said Karol Havlicek, deputy chairman of the ANO party. 'The current cabinet can remain in power until the elections, but it should not make any important decisions.' The opposition is considering holding an emergency session of the Chamber of Deputies on June 5 to pass a vote of no confidence in the government. Radim Fiala, deputy chairman of the ultra-right SPD party, said that they are ready to support the emergency session and the vote of no confidence.

**Czech Opposition Demands Government Resignation Over Bitcoin Scandal**
The Czech opposition parties ANO and SPD have called for the resignation of the government after the Ministry of Justice was embroiled in a scandal involving a donation of 1 billion crowns (approximately 45.5 million USD) in Bitcoin. The ministry received the donation from Tomáš Ižikovský, a convicted drug trafficker. Minister of Justice Pavel Blažek subsequently resigned. The opposition has now demanded the resignation of the entire government, calling for an extraordinary session of the Chamber of Deputies on June 5. 'We want the government to find enough self-reflection and resign,' said Karel Havlíček, deputy head of the ANO party. 'The current cabinet can remain in power until the elections, but it should not make any important decisions.' Havlíček added that they are seriously considering calling a session to vote on a motion of no confidence in the government. Radim Fiala, deputy chairman of the far-right SPD party, said that they are willing to support the holding of an extraordinary session and a vote of no confidence in the government. The essence of the scandal in the Czech Ministry of Justice is that Minister Pavel Blažek resigned due to a scandal involving Bitcoin, which the ministry accepted in the amount of 1 billion crowns. The cryptocurrency was donated to the ministry by Tomáš Ižikovský, who was convicted in 2017 of embezzlement, drug trafficking, and illegal possession of firearms. He was released from prison in 2021. Law enforcement confiscated his cryptocurrency wallet containing over 1560 Bitcoins, of which 468 he donated to the Ministry of Justice. The ministry then sold the cryptocurrency at auctions for 956.8 million crowns (approximately 45 million USD). The opposition has accused the Ministry of Justice of legitimizing money obtained through criminal activity.

**'Hay tantos elementos extraños': the mysterious case of bitcoin torture in New York**
A mysterious case of torture for bitcoins has shaken New York: the encounter between the 'crypto king' of Kentucky, his massive partner, and an Italian entrepreneur who was allegedly kidnapped and tortured to steal millions of dollars in bitcoins. According to the police, the Italian entrepreneur, Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, was held captive for 17 days in a luxurious house rented by John Woeltz, the 37-year-old 'crypto king of Kentucky', who has been accused of kidnapping, criminal possession of firearms, assault, and illegal detention.

Woeltz's lawyer, Wayne Ervin Gosnell, said in court that his client is a man with no prior convictions, a university degree in philosophy, and a successful career in the tech sector.

**Tchèque Justice Minister Resigns Amid Scandal Over Bitcoins**
Tchèque Justice Minister Pavel Blazek resigned after a scandal surrounding the sale of 500 bitcoins that previously belonged to a convicted drug trafficker. The minister had posted on social media that he was selling the bitcoins to raise funds for digitizing the justice system, but it was later revealed that the bitcoins were given to him by the convicted criminal Tomas Jirikovsky. Jirikovsky had been convicted in 2017 of 'embezzlement, drug trafficking, and illegal possession of arms' and had been released from prison in 2021. The minister accepted the gift without questioning its origin, saying 'I had no way of doing research on this matter and it didn't interest me years after the case.' He claimed that Jirikovsky wanted to 'repent' by making the donation. The police launched an investigation into the origin of the bitcoins, and the opposition cried out for a scandal of state. Under pressure and four months before the legislative elections, the minister announced his resignation, saying 'I have no knowledge of any illegal action. However, I do not want to harm the reputation of the government or that of the ruling coalition.'

**Tschechiens Justice Minister Resigns Over Bitcoin Payment Controversy**
Tschechiens Justizminister Pavel Blazek has resigned after criticism over a Bitcoin payment received by his ministry from a convicted drug dealer. Blazek stated, 'I have no knowledge of any unlawful action, but I want to protect the reputation of the government coalition.' The police are investigating the payment for suspected abuse of power and money laundering. The ministry received a payment of nearly 1 billion Czech crowns (approximately 40.13 million euros) in Bitcoins from a man who had served prison time for theft, drug trafficking, and illegal firearm possession. Blazek claimed that the ministry sold the Bitcoins at an auction and converted them into crowns, but it is unclear where the man obtained the money. Blazek said that it was never proven that the money came from criminal activities. Blazek's resignation comes as a new parliament is set to be elected in October.

**Malaysian Authorities Dismantle Large-Scale Illegal Bitcoin Mining Operation**
Malaysian authorities have dismantled a large-scale illegal Bitcoin mining operation that was secretly siphoning electricity from the local power grid. The operation, which was discovered during a joint operation with Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), had installed 45 machines in two locations, worth around 225,000 RM (approximately $52,149 USD). The police claim that the electricity installations in these properties were modified to bypass energy meters, allowing the illegal activity to go undetected while consuming a significant amount of energy from the grid. TNB estimates that the illegal miners were stealing electricity worth around 36,000 RM (approximately $8,343 USD) per month. The case is currently being investigated under articles 379 and 427 of the Malaysian Penal Code, which deal with theft and malicious damage to property, as well as article 37 of the Electricity Supply Act 1990. If convicted, the perpetrators could face up to five years in prison, a fine of up to 100,000 ringgit, or both. 'It was a great day,' said a police spokesperson, 'when we were able to shut down this illegal operation and prevent further energy theft.' According to TNB, the illegal mining has caused losses of over 440 million ringgit (approximately $101 million USD) for the company between 2018 and 2024. 'We will continue to work with the authorities to prevent such incidents and protect our energy infrastructure,' said a TNB spokesperson.

**Malaysian Authorities Dismantle Large-Scale Illegal Bitcoin Mining Operation**
Malaysian authorities have dismantled a large-scale illegal Bitcoin mining operation that was secretly siphoning electricity from the local grid. The operation, which was uncovered during a joint operation called 'Op Letrik', was estimated to have cost Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) over 100 million dollars in losses. The police discovered 45 Bitcoin mining machines and other related equipment at two locations, with a total infrastructure value of approximately 225,000 RM (52,149 USD). The operation was using trafficked properties to bypass electricity meters, allowing it to operate undetected while consuming a significant amount of energy. TNB estimates that the illegal miners were stealing around 36,000 RM (8,343 USD) of electricity per month. The case is currently under investigation under articles 379 and 427 of the Malaysian Penal Code, which cover theft and malicious acts causing damage, as well as article 37 of the 1990 Electricity Supply Act. If convicted, the perpetrators could face up to five years in prison, fines of up to 100,000 RM, or both. 'The attraction of high profits continues to attract criminals,' said a TNB spokesperson, highlighting the growing problem of illegal Bitcoin mining in Malaysia. The country has become a hub for illegal Bitcoin mining, with the practice causing widespread electricity theft. According to TNB, the illegal mining activities have cost the company over 440 million ringgits (101 million dollars) in losses between 2018 and 2024.

**Detective is charged with stealing Bitcoin now worth £3million**
A National Crime Agency detective, Paul Chowles, has been charged with stealing 50 Bitcoin worth nearly £60,000 in 2017, during an investigation into a clandestine online marketplace for illegal drugs called Silk Road 2.0. The Bitcoin would be worth over £3m at today's value. Chowles, 42, is accused of concealing, disguising, or converting criminal property and acquiring, using or possessing criminal property. He will appear at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on April 25, 2025. The investigation led to the jailing of Thomas White, the 'guiding mind' behind Silk Road 2.0, in 2019. White was found to have traded in illicit drugs and facilitated the trading by others through the medium of a clandestine online marketplace. He was sentenced to five years and four months in prison for running the site and possessing indecent images of children. Malcolm McHaffie, head of the Crown Prosecution Service Special Crime Division, said: 'We have authorised Merseyside Police to charge National Crime Agency officer Paul Chowles with 15 offences relating to the alleged theft of 50 Bitcoin... Mr Chowles, 42, is due to be charged with 11 offences of concealing, disguising, or converting criminal property, three offences of acquiring, using or possessing converting criminal property and a single count of theft.'

**US Clarifies Details on Cryptocurrency Reserve**
The US government has clarified details about its cryptocurrency reserve. In 2022, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) seized 94,636 BTC from Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan. Lichtenstein was convicted of hacking into the Bitfinex exchange, while Morgan was convicted of laundering stolen assets. The court ruled that Bitfinex would receive the seized Bitcoins, not their fiat equivalent. Bitfinex is the only identified victim, as the exchange has already compensated its affected clients. According to Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Research, only 86,000 of the 198,000 Bitcoins controlled by the US government can be included in the national cryptocurrency reserve. The remaining 112,000 BTC belong to the Bitfinex exchange and must be returned to it, as per a court ruling in January. Thorn noted, 'That's when the market will learn the difference between 'seized' and 'confiscated' assets.'

**Massive Seizure: $189 Million in Cryptocurrencies Confiscated in BitConnect Scandal**
The Indian Enforcement Directorate (ED) has seized $189 million in cryptocurrencies in a major crackdown on the BitConnect scandal. The investigation highlights the significant challenges in the cryptocurrency space and the widespread fraud that plagues the industry. BitConnect, which operated between November 2016 and January 2018, used a Ponzi scheme to lure investors with unrealistic promises of high returns. According to estimates, investors worldwide lost around $2.4 billion. The recent seizure of cryptocurrencies is a significant step in the fight against such scams, and it demonstrates the authorities' commitment to tackling illegal financial practices. The main actor, Satish Kumbhani, faces several charges, including conspiracy to commit fraud and international money laundering, and could face up to 70 years in prison if convicted. The main US intermediary, Glenn Arcaro, was sentenced to 38 months in prison in 2022 and must pay $17.6 million to the victims. The difficulty in pursuing digital assets lies in the use of the Dark Web, which is often used by criminals to hide illicit activities. Investigators had to analyze a large number of wallet addresses and transaction flows to reach the digital assets. These actions emphasize the importance of thorough education on safe investment practices and the detection of suspicious money flows. The ED's actions are not only a step towards justice for the victims but also a signal to potential investors to be vigilant and informed about the risks in the cryptocurrency space.

**Alexander Vinnik, 'Cryptocurrency Mafia' Figure, Released by US and Handed Over to Russia**
Alexander Vinnik, a 44-year-old Russian national considered a 'cryptocurrency mafia' figure, has been released by the US and handed over to Russia. He was responsible for one of the largest cryptocurrency exchange platforms used by cybercriminals, BTC-e, between 2011 and 2017. Vinnik was detained in Greece in 2017 on US charges of laundering €4 billion through Bitcoin. He was also linked to the Mt. Gox platform, which was hacked in 2014. As part of a deal for his release, Vinnik will leave behind $100 million in digital assets. The US had accused Vinnik of crimes including identity theft, drug trafficking, and money laundering, and he had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering in May 2024. He faced nearly 20 years in prison and was awaiting sentencing in January 2025, but a federal judge delayed the sentence until June 2025 without explanation. Vinnik had gone on a hunger strike in 2018 to protest his detention. The US had extradited Vinnik to France, where he was convicted of capital flight in 2022, and later to the US. US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz called the move a 'good faith gesture' from Russia, suggesting that a positive relationship may be developing. Donald Trump had said that Russia had not asked for 'anything more' in exchange for releasing Fogel, a US professor detained by Russia in 2021 for possessing illegal drugs.

**Businessman Firoz Patel Sentenced to Additional Prison Time for Hiding Cryptocurrency**
Firoz Patel, a 50-year-old businessman from Montreal, has been sentenced to an additional 41 months in prison in the United States for attempting to hide 43 million dollars in bitcoins from authorities. This sentence is in addition to a previous conviction for money laundering. Patel must also repay the total amount of hidden cryptocurrency. Patel was previously convicted in 2020 to 36 months in prison for operating Payza, an online payment platform that operated illegally for six years. His brother, Ferhan Patel, was also sentenced in relation to this case. According to US authorities, Payza facilitated transactions worth over 250 million dollars, used by merchants linked to scams, money laundering, child pornography distribution, and steroid sales. Patel was required to turn over all profits from his illicit activities as part of his guilty plea, but attempted to hide 450 bitcoins, initially valued at 24 million dollars, by transferring them to an account in his father's name. With the increase in cryptocurrency value, these assets reached 43 million dollars. In an attempt to evade authorities, Patel claimed in an email that he did not possess funds in his name. However, before entering prison, he attempted to transfer the bitcoins to other cryptocurrency platforms on two occasions. These transactions were identified as suspicious and the funds were frozen. During the trial, US prosecutors described Patel as a 'serial liar and cheat' and highlighted his recidivism in financial crimes. A US Department of Homeland Security agent stated that Payza had become the 'preferred tool for criminals' to move money of illicit origin. With the new sentence, Patel will spend more time in prison and must repay the hidden funds, closing another chapter in his history of evasion and financial fraud.
