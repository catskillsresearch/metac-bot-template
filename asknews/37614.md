**Republican turned Democrat David Jolly enters Florida governor's race - UPI.com**
Former Republican-turned Democrat Rep. David Jolly, D-Florida, has announced his candidacy for the 2026 Florida governor's race. Despite being at a fundraising disadvantage and outnumbered by registered Republicans, Jolly aims to win the support of nonpartisan voters who are disillusioned with the current political climate. He has proposed policies such as lower corporate taxes, gun safety legislation, affordable housing, and restructuring Florida's catastrophe insurance. Jolly said, 'I'm for lower corporate taxes because I think it leads to greater economic growth, but I'm more for gun safety legislation because I think that reduces violence in our state.' He believes Florida is in a crisis of 'right versus wrong,' not just 'right versus left.'

**David Jolly Announces Democratic Candidacy for Florida Governor**
David Jolly, a 52-year-old former Republican congressman, has announced his candidacy as a Democrat to govern Florida. Jolly, who represented Florida's 13th Congressional District from 2014 to 2017, left the Republican Party in 2018 due to disagreements with Donald Trump's ideas. Despite the challenges Democrats face in winning the election next year, Jolly decided to run as the Democratic candidate. 'Let's end the politics of division and return Florida to voters who simply want a working economy, the best education system in the world, safe communities, and a government that stays out of our medical consultations and family decisions,' he said. When asked about his past as a Republican, Jolly stated that he never fully agreed with the party's principles and decided to end his relationship with them. 'It cost me to exercise those values in the Republican Party. The real registration as a Democrat was not a change. It was a formality,' he said. Jolly's mission to become the governor of Florida is complicated, as Republicans have made it a stronghold for over two decades. However, Jolly's path is clear after Jason William Barnet Pizzo, a former state senator, announced his candidacy as an independent candidate. 'We can clean up corruption in Tallahassee. It's time for women and doctors to make healthcare decisions, not politicians. We can resolve affordability crises, reduce costs, and lower insurance rates,' Jolly warns on his website.

**Former Republican Congressman David Jolly to Run for Florida Governor as Democrat**
Former Republican congressman David Jolly has announced his candidacy for governor of Florida as a Democrat. Jolly, a critic of Donald Trump, believes that issues such as affordability, public school funding, and campaign finance reform will resonate with voters in 2026. He predicts that the elections next year will signal a national change. 'I think the Republicans in Tallahassee have gone too far in dividing us. I think we should take the politicians out of the classrooms and the doctor's offices,' said Jolly. 'I think many people in Florida, even some Republicans, now understand that the cultural wars have gone too far,' he added. Jolly, a lawyer and former state representative, has undergone a political evolution that led him to leave the Republican Party in 2018 and become an independent and later a registered Democrat. He has gained a national profile as an anti-Trump commentator on MSNBC. Jolly said he has considered himself 'part of the Democratic coalition' for about five years and believes in what he considers the 'fundamental values' of the party: that government can help people, that the economy should be 'just' for all, and that immigrants should be celebrated. 'It cost me to exercise those values in the Republican Party,' Jolly said, and continued: 'Registering as a Democrat was not a radical change. It was a formality.' Jolly has distanced himself from his former party on the issue of immigration, while Florida lawmakers rush to help Trump fulfill his promise of mass deportations. Jolly harshly criticized Republicans, who, according to him, have 'combined immigration and crime,' which he described as incorrect and immoral.

**Former U.S. Rep. David Jolly announces run for Florida governor**
Former U.S. Rep. David Jolly announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Florida governor, citing the state's affordability crisis as a major issue. Jolly stated, 'We have an affordability crisis in Florida driven by an insurance crisis that continues to worsen in the face of complete neglect by Tallahassee. We have abandoned public education, and we've allowed corruption to run rampant. It's time for a change.' Despite the long odds, Jolly will face competition from other candidates, including Southwest Florida Congressman Byron Donalds, who has already launched his campaign for the GOP nomination, and Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, who is considering a run. Florida's primary election is scheduled for August 18, 2026, with the general election on November 3, 2026.

**'Radical Leftist': Byron Donalds Laughs Off Never Trumper Ex-GOP Rep Running For FL Gov As Dem**
Former Republican Rep. David Jolly announced his candidacy for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race as a Democrat. Jolly, a longtime critic of President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, stated that Florida is in crisis and needs a change. Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds, the Trump-endorsed frontrunner, referred to Jolly as 'an anti-Trump, radical leftist' and said he is 'completely out of touch with Florida's voters and our values.' Donalds added that he will fight side by side with Trump to protect Florida families and Make America Great Again. The Florida Republican Party also criticized Jolly, calling him a 'flip-flopping political relic' and stating that Floridians won't be swayed by his candidacy.

**What Pinellas' David Jolly brings to Florida's governor race | Column**
David Jolly, a former congressman from Pinellas County, has announced his candidacy for Florida governor in 2026. Jolly, who switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party in April, is running on a moderate agenda that focuses on affordability, education, and economic growth. He has proposed reforms such as creating a state catastrophic fund to ease insurance premiums and giving Florida students better access to state colleges and universities. Jolly's appeal lies in his ability to work across the aisle and build a coalition to address concerns across a broad front. However, his biggest challenge is his own party, as registered Republicans outnumber Democrats in Florida. Jolly will need to break through the new mediascape and convince Democrats that he is genuinely one with them. As Jolly said, 'I've been out of politics long enough to tell the truth. Some of our leaders escalate problems instead of de-escalating them. We have to de-escalate division.'

**Republican turncoat announces Democrat bid for Florida governor's seat | Blaze Media**
Former Republican David Jolly, who represented the Tampa Bay area in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2014 to 2017, has announced his bid for the Florida governor's seat in 2026 as a Democrat. Jolly, who was an independent until recently, stated that he brings a different value set to the Democratic Party, including support for marriage equality, gun control, climate science, and campaign finance reform. According to Jolly, 'The actual registration as a Democrat wasn't a pivot. It was a kind of formality.' He believes the Democratic Party is the right 'vessel' to help him address the 'affordability crisis' in Florida, which he attributes to an insurance crisis, neglected public education, and corruption. Jolly's challenge to the Republican stronghold in Florida comes at a time when the Democratic Party faces uncertainty, with a reported 1.2-1.3 million more registered Republicans than Democrats in the state.

**David Jolly, a Trump critic and former GOP congressman, to run for Florida governor as a Democrat**
Former Republican congressman David Jolly has announced his bid to run for Florida governor as a Democrat. Jolly, a vocal critic of Donald Trump, believes that issues such as affordability, funding public schools, and strengthening campaign finance and ethics laws will resonate with all voters in 2026. He predicts that elections next year will herald nationwide change. Jolly has undergone a political evolution, leaving the Republican Party in 2018 to become an independent and then a registered Democrat. He has broken from his old party on immigration, criticizing Republicans for 'conflating immigration and crime.' Jolly's gubernatorial run as a Democrat draws comparisons to the failed bid of former Republican congressman-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist. 'I actually think Republicans in Tallahassee have gone too far in dividing us,' Jolly said. 'I think we should get politicians out of the classrooms, out of the doctor's offices.'

**Former Republican congressman-turned-Democrat launches bid for governor in push to flip red-state Florida**
Former Republican congressman David Jolly has announced his candidacy for governor in Florida as a Democrat, aiming to end the party's losing streak in the state. Jolly, who won election and re-election to Congress as a Republican a decade ago, pointed to the state's affordability crisis as a key issue, saying, 'It's been even longer since we had an affordability crisis like we're experiencing right now. That's how.' He argued that the crisis has 'largely been caused by Republican neglect that I don't believe Republicans will address and that our campaign will.' Jolly acknowledged the GOP's voter registration advantage in Florida but said, 'Let's be honest about the math... There aren't enough Democratic votes in Florida for a Democratic governor to just win with their own party. We have to build a coalition that includes independents and commonsense Republicans.' He highlighted his own transition from Republican to Democrat, saying, 'David Jolley left the party... I've grown. I've changed.' Florida Republicans predict Jolly will become the latest in a line of defeated Democrat gubernatorial candidates.

Morgan believes a new party should focus on reducing economic inequality and helping everyday people. He has clashed with Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Republicans over his financial backing and advocacy of several ballot initiatives. Morgan is uncertain about running for governor, but if he does, it will be under a new party he is planning to launch.

**John Morgan jokes, curses, talks third-party gubernatorial run at Capital Tiger Bay Club ‚Ä¢ Florida Phoenix**
Trial attorney John Morgan expressed interest in running for governor, citing his experience with financing constitutional amendments and his name recognition as the founder of Morgan & Morgan law firm. Morgan also plans to form a third party in Florida, arguing that the existing parties have been hijacked by factions that don't represent their members. He criticized Republicans for being controlled by Donald Trump supporters and Democrats for being influenced by progressives and socialists. Morgan said he will choose the party's name through a competition with a cash prize and has already brought in a lawyer to help draft the paperwork. He also weighed in on Florida's current political events, taking shots at Governor DeSantis and saying the 2023 insurance changes were a 'money grab' for the governor to run for president. Morgan declared the Democratic Party of Florida dead and blamed former Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum for its demise. He also suggested that the Legislature shouldn't meet every year and questioned the need for the Governor's Mansion, lieutenant governor, and agriculture commissioner. Morgan predicted that the latest effort to legalize marijuana in Florida will pass despite the constitutional ballot changes recently passed by the Legislature and signed into law by DeSantis. 'We're stuck in the middle, and we don't have a voice, any voice, but yet, we have a lot to say, but we're paralyzed,' Morgan said. 'So my belief is this: I believe that we need a third party.'
