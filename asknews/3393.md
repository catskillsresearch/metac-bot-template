**Colombia: Scientists Uncover Enigmatic People Who Vanished 6,000 Years Ago**
Scientists from the University of Tubinga, the Center for Human Evolution and Paleoenvironment, and the National University of Colombia have successfully sequenced the DNA of ancient inhabitants of the Bogotá region, revealing the existence of an enigmatic people who flourished 6,000 years ago and then vanished completely. The group left no genetic legacy, no direct descendants, and no signs of intermarriage with subsequent populations. It's as if they were erased from history, leaving only this archaeological enigma in the heart of the Colombian Andes. The researchers analyzed the DNA of 21 individuals from five archaeological sites in the highlands, spanning almost 6,000 years. The oldest samples come from the Checua excavations, north of Bogotá, at an altitude of 3,000 meters. 'These are the first ancient human genomes from Colombia to be published,' says Professor Cosimo Posth, senior author of the study, published in Science Advances. The team extracted genetic material from bones and teeth dating back 6,000 years to just before the Spanish colonization. The most surprising aspect of the discovery is not just the age of the remains but what they reveal about the fate of their owners. The oldest individuals from Checua belonged to a small population of hunter-gatherers representing 'a previously unknown basal lineage,' according to the study. These people were part of the initial expansion that quickly populated South America from the north. However, around 2,000 years ago, these first inhabitants simply disappeared. Not gradually, not through intermarriage with other groups, but completely and radically. 'We couldn't find descendants of these first hunter-gatherers from the Colombian highlands: the genes didn't transmit,' explains Kim-Louise Krettek, first author of the study, in a statement from the University of Tubinga. 'That means there was a complete exchange of the population.' In place of the ancient hunter-gatherers, around 2,000 years ago, a completely different group arrived. These new inhabitants came from Central America and brought not only a distinct genetics but also important cultural innovations such as ceramics and, probably, the Chibcha languages still spoken in parts of Central America. Unlike their predecessors, these new inhabitants left visible genetic traces until the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century, developing the Muisca culture that the conquistadors found upon arrival. 'In addition to technological developments like ceramics, the people of this second migration probably also brought the Chibcha languages to what is now Colombia,' notes Andrea Casas-Vargas, co-author of the study from the National University of Colombia, according to the statement. What makes this discovery exceptional is the rarity of the phenomenon. 'That the genetic traces of the original population disappear completely is unusual, especially in South America,' highlights Casas-Vargas. In other regions of the continent, such as the Andes and the southern cone, a strong genetic continuity has been observed over long periods, even when significant cultural changes occurred. In this sense, the study raises unsettling questions: what caused the complete disappearance of the first population? The researchers do not speculate on what caused the disappearance of the first inhabitants, although conflicts or diseases could be among the possible explanations. It is a mystery that future research will have to solve. The research team took special care in the human aspect of their work. Before publishing their conclusions, they interacted with the Muisca Indigenous Guard, the current descendants of the culture that inhabited the region when the Spanish arrived. 'The questions about history and origins touch a sensitive area of the indigenous population's self-perception and identity,' recognizes Posth. 'The genetic disposition should not be considered equal to cultural identity. As scientists addressing relevant issues for the indigenous communities of Colombia, we respect and value the richness of community knowledge,' adds.

**Ancient Mummy Discovery Reveals Secrets of Tibet's Mysterious Past**
Scientists have discovered a 7,100-year-old female mummy in southwestern China, shedding light on the mysterious past of Tibet. The woman's skeleton was found without any burial items, but radiocarbon dating revealed that she lived around 7,100 years ago. Analysis of her DNA showed that her ancestors belonged to a population that separated from others around 40,000 years ago. This 'ghost population' had not been previously recorded in genomic data. The findings suggest that the woman's ancestors were isolated for a long time before intermingling with Eastern Asian populations, contributing to the genetic heritage of Tibetans. However, researchers emphasize the need for further excavations and analysis to confirm the connection between this ancient lineage and modern Tibetans. This discovery expands our understanding of the genetic history of Central and Eastern Asia and raises new questions about ancient migrations and interactions.

**The Secret to Jeanne Calment's Record-Breaking Longevity**
Jeanne Calment, the verified oldest person in history, lived an impressive 122 years and 164 days, defying modern concepts of health and well-being. Born in 1875 in France, Jeanne lived through three centuries of social, cultural, and technological transformations, becoming a symbol of longevity. Her unconventional lifestyle, as described in the book 'Jeanne Calment, the Secret of Longevity Unravelled', included smoking until the age of 117, drinking red wine every day, eating over a kilogram of chocolate per week, and claiming to hate any type of physical exercise. Despite her lifestyle, which would be considered unhealthy today, Jeanne lived with intensity, sweetness, and freedom, and became an icon of human longevity. When asked about her secret to longevity, Jeanne humorously replied, 'I have only one wrinkle, and I'm sitting on it.' Specialists suggest that genetic and psychological factors may have played a significant role in her longevity, and that her positive attitude, lack of constant stress, and ability to maintain a good sense of humor may have been as important as any strict diet or exercise routine.

**Jeanne Calment: The Woman with the Longest Verified Human Lifespan**
Jeanne Calment, born on February 21, 1875, in Arlés, France, holds the record for the longest verified human lifespan at 122 years and 164 days, until her death on August 4, 1997. Her life spanned three centuries, making her a unique case in demographic records. Calment attributed her longevity to a combination of factors, including a diet rich in olive oil, moderate consumption of Port wine, and an active lifestyle. She practiced sports like tennis, swimming, and cycling until advanced ages, and was seen riding a bicycle at 100 years old. She also smoked two cigarettes a day until age 117 and regularly consumed chocolate. Her sense of humor and relaxed philosophy of life were notable. Calment's longevity drew the attention of scientists and demographers, and she participated in studies on aging in her later years, contributing to the understanding of genetics and environmental factors in longevity. Her record remains unbroken, and her case continues to be a milestone in human longevity, inspiring both scientists and those seeking to understand the art of living well.

**Brazilian Woman, 120, Seeks to Prove Age for Guinness Record**
Deolira Glicéria Pedro da Silva, a 120-year-old Brazilian woman, is attempting to prove her age to enter the Guinness Book of Records. Despite her identity confirming her birth year as 1905, the officialization of her record faces challenges. To ensure her inclusion in the list of the world's oldest people, she needs to present additional documents. However, original records were lost in a flood in 1977, making the process difficult. According to Dr. Juair Abreu Pereira, who has been following her case for three years, they are searching for documents in local churches. If her proof is accepted, she would surpass the record of Jeanne Calment, a French woman who lived to be 122 years old. Deolira also participates in a study by the University of São Paulo called 'DNA Longevo', which aims to understand the genetic factors that contribute to a long and healthy life.

**Jeanne Calment: The Oldest Person in History Makes a Clever Deal**
Jeanne Calment, the oldest person in recorded history, lived a life of luxury in her own home, thanks to a clever deal she made with her lawyer, Andre-Francois Raffray. Born in France on February 21, 1875, Jeanne lived an astonishing 122 years and 164 days. Raffray, who was half her age, thought he had made a good deal when he agreed to pay her 2,500 francs (approximately $415) per month for as long as she lived in her apartment. However, Jeanne outlived Raffray by 32 years, and he ended up paying her a sum more than twice the value of the apartment. As Jeanne said, 'In life, sometimes you have to make bad deals.'

**Jeanne Calment: The Oldest Person in History Made a Clever Deal with Her Lawyer**
Jeanne Calment, the oldest person in history, lived a luxurious life in her apartment above her husband's fabric store, with servants who cooked and cleaned for her. She had no living heirs, having lost her daughter at 36 and her grandson at 37. At 90, in 1965, she made a deal with her lawyer, André-François Raffray, that she would sell him her apartment if she could live in it until the end of her life. He agreed to pay her 2,500 francs (around $415) per month until her death, after which he would take ownership of the apartment and move in. Calment lived for another 32 years, longer than any other person in history, and longer than Raffray, who died in 1995 at 77. Calment herself moved to a nursing home at 110 and lived another nearly three years, until her death in 1997. Raffray's family continued to pay her the monthly sum after his death, and she ultimately received a sum more than double the value of the apartment. As she once said, 'In life, one sometimes has to make bad deals.'

Jeanne Calment from France held the Guinness World Record for the oldest person ever for nearly three decades, living to the age of 122 years and 164 days. In 1965, she made a deal with a lawyer, André-François Raffray, to receive 2,500 francs monthly for the next 30 years of her life. After Raffray's death in 1995, his family continued to pay her the monthly amount, which ultimately totaled double the value of her house. Jeanne attributed her long life to a diet rich in olive oil, despite being a smoker for almost a century. She lived a life of luxury, with a large apartment and helpers, and enjoyed various hobbies such as fencing, hunting, and music. According to Guinness World Records, Jeanne remains the only person on record to have lived for over 120 years.

**World's oldest ever person said 'gold' food helped her live to 122**
Jeanne Calment, a French woman, holds the record for the oldest verified person, living an extraordinary 122 years and 164 days. She attributed her longevity to a diverse diet, including olive oil, port, and chocolate, as well as her active lifestyle and serene disposition. Calment's diet was rich in monounsaturated fats and antioxidants, which have been linked to improved quality of life, increased lifespan, and decreased mortality rates. According to Surrey Live, she said, 'I am going to live to 150.' While port and chocolate may not be the healthiest choices, olive oil is a staple in the Mediterranean diet and has been shown to have numerous health benefits, including reducing cardiovascular risk, supporting brain health, and managing body-fat composition. Calment's story is an inspiration to many, and her legacy continues to be celebrated.
