**Uber Endures Stricter Controls in Florida: Mandatory Identity Verification and Anti-Fraud Measures**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has signed legislation that will implement significant changes for drivers of platforms like Uber and Lyft starting July 1, 2025. The law aims to strengthen safety in shared transportation and punish identity theft more severely. According to the bill 1525, impersonating a driver for these platforms will be a second-degree misdemeanor, and if another crime is committed, it will be elevated to a third-degree felony. This measure aims to protect both users and drivers. The law also introduces new requirements for drivers, including more rigorous training and documentation. Companies must provide educational materials, and the Commission for Transportation Disadvantaged can allocate funds to alternative providers. The law clarifies that these services will not be considered public or traditional private transportation, defining their legal and operational framework in Florida. In response to the new legislation in Florida, Uber has implemented significant improvements to its security protocols. Since 2024, the company has launched a pilot program in Miami to strengthen user identity verification. This system uses reliable external databases to match information and awards a verification badge to profiles that meet the requirements. Users can also send official documents, such as passports or driver's licenses, to complete the validation. Uber also facilitates the reporting of suspicious behavior, allowing direct calls to 911 from the app, reports to Crime Stoppers, and the submission of incidents from the platform. The legislation signed by Governor Ron DeSantis aims to increase confidence in shared transportation and establish clear responsibilities for drivers and companies, adapting the rules to the current digital security and authenticity challenges in Florida.

**A top DeSantis aide could become Florida's next education commissioner**
Anastasios I. Kamoutsas, a top aide to Gov. Ron DeSantis, is emerging as a leading candidate to replace Manny Diaz Jr. as Florida's education commissioner. Kamoutsas, known as 'Stasi,' has been involved in education issues for years, including ending school mask mandates and revamping the state's higher education system. Richard Corcoran, a former education commissioner, praised Kamoutsas, saying, 'If it's education policy in the state of Florida over the last seven years, Stasi's fingerprints are there.' Diaz, who is leaving the post in July, said he would endorse Kamoutsas as his replacement, citing his institutional knowledge and ability to take the role. Kamoutsas has been viewed as a loyal DeSantis supporter, but some Democrats are not familiar with him. The State Board has not revealed who it is considering for the post.

**As final vote nears, fate of UF's next president no sure thing**
Santa Ono faces a final vote to become the University of Florida's next president, but his fate is uncertain due to intense lobbying against him from conservative politicians and activists. Despite Gov. Ron DeSantis' initial support, he has remained neutral on the issue, saying 'vote your conscience.' The 17-member state Board of Governors will interview Ono ahead of its vote, and if they block him, it would be the first time in its 22-year history that it had overruled a college's trustees over a leadership pick. Ono's compensation package, worth over $15 million over five years, will also be discussed. Some board members, including U.S. Rep. Gregory Steube and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, have expressed concerns about Ono's past comments on diversity initiatives and climate change, while others, like outgoing Commissioner of Education Manny Diaz, remain unconvinced and are waiting for Ono's interview to make their decision.

**Kazakhstan's President Tokayev to Step Down in 2029**
Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced in an interview with Al Jazeera that he will step down from his position in 2029. According to Tokayev, this decision is a personal one and 'a requirement of the people'. Tokayev emphasized that 'the president is not a god's appointee, but a manager hired by the people.' Tokayev has been president since March 2019, succeeding Nursultan Nazarbayev, who ruled for nearly 30 years. He was re-elected in 2022 with 81.3% of the vote. Under the new Constitution, the head of state is elected for a single seven-year term without the possibility of re-election. If Tokayev steps down in 2029, Kazakhstan can expect its first planned and predictable transfer of power in years, which may strengthen the country's image as a stabilizing factor in Central Asia.'

**Florida Introduces New Requirement for Driver's License**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has approved a new law, SB 994, which introduces a new requirement for obtaining a driver's license in the state. Starting July 1, 2025, first-time applicants will need to complete a traffic education course that teaches the rules of the road and the dangers of driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The goal is to make drivers more responsible and reduce accidents on Florida's roads. The law applies to adults over 18 who apply for a license, but those who already have a valid license from another state or have completed a similar course are exempt. Teenagers from 15 years old will also need to complete a standardized course to obtain their learner's permit. The course must meet the standards of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) and include education on substance abuse. Senator Danny Collins proposed the law, which was supported by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and was signed by Governor DeSantis on May 30, 2024. The law will take effect on July 1, 2025.

**Kazakhstan's President Tokayev Announces 2029 Departure**
Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced that he will step down from his position in 2029. According to Tokayev, this decision aligns with both public expectations and his personal choice. 'In 2029, I will have announced my resignation. Because it is the demand of my people and my personal choice,' he said. Tokayev emphasized that he views the role of the president as that of a state manager. 'I am convinced that the president of any country, including my own, is a state manager, not a messenger of God. He is a state manager hired by his own people for a term of seven years,' he explained. Tokayev has been in office since March 20, 2019, after the resignation of Nursultan Nazarbayev. He won the presidential election in June 2019 with over 70% of the vote. Following the events of January 2022, Tokayev announced that he would hold new presidential elections. He was first elected to a seven-year term without the possibility of re-election, which he also won with 81.31% of the vote. Tokayev has previously stated that he considers a seven-year term sufficient for implementing his pre-election program and conducting key reforms.

**Budget deal Take Two: Florida House, Senate agree on 'framework' amid raucous session**
Florida House and Senate leaders, Daniel Perez and Ben Albritton, have reached an agreement on a 'framework' for the 2025-2026 budget, which includes a $900 million tax cut through eliminating a tax on commercial leases, $350 million in permanent sales tax exemptions, $250 million in debt reduction, and $750 million in annual payments into a state rainy-day fund. According to Albritton, the framework provides for a 'fiscally responsible, balanced budget that reduces state spending, lowers per capita spending, and reduces the growth of state bureaucracy.' Conference committees will start meeting on Tuesday to negotiate details of the budget, and unresolved issues will be sent to House Budget Chairman Lawrence McClure and Senate Appropriations Chairman Ed Hooper for further negotiations. The fiscal year will start July 1, giving Gov. Ron DeSantis two weeks to use his line-item veto authority.

**DeSantis Signs Law Limiting Florida Contracts with 'Countries of Concern'**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a new law that declares certain countries as 'foreign countries of concern', which will impact the signing and renewal of public contracts with companies controlled by their governments. According to the law, which will take effect on July 1, 2025, the goal is to limit foreign influence in sensitive sectors such as genetic research, public contracts, and health licenses. The law prohibits Florida health department-regulated laboratories from using software developed in the mentioned countries or by state-owned companies or companies based in those territories. DeSantis' administration aims to prevent potential infiltrations or vulnerabilities that could affect Florida's government systems, ensuring that sensitive technologies are not controlled by governments that, according to Florida authorities, pose a risk to national or cyber security, as stated by DeSantis, 'We must take steps to protect our state's critical infrastructure and prevent foreign adversaries from infiltrating our systems.'

**Gov. Ron DeSantis Signs Bill Recognizing Gold, Silver as Legal Tender in Florida**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a bill, HB 999, recognizing gold and silver as legal tender in the state. This makes Florida the 11th state to enact such laws, with several others considering similar measures. According to State Rep. Bill Bankson, the legislation aims to 'eliminate the tax burden and make it a functional means of transaction between willing parties.' DeSantis stated that 'outdated regulations and unnecessary sales taxes' have prevented many Floridians from entering the gold and silver markets for years. The law must still be ratified by the state legislature and would take effect on July 1, 2026, if approved.

**AFT official on FAMU hire:  ‘They’re trying to run our minds’ - The Carolina Peacemaker**
Fredrick C. Ingram, secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of Teachers, has expressed concerns about the hiring of Marva Johnson by Florida A&M University. Ingram believes that Johnson's appointment is a 'calculated political strategy' to control Black institutions and influence how future generations think. He stated, 'They are trying to change the mindset, get into the brain trust of young people to try and change history, to try and change a cultural mindset.' Ingram criticized the FAMU board of trustees for selecting Johnson, a longtime ally of Gov. Ron DeSantis, despite widespread protests and concerns about her qualifications. He pointed out that Johnson has no teaching experience and has been appointed to various boards by conservative governors. Ingram warned that Johnson's appointment is not just about a single hire, but about gaining control over institutions that have historically developed Black leadership. He stated, 'They’re not trying to simply run schools — they’re trying to run our minds.' Ingram called on the community to keep a watchful eye and loud voice going to make change, and questioned whether Johnson will resist or give in to pressure from the governor's office or the President of the United States.

**Ron DeSantis weighs his political future post-Trump - Washington Examiner**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's chances of running for the presidency in 2028 are uncertain, according to several Republican strategists. DeSantis's wife, Casey, is rumored to be considering a run for governor in 2026, which could create tension with Donald Trump, who has endorsed a rival candidate. A former DeSantis aide said that encouraging his wife to run would be an 'unforced error' that would hinder his chances. DeSantis has been trying to repair his relationship with Trump, but several strategists believe that he may have missed his moment to win the White House. A March survey shows JD Vance with a significant lead among GOP primary voters, with DeSantis tied for second place at 7%. DeSantis's 2024 campaign was marred by infighting, embarrassing campaign resets, and a lack of coherent messaging, and he may not have the finances to run a serious challenge in 2028.

**DeSantis Plots a Comeback**
Ron DeSantis, the former presidential candidate, is attempting a comeback to the White House. Despite his disastrous 2024 campaign, DeSantis' team is working to make him a contender for 2028. However, this move may actually harm his chances and show that he didn't learn from his previous failure. DeSantis' wife, Casey, is being considered as his chief advisor, and the couple has played golf with Donald Trump, who doesn't appear to hold a grudge. However, taking on Andrew Tate, a figure associated with Trump, could be a mistake, as it may be perceived as an attack on Trump himself. DeSantis needs to focus on making himself more MAGA and ignoring the online backlash, rather than engaging in proxy battles with Trump. Despite this, DeSantis has reasons to be optimistic, as Trump may stay out of the Florida race, giving Casey a strong chance in 2026 and Ron a shot at the White House in 2028.

**DeSantis Promotes Wife as Next Governor of Florida, Potentially Creating Showdown with Trump**
As Ron DeSantis approaches the end of his second term as Governor of Florida, he has spoken about who will succeed him in 2026: his wife and mother of three, Casey DeSantis. He is also trying to make a case for her to be chosen as the next governor by President Donald Trump. DeSantis praised his wife as a 'strong-willed conservative' who will build on his legacy, saying she can attract even more voters than he did, according to the Associated Press. DeSantis won a landslide re-election in 2022 with a nearly 20-point margin. 'She's got, I think, the spirit and commitment to conservative principles,' DeSantis said of his wife. His comments came days after Trump endorsed a different Republican candidate, Byron Donalds, for governor of Florida. 'Byron Donalds would be a great and powerful governor of Florida, and if he decides to run, he will have my full and unconditional support,' Trump wrote on social media. 'Run, Byron, run,' he added, referencing a cult classic movie. DeSantis' comments create a potential showdown between the governor and the head of the White House, who defeated him in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. DeSantis, who is term-limited, may run for president again in 2028 and is working to repair his relationship with Trump. Former Congressman Matt Gaetz, another Trump ally, criticized DeSantis' comments on X, saying, 'Dude, it hurts to see this. Governor DeSantis, don't you remember when you and I worked together to get you elected in 2018? We were literally your debate prep team.'
