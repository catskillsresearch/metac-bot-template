**China's Automotive Market: A War Without Rules**
The Chinese automotive market is becoming increasingly competitive, with a clear divide between companies producing smart EVs and others. The gap between electric and gasoline-powered cars is even larger. As a result, Chinese automakers are entering a period of brutal competition. To stay ahead, companies must offer more than just standard features and develop sophisticated autonomous driving software, such as large language models based on artificial intelligence. Chinese groups are doubling down on these advanced software systems for driver assistance, aiming to dominate the premium market segment, previously dominated by foreign traditional groups. For example, BYD sold 416,000 electric vehicles in the first quarter of 2025, a 39% increase from the previous year, while Tesla sold 337,000 vehicles worldwide in the same period, a significant decrease from the 390,000 expected by analysts and the 387,000 sold in the previous year. Given the internal competition in China, foreign brands will face the challenge of keeping pace with the local market. The share of foreign automakers in China has reached a historic low of 31% in the first two months of 2025, with a loss of one-third of the market since 2020. According to UBS, if this percentage were to drop to 20%, these same companies could find themselves with a surplus of 10 million vehicles and financial difficulties. 'It's a war without rules,' said an analyst, 'and only the strongest will survive.'

**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**China's Electric Vehicle Market Faces Challenges as Price Wars Intensify**
The Chinese government has urged automakers to stop price wars that threaten the health and sustainable development of the industry. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) warned that these 'disorderly' competition strategies have affected the normal functioning of the sector and its profitability. 'There are no winners in a price war, nor a future,' said a MIIT spokesperson, cited by the official Xinhua agency. The warning comes after a new round of discounts initiated by a major manufacturer, BYD, and followed by other giants like Geely and Chery. BYD's Seagull model has been incentivized with discounts that reduce its price to 55,800 yuan (6,830 euros). The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) has also called for an end to price wars, citing their negative impact on investment in research and development, product quality, and vehicle safety. BYD's actions have not been beneficial to the company, with its shares falling by over 17% in the last week due to concerns that its price cuts may attract government scrutiny and be unsustainable for the Chinese electric vehicle industry. Despite selling 382,476 vehicles in May, BYD's interannual growth rate was 15%, the lowest since August 2020, excluding a decline in February last year due to the Lunar New Year holiday. The company has led the intense price war, reducing profits and clouding the prospects of this rapidly growing sector, which leads the world in electric vehicle technology. BYD has sold 1.76 million units so far this year, short of its annual target of 5.5 million. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that the company needs to sell an average of around 534,000 units per month for the rest of 2025 to meet its goal. The fourth quarter is typically strong for all manufacturers, as they try to clear inventory before the end of the year. The large discounts seem to be helping other manufacturers to boost their sales. Leapmotor sold 45,067 vehicles in May, a 148% interannual increase, while Geely Auto deliveries increased by 46% to 235,208 units. Xpeng Inc. tripled its sales in May, driven mainly by its MONA M03 model, aimed at the mass market. It is worth noting that BYD's sales of battery-electric passenger vehicles, which reached 204,369 units last month, exceeded those of its plug-in hybrids (172,561), marking the second time since the beginning of 2024 that pure electric sales have led. The company is also accelerating its sales abroad, with over 89,000 units delivered in May, its highest figure to date. The authorities have announced measures to strengthen market supervision, combat unfair competition practices, and promote a 'fair and orderly' business environment. In a statement, the CAAM warned that this 'involutive competition' has generated panic in the market, especially in the new energy vehicle area, which already accounts for over 40% of new registrations in the country. 'Leading companies should not monopolize the market,' the CAAM said in its statement. It added that 'except for discounts allowed by law, companies should not sell products below cost or engage in deceptive advertising.' Among the planned actions are random quality inspections, restrictions on selling below cost, and increased cooperation between regulatory bodies. The MIIT also encouraged companies to improve their innovation capacity, elevate the quality of their products and services, and fulfill their social responsibilities.

**Mexican Senate Proposes Reforms to Boost Electric Vehicle Market**
The Mexican Senate is analyzing a package of reforms to encourage the development of electric vehicle infrastructure at the federal, state, and municipal levels, aiming to boost the country's electric vehicle market and reduce pollution. The proposed reforms modify the General Climate Change Law to require authorities to promote the construction of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. By 2040, all new vehicles sold or leased should be zero-emission, and by 2035, all government-owned or leased vehicles should be electric or zero-emission. According to Senator Agustín Dorantes, 'despite Mexico's exponential growth in electric vehicle sales, they only represented 1.62% of the market in 2024, with over 24,000 new vehicles sold.' Dorantes added that while Mexico struggles to reach 130,000 electric, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, other countries have already surpassed this number. China, for example, sold 8.4 million electric vehicles in 2023, making it the world's largest market for electric vehicles. The proposed reforms also aim to accelerate the transition to electromobility by modifying the General Mobility and Road Safety Law to require local laws to establish timelines and stages for this transition.

**The Future of the European Automobile Industry is Now**
The future of the European automobile industry is now, especially considering the ongoing trade war, Chinese brand invasions, stagnant sales, unbalanced accounts, and bleak forecasts. It would be wise for Brussels to take note of this reality, but instead, it seems to be pushing forward with its electric vehicle strategy at all costs, even as the world around it changes. The US president, Donald Trump, has reached agreements on tariffs with the UK and China, but the EU has yet to negotiate concretely with the US, leaving European automakers uncertain and at risk of losing market share in the world's largest market. Meanwhile, Brussels continues to ignore market reality and insists on pursuing electric vehicles. However, for Europe, the automotive sector accounts for 7-8% of the total GDP and around 13 million jobs. Is it possible that the 'electric vehicle religion' continues to prevail over reality? So far, the EU has only suspended fines for three years for manufacturers who fail to meet the new targets set by Brussels. This move certainly helps companies that would otherwise have to pay around €15 billion in sanctions this year. However, it is not a solution and confirms a disconnect from reality by European regulators, as the quota of electric vehicle sales would need to suddenly rise from 5% to over 20% to respect the targets, which is impossible. The only solution, requested by Stellantis' CEO John Elkann and Renault's CEO Luca de Meo, is to suspend the ban on thermal vehicle sales in 2035 and adopt a neutral technology approach to reduce emissions. This path is already being taken by the same companies, which have relaunched hybrid models to compensate for the slowdown in electric vehicles. However, Brussels must act quickly, as the future of the European automobile industry is now.

**Electric Cars Lose Half Their Value in Two Years**
A new report from 'Cox Automotive' reveals that electric cars have lost more than half of their value in just two years. According to the report, an electric car that is 24 months old in April retained only 47% of its original value, compared to 83% two years ago. The rapid decline is attributed to significant discounts offered by manufacturers to meet the UK government's mandatory sales quotas for electric cars, making new cars more attractive than used ones, and leading to a collapse in the secondary market. According to the 'ZEV' regulation, which has been in effect in the UK since January, companies must increase their annual sales of electric cars until 2035, with quotas starting at 22% in 2024 and reaching 80% by 2030. Failure to comply with these quotas exposes companies to fines of up to £12,000 per car. To achieve these goals, companies have lost £4 billion due to discounts. Mike Hawes, president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, described this as unsustainable. The introduction of a car tax on electric car owners for the first time in April led to a decline in demand, prompting companies like Ford and Volkswagen to lower the prices of their models to avoid the luxury car tax that will be applied to electric cars over £40,000 from next year. The increase in new car supply, especially from China, and the development of battery technology have also affected the value of old cars. In contrast, used electric cars with an age of 3 to 5 years have performed better, with a decline in value of only 15%, as they target a different segment of drivers. Philip Nuthall, research director at Cox Automotive Europe, warned that large discounts on new cars reduce the attractiveness of used cars, requiring greater support for the used electric car market to mitigate the decline in value. In response to market pressure, Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced changes to the ZEV mandate to support manufacturers, and a leaked message from Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood revealed a study to abolish the 'Tesla tax' to boost demand for electric cars.

**BYD Achieves Best Monthly Sales in 2025**
Chinese automaker BYD has achieved its best monthly sales in 2025, with 382,476 vehicles sold in May, according to a statement released by the company. The sales were driven by significant discounts offered in the last days of the month, which attracted a large number of customers to showrooms. Electric vehicles accounted for 53.6% of total sales, with 204,369 units sold, surpassing hybrid plug-in vehicles for the second time since the beginning of 2024. The discounts, which reached up to 34% on BYD's vehicle prices, led to a significant increase in showroom traffic, with City Research estimating a 30-40% increase in visitation rates on a weekly basis. However, the large discounts led to a decline in BYD's stock price and other electric vehicle companies, amid concerns of a new wave of price wars. The Chinese Automobile Manufacturers Association criticized the random discounts, warning that they would exacerbate the intense competition in the market and reduce profit margins. 'This is a fierce competition that may ignite a new round of panic due to price wars,' the association said in a statement. Since the beginning of 2025, BYD has sold 1.76 million vehicles, aiming to achieve a ambitious goal of selling 5.5 million vehicles by the end of the year.

**Russian Car Dealers Predict Stable Market Share for Chinese Car Manufacturers in 2025**
According to the directors of several major Russian car dealerships, the market share of Chinese car manufacturers in Russia is expected to remain stable in 2025, around 60-65%. However, if the new law on localizing taxis is not implemented, the market share of Chinese car manufacturers may decrease in 2026. Rolf's director of new cars, Nikolai Ivanov, predicts that the market share of Chinese car manufacturers will not change significantly in 2025, but may decrease in 2026 if the law is not implemented. Avilon's deputy director of sales, Renat Tyukteev, notes that the market share of Chinese car manufacturers has grown significantly over the past two years and is expected to continue growing in 2025. He also mentions that there is a growing trend of locally produced cars with Chinese investment. On the other hand, Autodom's general director, Andrey Olkhovsky, disagrees and believes that the market share of Chinese car manufacturers will decrease due to the increasing number of cars assembled directly in Russia.

**Global Electric Car Sales Expected to Surpass 20 Million in 2025**
The International Energy Agency predicts that 25% of new cars in Europe will be electric this year. The price gap between electric and gasoline cars is decreasing rapidly, especially in China where two-thirds of electric cars are now cheaper than gasoline cars. Globally, electric cars are expected to account for 40% of total car sales by 2030. China leads with 60% electric car share, while Europe is expected to reach 25% this year. The US has a more uncertain development with an estimated level of around 10%. The report highlights that emerging economies are driving the growth of electric cars, with countries in Asia and South America growing by over 60% last year. Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil are notable examples. By 2030, 40% of car sales are expected to be electric globally. In Europe, around 60% of all new cars sold are expected to be electric, with China leading the way at 80%. The US is expected to lag behind with an estimated 20% share, according to the report. In Southeast Asia, 25% of all new cars are expected to be electric, with a significantly higher share of fully electric two- and three-wheelers. The transition to electric cars is expected to replace over five million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with half of that in China, according to the report's calculations. China produces 70% of the world's electric cars, with exports increasing by 20% in 2024 and accounting for around 40% of the global market. European manufacturers still have a net export, while the US is increasingly importing. Chinese car manufacturers are now expanding to other markets such as Brazil, Mexico, and Southeast Asia as new import tariffs change global trade flows. The price gap between electric and gasoline cars is decreasing rapidly, with two-thirds of electric cars in China now being cheaper than gasoline cars. This has helped sales in China, despite lower subsidies. In emerging markets such as Brazil and Thailand, the price gap is also decreasing rapidly due to the import of Chinese models. Battery prices have fallen significantly in China, with a 30% drop, compared to 10-15% in Europe and the US. The number of public charging stations has doubled in Europe over the past two years, with Europe leading the way in terms of coverage along highways. To meet the 2030 needs, a ninefold increase in public charging capacity is required, according to the report. Technologies such as smart charging and vehicle-to-grid are growing, but require new market structures and regulations. China and the UK are two markets that are leading the way in these areas.

**Over 25% of Global Car Sales Expected to be Electric in 2025**
According to the Global EV Outlook report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), more than one in four cars sold worldwide this year will be electric, with sales expected to surpass 20 million in 2025, representing over a quarter of global car sales. Despite economic uncertainties, the electric vehicle market share is on track to exceed 40% by 2030 as models become more affordable in more markets. In 2024, global electric vehicle sales reached 17 million, surpassing 20% market share for the first time, with a 35% year-over-year increase in the first quarter of 2025. China leads the electric vehicle market, with electric cars accounting for nearly half of total car sales in 2024. Emerging markets in Asia and Latin America have also become new growth poles, with total electric vehicle sales in these regions increasing by over 60% in 2024. 'Our data shows that, despite considerable uncertainty, electric vehicles are maintaining a solid growth trajectory worldwide. Sales are continuing to break records, with significant implications for the international automotive industry,' said Fatih Birol, IEA Executive Director. 'This year, we expect more than one in four cars sold worldwide to be electric, with growth accelerating in many emerging economies. By the end of this decade, we expect more than two in five cars to be electric as electric vehicles become increasingly affordable.'

**Electric vehicle sales surge despite global trade tensions**
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), electric vehicle (EV) sales are surging globally, despite trade tensions. By 2030, over 40% of global car sales are expected to be electric, with China accounting for nearly two-thirds of global sales and over 70% of production. The IEA notes that electric cars in China are now less expensive than internal combustion engine vehicles, even without government subsidies. However, buyers in countries like Germany and the US still face a 20-30% price premium when choosing an EV. Emerging markets across Asia, Latin America, and Africa are also experiencing a boom in EV adoption, with sales growing by over 60% last year. Chinese automakers are expanding local production facilities in developing countries to reduce dependence on exports and circumvent costly import duties. The IEA warns that heightened tariffs are negatively impacting EV sales, but the Chinese EV sector is projected to remain resilient due to strong domestic support and competitive pricing. 'Electric vehicles are firmly positioned on a global growth path,' said Fatih Birol, Director-General of the IEA. 'By the end of 2025, electric cars are expected to make up one in every four vehicles sold globally.'

**1 in 4 new cars sold in 2025 will be electric, new report says, and China is the undisputed EV leader | CBC News**
According to the International Energy Agency, over one in four new cars sold worldwide in 2025 will be electric, reaching 40% of all new cars by 2030. China is the undisputed leader in electric vehicle (EV) sales, with new EV sales increasing 40% year over year in 2024 and accounting for 11 million out of the 17 million new EVs sold worldwide. The IEA's Global EV Outlook report highlights China's decades-long investment in EVs, making electric cars more affordable for buyers in developing countries. Daniel Breton, president of Electric Mobility Canada, stated, 'We're not going back, no matter what some people might say or think. We are moving in the transition to EVs.' China's success in EVs has been driven by its vertically integrated business model, dominating in making batteries, sourcing minerals, and financing for car buyers. The report warns of the impacts of U.S. trade and tariff threats on the EV market, but Electric Mobility Canada recommends that Canada maintain its EV Availability Standard, which requires companies to sell only electric cars in the country by 2035.

**Electric Vehicles to Reach 40% of Global Car Sales by 2030, Says IEA**
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the share of electric vehicles in global car sales will reach 25% by 2025 and 40% by 2030. The demand for electric vehicles is driven by their increasing accessibility. Sales of electric vehicles are growing rapidly, with a 35% increase in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period last year. By the end of 2025, global sales are expected to exceed 20 million. China remains the leader in the market, with electric vehicles accounting for nearly half of all sales in 2024. The number of electric vehicles sold in China last year (over 11 million) is equivalent to the total number of electric vehicles sold worldwide in 2022. Developing markets in Asia and Latin America are also becoming new centers of growth, with a 60% increase in sales in 2024. In the US, sales of electric vehicles have grown by around 10% year-on-year, with their share exceeding 10%. In Europe, sales have stagnated due to the reduction of subsidies and other support measures, although the share of electric vehicles in the market remains around 20%. On a global level, prices are falling due to increasing competition and decreasing battery costs. In China, two-thirds of all electric vehicles sold last year were cheaper than their conventional counterparts, even without considering purchase incentives. However, the price gap remains on many other markets. For example, the average price of an electric vehicle in Germany is still 20% higher than that of a conventional vehicle. In the US, electric vehicles with batteries are still 30% more expensive.

**IEA Predicts Electric Vehicles Will Account for 25% of Global Car Sales in 2025**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that electric vehicles will account for 25% of global car sales in 2025, and 40% by 2030. According to the agency, 17 million electric cars were sold in 2024, which is 20% of all car sales. The IEA notes that the 3.5 million increase in sales compared to 2023 is more than the total global sales of electric vehicles in 2020. 'It is expected that electric vehicle sales will exceed 20 million worldwide in 2025 and account for more than a quarter of all cars sold globally. Sales have grown by 35% in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period last year, with record sales in the first quarter observed on all major markets,' the IEA's Global EV Outlook 2025 report states. In China, the share of electric vehicles is expected to reach around 60% of the country's total car sales this year, while in Europe it will be 25% and in the US 11%. In developing economies, excluding China, sales are expected to continue to grow actively, increasing by 50% and reaching 1 million in 2025. 'Despite the uncertainty in prospects, the share of electric vehicles in total car sales is expected to exceed 40% by 2030 under current policy parameters,' the IEA report adds.

**China Aims to Dominate Electric Vehicle Market by 2035**
China aims to have electric vehicles dominate the domestic market by 2035, with a target of over 50% market share. This is the first time the Chinese government has set such targets. Currently, electric vehicles account for only 27.61% of the primary segment of the automotive market. In contrast, Europe and the US have been setting ambitious goals for transitioning to electric transportation, but China has been making this shift without administrative guidance. The Chinese government has now announced a program to promote the development of electric vehicles, with a focus on creating a network of virtual power plants that can utilize the batteries of electric vehicles to generate electricity when they are not in use. Last year, 10,895,252 electric and hybrid vehicles were sold in China, a 40.55% increase from 2023. Electric vehicles accounted for 27.61% of the primary segment of the automotive market, while hybrid and electric vehicles accounted for 47.6% of all passenger vehicle sales. The sales of electric vehicles grew by 22.82% last year, and they accounted for 58% of the segment of vehicles that can be charged from the network. In the first quarter of this year, electric vehicles increased sales by 45.28% to 1.49 million units, while hybrid vehicles added only 25.32% to 929,000 units.

**China aims for BEVs to dominate new car sales by 2035**
China has set a goal for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) to dominate new car sales by 2035, with a target of making transportation and new energy systems fully integrated and interactive. According to the guideline, by 2027, the proportion of new energy vehicles (NEVs) in new vehicles will increase year by year. In 2024, NEVs accounted for 47.6% of all passenger vehicle retail sales, with BEVs contributing 58% of NEV retail sales and 27.61% of all passenger vehicle retail sales. The sales growth of BEVs has outpaced that of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) so far this year. 'China aims to make transportation and new energy systems fully integrated and interactive by 2035,' the document said. 'By that time, China will initially establish a transportation energy use system dominated by clean, low-carbon energy consumption, with scientific and technological innovation as the key support.'
