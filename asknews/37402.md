**Record Number of Companies with High Debt Levels in 2025**
The number of companies with high debt levels, known as 'main debtors', has reached a record high of 41 in 2025, up from 36 in 2024, according to the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS). The main debtors are companies with large amounts of debt, including bank loans, and are subject to stricter financial regulations. SK Group topped the list for the second consecutive year, followed by Hyundai Motor, Samsung, Lotte, and LG. The FSS selects main debtors based on their total debt and bank credit outstanding, and requires them to undergo regular financial evaluations. This year, the total debt of main debtors exceeded 2.401 trillion won, and their bank credit outstanding exceeded 1.4063 trillion won. According to the FSS, the main reason for the increase in main debtors is the poor financial performance of certain industries, such as battery production and construction, which have led to increased borrowing. The FSS also noted that the number of main debtors has increased due to corporate mergers and acquisitions, which have resulted in larger debt levels. The FSS stated that it will 'induce the main debtors' banks to conduct thorough evaluations, taking into account potential risks such as the decline in the performance of vulnerable industries and the likelihood of capital outflows.'

**U.S. banks see profits climb in first quarter:  FDIC**
The U.S. banking industry reported a 5.8% increase in profits to $70.6 billion in the first quarter of 2025, driven by a 7% rise in noninterest income. However, banks also saw a slight increase in provision expenses against potential loan losses, which stood at $22.5 billion, a 9.1% increase from the previous year. The FDIC noted that banks are still struggling with commercial real estate loans, with overdue loans reaching 1.49%, the highest level since 2014. Loan growth was also slow, with balances increasing by just 0.5% from the previous quarter, and annual growth at 3%, below the pre-pandemic average of 4.9%. As stated by FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill, 'With strong capital and liquidity levels to support lending and protect against potential losses, the banking industry continued to support the country's needs for financial services while navigating the challenges presented by economic uncertainty, elevated inflation and interest rates, tighter credit, and elevated unrealized losses.'

**FDIC's Living-Will Rewrite Haunted By Ghost Of SVB**
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has announced changes to living wills, documents maintained by 50 of the largest banks, to make it simpler for troubled lenders to wind down their operations. This move is seen as a response to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), with the FDIC wanting to avoid a similar scenario in the future. The changes aim to provide a clearer roadmap for banks to follow in the event of a crisis, allowing for a more orderly resolution. As the FDIC stated, 'The goal is to make it easier for banks to plan for and execute a resolution in a way that minimizes disruption to the financial system.' The changes are expected to benefit the stability of the financial system and reduce the risk of bank failures.

**US bank regulator lays out plans for 20% staff reduction, email says**
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 20%, or 1,250 employees, as part of the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the federal government. The agency will launch several initiatives, including early retirement, incentives for resigning, and layoffs if necessary. According to a copy of an email seen by Reuters, the goal is to reduce staffing from the authorized 6,900 employees in 2025. The FDIC has already seen hundreds of employees agree to resign as part of a government-wide buyout offer, but may reject offers from certain employees, including those who examine and resolve failed banks or handle sensitive bank information. Involuntary layoffs may be pursued if necessary after May 13.

**How secure are your deposits?**
The security of deposits is a top priority in today's financial landscape. While bank failures are uncommon, they're not rare. Between 2015 and 2025, 37 U.S. banks failed, including one this year. Dana Robb, vice president of retail banking and operations at Pittsfield Cooperative Bank, advises that the FDIC provides insurance coverage for deposits at member banks, up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, and ownership category. This coverage is free and applies to accounts including checking, savings, and CDs. If your savings exceed the $250,000 FDIC coverage, you can open accounts at different banks that are separately chartered, or use a financial services company to handle dividing big deposits into accounts across a network of FDIC-insured banks. However, fees often apply for the service, and you may not always get the best interest rate for CDs. It's also important to note that mutual funds, stocks, and bonds, annuities, and crypto assets are not covered by either FDIC or DIF.

**NDIC lists 20 failed banks, offers to pay depositors 100% liquidation dividends**
The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) has announced that it will pay a 100% liquidation dividend to depositors of 20 failed banks. According to Pamela Robert, the South-East Zonal Coordinator of the NDIC, the corporation has started plans for the payment of the first tranche of liquidation dividends, which will commence this month. Robert stated that the NDIC is responsible for liquidating failed banks, reimbursing insured depositors, recovering debts, and disposing of assets to ensure full payments to depositors and others. She noted that depositors will get up to N5 million, and balances exceed the amount, and uninsured deposits are reimbursed as liquidation dividends when enough assets and loan recoveries are made. Robert urged all affected depositors to engage with the NDIC to claim their entitlements. The NDIC has made progress in asset sales and debt recovery, and Robert expressed optimism about the corporation's financial and operational capacity to repay all verified depositors.

**Banks start 2025 on a solid footing, including the 4 that dominate Arizona**
The banking industry ended 2024 with a record profit of $268 billion, and 93.3% of banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. were profitable last year. However, new regulatory priorities under President Trump could affect the financial strength of banks. Travis Hill, the acting chairman of the FDIC, has issued a list of priorities that includes conducting a wholesale review of bank regulations, adopting a more 'open-minded' approach to innovation and technology, and improving the supervisory process. Hill also wants to re-set a workforce culture within the agency 'where misconduct is not tolerated and those who engage in misconduct are held accountable.' The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been laying off staff and appears to be winding down operations since Trump took office. The new FDIC priorities may lead to more or fewer banks, but it's hard to say. The number of U.S. banks has declined every year for at least the past two decades. 'At this stage of the U.S. economic cycle, the banking industry is well positioned to continue supporting customers, clients and communities with the financial services they want and need,' the American Bankers Association said in a commentary on the latest report for the year ending Dec. 31, 2024.
