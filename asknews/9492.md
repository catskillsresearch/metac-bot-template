**Water Intelligence: Detecting Leaks with AI and Robotics**
Every day, 346 million cubic meters of potable water are wasted worldwide due to leaks in the pipes. The losses vary greatly from country to country: 83% in Armenia, 15% in France, and 5% in the Netherlands. 'The Netherlands being relatively flat, the water pipes are not subject to too many inclines or pressure differences, which are often causes of leaks,' explains Robbert Lodewijks, CEO and co-founder of Hulo, a Dutch startup that uses AI to detect water leaks. Additionally, the Netherlands has always well-maintained and documented its water network. 'Until now, they were only notified when a consumer called to report a problem,' says Robbert Lodewijks, who has developed a range of software that can detect leaks in 15 minutes. Dogs, robots, and data loggers are being used to detect leaks in water pipes. The data collected by operators allows for the creation of a digital twin of the network and the simulation of its normal functioning; any deviation, indicative of a potential leak, is signaled to an operator. A more in-depth analysis allows for the location of the leak to within 50 meters. Several water distribution companies around the world are currently testing satellite imaging. Radar technology on some satellites can detect pockets of potable water up to three meters deep. The Israeli company Asterra, for example, provides such a service. 'The test we recently conducted in the north of Dublin allowed us to identify several POI,' says Adrian Mullins. SmartBalls, SmartSponges, and other PipeDivers are being used to inspect pipes from the inside and prevent leaks. 'Our intelligent sponge is derived from a technology originally used to clean pipelines and gas ducts,' says Erik Driessen, CEO of Acquaint, another Dutch company. The Acquarius, a giant inflatable buoy, perfectly hugs the shape of the pipes and, thanks to its 32 ultrasonic sensors, gives them a thorough health check. 'We detect, of course, leaks, but also corrosion of metal pipes, deformations of joints or plastic pipes, and losses of thickness...,' details Erik Driessen. The company, which has inspected 700 km of pipes over the past five years, has partnered with Wetsus, a Dutch research center on water technologies, to study a new method of detecting cracks two millimeters wide: electrical impedance. Predictive tools are being developed to analyze the data collected by these devices and identify the most fragile sections of the network. 'Our predictive tools are fed by data provided by suppliers like Acwa Robotics, but also by the history of leaks, the topology of the locations, the methods of burying the pipes, etc. to identify the kilometers of pipe most likely to break. These sections must be replaced in priority,' explains Gilles Brunschwig, president of Altereo, a Paris-based engineering firm specializing in water. Only 5,200 km - 0.6% of the French network - are renewed each year. It would be better to choose them wisely.

**New AI Tool Predicts Postpartum Depression Risk**
Researchers in the United States have developed a new tool based on artificial intelligence (AI) that can predict, in advance, which people are more likely to develop postpartum depression. The discovery, published this week in the American Journal of Psychiatry and reported by Nature, could revolutionize mental health care in the postnatal period. Postpartum depression is a mental health condition that affects around 17% of people who give birth worldwide. Unlike the 'baby blues', a mild and temporary sadness common in the first days after birth, postpartum depression is more intense and lasting. Symptoms include deep sadness, anxiety, loss of interest in daily activities, and difficulty connecting with the baby. The condition can occur up to a year after birth and affects not only the mother but also the baby's development and family well-being. The research team used data from over 29,000 mothers who gave birth in the United States between 2017 and 2022. The machine learning model was trained with electronic medical records and mental health screening results from that period. The goal is to help hospitals identify, in a preventive manner, which parents and mothers can benefit from emotional support and psychological follow-up shortly after the baby's birth. The system excluded from analysis people who already had a recent history of depression, a group already recognized as high-risk. Thus, the AI showed effectiveness: among those classified as high-risk, 30% developed the condition - a rate three times higher than the overall average of the sample. According to the scientists, the value of the tool lies in its ability to anticipate critical situations and offer support before symptoms worsen. 'If we know that someone is at higher risk, we can try to develop strategies to help prevent depression,' explains psychiatrist Roy Perlis, from Mass General Brigham Hospital in Boston, co-author of the study. Among the suggested actions are specific therapies and stress management techniques.

**Israeli Families Offered Opportunity to Have Children Using Deceased Sons' Sperm**
Sharon Eisenkot, a mother from Israel, has been offered the opportunity to have a child using the sperm of her deceased son, Maor, who was killed in a Hamas attack in Gaza. Eisenkot, who is 19 years old, was a soldier in the Golani brigade and was killed while securing a mosque in Khan Younis. His mother, Sharon, was devastated by his death, but was asked if she wanted to preserve his sperm, to which she agreed. Eisenkot has already begun searching for a woman to carry the child and hopes that it will help her cope with her grief. This is not an isolated case, as all families who have lost a son in the Hamas attack or the subsequent war have been offered the opportunity to preserve their son's sperm. The procedure has been performed on approximately one in four fallen soldiers. 'It's a way to bring life back to those who have lost everything,' says advocate Irit Rosenblum, who represents some of the families. However, not everyone is in favor of this practice, with some raising ethical concerns about the use of frozen embryos and sperm cells. 'When someone is dead, they usually don't continue to have children,' says Revel, a man who has helped many childless couples. 'If we were to use the sperm of Charlie Chaplin or Albert Einstein, we could continue to have children for many years or even centuries after their death.'

**The Genocide and Artificial Intelligence in Gaza**
The Israeli military has been waging an exceptional war on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, targeting civilians, buildings, and vital infrastructure to achieve unprecedented destruction. To achieve its genocidal plan in Gaza, Israel has relied on its two pillars, military and material, and political support from its natural allies, particularly the United States and European countries, as well as some Arabs. However, achieving this exceptional level of destruction was not possible without Israel's reliance on advanced military and war applications, particularly the dark side of artificial intelligence, to launch a new and advanced war to exterminate Palestinians through the use of applications for killing and destruction provided by artificial intelligence to implement the project of getting rid of Palestinians deeply rooted in the Zionist ideology. The Israeli military, 'Tsahal', has used the 'Lavender' system, a part of the arsenal that includes the 'Gospel' artificial intelligence, which can identify around 100 targets per day, to determine the degree of each person's involvement in Hamas or the Islamic Jihad movement, or the likelihood of being a fighter. After determining the target's location, the army is given the order to kill them. According to sources, the Israeli army relied heavily on 'Lavender' in the first weeks of the war, which identified around 37,000 Palestinians as fighters to be killed. The 'Habsora' system, also known as 'The Gospel', is used to choose the buildings to be targeted, and its use has accelerated the pace of attacks to expand the circle of collective killing and urban destruction. The Israeli military's ideology of killing and destruction, which aims to implement a genocidal plan against Palestinians, has not differentiated between the various roles of Palestinians, but has instead targeted all Palestinians, including children, women, and elderly, as evident in the bombing of many inhabited buildings at night to achieve the maximum damage among civilians. The existence of a arsenal of programs specialized in killing Palestinians is a clear indication of a real intention to exterminate Palestinians and destroy the strip.

**Israeli Researcher Elizabeth Tsourkov's Release Negotiations: A Complex Web of Deals and Diplomacy**
According to sources, the Israeli government is negotiating with an Iraqi militant group to release Israeli researcher Elizabeth Tsourkov, who is being held in Iraq. The negotiations are being conducted through an American intermediary and are taking place in a tense security environment. The agreement currently on the table involves transferring Tsourkov to Azerbaijan, a country with good relations with both Iran and Israel, in exchange for $200 million and the release of five individuals who work for the 'resistance axis.' One of these individuals is believed to be Mohammad Reza Nori, a prominent leader in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard who was involved in the killing of American citizen Stephen Troil in Baghdad in 2022. The negotiations are being closely monitored by senior Iranian intelligence officials and the head of the Iranian judiciary, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, who previously visited Baghdad and presented the case for releasing Nori to Iraqi officials. However, the US strongly opposed this, and it is believed that this opposition is behind the delay in transferring Tsourkov to her home country.

**Defense Admits 'Technological Dependence' on Israel but Works on 'Disconnection'**
The Secretary of State for Defense, Amparo Valcarce, acknowledged on Friday that some industrial programs have a 'technological dependence' on Israeli-made products, but assured that the department is already working on 'disconnection plans' from the Israeli state. Valcarce made this statement after the Congress gave the green light to the processing of a bill promoted by Sumar, Podemos, and the BNG to impose an arms embargo on Israel in retaliation for the massacres in the Gaza Strip. The Secretary of State expressed 'all the respect' of the Ministry of Defense for the processing of the norm, which she considers 'very necessary'. When asked if it is feasible to apply an arms embargo to the Israeli state, Valcarce emphasized that Spain halted arms trade with Israel on October 7, 2023, but acknowledged that 'some ongoing programs have technological dependencies on some Israeli companies', without providing further details. She highlighted the importance of the industrial plan approved by the Government, worth 10.471 million euros, for achieving strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty that would help 'disconnection' from Israel and other countries 'in no way'. 'In technological matters, we must reach zero and only achieve it with the disconnection plan we are implementing', she said. The Ministry of Defense has already stated that it finds it difficult to comply with a potential arms embargo on Israel because it develops a significant part of the cybersecurity or artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which is vital today. Additionally, it believes that it could circumvent the law, despite its existence.

**Experts call for escalation of AI tool to improve health outcomes - THE AUTHORITY NEWS**
Experts in the health sector have called for the escalation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool in other health programs like malaria and Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (RMNCH) to strengthen health initiatives and improve health outcomes. They commended the Institute of Human Virology Nigeria for its ground-breaking impact of the use of AI in the fight against Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV in Nigeria. Dr. Adebobola Bashorun suggested a more centralised government approach to facilitate rapid scale-up and scale-out of the AI solution. Dr. Emmanuel Vincent explained that the AI platform was adopted across 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, reaching over 5,300 healthcare facilities. The platform has driven unprecedented improvements in efficiency, accountability, and coordination of the national TB/HIV response, with 65% reduction in performance standards, 100% compliance, and 11,307 supervision and mentorship engagements tracked. Dr. Jerome Mafeni added that 'This is about building a culture of performance.'

**Bioethics: The Italian Law on Medically Assisted Procreation Under Attack**
The Italian law on medically assisted procreation (PMA) has been subject to intense opposition since its introduction. The law aimed to protect the fundamental values of human life and the family, but the judiciary has been gradually dismantling it. The Corte Costituzionale has issued 12 rulings since 2006, some of which have introduced significant changes. The 2009 ruling (n. 151) allowed for the production of surplus embryos and their freezing, while the 2015 ruling (n. 96) permitted access to assisted reproduction for couples with genetic diseases. The 2015 ruling (n. 229) lifted the ban on eugenic embryo selection, and the 2014 ruling (n. 162) recognized the 'right to a child' as 'incoercible'. The 2025 ruling (n. 68) granted parental status to the 'intentional mother' who consented to the in vitro conception of a child carried and born by her partner. The article argues that the cultural push to prioritize individual will over traditional family values is concerning, and that the complementarity of masculinity and femininity is essential for child growth and care.

**Israel Faces Mental Health Emergency Amid Breakthroughs in Gene Editing and Cancer Research**
Israel is facing a mental health emergency, warns Yair Bar-Haim, head of Tel Aviv University's National Center for Trauma and Resilience. A study found that 12% of reserve soldiers report PTSD symptoms after Gaza combat service. Meanwhile, a breakthrough in gene editing has eliminated 50% of head and neck tumors in mice. Israeli researchers have also developed a blood test for early detection of Parkinson's disease. Additionally, a study has found that people with intellectual disabilities can get smarter as they age, debunking a long-held myth. Furthermore, a new medical school is set to open in Israel to address the urgent shortage of physicians. The country is also seeing a rise in cases of measles, with 8 cases diagnosed in the past week. The Health Ministry has announced new guidelines for hospitals receiving hostages, including STD checks and pregnancy tests. Israeli scientists have made several breakthroughs in recent months, including the development of a tool to detect abnormal protein activity and the discovery of a potent lifesaving virus. The country is also seeing a rise in cases of trauma, with 3 million Israelis suffering from trauma since October 7, according to the State Comptroller. 'Fear is now in our DNA': With a pause in Hezbollah attacks, two border towns are regrouping and rebuilding. The 15-month war has taken its toll 'not only physically but also emotionally' on residents evacuated from Mattat, and those who stayed put in the area. 'The journey to recovery for Iair and our family will be long, and will not end until our loved ones are home,' said the family of Iair Horn, a freed hostage. Researcher Prof. Michal Schwartz has found that immunotherapy treatment could slow the aging process, and a study has found that fish embryos are able to decide when they want to be born. 'We are facing a mental health emergency,' said Bar-Haim, 'and we need to act quickly to address it.'

**AI in Assisted Reproduction: A 7% Reduction in Conception Time**
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in assisted reproduction has revolutionized the selection of eggs, sperm, and embryos, allowing for a 7% reduction in the time needed to conceive a child, according to a study led by researchers at IVI Valencia. The study, presented at the 11th International Congress IVIRMA, found that applying AI to embryo selection also increases the pregnancy rate by 5% and up to 7% in multiple attempts. 'AI is a reality in assisted reproduction and is giving great results in research and clinical practice,' said Juan Antonio García Velasco, scientific director of the congress and IVIRMA. 'We are talking about distinguishing the spermatozoid with the highest capacity to fertilize the ovocyte and give rise to an embryo, as well as identifying the best quality eggs, which undoubtedly contribute positively to achieving better success rates, reducing time and increasing pregnancy rates.' The AI also shows promising uses in personalizing fertility treatments, providing women with information on the expected number of eggs and the best day to visit the clinic, reducing unnecessary visits. However, beyond AI, the IVIRMA Congress has also presented advances in genetics, stem cell biology, and tissue engineering. Dr. Antonio Capalbo, responsible for genomics at IVIRMA Global Research Alliance, presented a study suggesting that sequencing the complete genome of embryos before implantation could identify not only major chromosomal abnormalities but also subtle variations that may compromise their development and future severe diseases in offspring. 'With current genetic tests (such as trophoblast biopsies), approximately half of the embryos considered normal do not implant in the endometrium, and another 10% end in spontaneous abortion,' Capalbo explained. However, the specialist admitted that more studies are needed to evaluate the impact and how to manage the new genomic information obtained before applying complete genome sequencing of embryos in clinics.

**First Baby Born Using Fully Automated and Digitally Controlled ICSI System**
Conceivable Life Sciences, a biotechnology company, has announced the birth of the first baby conceived using their fully automated and digitally controlled Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) system. The details are available in an article published on Reproductive Biomedicine Online. Conceivable combines artificial intelligence and robotics to automate over 200 steps necessary for creating embryos for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Their workstation automates each of the 23 steps of the standard ICSI procedure. This technique involves fertilization through the injection of a single spermatozoon into the center of a mature ovum. Traditionally, ICSI procedures are performed manually by experienced embryologists who operate micromanipulation systems, which can introduce variability in the fertilization process. Jacques Cohen of Conceivable, an embryologist, noted that the phases of ICSI can be controlled using artificial intelligence or a remote operator. In this latest version, scientists used artificial intelligence to position the spermatozoon in the injection pipette and direct the microinjection inside the ovum. The AI system 'selects the sperm autonomously and immobilizes its central part with precision using a laser ready for injection,' explained Gerardo Mendizabal-Ruiz, chief engineer of the company. The birth reported in the study occurred from a 40-year-old woman who was directed for treatment with donor eggs at Hope IVF Mexico in Guadalajara, Mexico, following a previous failed IVF attempt that produced only one mature ovum and no embryos. In the study cycle, five oocytes were assigned to fertilization with automated ICSI and three as controls with standard manual ICSI. The automated system was installed on site, but later remote operators, at the clinic in Guadalajara and in New York, issued commands through a digital interface to perform each of the 23 microinjection steps for each ovum, for a total of 115 steps. Four of the five oocytes injected into the automated system achieved normal fertilization, as did all three of the manual control group. A high-quality embryo that reached the blastocyst stage in culture was generated with the automated system under remote control from New York. When this blastocyst was transferred in a subsequent cycle, a pregnancy was initiated that progressed normally to the birth of a healthy male baby. The treatment was provided under the supervision of the review committee at Hope IVF, a fertility clinic in Guadalajara, as part of a pilot investigation on various automation processes in the fertility laboratory. As a testament to the interest in using AI in assisted reproduction, Conceivable collected $18 million in a funding round led by Artis Ventures with the participation of several new investors at the beginning of this year.

**First Baby Born Using Fully Automated ICSI Procedure**
A biotechnology company, Conceivable Life Sciences, has developed a robotic system that can perform all 23 stages of the intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedure in an automated manner. This approach reduces the risk of human error in such procedures. The system uses artificial intelligence to select the healthiest sperm for fertilization based on their appearance, and then injects them into the egg in a laboratory setting. The company tested the system with a childless couple from Mexico, where the man had low sperm motility and the woman had problems producing eggs, and they used donor eggs. The system successfully fertilized four embryos, and one of them led to a healthy baby boy born at 38 weeks. The procedure took around 10 minutes, with the operator controlling it remotely from 3700 km away. The authors of the study note that this approach does not necessarily produce healthier embryos than traditional ICSI, and more research is needed to confirm the results.

**World's First Baby Born Using AI-Assisted IVF Technology**
The first baby in the world has been born using AI-assisted IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) technology. According to reports, the AI system has replaced the traditional manual process of Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) in IVF, where a sperm is directly injected into an egg. The new process uses AI or remote digital control to complete all 23 steps of the ICSI procedure without human intervention. In a fertility clinic in the US, AI technology was used to select the best embryo, and the AI-selected embryo was then implanted into a woman's uterus, resulting in a successful pregnancy and the birth of a healthy baby. AI has helped in selecting the right embryo, which is a challenging task for doctors. The AI algorithm analyzed microscopic images to select the best embryo, which is a difficult task for any doctor to do by eye. The AI technology has also improved the success rate of IVF by scoring the embryo's growth, cell division speed, and other biological signals. This has made the process easier and more efficient. Experts say that IVF is often a costly and exhausting process, but AI can help make it faster and more accurate, saving time and money.

**Artificial Intelligence Revolutionizes IVF Treatment: An Interview with Dr. Seval Taşdemir**
Dr. Seval Taşdemir, a specialist in obstetrics and IVF, discussed the latest developments in IVF treatment, including the use of artificial intelligence in embryo selection, the importance of genetic testing, and the importance of timely medical checks for couples trying to conceive. According to Dr. Taşdemir, artificial intelligence has greatly benefited IVF treatment, allowing for easier selection of embryos with high fertility and healthy genetic makeup. 'We can now more easily select embryos with high fertility and a strong genetic makeup,' she said. Dr. Taşdemir emphasized the importance of genetic testing in ensuring a healthy pregnancy process, stating that 'we now have the ability to analyze the genetic makeup of the embryo and determine whether it is healthy or not.' She also stressed the importance of timely medical checks for couples trying to conceive, saying that 'women tend to become mothers at an older age, but their egg reserves decrease, so we aim to develop 10-15 eggs using the 'pooling' method.'

**Tel Aviv U. technology increases IVF success rates**
A new fertility technology developed at Tel Aviv University has shown a remarkable increase in IVF success rates, from 34% to 65%. The technology, which selects the highest-quality sperm cells based on World Health Organization criteria, has already led to 20 successful pregnancies from 31 embryo transfers in early clinical trials. The innovation, developed by Natan T. Shaked, chair of Tel Aviv University's Biomedical Engineering Department, uses an optical imaging technique to evaluate sperm without chemical staining, allowing clinicians to choose the most active and viable sperm. Shaked said, 'We knew sperm selection was important, but the fact that we could nearly double the success rate of IVF was surprising.' The technology is now being promoted through QART Medical, a startup founded by Shaked and Alon Shalev, and is being tested in clinical trials across five hospitals in Israel and two leading international institutions. Shalev described the company's technology as a 'next-generation microscope' that provides embryologists with a radically new way to evaluate sperm cells. He said, 'We're not just developing a product -- we're giving people a chance to build families.' The next step for QART Medical is global expansion, with plans to expand to additional countries this year.
