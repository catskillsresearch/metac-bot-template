**OpenAI Plans to Develop ChatGPT into a 'Super Assistant' by Mid-2025**
OpenAI is planning to develop ChatGPT from a simple chatbot to a highly advanced AI assistant that can understand users deeply and become their primary interface to the internet and perform various daily tasks. According to leaked documents revealed during an antitrust lawsuit against Google in the US, the company plans to launch the advanced version of this assistant in the first half of 2025. The current version of ChatGPT has evolved from a smart chat to an integrated platform that includes image generation, deep search, and e-commerce, but OpenAI aims to make it a 'super assistant' that can understand what matters to the user and help them complete any task, simple or complex, using advanced AI techniques. The leaked documents indicate that the new assistant will be able to handle multiple tasks across a wide range of skills, similar to a T-shaped skillset, including simplifying daily life such as answering questions, scheduling appointments, helping with travel planning, and even communicating with lawyers or joining sports clubs. The documents also emphasize that the current GPT models, 'versions o2 and o3', are smart enough to perform interactive tasks, and the use of tools such as computers and multi-media technologies 'such as text, images, and audio' will allow ChatGPT to interact with users in a more natural and effective way. There is also a collaboration between Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, and former Apple designer Johnny Ives, to develop new devices that may be designed for smart home use, indicating a possibility of integrating the super assistant into smart home devices in the future. According to the documents, ChatGPT will be available on various current devices such as computers and smartphones, and OpenAI aims to make this virtual assistant the default choice on these devices, with work underway to gain regulatory approval for this. Despite the ambitious plans, the company expresses concern that the rapid growth may not be sustainable in the long term, and therefore invests billions of dollars in projects to build data centers in the US and UAE, a step to enhance infrastructure and improve the performance of cloud-based services that rely on it. The OpenAI project aims to make ChatGPT a comprehensive assistant that helps users in all aspects of their lives, whether at home, work, or on the go, with interactive capabilities that make dealing with technology easier and smarter.

**Summer 2025: How to Properly Suspend the Telematic Cash Register**
As the summer of 2025 approaches, businesses may decide to temporarily close for vacation. For those with a VAT number, it's essential to communicate their absence to the tax authorities if it exceeds 12 days. This is because the automatic transmission of daily receipts to the Agenzia delle Entrate (Italian tax authority) may be interrupted. To avoid any issues, it's necessary to put the telematic cash register in a state of inactivity. This can be done by generating an event with code 608, which signals the start of the inactivity period. Upon reopening, the first useful transmission will automatically reactivate the register. Before closing for vacation, it's crucial to verify that the cash register can handle the inactivity internally. If not, it's possible to manually indicate the inactivity period on the Agenzia delle Entrate's portal. Communicating inactivity is essential to avoid any potential disputes and to maintain transparency and compliance with tax regulations. By following these procedures, businesses can ensure a smooth and efficient management of their activities.
