**Belarus and Russia Agree to Promote Objective Information about Union State**
Belarusian Foreign Ministry officials, Maria Zaharova and Ruslan Varankov, discussed plans to promote objective information about the activities of the Union State. According to a statement, they agreed to 'cut the truth with a Belarusian Minsk Tractor Works (MTZ) axe together.' The MTZ is a Belarusian tractor manufacturer. The officials also discussed specific projects and plans to promote objective information about 'union construction.' This comes after Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko called for making the integration process with Russia 'irreversible' in March. He also stated that if Belarus had to choose, it would always side with Russia. The Union State is an integration project between Russia and Belarus, established in 2000, which aims to create common approaches in various areas, including politics, economy, defense, and social issues.

**Germany's Top General Warns of Potential Russian Attack on NATO by 2029**
German Chief of Staff, General Carsten Breuer, believes that Russia may attack NATO within the next four years. He stated in an interview with the BBC, published on June 1, that NATO members must prepare for a possible Russian attack by 2029 or even earlier. According to Breuer, NATO is facing a 'very serious threat' from Russia, which he has never encountered in his 40-year career. He noted that Russia is rapidly increasing its military capabilities, producing around 1,500 main battle tanks per year and 4 million 152mm shells in 2024, not all of which were sent to Ukraine. Some of the military equipment is being stored in warehouses, awaiting a potential attack on the West. 'There is an intention and a buildup of reserves' for a possible future attack on Baltic states, he said. 'We must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it won't happen before 2029, I would say no, it's not. So we must be able to fight tonight,' Breuer said. He highlighted the Suwalki Corridor, a territory bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable areas. General Breuer asserts that NATO members must again increase their military forces. He added that it will take years for the European military-industrial base to ramp up to match the scale of Russia's military production.

**General Broyer Warns of Potential Russian Attack on Baltic States in 2029**
General Broyer stated that Russia produces around 1,500 main battle tanks annually and significantly increases its military forces. 'Not all tanks are sent to war in Ukraine, but they also arrive in reserves and new military structures that are always directed against the West,' he said. Broyer also mentioned that in 2024, Russia produced 4 million 152mm artillery shells, not all of which are intended for the front in Ukraine. 'There is an intention and accumulation of reserves' for a possible future attack on Baltic countries, he added. 'This is what analysts estimate - in 2029. So we must be ready for 2029... If you ask me now, is this not a guarantee that it will not happen before 2029? I would say no, it's not. So we must be ready for a fight today,' he emphasized. Broyer identified the Suwalki Gap as the most vulnerable zone for Russian aggression - a section on the border of Poland, Lithuania, Russia, and Belarus. 'Baltic states are indeed vulnerable to the Russians, aren't they? And when you're there, you really feel it... during the negotiations we conduct there,' he said. According to him, Estonians compare their situation to feeling warmth, seeing flames, and smelling smoke, while in Germany 'you probably see only a little smoke on the horizon.' The general also noted that Russia views the war in Ukraine as 'a continuation' of a broader conflict with NATO and 'tries to find ways to penetrate our defensive lines and test them.' As examples of such actions, he cited attacks on underwater cables in the Baltic Sea, cyberattacks on public transportation, and the appearance of drones over critical infrastructure in Germany. Broyer called on NATO allies to urgently increase their defensive capabilities. 'What we need to do now is really take the matter and say to everyone: 'Hey, invest... invest more in this, because we need it. We need it to be able to defend ourselves, and therefore to increase the deterrent potential,' he said.

**Belarus Moves Joint Military Exercises with Russia Deeper into the Country**
Belarus has announced that it will move the joint military exercises with Russia, 'Zakhid-2025', deeper into the country, away from the western borders. This suggests that Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has received several signals. According to Pavel Latushko, the deputy head of the United Transitional Cabinet of Belarus and head of the People's Anti-Crisis Management, Lukashenko asked Vladimir Putin to move the exercises after receiving these signals. This scenario is also beneficial for the Kremlin. Latushko stated that the joint military exercises previously posed a threat not only to Ukraine, but also to Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland. As for Ukraine, even President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that Russia was 'preparing something' in Belarus. Latushko believes that there are several reasons for moving the main stages of the 'Zakhid-2025' exercises deeper into the country: 'Lukashenko received these signals. I am sure that he crawled on his knees to Putin and started begging him not to do this,' he emphasized. Latushko also noted that there is a certain game being played here - Russia does not want to stop the war in Ukraine, but in Belarus, it shows that it is withdrawing its troops from Europe. 'Here, there is a call for peace, and there - for war,' he said. Meanwhile, the head of the Institute of World Policy, Viktor Shlinchak, expressed the opinion that it was Putin who was hinted to move the exercises to Belarus. It is likely that this was done by the Americans.

**Belarus, Russia working on joint drone venture**
Belarus and Russia are working on a joint drone venture, with a factory to be built in Belarus. According to Igor Korol, an analyst with the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies, 'Setting up the production of dual-purpose unmanned aerial aircraft on Belarusian soil would certainly contribute to enhancing the defense capabilities of the Union State.' The venture aims to establish a joint civilian drone production, which can be easily converted for military purposes, as stated by Dmitry Pantus, Chairman of the State Military-Industrial Committee of Belarus. The construction of the factory has already begun, with design work underway. 'As far as I know, work to design such a factory and launch its construction is underway already,' said Korol. The joint venture is expected to boost the defense capabilities of the Union State.

**Belarus and Russia Move Towards a Single Legal Space**
The ratification of the agreement 'On the order of mutual enforcement of court decisions of the Republic of Belarus and courts of the Russian Federation' by the Belarusian parliament is a significant step towards forming a single legal space in the Union State. According to Andrei Schmidt, a lawyer and expert in international private law, this process is positive for ordinary citizens and businesses. The agreement will simplify the lives of individuals and businesses by eliminating the need for special procedures to recognize court decisions. Additionally, the use of official documents, such as certificates, diplomas, and notarized copies, will be facilitated. The agreement also allows citizens of Russia and Belarus to work without additional permits and patents. Schmidt emphasizes the importance of unifying the Russian and Belarusian legislation in areas such as commercial activity, trade, investments, and transportation. He also notes that the recent actions of Ukraine and the Baltic states to break off special relations with Russia in the field of international private law have created problems for ordinary people, requiring them to obtain apostilles for official documents.

**Belarus and Russia Develop Model for Financing High-Speed Railway Line Moscow-Brest**
The governments of Belarus and Russia have been instructed to find a model for financing the construction of the high-speed railway line (HSRL) Moscow-Brest. This was announced by the head of the Administration of the President of Belarus, Dmitry Krutoy, on May 28 in Smolensk at a meeting of the High-Level Group (HLG) of the Council of Ministers of the Union State, which he co-chairs. According to Krutoy, the level of personal communication between the leaders of Belarus and Russia sets the tone and direction for the entire union agenda. Krutoy: 'We have a breakthrough project, such as the high-speed railway line Moscow-Brest. It is actively discussed by the presidents of our countries. The corresponding instructions have been given to the governments and our financial regulators to find a model for financing this project. If we can reach a coordinated decision by the end of the year, I think it would be a gem of our agenda,' said Dmitry Krutoy. He characterized the transportation of goods as a good example of bilateral cooperation. 'We continue to actively increase the volume of Belarusian cargo shipments using the infrastructure of Russian ports: the Northwestern region, the Northern Sea Route, and the North-South corridor - three main priorities,' said the head of the Administration of the President. He also reminded that since May 16, the intergovernmental Belarusian-Russian agreement on international road transport has been in operation. 'We have been preparing, coordinating, and ratifying it for a long time. It will significantly simplify access for Russian and Belarusian carriers to the markets of other countries. Every year we will reduce the list of these countries. By 2030, we plan to switch to a full non-permitted system of international road transport of goods,' said Dmitry Krutoy. 'On March 31, the agreement for air carriers on the collection of aeronautical and airport charges and tariffs came into effect.'

**Union State to Allocate 2 Billion Rubles for Cultural and Humanitarian Events in 2025**
The Union State of Russia and Belarus will allocate approximately 2 billion rubles to fund 41 cultural and humanitarian events in 2025, according to Eleanora Bogdan, the deputy general secretary of the Union State's permanent committee. 'We will finance 41 events with a cultural and humanitarian focus, totaling around 2 billion rubles. These events will not only be significant on the territory of the Union State, but also on the territory of the CIS. Examples include the 'Train of Memory' and the youth agenda of the International Forum, which will start in Volgograd soon. All Union State events this year will be held under the auspices of the 80th anniversary of Victory.' Bogdan said at the XIV meeting of the inter-parliamentary commission of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation and the Council of the Republic of the National Assembly of Belarus on inter-regional cooperation in Smolensk. The Ministry of Education of Belarus and Rosmolodezh signed a roadmap for the implementation of youth policy for 2025-2027, which includes 63 events. 'As a result of the implementation of these events, work has begun on preparing a strategy for youth policy of the Union State. Rosmolodezh and the Ministry of Education of Belarus have prepared a protocol decision (...), in which the terms are agreed and clearly defined, that by the II quarter of 2026, a project of the strategy for youth policy of the Union State will be prepared and submitted for consideration to the Supreme State Council,' Bogdan said. Egor Litvinenko, the deputy head of the Federal Agency for Youth Affairs, added that the roadmap includes 63 events in 11 areas: civic and patriotic education, preservation of spiritual and moral values, volunteering, education and science, professional development of youth, culture, sports. 'A very important common task is, of course, the strategy for youth policy of the Union State. A working group is currently being formed to develop the strategy, and the Russian part has been formed and presented to the permanent committee of the Union State in accordance with the presidential instruction,' he added.

**Expert Lazorkina: The Union State Developed Diversely and Multi-Vectoredly from 2021 to 2025**
Belarusian expert Olga Lazorkina believes that the Union State (SG) has developed in a multi-faceted and multi-vector way from 2021 to 2025, achieving successes in important areas. She highlighted three key achievements: the adoption of the concept of security, the approval of the strategy for scientific and technological development until 2035, and the creation of a media company. These steps reflect the creation of a system of strategic planning, she noted. Lazorkina emphasized that the future of the Union State includes 'scientific and technological progress, the sphere of security, and the information space - three of the most important components that are in high demand for all countries.' She added that the SG has already filled this niche for itself. The expert noted that the concept of security for the Union State has fixed a coordinated policy of Belarus and Russia on the international arena. 'Today we see how high the need for this step was. Considering the situation in the region, it is very important to not only coordinate the steps of Belarus and Russia, but also to convey a specific message to our neighbors in the region and on a global level,' she said. The strategy for scientific and technological development confirms that both countries 'look beyond the horizon for several decades and plan their economy and technological progress today,' Lazorkina said. She added that Belarus and Russia are forming their future image and giving a positive example to other partners 'and even those who are not partners today.' Lazorkina also emphasized the importance of introducing all the achievements and different directions of cooperation into a single stream, which she considers a significant and important step. She noted that technological sovereignty is the number one topic in the Union State. 'This is a mega-goal. We are working today within the framework of import substitution projects. And therefore, seeing the horizon of planning, moving from import substitution to technological sovereignty is exactly what can be done within such a document of strategic planning,' she said. Finally, she considered the start of work of the SG media holding to be an important detail in protecting the information space. Lazorkina believes that it is essential to create a special model of the information space for the residents of Belarus and Russia. 'Here we are working not only on the internal field. This step is important because we will be working not only on the internal contour, but also on the external one. We see what information attacks are being carried out by Western countries against Belarus and Russia,' she reminded, adding that this trend will continue. Therefore, Minsk and Moscow need to take the initiative, tell people the truth about their countries.

**Belarus and Russia Form a Unified Transport Space**
Belarus and Russia have finalized the ratification of the intergovernmental agreement on international road transport, signed in 2023. The agreement, which has the force of law, was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The document regulates the transportation of passengers and goods within the Union State, transit, and cabotage. By 2030, Belarus and Russia plan to gradually abolish the permit system for transporting goods to and from third countries. This is a significant step towards the development of a unified transport space of the Union State. According to Natalya Nikonorova, a member of the Committee of the Federation Council on International Affairs, the agreement is aimed at improving international legal regulation of bilateral cooperation, creating favorable conditions for carriers of both countries. 'In the end, Belarus has real opportunities to significantly increase the export of logistics services,' said Andrei Smolyar, chairman of the board of directors of OOO 'Intertransauto'. The agreement allows for cabotage, which will make work on Russian routes more profitable for Belarusian carriers. Belarusian carriers have been waiting for permission to engage in cabotage since the West imposed sanctions on Belarus, which led to a surge in trade and economic relations with Asian countries. 'Cabotage will make work on Russian routes more profitable for Belarusians,' emphasized Tatyana Soldatenko, director of the representative office of 'ATI.SU in Belarus'. However, similar rights are also granted to Russian carriers in Belarus. This is a specific result of union integration and a practical response to Western sanctions against Belarus and Russia. The transportation sector, which accounted for almost half of Belarus' export revenue, had to be significantly restructured due to sanctions. However, according to statistics, carriers were able to adapt to new times by redirecting to other markets. In 2023, the flow of goods from the EU to Belarus decreased by more than half, while the flow from the eastern direction increased by 2.3 times. A similar trend is observed in exports. In 2024, Belarusian entities increased international road transport by 10%. The transport complex of the Union State as a whole exceeded the main indicators for the entire 2023 year by the beginning of December of the same year, noted in the Ministry of Transport of Russia. Belarusian-Russian cooperation is developing in all areas of transport and logistics. The Trans-Siberian Railway, the BAM, the Belarusian Railway, and other transportation systems are working together to implement two-way and transit transportation. As a result, goods from Shanghai to Minsk are delivered in 40-50 days, which is many times faster than by sea. To deliver goods even faster, Belarus and Russia are implementing direct flights from China. Belarus has also increased the export of petroleum products, mineral fertilizers, timber products, and other goods through 20 Russian seaports, from which the goods are shipped to dozens of countries. Thousands of residents of the Union State are using the restored rail communication between Smolensk and Vitebsk, Pskov and Vitebsk regions, the high-speed train 'Luch' on the route Moscow-Minsk, new air routes between Minsk and Samara, Ulyanovsk, Chelyabinsk, Makhachkala, Moscow and Brest, St. Petersburg and Gomel. A joint plan of actions to improve automobile roads is being implemented, and the digitalization of cargo transportation is continuing - all this speaks to the dynamic development of the unified transport system of the Union State.

**Belarusian and Russian Enterprises Have Many Reserves for Joint Activities**
Belarusian and Russian enterprises have many reserves for joint activities, according to Georgy Grits. Alexander Lukashenko emphasized the importance of economic integration, including import substitution, during his speech in the Russian Federation Council: 'Sanctions have even helped us. And with that, we've finally driven their authors into a dead end. In just three years, we've built the contours of industrial and technological sovereignty for decades to come. In the Union State, promising import-substituting investment projects are being implemented. Their implementation allows for the replacement of critical imports, the production of high-tech products.' Despite the different resource potential of Belarus and Russia, our countries organically complement each other, allowing not only more rational use of available resources, but also reducing the time it takes to launch new products into series. The effectiveness of such cooperation has been confirmed in practice when implementing a number of joint Belarusian-Russian import-substituting projects. The importance of this cooperation has increased significantly when implementing much larger flagship projects to ensure the technological sovereignty of the Union State. Successes in this area are evident. Documents are being developed to further develop this area. The Strategy for the Scientific and Technological Development of the Union State and the plan for its implementation until 2035 have been adopted. They contain specific steps to strengthen common technological sovereignty, including the launch of large joint projects for import substitution and the creation of competitive products with high added value. In the development of these documents, Belarusian and Russian agencies have signed a number of sectoral programs in the fields of machine building, microelectronics, and other areas. However, the question of financial support remains unresolved. Therefore, it is necessary to immediately resolve the long-standing problem of equal access for Belarusian and Russian organizations and companies to corresponding programs in the partner country. The problem of equal access to programs in the partner country is particularly relevant for Belarusian companies. For example, in the Russian Federation, a unified regional subsidy is provided to industrial enterprises to cover expenses related to connecting to communal infrastructure, purchasing new equipment, and paying the first installment under a contract for the leasing of equipment with Russian leasing companies. Industrial enterprises can apply for preferential loans to implement investment projects through regional Funds for the Development of Industry (FRI). FRI offers preferential terms for financing projects aimed at producing import-substituting, high-tech, and competitive products, localizing the production of components and auto components, leasing production equipment, machine building, digitization of existing production, producing OPK products of civil or dual-purpose, marking goods, and increasing labor productivity. To implement new industrial projects, the fund provides target loans at interest rates of 3-5% per annum for up to 7 years in the amount of 5 million to 2 billion rubles within the main programs of financing, stimulating the influx of direct investments into the real sector of the economy. FRI also jointly finances projects that require loans up to 200 million rubles, with regional FRI in a ratio of 90% federal funds and 10% regional funds. All these preferences from Russia are also needed by Belarusian companies. The task of removing bureaucratic obstacles for the participation of Belarusian subjects of economic activity in national projects of Russia is particularly important. Currently, 19 national projects are listed on the Russian government's website, which are to be implemented by 2030. Nine of them are projects related to microelectronics, machine building, scientific and technological development. According to the Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, about 40 trillion rubles will be allocated for the implementation of all national projects. Of course, steps are being taken in this direction. Belarusian Minister of Industry Alexander Yefimov reported that an agreement has been reached on the participation of Belarusian partner organizations in several Russian national projects on technological leadership, including 'Means of production and automation', 'Industrial provision of transport mobility', and 'New materials and chemistry'. However, it is worth noting that there are 19 national projects in Russia, so it's too early to be complacent.

**Belarus and Russia Sign 'Guarantees of Security' Agreement, Lukashenko Rules Out Merger**
Russia and Belarus have ratified a 'guarantees of security' agreement as part of the Union State. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko assured that there are no plans for the countries to merge in the near future. Lukashenko met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, according to 24 Kanal citing Belarusian media and the Russian State Duma website. Lukashenko stated, 'Belarus will not become part of Russia in the near future.' However, he did suggest the possibility of creating a unified parliament in the future. The two countries have also signed a protocol allowing Belarusians and Russians to participate in local elections as voters and candidates. The leaders have ratified a 'guarantees of security' agreement in Moscow, which includes the continuation of joint efforts to 'effectively respond to modern challenges and threats in order to strengthen the security of Belarus and Russia within the common defense space of the Union State.' According to the agreement, Belarus will allow the placement of Russian military bases and units on its territory, with a minimum 10-year term and no possibility of early termination. Putin also invited Lukashenko to the May 9th parade, where Belarusian military will participate.

**Belarus and Russia Synchronize Programs to Support High-Tech Companies**
Belarus and Russia are synchronizing their programs to support high-tech companies. The areas of cooperation were discussed at the High Technologies Park (HTP) during a meeting with representatives of the Russian company 'Innopraktika' in the presence of the Permanent Committee of the Union State, reports BELTA. Natalia Popova, first deputy general director of 'Innopraktika', said that Belarus has a huge potential in the IT sector. 'We would like to synchronize the support programs for Russian and Belarusian high-tech, conduct joint selection of champions, and raise the project to the level of the Union State,' she said. The first step could be the joint forum. Another promising direction is the creation of a joint venture, localization of Russian companies on the Belarusian market and vice versa. Successful examples of cooperation already exist. Alexander Bazanov, head of the secretariat of the supervisory board of HTP, said that this year the park will mark its 20th anniversary. 'We have our own school of preparing champions. Over 20 years, we have done a lot in this direction, and Belarusian IT companies are known worldwide. We are proud of this,' he said. 'In the framework of the Union State, new opportunities are opening up. It's time to bring our standards together and look to the future. Together, we will be able to achieve more.' The Russian delegation visited HTP last year on an introductory visit. Today's meeting discussed how to combine efforts, resources, and competencies. State Secretary of the Union State Dmitry Mezenkov drew attention to the task set by the presidents of the two countries: to spend each ruble of the Union budget as economically and effectively as possible. 'That's why the programs and projects of the Union State must be maximally integrated into the overall work being done by the governments of our countries, ministries, and agencies to ensure proper competitiveness of products. First and foremost, in the high-tech sphere. The meeting on the HTP platform, where resident companies can offer cooperation in one form or another, is an important milestone for us,' he said. He also reminded about the work on creating a Union State University of High Technologies, plans to organize the next Forum of Engineering and Technological Universities of the SG. All these events are aimed at forming a single scientific and technological space of the Union State by 2030.

**Shpakovsky on the Guarantees of Security in the Union State**
The ratification of the Agreement on Guarantees of Security between Belarus and the Russian Federation is a significant step in the development of security in our country, said Alexander Shpakovsky, a deputy of the National Assembly. The agreement strengthens guarantees of security in the nuclear sphere. According to Shpakovsky, the document is strategic and fundamental, and its role and significance are obvious not only for the defense capabilities of Belarus, but also for the Russian Federation. The expert noted that Belarus is the only military ally of Russia on the western borders, and directly 'touches' three NATO states and hostile Ukraine. Therefore, Belarus and Russia are mutually strengthening each other, creating necessary normative-legal frameworks. Shpakovsky explained that this was preceded by a certain sequence of actions: the Constitution of Belarus was changed in 2022, excluding the norm about the non-nuclear status, followed by negotiations between the heads of state, and in 2023, tactical nuclear weapons were moved to the territory of Belarus. 'The mechanism of its application is already agreed upon by the leaders of the states, our military have undergone corresponding training, and we have been transferred operational-tactical missile systems 'Iskander-M', capable of carrying a warhead,' said the Belarusian parliamentarian. 'And, of course, such aspects require legal formalization. In addition, the action of the Agreement on Guarantees of Security is much broader than just the use of all forces and means to ensure the defense capabilities of the Union State. In the event of external aggression, there is also an economic component and a certain order of actions. In general, our military have taken asymmetric measures, allowing Belarus not to get involved in the arms race. Because in Poland, for example, military spending for last year was from 35 to 40 billion dollars.' Shpakovsky noted that the military-political situation in the region remains tense, and even current peacekeeping processes between Russia and the US are taking place against the backdrop of NATO's plans to increase military spending to 5%. 'We cannot and do not want to react to the actions of the West symmetrically and turn the country into an arsenal,' said the deputy. 'We have a compact and combat-ready army, and in recent years we have significantly increased its capabilities. But we need a strong argument. And this strong argument is the union with the superpower - the Russian Federation, which has a comparable potential for nuclear deterrence with the US. And that's how we consider the possibilities for ensuring the defense capabilities of our state today.'

**Federation Council to Consider Law Extending Maternity Capital Program**
The Federation Council will consider a law to extend the maternity capital program until the end of 2030. According to the government, approximately 4.9 million families will acquire the right to maternity capital in 2027-2030. The program's current period of action is limited to December 31, 2026. The government estimates that around 2.8 trillion rubles will be needed to implement the program in this period. The extension of the program was previously proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in his address to the Federal Assembly. The Council will also discuss a law limiting distance learning in medical and pharmaceutical education, except in cases specified by federal educational standards, which will be developed by the Ministry of Health. Additionally, the Council will consider the ratification of the agreement with Belarus on security guarantees within the Union State. The agreement states that Russia and Belarus will not direct their relations within the Union State against other countries and will be carried out in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter and other norms of international law. The agreement also establishes that a military attack on a country participating in the Union State will be considered an act of aggression against the Union State as a whole. The agreement also provides for the possibility of creating military facilities and deploying Russian military formations on the territory of Belarus to prevent acts of aggression. The agenda also includes amendments to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, clarifying responsibility for intentional destruction of property, amendments to the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation in terms of establishing responsibility for unauthorized cabotage transportation, and a law on providing children of FSI employees with priority admission to universities.

**State Duma to Discuss Agreement with Belarus on Security Guarantees and Extension of Maternal Capital Program**
The State Duma plans to discuss the ratification of the agreement with Belarus on security guarantees within the Union State, as well as consider in the second reading the draft laws on extending the program of maternal capital until December 31, 2030, and on the right of the Central Bank to annually determine the list of foreign currencies for the payment of the charter capital of credit organizations. The agreement with Belarus on security guarantees, signed in Minsk on December 6, 2024, was submitted to the State Duma for ratification in February by Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the text of the agreement, nuclear weapons of the Russian Federation may be used in response to the use of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction against Russia or Belarus, 'as well as in the event of aggression against any of the parties using conventional weapons, creating a critical threat to its sovereignty or territorial integrity.' The sides consider a military attack on a participant in the Union State as an act of aggression against the Union State as a whole and will take corresponding countermeasures using all the forces and means at their disposal. As noted by the Chairman of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, the task of the deputies is to implement the decisions made at the level of the heads of the Union State. He emphasized that in the conditions of modern challenges, questions of ensuring security within a common defense space acquire key importance. The extension of the program of maternal capital The draft law on extending the program of maternal capital until December 31, 2030, was submitted to the State Duma by the Russian government in December 2024. Changes are proposed to be made to the Law 'On Additional Measures of State Support for Families with Children.' As stated in the explanatory note, about 5 million Russian families will have the right to maternal capital from 2027 to 2030. According to preliminary estimates, the implementation of the draft law will require additional expenses from the budget in 2027-2030 in the total amount of 2.776 trillion rubles. Volodin previously emphasized that support for families with children, future parents is a priority in the work of the deputies. He said that despite challenges, threats, and Western sanctions, the state fulfills not only all its obligations but also implements additional measures of support for citizens. The Chairman of the State Duma noted that this is the result of the work of the political system and the economic model created by the President of the Russian Federation. The right of the Central Bank to determine currencies for bank capital The State Duma will also consider a draft law granting the Board of Directors of the Central Bank the right to annually determine the list of foreign currencies that can be used to pay the charter capital of credit organizations, insurance organizations, and non-state pension funds. The document is initiated by a group of deputies and senators led by the Chairman of the Committee of the State Duma on the Financial Market, Anatoly Aksakov. The list of such currencies, presumably, may include the currencies of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries - Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Belarus, the currencies of the BRICS countries, including the Chinese yuan (currently allowed for use) and the Indian rupee, as well as the currencies of Brazil, South Africa, Argentina, Egypt, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Ethiopia.
