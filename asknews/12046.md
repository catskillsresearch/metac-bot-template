**Starmer Strengthens UK's Anti-Russia Stance: 'We Must Be Ready for War'**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has outlined a new military and defense strategy, focusing on the 'threat' posed by Russia. He stated, 'If we want to deter a conflict, the best way is to prepare for a conflict.' The strategy includes plans for 12 new nuclear-powered submarines, massive investments in munitions, and a command center for coordinating cyberattacks against Russia and China. The opposition Tory party and conservative media are skeptical, noting that Starmer remains vague on resources and has made a 'half-step back' on the timeline for increasing military spending from 2.5% to 3% of GDP, now aiming for 2034 instead of 2027. Starmer emphasized the need for national unity in the face of an increasingly unstable and dangerous world. The three main objectives of the new strategy are to make the country 'ready for war,' strengthen NATO, and accelerate military innovation to make the UK a 'leader among allies.' Specific plans include building six new munitions factories, creating a hybrid coordination center for the Royal Navy, and investing £15 billion in modernizing the nuclear arsenal.

**UK to build up to 12 new attack submarines**
The UK will build 'up to' 12 new attack submarines to replace the Astute class from the late 2030s onwards, according to the prime minister's announcement. The new submarines will be conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered, and will keep 'Britain and Nato safe for decades', as stated by Sir Keir. The government will also spend £15bn on its nuclear warhead program and commit to increasing UK defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027. The review will make 62 recommendations, which the government is expected to accept in full. The Labour party has committed to increasing defence spending to 3% of national income by 2034, but the Conservatives say this should be met by the end of the decade. The review will also include other announcements, such as £1.5bn to build six new factories for 'always on' munitions production capacity, building up to 7,000 long-range weapons, and setting up a 'cyber and electromagnetic command' to boost the military's defensive and offensive capabilities in cyberspace.

**UK must change approach to defence in an insecure world, Starmer warns**
Sir Keir Starmer has warned that the UK must change its approach to defence in a changing world, which is more unstable and insecure than before. The Labour leader said that the world has changed and the UK needs to be ready, citing a 'new era' of instability on defence and security. The Government has pledged to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, but Starmer refused to guarantee that defence spending would reach 3% of GDP by 2034, calling it an 'ambition'. The strategic defence review will support regions across the UK, with 70% of defence jobs outside of London and the South East. The review will also commit to building up to 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines, investing £15 billion in the warhead programme, and boosting weapons and equipment stockpiles. However, the Conservatives and Lib Dems have questioned Labour's commitment to funding the promises it was making.

**UK PM: We can't ignore Russian threat**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that Britain cannot ignore the threat posed by Russia, citing the conflict in Ukraine as an example. The UK will increase military spending to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. This move is part of a broader effort to deter Russia and bolster Europe's defenses. NATO chief Mark Rutte is expected to discuss a commitment to spend at least 3.5 percent of GDP on defense at an upcoming meeting. Robert Jenrick, a Conservative Party spokesman, called for the government to be more ambitious and raise spending to 3 percent of national income by 2029, stating, 'We think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation.'

**PM Starmer:  warns UK must prepare for war to prevent it**
Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a significant shift in the United Kingdom's military strategy, prioritizing 'war-fighting readiness' and deterrence amid global instability and rising threats from Russia. Starmer unveiled plans to boost defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034 and 'innovate and accelerate at a war-time pace,' citing Russia's aggression and global tensions as reasons to invest heavily in military capabilities. 'We cannot ignore the threat Russia poses,' he said. 'To deter war, we must be prepared for it.' The strategy includes plans for new submarines, expanded munitions manufacturing, and reaffirmed NATO-first commitments. Opposition voices have emerged, with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch challenging the adequacy of Starmer's budget timeline and the Liberal Democrats arguing the UK must move faster and spend more immediately.

**Labour accused of making an embarrassing retreat on defence spending**
Labour's Defence Secretary, John Healey, has been accused of making an embarrassing retreat on defence spending after downgrading a commitment to spend 3% of GDP on national security by 2034 to a mere 'ambition'. Just 72 hours after saying Britain 'will spend' such an amount 'in the next Parliament', Healey told the BBC that it was only an 'ambition'. Critics warn that the 10-year plan is likely to prove unaffordable without a hike to 3%. The Ministry of Defence has announced plans to build up to 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines to boost the Royal Navy's commitment to the Aukus Pacific defence partnership, but the first of these submarines is not expected to enter service before the late 2030s. Labour has been accused of weakening UK security by the Conservatives, who say that the promises on submarines are a 'fantasy fleet' without real money to back them up.

**Rachel Reeves as unpopular as 'Lettuce' Liz Truss's chancellor during mini-Budget chaos - Daily Star**
A new poll shows that Chancellor Rachel Reeves inspires as little public confidence as Kwasi Kwarteng did during the mini-Budget chaos. Just over half of voters (51%) think Ms Reeves is doing a 'bad job' at the Treasury, while only 16% think she is doing a 'good job'. This is similar to the outcome of a poll in September 2022, where 53% of the public felt Mr Kwarteng was doing a 'bad job'. Ms Reeves has faced criticism for her decisions, including raising employer National Insurance contributions and removing the winter fuel payment from millions of pensioners. However, despite her poor personal ratings, Labour remains the most trusted party on economic affairs, with 20% of voters saying they trust Labour to manage the nation's finances.

**UK seeks to send message to Moscow as it outlines higher defence spending**
The UK is set to increase its defense spending by 13 billion pounds (USD 17 billion) per year, aiming to reach 2.5% of national income by 2027 and 3% in the early 2030s. Defence Secretary John Healey said this is 'a message to Moscow' and will make the UK's armed forces stronger and its industrial base more resilient. The move comes as the UK responds to a strategic defence review, which is expected to make recommendations for dealing with the new threat environment, both on the military front and in cyberspace. Healey also stated that Russia is 'attacking the UK daily' with 90,000 cyber attacks from state-linked sources over the last two years, and a cyber command will be set up to counter such threats. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary for the Conservative Party, welcomed the pledge but expressed scepticism about the Treasury's ability to deliver, calling for more ambitious spending targets.

**The U.K. seeks to send a message to Moscow as it outlines higher defense spending**
The U.K. is set to increase its defense spending by 13 billion pounds ($17 billion) per year, aiming to reach 2.5% of national income by 2027 and 3% by the early 2030s. This move is seen as a message to Moscow, according to British Defense Secretary John Healey. The increase in spending will transform the country's military, which has been in decline for decades. Healey stated, 'This is a message to Moscow,' and 'This is Britain standing behind, making our armed forces stronger but making our industrial base stronger, and this is part of our readiness to fight, if required.' The U.K. has been compelled to review its defense spending since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Additionally, the government will establish a cyber command to counter state-linked cyber attacks, which have targeted the U.K.'s defense over the last two years. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary for the Conservative Party, welcomed the pledge but expressed skepticism about the Treasury's ability to deliver, calling for more ambitious spending targets.

**Boris Johnson may return as Badenoch becomes unpopular**
Conservative Party officials are planning to replace Kemi Badenoch with Boris Johnson as the party leader, according to the UK's Sun. The move comes after the party's loss of 674 council seats in the May 1 local elections and a significant dip in poll ratings. A Tory official was quoted as saying, 'We keep sharpening our knives and putting them back down again. Things are pretty grim.' Johnson, the former UK prime minister, is seen as the party's best chance of beating Nigel Farage's Reform UK in the elections. However, under party rules, Badenoch's position cannot be challenged until 12 months after she became Conservative leader, which could be in November. Officials are considering other options, including mass calls for resignation by members of the shadow cabinet, with Robert Jenrick and Laura Trott being considered as potential replacements.

**'Kennedy Agyapong can help NPP win power in 2028' - Kwasi Kwarteng opines**
Former Ministry of Education Spokesperson, Kwasi Kwarteng, believes that Kennedy Agyapong, a former Member of Parliament for Assin Central, presents a unique advantage to the New Patriotic Party (NPP) in its bid to win the 2028 elections. Kwarteng stated that in the current climate, where the NPP is expanding its delegate base from 230,000 to potentially over 700,000, it is essential for all aspirants to strengthen their appeal and connection with the grassroots. He noted that former Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia is likely to contest, and acknowledged other potential candidates, including Kennedy Agyapong and former Minister of Education Dr Yaw Adutwum. Kwarteng emphasized that the final decision will rest with party delegates and that whoever wins will receive the full backing of the party. 'If he [Kennedy Agyapong] doesn't win, then as a loyal party member, I will throw my support behind whoever emerges victorious,' he said.

**UK and EU Reach Significant Agreement on Post-Brexit Relations**
The UK and EU have reached a significant agreement on post-Brexit relations, canceling some trade barriers and cooperating on defense issues. The agreement, announced on May 19, 2025, is the most important reset of bilateral relations since the UK's departure from the EU in 2020. According to the agreement, the UK and EU will extend mutual fishing rights for over 10 years, until 2038, and work towards a food and agriculture standards agreement to eliminate most border checks. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hopes to reduce trade obstacles and boost the economy. The UK will also seek to rejoin the EU's Erasmus+ exchange program and establish a youth visa program. The EU will remove obstacles and allow UK citizens to use electronic border gates, and relax restrictions on cultural workers crossing borders. UK Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said, 'This is a real reward for the UK.' The agreement includes a defense and security agreement, which establishes a bilateral platform for cooperation in various areas, including intelligence sharing, maritime and space security. The EU has also committed to expediting the UK's participation in the joint defense procurement fund. The six-page joint statement reaffirms support for Ukraine's resistance to Russian aggression. The statement also outlines a regular policy dialogue between the UK's Foreign and Defense Secretary and the EU's High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy. The agreement aims to prevent illegal migration across the English Channel and reduce pressure on the UK government. 'This is a significant agreement that will benefit both the UK and the EU,' said a spokesperson for the UK government.

**NPP's Kwasi Kwarteng clashes with Kwame Jantuah on live TV over galamsey**
Kwasi Kwarteng, a former spokesperson for the Ministry of Education and member of the NPP communication team, clashed with Kwame Jantuah, a legal practitioner and political analyst, on live TV over the government's approach to combating illegal mining. Kwarteng accused Jantuah of softening his stance on the fight against galamsey under the John Mahama-led administration, claiming that Jantuah's utterances give him away as a sympathizer of the NDC rather than the CPP. Kwarteng questioned Jantuah's objectivity, demanding that he equally criticize the NDC government just as he did during the tenure of former President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo. He told Jantuah to desist from citing Akufo-Addo in his discourse on illegal mining, stressing that Mahama must take full responsibility to end the menace. 'Let's not make it appear as if he is giving some sort of objective view. He has never been objective. Nana Jantuah here, all of a sudden, has shifted from his medical stance. Before the [2024] elections, Nana Jantuah was the one who was consistently reminding us that people were giving birth to still birth and some children were born with defects. Now that the NDC is in power, you are changing your stance. Galamsey is not 8 years old. Even John Mahama failed in his first term. Now President Mahama is in power. Instead of looking into the guy's face and telling him that it's 3 months but how you're treating the galamsey issue hasn't really helped, you're changing your stance. Instead of you telling him that if you take this tangent, you're bound to fail - so, sit up - you're not doing that but you're dragging Akufo-Addo into it. Akufo-Addo will not come and fix galamsey for you,' he said.

**Kwarsi Kwarteng and why the Tories are in the Mire.**
Kwarsi Kwarteng's recent radio interview with Alistair Campbell and Rory Stewart was described as 'vacuous' and 'pathetic'. Kwarteng's comments, including his assertion that Liz Truss was a competent politician due to her ability to generate headlines, were criticized as 'nonsense'. The interview was seen as an embarrassment for Kwarteng, who was accused of opening the door to extremist elements in the Conservative Party, potentially paving the way for figures like Nigel Farage. The article concludes that Kwarteng's budget under Truss was a disaster and that the Conservative government under Badenoch is a shadow of its former self.

**'Welfare reforms threaten to alienate Labour's own voting coalition' - LabourList**
According to Ipsos' snap-polling, half of the public (51%) thinks Rachel Reeves is doing a bad job as Chancellor, a 7-percentage point increase from last month. This is now just short of the verdict delivered to Kwasi Kwarteng after his infamous 'mini-Budget' when he registered a 53% disapproval rating. The public's reaction shows Reeves has failed in her mission to inspire optimism, with three in five (57%) saying the Spring Statement has left them more concerned about Britain's economy than reassured. The welfare reforms announced in the Statement are particularly divisive, with around one in three (36%) supporting reducing welfare spending by changing disability, sickness and universal credit benefits, while the same proportion oppose it (35%). Labour voters are less supportive of the reforms than 2024 Conservatives (36% vs. 48%). Labour now needs to get on with delivering on their promises to their voters, as angering Labour MPs and alienating their own voting coalition is a real challenge the party is facing.

**Conservative Party Leader Kemi Badenoch Launches New Policy to Regain Public Trust**
British Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has launched a new policy to regain public trust, which the party lost two years ago and ended in a disastrous election last summer. Badenoch held two press conferences, one in London and the other in Bicester, Oxfordshire, to announce the party's new strategy. The choice of locations reflects the party's plan to focus on national issues, such as the economy and long-term challenges facing the country, ahead of the 2029 general election. The party is also preparing for local council elections in 36 days. Badenoch, who is known for her straight-talking style, has given several radio and TV interviews, as well as written articles in major newspapers, co-authored by three generations of Conservative MPs, some of whom were ministers in the late Margaret Thatcher's governments. The message is to return to the traditional Conservative line that is preferred by the British middle class. The test of the new policy's success will be in the local council elections, so Badenoch and her team are focusing on being honest with voters by abandoning some of the party's policies in recent years, especially since politics in parliamentary democracies starts with the local voter, even if the government's policy is global. One of the most significant changes in the Conservative Party's policy is the abandonment of the goal of achieving zero carbon emissions (equating the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by fossil fuel vehicles with the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by trees or removed from the atmosphere) that led to a decline in the economy, job losses, and high fuel costs reflected in prices and inflation. The Conservatives are following market indicators and their impact on the national economy, noting that major oil companies (such as Shell and British Petroleum) have stopped investing in green energy projects and are directing their work towards traditional fossil fuel extraction policies that ensure continuity and stability for consumers and the economy. The previous Labour government's climate change law, passed 17 years ago, aimed to end 80% of fossil fuel emissions by 2030, relying on renewable energy sources. However, 'the future' is catching up with us quickly, as known by the elderly, and economic numbers for 2030 or 2050 (the target year for the Conservatives to achieve zero carbon emissions in their 2019 amendment to the law) have shown that the costs are astronomical, many times more than the numbers in 2008. A small number of MPs opposed the rush to commit to a policy with uncertain consequences for industry and the economy, while countries like China (zero carbon by 2060), India (zero carbon by 2070), the US (2050 before Trump), and Russia (zero carbon by 2060) contribute 63% of global carbon emissions, while the UK contributes only 1%. The ideological obsession with this policy has cost the UK many heavy industries such as steel and aluminum, which are now imported from China, while the only remaining oil refinery in Scotland has been converted into an import terminal for products that the country used to produce until recently. Badenoch has shown the courage of her idol Margaret Thatcher, making the Conservatives the first major party to admit to the public that the facts and numbers that other parties hide are true. The reliance on fossil fuels since the discovery of coal, then oil and gas, has been and remains the main reason for the progress of industrialized countries and economic development, as well as the boom in global trade. As the first politician to challenge the official narrative and the widespread belief in British media, Badenoch has overcome her aversion to appearing on TV screens (she was criticized for being more suited to TV appearances than the stage of politics by the leader of the right-wing Reform Party, Nigel Farage, who is winning Conservative votes) to face the voter with the need to reconsider environmental policies. By coincidence, a fire broke out in the electrical substation that powers Heathrow Airport on Thursday night, causing its closure and the cancellation of around 1,350 flights, affecting global flights throughout Friday. Heathrow has diesel generators as a backup to electricity; critics accuse the airport management of selling the generators and replacing them with green generators that run on biofuel, as part of the policy of abandoning fossil fuels and committing to zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Ministry of Transport was satisfied with saying that the diesel generators exist but are not working properly, before starting an investigation to find the cause.

**Conservative Party Members Plan to Push for Liz Truss's Resignation**
Some Conservative Party members in the UK parliament are unhappy with the policies of Prime Minister Liz Truss and are planning to push for her resignation, according to Politico. The party's rules state that a prime minister cannot be voted out of office in their first year, but members are discussing changing these rules. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng, who was fired by Truss on October 14, has also hinted at her potential early departure. High-ranking officials at Downing Street have also expressed concerns about Truss's tenure. 'The party's rules state that a prime minister cannot be voted out of office in their first year, but members are discussing changing these rules,' Politico notes. 'This is a sign of growing discontent within the Conservative Party,' said a source. 'The party is not happy with the direction the government is taking, and there are concerns about the prime minister's leadership.'

**Liz Truss 'lacked self-awareness needed to be PM', says former lover**
Liz Truss 'lacked the self-awareness' needed to be prime minister, according to her former lover, Mark Field. Field, a former Tory minister, had an 18-month affair with Truss in 2003, which ended his marriage. He described her as 'exhilarating' and 'manic', but also listed several character traits that made her unsuitable for the role. Field said Truss lacked self-awareness, inspirational leadership, and the capacity to focus on policy implementation. He also criticized her for 'talking a good game' about cutting taxes and promoting economic growth, but 'actually delivering next to nothing'. Field's comments come after Truss's ill-fated mini-budget and her subsequent sacking of Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, which led to her losing her seat in the 2024 general election.

**Fund Managers Turn to Politics: A Growing Trend?**
Several high-profile fund managers have left their positions to pursue careers in politics. One notable example is Kwasi Kwarteng, the UK's shortest-serving Chancellor, who served from September 6, 2022, to October 12, 2022. Before entering politics, Kwarteng worked at Crispin Odey's boutique fund, East Capital. Another example is Anthony Scaramucci, who was briefly the White House Communications Director under Trump, but was fired after criticizing the administration. Scaramucci has since returned to managing funds, while also advocating for Joe Biden's presidency. Neel Kashkari, who worked at PIMCO and managed funds, is now the President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve. Aivaras Abromavicius, a Lithuanian native, was appointed Minister of Economy in Ukraine in 2014, but resigned in 2016. He returned to politics in 2019 and is now focused on pension investments in Lithuania. Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur, founded the 'anti-woke' Strive Asset Management, which challenged ESG criteria and advocated for fossil fuel companies. Ramaswamy has since run for president and supported Trump, and is now a director at the Department of Government Efficiency. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a UK Conservative politician, cofounded Somerset Capital with Dominic Johnson. Rees-Mogg began his career at Lloyd George Management before founding Somerset, and has since been involved in various political roles, including a brief stint as a campaign director for government efficiency. After losing his parliamentary seat in 2024, Rees-Mogg appeared in a reality show about his family. Dominic Johnson, who remained at Somerset after Rees-Mogg's departure, entered politics in 2022 and is now co-president of the Conservative Party.
