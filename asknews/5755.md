**FO° Exclusive: US Budget and US-China Tariff Deal Unleash New Economic Uncertainty**
The US House of Representatives has passed a budget bill that will increase the country's debt by trillions of dollars. The bill, which was passed by a single vote, extends corporate and individual tax cuts, cancels green energy incentives, and tightens eligibility for health and food programs for the poor. The bill also funds Trump's crackdown on immigration and loosens regulations on firearm silencers. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will increase the US government's deficit by $3.4 trillion by 2034. The US debt has already reached 124% of the GDP. Markets are worried about growing US debt, and the dollar has depreciated, which could add to inflationary pressures. The bill still has to go through the Senate and will have global consequences. Additionally, the US and China have agreed to a trade truce, with the US decreasing extra tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% and China removing non-tariff barriers on American goods and decreasing extra tariffs to 10%. The US tariffs on Chinese goods will remain about 40%, while Chinese tariffs on American goods will be 25%. The US administration is divided between Bessenomics, a more transactional take on traditional Republican economics, and Navaronomics, a more isolationist and protectionist economic policy. Bessenomics aims to use tariffs as a transactional tool to gain greater market access into China, while Navaronomics seeks a total reordering of global trade through punitive tariffs.

**US & China's Combined GDP Equals 184 Countries**
The combined GDP of the U.S. and China equals that of 184 countries, with a total of around $50 trillion. The U.S. has a GDP of approximately $31 trillion, while China's GDP is around $19 trillion. According to experts, despite the rise of regional trade, there is no escaping the economic influence of these two giants. The U.S. is the world's largest importer of consumer goods, and China is the largest exporter, making them the dominant trading partners for most countries. As noted by Pallavi Rao, 'there is no escaping one of the two economic giants.'

**US-China Trade War: Who Will Be the Dominant Power?**
The trade war between the US and China has raised questions about who will be the dominant power in the future. The US has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, but China has retaliated with its own tariffs. The situation has led to a decline in trade between the two countries, with the US experiencing a trade deficit of $700 billion in 2025. In contrast, China has a trade surplus of $700 billion, with a focus on exporting electronics and other goods. The US has a large national debt of $35 trillion, while China's debt is $15 trillion, but its total debt is 300% of its GDP. According to the IMF, China is expected to become the largest contributor to global growth in the next five years, with a 23% share. The US is still expected to be a major contributor, but its share is expected to decline. The two countries have different economic systems, with the US relying heavily on services, while China relies on industry. The US has a strong military, with over 6,100 tanks and 40,000 armored vehicles, while China has a large military with over 3.3 million soldiers and 3,260 aircraft. The US has a strong navy, with 490 ships, including 11 aircraft carriers, while China has a large navy with 777 ships. The US has a strong defense budget, with $740 billion in 2025, while China's defense budget is $178 billion. According to a report by the Telegraph, China has surpassed the US in terms of military strength, with over 1 million soldiers and a larger navy. The US is concerned about China's rapid military modernization, including its nuclear capabilities. The trade war between the US and China is not just about tariffs, but also about the future of the global economy and the balance of power between the two countries.

**Jamie Dimon warns that the US’s biggest problem is not China but ‘the enemy within’**
Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, warned that the US's biggest problem is not China, but 'the enemy within', referring to the country's internal issues such as mismanagement, debt, and a lack of capability. Dimon stated that the US has added $10 trillion in debt in five years, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 100% and a deficit of almost 7%. He emphasized that the US needs to 'get its act together' and fix various issues, including regulations, permitting, immigration, taxation, inner city schools, and the healthcare system, in order to grow at a rate of 3% per year. Dimon also criticized the US's mismanagement, saying that it is 'extraordinary' and will 'kill us' if not addressed. He noted that China is a potential adversary, but the US's internal problems are a greater concern. Dimon's comments come amid a sharp decline in trade between China and the US following the implementation of tariffs.

**US and China to Meet to Resolve Trade Dispute over Minerals**
The US Treasury Secretary, Bessent, believes that US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will speak to resolve trade issues, including a dispute over essential minerals. 'I think we'll see something very soon,' Bessent said, in the context of new attacks made by President Trump, accusing China of violating an agreement to reduce tariffs and trade restrictions on essential minerals. The two countries agreed to temporarily reduce 'reciprocal tariffs' between them for 90 days. US tariffs on Chinese imports will decrease from 145% to 30%, while Chinese tariffs on US products will fall from 125% to 10%. 'I'm confident that when President Trump and President Xi speak, this will be resolved,' Bessent continued. 'But the fact that they are holding onto some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement - perhaps it's a flaw in the Chinese system, perhaps it's intentional. We'll see after the President speaks with President Xi.' The interview was given to CBS. Last Friday, Trump said he was certain he would speak with President Xi Jinping. China said in April that the two leaders had not spoken recently. China is at the forefront of countries with a non-hegemonic foreign policy towards the US. Some statistical data also explains the fear of Americans. In 2024, for example, China was among the top 10 countries with the highest growth rate - 5%, according to official numbers. The first place was held by India (6.5%), followed by the Philippines (5.6%), Malaysia (5.1%), Indonesia (5.0%) and China (5.0%). In 2024, China's GDP totaled around 134.9 trillion yuan, equivalent to around $17 trillion to $19 trillion. In the first quarter of 2025, China's economy grew 5.4% compared to the same period last year. The market estimated a 5.1% increase in China's GDP (with Reuters). China was also one of the countries that most defended the expansion of the BRICS, hosted in the Asian country. One of the main debates within the bloc is the use of a common currency, which reduces dependence on the dollar for commercial transactions. Currently, the BRICS is formed by Russia, India, China, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Iran. The BRICS also includes partner countries - Belarus, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda and Uzbekistan.

**China's steady economy: fostering global certainty amid turbulence**
China's economy has shown remarkable resilience and maintained steady growth, with a 5.4% year-on-year GDP increase in the first quarter of 2025. The country's industrial added value, services sector index, and retail sales rose by 6.1%, 6%, and 5.1% respectively. International media have commended China's economic performance as 'exceeding expectations', 'resilient', and 'steadfast.' China's continued economic resilience and growth can be attributed to its solid foundation, diverse advantages, and notable resilience. The country's immense consumption potential, innovation-driven growth, favourable business environment, and competitive edge have all contributed to its economic stability. China's relatively sound fiscal status also provides ample space to cushion external shocks. As President Xi Jinping pointed out, 'Believing in China is believing in a better tomorrow.' China will remain a pillar of stability and certainty in an increasingly uncertain world.

**World Economic Forum Warns of Global Economic Fragility**
The World Economic Forum's 'Chief Economists Outlook' report highlights growing concerns about the fragility of the global economy. Based on a survey conducted between April 3 and 17, 2025, the report collects the perspectives of chief economists from the public and private sectors. Experts warn that the state of the global economy will significantly deteriorate, mainly due to abrupt changes in US commercial policy. The US has imposed historic tariff increases, including a 10% general tariff and up to 145% on Chinese products. China has retaliated with export restrictions on strategic minerals. Although a 90-day pause in the tariff escalation was agreed upon, experts believe that uncertainty persists. The report states that US commercial policy decisions are perceived as a long-term structural change, not a temporary disruption. 79% of surveyed economists share this view. The risks are not limited to the US. In Europe, a weak growth persists, but signs of recovery are seen, driven by more expansive fiscal policies, particularly in Germany. In China, the 5% growth target is met with skepticism, with the IMF reducing its projections to 4% due to internal and external factors affecting demand and the dynamism of the real estate sector. In Latin America, the situation is equally challenging, with a 2% growth expectation for 2025, down from 2.4% in the previous year. The report highlights the growing fragmentation of the global economy, with 98% of economists expecting it to accelerate in the remainder of the year. 94% anticipate that economic nationalism will increasingly influence policy decisions. The uncertainty has led to a paralysis in business decision-making, with 87% of experts believing that companies are delaying strategic investments, reorganizing supply chains, and diversifying operations to reduce risks. The uncertainty has become a structural feature of the global economy, with over 80% of surveyed economists rating it as 'very high' and only a slight majority expecting it to decrease in the next year. The areas most affected will be trade, GDP growth, and foreign direct investment. In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a double-edged factor. While 45% expect it to be disruptive in 2025, 81% believe it can contribute between 1 and 10 percentage points to global growth in the next decade. However, its impact on employment is uncertain, with 47% anticipating net job losses and only 19% expecting net gains. The most promising areas are automation of tasks and acceleration of innovation. The report concludes that AI can become the main driver of economic innovation if it is properly channeled, but also warns of associated risks, such as market concentration, unemployment, increased inequality, and disinformation. Governments and companies must prepare to integrate AI into their operations, with 89% of economists believing it is essential to invest in AI infrastructure and 75% seeing a need for public investment in training and labor retraining. Businesses should prioritize redesigning processes, improving data infrastructure, and strengthening cybersecurity.

**IMF Warns of Rising Global Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that the global government debt-to-GDP ratio will exceed the peak reached during the COVID-19 pandemic by 2030. The IMF attributes this to the uncertainty caused by the US's trade policies and the ongoing wars around the world. According to the IMF's 'Fiscal Monitor' report, the global government debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to reach 99.6% by 2030, up from 92.3% in 2024. The US, China, France, and Brazil are expected to lead the increase in debt. The US's government debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise from 122.5% in 2024 to 128.2% by 2030. China's debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise from 88.3% in 2024 to 116.0% by 2030. South Korea's debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise from 52.5% in 2024 to 59.2% by 2030. The IMF warns that the global economy will be severely affected if the global supply chain is disrupted and the growth rates of the US and China decline simultaneously. The IMF also emphasizes the need for countries to strengthen their fiscal resilience by implementing targeted fiscal adjustments, reducing debt, rebuilding fiscal buffers, and responding flexibly to emergency spending needs, and securing sustainable growth foundations.

**Silver price points to upside potential as gold/silver ratio soars**
The silver price has struggled to keep up with the gold price, which has surged by over 25% since the beginning of the year. The gold/silver ratio has risen above 100, a level last seen during the COVID-19 era in 2020. However, experts believe that silver has untapped upside potential, particularly if a US-China trade deal is reached, which would lower the gold/silver ratio. The global goal of reducing carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050 is also expected to bolster silver's demand outlook in the medium to long-term. Meanwhile, the US dollar has capped its gains due to underwhelming US economic data, including a 0.3% contraction in Q1'25 GDP and a 3.6% headline PCE. Investors are eyeing the jobs report on Friday amid concerns that Trump's aggressive tariffs will slow economic growth and increase inflation.

**Aging demographic unleashing consumption potential**
China is leveraging its vast domestic market and industrial infrastructure to grow the silver economy, which is projected to see over 400 million people aged 60 and above by 2035. Analysts said that China's experience can offer insights for other developing countries, as the country is not only improving the well-being of senior citizens but also unlocking new avenues for economic growth and innovation. According to Zhang Ming, deputy director of the Institute of Finance and Banking, China has a relatively complete industrial chain, supply chain, and innovation capacity, which will drive the silver economy forward. By 2035, the silver economy might grow from 7 trillion yuan ($970 billion) in 2024 to 30 trillion yuan, and elderly consumption is predicted to reach 40-69 trillion yuan by 2050, or up to 20.7 percent of the nation's GDP. Liu Ming, director of the Department of Social Development, said, 'We are witnessing a convergence in the consumption mindsets and structures of the elderly and the young, where the traditional lines separating their preferences and behaviors are gradually fading.'

**US Public Debt on the Rise: CBO Predicts 107% of GDP by 2029 and 156% by 2055**
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) of the US Congress has predicted that the country's public debt will reach 107% of its GDP by 2029 and 156% by 2055. According to the CBO's Budget Outlook Report, which covers the period from 2025 to 2055, the budget deficit will increase every year, with the public debt-to-GDP ratio reaching 107% in 2029, surpassing the historical peak reached after World War II. The report states that the debt-to-GDP ratio will continue to rise, reaching 156% by 2055. The CBO warns that such a large and increasing debt will slow down economic growth, increase interest payments to foreign creditors, and pose significant risks to the country's fiscal and economic outlook. The report also notes that the total federal budget deficit will average 6.3% of GDP over the next 30 years, exceeding the average of the past 50 years by 1.5 times. By 2055, the deficit is expected to reach 7.3% of GDP, remaining high by historical standards. The report predicts that federal spending will continue to increase, reaching 26.6% of GDP by 2055, a level only exceeded during World War II and the pandemic. Social security spending is expected to drive this increase, particularly over the next 10 years. The report also notes that revenues will continue to grow, reaching 19.3% of GDP by 2055. However, the CBO predicts that the US economy will experience slower growth, with an average annual growth rate of 1.6% from 2025 to 2055, down from 2.5% over the past 30 years. The report forecasts 2.1% growth for this year, with 1.4% growth expected by 2055.

**Moody's Predicts China's Actual GDP Growth Rate to be 4.3% in 2024**
According to aastocks, a 1% increase in the deficit ratio after the credit rating upgrade is attributed to a decrease in government revenue, with structural decline in property-related income and tax relief being partial causes. Under the revised definition, government revenue as a percentage of GDP is expected to decrease to 21.1% in 2025, lower than the 28.4% in 2019. The government claims to be working on new measures to increase revenue, but without effective action, future fiscal consolidation will face challenges. Moody's expects the government's general debt to GDP ratio to rise from around 55% in 2023 to over 60% in 2024, exceeding the median of 'A' rated sovereigns. The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to approach 70% in 2025, according to the government's budget and the ongoing 'debt swap' plan. The plan aims to include approximately 2 trillion yuan of off-balance-sheet debt into local government accounts. Moody's believes that most policies still focus on supply-side measures, such as investment in industry development. Local governments will be allowed to use special bonds to repay and repurchase idle land or vacant housing, but the amount involved is unclear. While a larger budget deficit can help drive economic growth, Moody's notes that the effectiveness and sustainability of fiscal stimulus are still uncertain. The Chinese government has set a 5% economic growth target for 2025, but Moody's expects the actual GDP growth rate to be around 4.3% this year, given the challenges of low domestic demand, pressure on the property sector, and increasing external pressures.

**China Aims for 2% Inflation and 12 Million New Jobs in 2025**
China aims to create 12 million new jobs in 2025, according to the 'Annual Labor Report' to be presented by Premier Li Qiang today at the National People's Congress. The report also sets a target inflation rate of around 2% and a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 4%, amidst a decline in tax revenues and land sales. This comes after inflation was estimated to be 3% in 2024, but ended the year near zero due to weak demand and low consumption. 'The report highlights the government's priorities for the year, including job creation and controlling inflation,' said a source. 'We are committed to creating a stable and prosperous environment for our citizens,' added Premier Li Qiang. 'Our goal is to achieve a balanced and sustainable economic growth, while ensuring social stability and equity.'

**China Maintains 5% Economic Growth Target Despite Impending War and Challenges**
China has maintained its economic growth target of '5%' for 2025, despite an impending war with the US and other challenging factors.

Li noted that 'at the national level, the foundation for China's economic recovery and sustained growth is not solid enough, with weak effective demand and slow consumption, particularly.' The IMF has projected China's economy to grow 4.6% this year, below the 5% target for 2024, according to Chinese government statistics. The report outlined plans for a more proactive fiscal policy, including a 3% to 4% increase in the deficit-to-GDP ratio.

**China Will Not Surpass the US by 2050, Says Professor**
A professor from Incheon National University analyzed the possibility of a power struggle between the US and China and proposed a national strategy for South Korea. His conclusion is that China will not surpass the US by 2050. He argues that South Korea's diplomacy should aim for 'global central diplomacy' based on the common interests of many countries and nations, rather than a binary choice between the US and China. The professor's reasoning is that China's military power will not surpass the US by 2050, considering military expenditure and population size. Economically, China's GDP growth rate is not sufficient to surpass the US, according to the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook. The professor also notes that China's cultural influence is limited due to its strict social and cultural control, as well as its poor response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He suggests that South Korea should lead the formation of diplomatic alliances or cooperative communities with countries that aim for global centrality, such as those in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and South America.

**Latin America's Rise to Global Power: Brazil and Mexico to Join the Elite by 2050**
A report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Standard Chartered predicts that four Latin American countries will join the United States and China as global powers by 2050. The report, 'The Long-Term Vision: How the Global Economic Order Will Change by 2050,' used the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) as key metrics to examine the projected growth. According to the study, Brazil and Mexico are the only Latin American economies that will make it to the top 10 globally by 2050. Brazil is projected to have a GDP of $7.54 trillion in PPP, ranking fifth, while Mexico will be seventh with a GDP of $6.863 trillion. The report also highlights two groups of global powers: the G7 (the world's largest advanced economies) and the E7 (the world's largest emerging economies). The projections suggest that China, India, and the United States will lead the global ranking in 2050, with China maintaining its status as the largest economy, followed by India and the United States. The study concludes that global economic growth will come from emerging markets, which will increase their share of the world's GDP over time.

**Analysis: Clean energy contributed a record 10% of China’s GDP in 2024 - Carbon Brief**
China's clean-energy sectors contributed a record 10% of the country's GDP in 2024, with a total value of 13.6tn yuan ($1.9tn). The sectors, which include renewables, nuclear power, and energy storage, grew three times as fast as the Chinese economy overall, accounting for 26% of all GDP growth in 2024. Electric vehicles and solar power were the top growth drivers, making up 39% of the total value of the clean-energy industries. The growth in clean-energy sectors played a key role in driving their overall contribution to GDP in 2024, whereas investment was the driver in 2023. The analysis notes that the growth of clean-energy sectors is expected to continue into 2025, driven by major projects aiming to finish before the end of the current five-year plan. However, the sectors are plagued by weak profitability and oversupply, and returning them to profitability would require maintaining strong domestic demand and measures to address overcapacity. The government's economic stimulus measures are likely to support investment in the clean-energy sectors, given their significant role in investment growth.

**Global Demographic Transformation Threatens Economic Growth, Warns McKinsey Report**
A report by the McKinsey Global Institute warns that the global demographic transformation, characterized by declining birth rates and aging populations, threatens global economic growth. The study, titled 'Dependence and Depopulation? Confronting the Consequences of a New Demographic Reality,' warns that if action is not taken quickly, this phenomenon could compromise the sustainability of economic growth, affect labor markets, and put pension systems at risk. The report highlights that two-thirds of the world's population live in countries with birth rates below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman, which 'could lead some advanced economies and China to lose between 20% and 50% of their population by 2100.' McKinsey describes the future as 'the era of youth scarcity,' as population pyramids are no longer pyramids and are on the way to becoming obelisks, with a rapid increase in the number of elderly and a decrease in young people. The study notes that in advanced economies and China, the working-age population will fall to 59% of the total by 2050, down from 67% today. This demographic scenario is expected to lead to a significant reduction in GDP per capita growth, by more than 0.5 percentage points per year in several countries, unless productivity and labor participation increase. Additionally, the tension in pension systems and public finances will continue to increase. The number of people of working age per retiree (the 'support ratio') is expected to fall from 3.9 today to 2 by 2050, a transformation that will directly impact consumption. 'We are at a turning point. Economic models based on population growth are a thing of the past. We need deep changes to sustain living standards,' said Chris Bradley, senior partner and director of MGI. According to him, 'in the absence of changes, advanced economies could see their GDP per capita growth fall to 0.8 percentage points per year in the coming decades, affecting the prosperity of future generations.' The report also notes that the epicenter of consumption and labor force will shift to emerging regions, beyond China. In fact, given the current trend, it is expected that China's population will fall from the current 18% of the total to 6% by the end of the century, and one-third of the world's population will be from Sub-Saharan Africa by 2100. The report highlights that Spain faces one of the biggest challenges among all countries. With a birth rate of around 1.2 children per woman and a growing percentage of retirees, economic growth and public finances will come under increasing pressure. Spain reached its peak working-age population in 2007, today it is 66%, and will fall to 52% by 2050. It is expected that the number of people of working age per retiree will fall from 3.2 today to 1.5 in just 25 years. Demographic changes alone could subtract up to 0.8 percentage points of growth per year from Spain's economy by 2050. As a reference, the annual growth rate over the past 25 years was 1.1%, so the demographic burden could erase almost all of the growth. 'Demographic changes, unlike other phenomena, have a significant advantage: they evolve slowly and are highly predictable,' said Marc Canal, senior researcher at MGI, who noted that 'Spain has a huge demographic challenge that can only be solved with increased labor participation and a substantial increase in productivity.' 'It is also important to rethink the social contract between generations,' he added. The MGI study emphasizes that, to adapt to this new reality, companies must rethink their strategies to capture the market of the elderly and manage multigenerational teams, as well as invest in technologies that drive productivity. At the same time, it indicates that governments must design public policies that promote such investment, as well as savings for retirement, public health, and healthy longevity.
