**Bluesky opens blue-check verification to 'notable and authentic' users: Here's how it works**
Bluesky has expanded its blue-check verification process to include 'notable and authentic' users. The social media company has launched an application that allows users to apply for verification and receive a blue check. This move comes after Bluesky initially introduced a domain-based verification process in 2023, which was used by over 270,000 accounts. The new application requires users to provide proof of their status and category, and will be reviewed by Bluesky's safety account. According to Bluesky, users who are not selected for verification will not receive a response, but can still pursue the domain option. This move is seen as a response to X's paid verification process, which has been criticized for lacking transparency.

**Bluesky's Blue Checkmark Era Begins: Who Can Apply?**
Bluesky, user verification applications have been opened! The process for those who want to get the blue checkmark has started. What criteria are being sought, who can apply? Here are the details... Bluesky is speeding up the user verification process. Although the company has not developed a definitive system for determining which accounts deserve the blue checkmark, it is now allowing users to apply for verification. The application process requires users to share their account information through Google Forms and explain why they want to be verified. However, it is still unclear how Bluesky will select accounts based on certain criteria and manage the intense application flow. Bluesky states that it aims to verify only 'active, safe, original, and notable' accounts. Users are recommended to fill in their biography completely and use two-factor authentication. In the form, users are also asked to indicate which category they belong to. The categories include officials, brands, journalists, academics, athletes, and 'others'. Bluesky emphasizes that the verification criteria will evolve over time and will be developed based on community feedback. The current version of the form is an initial version, and the verification conditions may change in the future. It is also stated that even meeting the basic requirements does not guarantee verification. The company's past reluctance to establish a verification system has made it difficult to combat impersonation issues. Today, Bluesky has 36 million registered users. Even if only a small portion of these users apply for verification, the company's limited human resources may face a significant burden. Bluesky also allows users to be verified through 'trusted verifiers', third-party organizations that can verify users' identities with a different symbol. These organizations can apply for this authority through the same form.

**Bluesky Introduces Blue Checkmark Verification for Notable Users**
Bluesky, a social media platform created by the same founder of Twitter, has quietly opened up registration for 'notable and authentic' accounts to request verification through an online form. Approved users will receive a blue checkmark on their profile, similar to other platforms. Tests with this feature began last month, first with news outlets like The New York Times, Wired, and The Athletic. To be eligible, accounts must be active, complete, and represent real people, companies, organizations, or legitimate entities, linking to their official website if available. It's unclear what the company considers 'notable', but it includes professional recognition, media coverage, and presence on reference platforms. Users who are not approved will not be responded to. In addition to this new feature, organizations can become trusted verifiers, gaining access to tools to verify other accounts. After receiving the blue checkmark, other users can tap on the mark to see who verified it. The adoption of the blue checkmark has not been well-received by some Bluesky users, as it reminds them of the pursuit of influence and fame that occurred on the other social media platform created by Jack Dorsey, now known as X. Verification represented a kind of hierarchy before its transformation into a paid subscription. In addition to the blue checkmark, Bluesky uses other forms of verification, such as the ability to define a domain, changing the user's @ to something other than the standard 'bsky.social'. So far, this method has been adopted by over 270,000 accounts. However, with the adoption of the blue checkmark, Bluesky is moving closer to traditional social media platforms like X or Threads, while distancing itself from decentralized alternatives like Deer.Social, where users can select who they trust as a verifier without any centralized definition.

**Bluesky Expands Verification Badge to All Users**
Bluesky, a decentralized social network, has opened up the possibility for anyone to request a blue checkmark, also known as a verification badge. This comes after the platform initially only verified accounts of well-known individuals. According to Bluesky Safety, 'We're excited that verification badges have made it easier to quickly recognize authentic accounts, especially for the dissemination of up-to-the-minute news.' The platform is now expanding this feature to allow verified accounts to request verification and become 'trustworthy' for their followers. This move comes after Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, now known as X, which introduced paid plans that automatically grant blue checkmarks. Bluesky has announced that it has reached 30 million monthly active users, a small fraction of X's 500 million monthly active users. The process for requesting verification is unclear, but the online form lists basic requirements, such as an active account with a bio, profile picture, and representing a 'real person, registered business, organization, or legitimate entity.' Bluesky states that notable accounts must be recognized in their 'industry and geographic area' and will consider various indicators, such as 'professional recognition, media coverage, and other evidence of public interest.'

**Bluesky will begin verifying 'notable' users | TechCrunch**
Bluesky, a social media platform, is testing a feature to verify 'notable' users. The verification process involves a blue badge, but also allows users to self-verify by setting a domain as their username. To date, over 270,000 accounts have adopted domain-based verification. However, the criteria for determining notability is less clear, and Bluesky will consider factors such as professional recognition, media coverage, and public interest. The company will not respond to users unless their account is selected for verification, and will review inbound requests to ensure that no famous figures slip through the cracks. As one Bluesky user noted, 'the blue verification badge is not a welcome addition, as it reminds them of the clout-chasing that took place on Twitter (now X)'.

**Bluesky Challenges X with Expanded Verification Process**
Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform, has opened up its verification process to all users. The platform, which is not managed by a single company but by its users' servers, has made it possible for anyone to request a blue checkmark. According to the guidelines, the feature is mainly aimed at media operators, journalists, and agencies. 'We're excited that verification badges have made it easier to quickly recognize authentic accounts,' reads a post by Bluesky Safety. 'Especially for the dissemination of up-to-the-minute news. Now we're expanding the functionality for known and authentic accounts that can request verification and become 'trustworthy' for their followers.' This move comes after Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, now known as X, which introduced paid plans that automatically grant blue checkmarks. Bluesky announced in January that it had reached 30 million monthly active users, a small fraction of X's 500 million monthly active users, according to independent analysts like Spocket. It's unclear how Bluesky will review verification requests, but the online form lists basic requirements, such as an active account with a bio, profile picture, and representing a 'real person, registered company, organization, or legitimate entity.' Bluesky claims that prominent accounts must be known in their 'sector and geographic area' and will consider various indicators, such as 'professional recognition, media coverage, and other proof of public interest.'

**Bluesky wants to verify notable users, similar to old Twitter system**
Bluesky, a social media platform, has launched a verification programme for users aiming to confirm their identity or notability. The programme, similar to the old Twitter system, allows 'notable and authentic' users to apply for verification via an online form. However, the return of a blue badge has raised concerns among some users, who fear it might create a status-driven culture. Bluesky's verification strategy blends traditional vetting with decentralised tools, including allowing users to self-verify by linking their identity to a domain name. So far, more than 270,000 users have adopted this domain-based approach. Despite the launch, it remains unclear how Bluesky will evaluate verification requests, and critics argue that launching it before building a larger network of independent Trusted Verifiers risks appearing overly centralised. An alternative Bluesky fork, Deer.Social, is testing a more community-led approach, allowing users to choose who they trust to verify others.

**Bluesky Begins Verifying 'Remarkable' Users**
Bluesky has opened the doors for users who want to be verified on its social networking service. The company announced that 'remarkable and authentic' accounts can now be reviewed through a new online form. Additionally, companies can apply to become trusted reviewers to gain access to tools that allow them to review others. Bluesky began testing this feature last month with a small group of organizations, including The New York Times, Wired, and The Athletic. The blue verification badge on Bluesky is not a welcome addition for some users, as it reminds them of the clout that existed on Twitter (now x). On Twitter, verification became a coveted status symbol before Elon Musk took over and turned it into a paid subscription service. Bluesky's approach to verification, however, relies on other systems beyond the blue badge. Users can also verify themselves by setting a domain as their username, like @-.org. Over 270,000 accounts have already adopted domain-based verification. The company's online form lists some basic requirements, such as being a 'real person, registered company, organization, or legitimate business' and linking to an official website if it exists. However, the criteria for what makes an account 'remarkable' are less clear. According to Bluesky, remarkable accounts must be 'remarkable' in their 'field and geographic region' and the company will consider various indicators, such as 'professional recognition, media coverage in established publications, presence on reputable reference platforms, or other evidence of public interest.'

**What is Bluesky? Everything to know about the X competitor.**
Bluesky has surpassed 30 million users as of February 2025, with its growth attributed to policy changes at X, including a change to the block feature and allowing third-party companies to train AI on users' posts. Despite this growth, Bluesky still lags behind Threads' 275 million monthly active users. Bluesky's goal is to remain free to end-users by finding alternative means to sustain its network, such as paid services and a subscription model. The platform is developing a decentralized AT Protocol, which will allow users to port their followers, handle, and data to other apps built on the protocol. Bluesky has also introduced features such as custom algorithms, email verification, and a 'Starter Pack' for new users. However, the platform has faced moderation issues, including accusations of failing to protect marginalized users and allowing racist content. Bluesky has rolled out 'more advanced automated tooling' to flag content that violates its Community Guidelines, but some users are still advocating for the ability to set their accounts to private.

**Bluesky Reaches 30 Million Users, Gaining Popularity as a More Open and Transparent Platform**
The number of users on 'Bluesky' has reached 30 million, according to a report by 'Challenge' economic newspaper. This is a significant increase from the 10 million users it had in September 2023, just a few months after its launch. The platform has been gaining popularity due to its open nature, allowing users to have more control over their content and interactions. Unlike 'X', which has been criticized for its algorithm-driven feed and lack of transparency, 'Bluesky' uses a more open approach, allowing users to choose what they want to see and interact with. This has made it an attractive option for many users, including scientists and researchers, who are looking for a more open and transparent platform. According to a survey by 'Nature' magazine, 70% of respondents have opened an account on 'Bluesky', with many of them switching from 'X' due to its handling of the Trump-Musk controversy. Some users have praised 'Bluesky' for its lack of misinformation and hate speech, making it a more suitable platform for scientific discussions. In France, 30,000 new users joined 'Bluesky' after a campaign called 'Hello... Quit X', which was organized by a group of researchers from the National Center for Scientific Research. The platform has also gained popularity in Canada, where many researchers and scientists have switched from 'X' to 'Bluesky' due to its more open approach. 'Bluesky' has no single leader, and its director, Jay Graber, has been promoting a decentralized and open approach to social media. This has made it an attractive option for many users who are looking for a more democratic and transparent platform.

**Bluesky Launches New Feature to Compete with X, Expands User Base to 28 Million**
Bluesky, a social media platform led by Jay Graber, has reached 28 million users with a faster growth rate compared to its competitors. According to iProUP, 'It has fewer monetization models, making the navigation cleaner and providing a better user experience. As a decentralized platform, it has a more democratic profile,' Graber said. Bluesky has launched a new feature to compete with X, allowing users to upload videos up to 3 minutes long. The updated version 1.99 of the app, released on March 7, 2025, triples the previous 60-second limit. This feature enables creators to express themselves more fully and share more extensive content without fragmenting it into multiple posts. Bluesky has also tested video streaming as part of a beta test. The platform is expanding its security features and entering new markets, including a chat request feature to manage messages from unknown users. This feature allows people to accept or reject conversations from non-followers, providing additional control over their inbox and helping to filter out unwanted messages. 'Our model enables the value of a more personalized user experience, which is something that X and other networks are moving away from in favor of a more viral and manipulative experience,' said Di Filippo.

Bluesky, a social networking platform, announced its latest update at SXSW 2025, which includes new features such as extended video upload duration, improved DM management, and enhanced user control. According to Bluesky, the update aims to make the internet 'less toxic' by giving users more control over their experiences on the platform. The new features include the ability to post up to three-minute-long videos, easily mute accounts, and manage messages from non-followers in the requests section. Bluesky has seen significant growth, with over 24 million users in early December and an average of one million user signups per day. The company is also working on a subscription service called Bluesky+ that will deliver premium features to users.

**Bluesky ramps up fight against child sexual abuse content**
Bluesky has joined the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) to combat the rise of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on its platform. The platform's user numbers have increased from 13 million in November 2024 to 30 million in January 2025, resulting in a 'predictable uptick in harmful content.' Bluesky is also growing its content moderation team and safety tooling. According to Bluesky's Head of Trust and Safety, Aaron Rodericks, joining the IWF is a 'significant step forward' in keeping users safe from harmful content. Bluesky is also subject to the Digital Services Act (DSA), which requires the platform to take down illegal content. If Bluesky reaches 45 million monthly users in the EU, it will face additional DSA scrutiny.

**'Twitter Quitters' Help Push Bluesky User Base to Over 31 Million**
Bluesky, a social media platform similar to X (formerly Twitter), has seen a surge in user growth since the 2024 US presidential election. The site has added over 14 million users, reaching 31 million users by February 11, 2025. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the first person to reach over 1 million followers on the platform. The site's growth may be attributed to changes made by X, such as removing legacy blue check marks and updating its terms of service. Bluesky's design and purpose are similar to X's, with vertically scrolling messages and small round photo avatars for users. The site uses a custom feed system, allowing users to choose from a variety of algorithms to determine what they see. Moderation is also different, with automated moderating and community labeling. Users can mute or block accounts, and report posts or accounts for abuse. The site has features to stop pile-ons and toxic behavior, such as hiding replies to posts and detaching posts from other users' quotes.

Bluesky, a decentralized social network, has announced that it has 30 million registered users, a significant increase from the 25.94 million users it reported last month. According to the platform, the growth rate has been approximately 5 million users per month. The platform, which removed its invitation-only system last year, has seen a steady increase in users since then. In February 2024, the platform had 1.6 million active users and 25,000 personalized 'feeds', but after removing the invitation system and opening its protocol to external developers, the number of registrations began to grow. The platform has continued to grow, reaching 10 million users in September, 14.5 million in November, and 25.94 million in December. The latest announcement marks a significant milestone, with the platform now having 30 million users. As shared on the official profile, 'it feels like a celebration' to reach this number, accompanied by an image of dolphins. The growth can be attributed to the recent announcement of new video features, including a new video tab on user profiles.
