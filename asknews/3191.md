**The Challenges Faced by Mexican Women: A Call to Action**
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo said, 'We did not arrive alone, we arrived together.' Despite this historic moment, Mexican women still face challenges that prevent them from celebrating this achievement. According to the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (Inegi), the participation of women in the country's economy has increased from 43% to 46% over the past 10 years. However, this is still below the OECD average of 67%. If strategies are not implemented to accelerate the incorporation of more women, it will take Mexico 56 years to reach the participation rate of these countries. The Instituto Mexicano para la Competitividad (Imco) estimates that if women's participation in the economy is accelerated, the country could increase its Gross Domestic Product by 6.9 billion pesos in the next decade, equivalent to 630 million pesos per year. 'To reach the level of participation maintained by the OECD, Mexico would have to incorporate 18.6 million women into its economy by 2035,' according to the research. To promote women's participation in the economy, it is essential to implement public and private policies, such as creating a Sistema Nacional de Cuidados (SNC) and implementing mandatory paternity leave. Additionally, the sector should work to eliminate the wage gap, which currently stands at 15% in favor of men. 'Standardizing the measurement of the wage gap, transparency in salaries, and institutionalizing care policies are key actions that can generate a positive impact on labor equality,' says the Imco report. Abating violence against women is another major challenge that women face in Mexico. According to the Encuesta Nacional sobre la Dinámica de las Relaciones en los Hogares (ENDIREH) 2021, 70.1% of women have experienced some form of violence in their lives. The most common forms of violence are psychological, with a prevalence of 51.6%, followed by sexual violence, with 49.7%, physical violence, with 34.7%, and economic, patrimonial, and discriminatory violence, with 27.4%.

**Support for Young People without a Vocational Qualification**
According to a recent study by the Nuremberg Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research (IAB), youth unemployment is increasing, particularly among young people without a vocational qualification. By the end of 2024, more than 250,000 young people were unemployed nationwide, with three-quarters of them lacking a vocational qualification. The SOS Children's Village in Nuremberg offers support through its vocational training center, where young people can learn six different trades, including carpentry, cooking, and interior design. Josi, a 21-year-old, is one of them, learning interior design in her second year. She says she was lost after school and only discovered this opportunity by chance. The center's trainer, Sebastian Weiß, explains that the lack of financial pressure allows them to focus on the individual needs of each young person. The program is designed to help young people who may struggle with daily routines, family or school problems, or social anxiety. Some young people can participate in a combined program with a company, while others can complete their training directly at the SOS Children's Village. The study's author, Holger Seibert, warns that many young people lack the skills to find a job or write a proper application, and calls for more support for this group. 'In times of acute labor shortages, it should be the goal to enable every young person to access a training program,' he says. 'After all, every man and woman is needed on the labor market.'

**220,000 new Omani jobs required by 2030 to meet growth targets: IMF**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected that the Omani economy will need to generate over 220,000 new jobs for its national workforce by 2032 to meet the country's growth demands. The report, 'Labour Market Dynamics in Oman,' highlights the need for a shift away from relying on the public sector for employment, as it is no longer feasible amidst efforts to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability. According to the report, the private sector remains dominated by expatriates, with 86% of the workforce, and wages significantly lower on average, particularly in low- and medium-skilled jobs. The IMF notes that Oman's education system is not aligned with the needs of a diversifying economy, causing a discrepancy in the skills required by the private sector and those available in the labour market. The report also highlights the low female labour participation rate, which stands at 32%, and limited mobility for expatriate workers as key restraints to the labour market. The IMF has hailed the new Social Protection and Labour Laws as a step in the right direction, while recommending complementary policies to address the longstanding challenges in the Omani labour market, including strengthening active labor market programmes, adopting dual-education systems, and accelerating efforts to increase the participation of women in the workforce.

**Denmark to Raise Retirement Age to 70 by 2040: A Response to Aging Population**
Denmark plans to raise the retirement age to 70 years by 2040, with the current retirement age being 67 years. The retirement age will increase every five years, reaching 68 in 2030 and 69 in 2035. This move comes as protests continue over low pensions, with experts calling for changes to labor laws to address the issue. A proposed labor reform aims to increase flexibility in work arrangements, reduce state intervention in private agreements, and allow for more flexible salaries and work relationships. Meanwhile, a proposed pension reform aims to address issues such as the 'envejecimiento poblacional' (aging population), where people are living longer but having fewer children, leading to uncertainty over the future of pensioners. Experts suggest moving from a 'beneficio definido' (defined benefit) system to a 'contribución definida' (defined contribution) system. According to Jacqueline Maubré, 'El sistema de reparto está en crisis en la Argentina. La expectativa de vida ha crecido, pero tambien baja el ritmo de la natalidad.' (The pension system is in crisis in Argentina. Life expectancy has increased, but the birth rate has also decreased.)

**Basque Country Faces Labor Shortage of 17% by 2036**
According to a study by Laboral Kutxa, the Basque Country (Euskadi) will face a labor shortage of 17% by 2036, with 171,000 job openings that cannot be filled. The study, 'Empleo y Transición Demográfica en la CAPV y Navarra: Horizonte 2036', projects that the region will not have enough workers to meet the demand, even in the most optimistic scenarios. The director of the Department of Studies at Laboral Kutxa, Joseba Madariaga, explained that the region's population is aging and the birth rate is low, with an average of 1.3 children per woman. Madariaga stated that 'although migrations contribute to maintaining the population, the combination of low fertility and high longevity is driving a significant demographic aging.' To address this issue, Laboral Kutxa recommends prolonging the working life, attracting and retaining migration, and accelerating professional requalification programs. The study also highlights the importance of adopting proactive policies and collaboration between the public and private sectors to ensure the sustainability of the labor market and the competitiveness of the regional economy.

**Labor Conflict Decreases in 2024, While Mediation and Arbitration Increase**
The Economic and Social Council (CES) has reported that labor conflict has decreased in 2024, with a 71 fewer strikes and 63,021 fewer participants in both the private and public sectors. According to the CES, the impact of these strikes was almost equal to the average annual impact of the last decade, with 328 participants per strike and 995 non-worked days per conflict. The participation rate in strikes was 24% of the total workforce. The CES notes that the impact of strikes in the public sector was significantly lower, with a 319,375 decrease in non-worked days. In the private sector, strikes and participants decreased, but non-worked days increased by 120,702. The CES highlights the decrease in strikes related to collective bargaining processes, which decreased by 104, and attributes it to the recovery of purchasing power of salaries agreed upon in 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, the number of conflicts mediated by the Interconfederal Service of Mediation and Arbitration (SIMA) increased by 13.3% in 2024, affecting 7.1 million workers in 698,000 companies. The SIMA also reported 70 conflicts related to strike calls, of which 17 were cancelled after conciliation. The autonomous communities' dispute resolution bodies handled 5,431 conflicts in 2024, a 3% increase from 2023, affecting 3.2 million workers in nearly 150,000 companies. The number of cases resolved by social courts also increased by 20.4% in 2024, reaching 410,239, the highest figure in the last decade. However, the global situation of social jurisdiction continued to worsen in terms of resolution rates, congestion, and backlog.

**Giovani, over 50 e quarantenni: chi sale e chi scende nel mercato del lavoro (e perché)**
According to Bankitalia's annual report, the labor market has slowed down in 2024, with the number of employed individuals and working hours increasing by 1.6% and 2.1% respectively, compared to 1.9% and 2.5% in 2023. The growth in employment has been driven by permanent employment, which has increased among individuals aged 50 and over, due to demographic aging and the reduction of outflows from the labor market, partly due to past pension reforms. The demand for high-skilled professions has increased, but the dynamics have been different between age groups, with younger individuals satisfying the demand for high-skilled professions, while older individuals have emphasized the importance of less qualified professions. The labor market participation rate has also slowed down, with the rate of participation among individuals aged 15-74 increasing by 0.6 percentage points compared to 2019, but then decreasing in 2024. The participation rate among older individuals (50-74 years) has continued to rise, while that of younger individuals (15-34 years) has decreased.

**US Increases Military Presence in Spain and Indo-Pacific Region**
The US is increasing its military presence in Spain, particularly in the base of Rota, where a new destroyer, the USS Oscar Austin, arrived in October 2024. The base is a critical node for US support logistics in Europe and Africa. The US plans to add hangars and increase capabilities at the base by 2035. Additionally, the US has deployed four destroyers in Rota since 2015, and two more were added in 2022 as part of the reinforcement of US troops in Europe. The base is also home to the Company Europe of the Security Antiterrorist Team of the Fleet (FAST), which provides security forces and rapid response for deployment in wide areas of Europe and Africa. Spain is a key military piece for the US, as shown by the explicit plans to expand and improve the Rota infrastructure by 2035. The US is also increasing its military presence in the Indo-Pacific region, with Spain participating in a maritime military deployment for the first time. The Spanish frigate Méndez Núñez will participate in the NATO operation 'Highmast' for five months, demonstrating the country's naval projection capabilities. The Spanish government has approved the 2024 Security Maritime Strategy, which includes the Indo-Pacific region as a 'maritime space of interest' for Spain. The country's military participation in the Indo-Pacific region is not new, as it participated in the 'Pacific Skies' exercise last year, where Spanish and French aircraft flew over 58,000 kilometers in 56 days. The Spanish military is also participating in 16 missions abroad with 3,000 military personnel and civil guards, including the reinforcement of the eastern flank of NATO and the operation 'Persistent Effort' to defend the airspace. However, this increased military presence and dependence on the US is raising concerns about Spain's sovereignty and national interests.

**Statistics with Youth: A Look at Turkey's Young Population**
According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), the 'Statistics with Youth' bulletin was published for the '19 May Atatürk Commemoration, Youth and Sports Festival'. The bulletin includes information on education, health, labor force, and life satisfaction of young people. The bulletin is prepared by utilizing the data from the surveys, research, and administrative records conducted by TÜİK. The 2024 bulletin includes interesting results. 14.9% of Turkey's population is young people, aged 15-24. The number of young people is 12 million 763 thousand 159, and the young population ratio is 14.9%. The young population's 51.2% are male, and 48.8% are female. The young population ratio has decreased from 20.8% in 1950 to 14.9% in 2024. According to population projections, the young population ratio is expected to be 14.8% in 2030, 12.2% in 2040, and 10.3% in 2060. Turkey is expected to lose its young population characteristic. Therefore, the country has focused on policies to increase the birth rate. The young population ratio is highest in Hakkari (20.8%), Şırnak (20.6%), and Siirt (20.3%), and lowest in Balıkesir (11.8%), Muğla (12.1%), and Ordu (12.2%). The labor force participation rate of young people has increased, and the unemployment rate has decreased. The labor force participation rate was 45.6% in 2023, and 47.2% in 2024. The unemployment rate was 17.4% in 2023, and 16.3% in 2024. The employment rate was 37.7% in 2023, and 39.5% in 2024. The employment of young people is sector-wise as follows: 13% in agriculture, 30.7% in industry, and 56.3% in services. The life satisfaction of young people is high. According to the 2024 Life Satisfaction Survey, 51.8% of young people are happy, 37% are moderately happy, and 11.2% are unhappy. The survey results show that the common perception that young people are unhappy and dissatisfied is not accurate. The survey found that 51.8% of young people aged 18-24 are happy, and 11.2% are unhappy. The top 3 values that make young people happy are health, success, and love. The general health status of young people is very high, with a satisfaction rate of 87.2%. 65.4% of young people are satisfied with the education they have received so far. Many negative ideas about young people are based on perceptions, but the truth is different. A significant portion of our young people have the 'time is mine and the place is mine' consciousness and will shape the Turkish Century.

**INPS: the pension system is balanced, but needs to be made more sustainable**
The Italian National Institute of Social Security (INPS) states that the pension system is currently balanced, but it is necessary to increase the number of workers and improve the continuity of employment positions to ensure its sustainability in the long term. The INPS suggests that one of the key levers to intervene is to stimulate the participation of women and young people in the labor market, as their participation rates are very low in Italy. According to the INPS, the expenditure for pensions as a percentage of GDP will increase from 15.3% in 2025 to 17.1% in 2040, but will then decrease to 16% in 2050 and 14.1% in 2060. The INPS also highlights the need to adapt to the increasing life expectancy and the demographic transition, which will lead to an increase of three months in the pensionable age in 2027. To increase the base contributory, the INPS suggests prioritizing the participation of young people and women in the labor market, improving the conciliation of work and family life, and reducing the mismatch between the demand and supply of labor. Additionally, the INPS suggests increasing the retributions and the power of purchase of workers, and introducing incentives for the permanence in the labor market, such as the bonus Maroni, the increase of the ordinary limits and the retention in service of public employees.

**Hardly Working**
The labor-force-participation rate in the US has fallen to its lowest level since the late 1970s, with the biggest decline among younger workers. The participation rate among those in their fifties has also decreased, with many likely having given up on finding a new job after being unemployed for several years. However, the most disturbing trend is the decline in workforce participation among those between 16 and 25, with a 5.3% decrease for 16- to 19-year-olds and a 3.0% decrease for 20- to 24-year-olds. Stephen Moore, chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, attributes this decline to the minimum wage, cultural attitudes, and the substitution of work with student loans. He argues that young people should be encouraged to work at a young age to learn the dignity of work and become responsible and independent. Moore suggests that parents should encourage their children to get a job, even if it's menial labor, to help them succeed in life.

**Taiwan's Labor Force Ages: Middle-Aged and Elderly Job Seekers Surpass Young Adults**
According to the statistics from the largest independent job platform in Taiwan, '打工趣', the labor participation rate in Taiwan has reached a new low in 2023, while the labor participation rate of middle-aged and elderly people (45-64 years old) has increased to 66.4%, a historical high, representing the oldest labor force in history. The platform's member data shows that the proportion of new registered members aged 45 and above has increased by 124% in 2024, while the proportion of young job seekers (22 years old and below) has decreased by two-thirds. The platform has launched a 'middle-aged and elderly job zone' to help enterprises fill labor gaps and assist middle-aged and elderly people in returning to the workforce. The platform's member composition shows that middle-aged and elderly people now account for nearly 30% (28.9%), while the largest group is still the young adults (23-44 years old) who account for 64% (63.9%). The platform points out that the term '工讀生' (job seeker) can no longer be used to describe the flexible workforce, as it implies that the target group is students, but now the majority of job seekers are middle-aged and elderly people. The platform has introduced a new 'tag' function to help employers and job seekers find suitable matches, with the first batch of tags including '#中高齡友善' (middle-aged and elderly friendly), '#二度就業' (second career), '#彈性工時' (flexible working hours), '#遠端工作' (remote work), '#假日打工' (part-time work), and '#有薪實習' (paid internship).

**Silver Dividend**
India is at a demographic crossroads, with a significant rise in its elderly population. By 2031, over 13% of India's population will be aged 60 and above. This shift presents both a challenge and an opportunity, which can be harnessed as a 'silver dividend' if policies and labour market structures are adapted. However, current policies have yet to fully tap into this potential. Labour force participation among India's elderly remains low, with only about a quarter of people aged 65 and above part of the workforce. In rural India, labour force participation has risen due to necessity, while in urban areas, it has stagnated. To harness the silver dividend, India needs a multi-pronged strategy, including expanding social security programmes, introducing reskilling programmes, and reforming labour laws to promote age-friendly workplaces and flexible work arrangements. As noted by the article, 'India has long benefited from its youthful workforce, but the time has come to recognise the economic value of its aging population.'

**Colombia's 'Nini' Phenomenon: 2.5 Million Young People Neither Study Nor Work**
According to the Dane, 2.5 million young people in Colombia, representing 22.5% of the total, are considered 'nini', meaning they neither study nor work. The majority of these young people are women, with 1.6 million, or 15.2% of the total, while men represent 7.3%, or 816,000 people. Juliana Morad, director of the labor observatory at the University of Javeriana, stated, 'The nini phenomenon is something we need to see over time, not just from year to year. In our study from last October, we saw that in 10 years, the non-participation of young people in the labor market has increased.' The migration of young people and the departure of young people are exacerbating this situation, and Morad emphasized the need to continue working on active labor and educational policies related to job training for this population. In 2024, the global participation rate of young people in the total national population was 54.8%, a decrease of 0.7 percentage points compared to 2023. The informal labor rate in Colombia remains a relevant phenomenon, with 55.9% of the population, or 13.1 million people, being informal workers. Sincelejo has the highest informal labor rate, with 68.2%, while Manizales has the lowest, with 34.2%.
