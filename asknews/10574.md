**Global markets falter as Trump's tariffs hit US growth, breed uncertainty among investors**
Global stock markets declined on Monday, June 2, following President Donald Trump's announcement to double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and renewed friction with China over trade commitments. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.2 per cent, while the S&P 500 fell 1.1 per cent and the Nasdaq lost 1.4 per cent. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said, 'Trump's pledge to double steel and aluminium import tariffs have caused fresh uncertainty.' The move comes weeks after Washington and Beijing reached a 90-day truce in Geneva to unwind aggressive tit-for-tat levies. China 'firmly rejected' US accusations of non-compliance, setting the stage for another round of trade hostilities between the world's two largest economies. The combination of trade uncertainty, inflationary pressure from tariffs, and geopolitical instability has clouded the outlook for global growth. Kai Wang, Asia equity market strategist at Morningstar, warned that markets risked 'greater volatility given the heightened uncertainty with regard to global growth.' Early data suggest Trump's tariff policies are already weighing on the US economy, with a 0.3 per cent contraction in first-quarter GDP and estimates indicating a 0.7 per cent annual decline if trade tensions persist.

**Global Public Debt Rises at a Faster Rate, Threatening Long-Term Sustainability**
According to a recent report by our team, the global public debt is expected to rise to 100% of the world's GDP by the end of the decade if current trends continue. This increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio reflects the renewed economic pressures, as well as the financial consequences of the pandemic, as stated in our report. The graph for this week shows that about a third of the countries, which represent 80% of the world's GDP, have a higher public debt than before the pandemic, and it is increasing at a faster rate. More than two-thirds of the 175 economies studied are now facing the burden of a heavier public debt than before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The development of public debt over the past 5 years has varied greatly between countries, meaning that fiscal policy should differ in line with the specific factors and conditions of each country. However, given the uncertain times that may await us due to the strong tensions in trade policies, countries everywhere will need much greater flexibility. Specifically, fiscal policy should be: part of comprehensive macroeconomic policies aimed at stability. In most countries, it should aim to reduce public debt and rebuild the ability to spend and respond to new pressures and other economic shocks through a medium-term reliable framework. Increase the potential growth to alleviate political tensions. In a state of uncertainty, fiscal policy should establish trust and stability for economies to achieve growth and prosperity. It is increasingly necessary for governments to build trust, impose taxes fairly, and spend wisely. Policymakers should commit their political capital to promote trust. This begins by doubling their efforts to maintain order in their financial households.

**Ibex 35 falls 0.2% as commercial tensions rise**
The Ibex 35 index fell by 0.2% at midday, remaining at 14,118.1 points, amidst new commercial tensions between the US and its partners. The US President, Donald Trump, announced his intention to double the tariffs on imported steel from 25% to 50% to benefit US steel. This increase is expected to take effect on June 4. The move comes after Trump accused China of 'violating' the tariff truce that reduced tariffs between the two countries two weeks ago and threatened the EU with a 50% tariff on all exports, which is expected to take effect on July 9. The OPEC+ meeting on Saturday resulted in a plan to increase oil production by 411,000 barrels per day from July. This decision aims to 'punish' countries that fail to meet their production quotas, such as Iraq and Kazakhstan. 'This will lead to a new increase in supply in the market, against a weaker demand due to the fear of a slowdown in growth due to the tariffs being negotiated globally,' analysts from Renta 4 said. The next meeting is scheduled for July 6 and will decide on August production. The day's trading was also influenced by the upcoming events, including the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting on Thursday, where analysts expect a 25-point cut in the deposit rate to 2%. The market will be watching for messages on US commercial policy and the update of the European economy's 'macro' picture. Additionally, this week will see the release of various employment data in the US, including the official report for May, as well as the eurozone's inflation rate for May and the PMI services index on Wednesday.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**Prediction: Lyft Stock Could Double in the Next 3 Years**
Lyft's stock has struggled on the public markets, down 77% since its IPO in 2019.

Lyft has also reported a profit for the first time last year and has seen its adjusted EBITDA nearly double in the first quarter of 2025. The company's market cap is under $7 billion, making it trade for less than 8 times trailing free cash flow. Additionally, Lyft's acquisition of FreeNow, a European ride-share platform, is expected to double its addressable market and increase annualized gross bookings by about $1 billion. According to the article, 'That's one good reason to bet that Lyft can double over the next three years.'

**2 Top Tech Stocks That Can Double by 2030**
Nvidia, the leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs), is poised for growth as the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips continues to rise. According to CEO Jensen Huang, 'Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure -- just like electricity and the internet -- and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation.' The company reported revenue of $44 billion, up 69% year over year and 12% over the previous quarter, despite missing out on $2.5 billion in revenue due to new export requirements to China. AI spending is expected to boost the global economy by $20 trillion by 2030, and Nvidia is well-positioned to benefit from this growth, with demand from cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services and Alphabet's Google Cloud driving its data center sales. The company is also expanding into new markets, including autonomous driving and robotics, which could drive long-term demand for its chips.

**'Doubling tariff on steel, aluminium by US to impact Indian exporters'**
US President Donald Trump's decision to double tariffs on imported steel and aluminium will negatively impact Indian exporters, according to think tank GTRI. The hike, which takes effect on June 4, will hurt the profitability of Indian producers and exporters, who exported USD 4.56 billion worth of iron, steel, and aluminium products to the US in 2024-25. GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava said, 'These exports are now exposed to sharply higher US tariffs, threatening the profitability of Indian producers and exporters.' India has already issued a formal notice at the World Trade Organization (WTO) signalling its intention to impose retaliatory tariffs on US goods, but it remains to be seen whether they will carry out the retaliation by increasing tariffs on certain US exports within a month.

**Breakthrough cancer drug doubles survival in trial - Business Telegraph**
A clinical trial has shown that an immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab, doubles the length of time patients with advanced head and neck cancer are cancer-free, from around 2.5 years to five years. The trial, involving over 350 patients, found that those given the drug before and after surgery had a 10% lower risk of their cancer returning elsewhere in the body after three years. Laura Marston, a 45-year-old from Derbyshire, was one of the patients in the trial and says she is 'amazed she's still here' after being given a 30% chance of survival six years ago. She received the immunotherapy before and after surgery, which helped her body learn to attack the cancer if it returned. Prof Kevin Harrington, who led the trial in the UK, says the results are 'really exciting' and that the treatment could 'change the world' for patients with this difficult-to-treat cancer. The researchers are now calling for the treatment to be made available on the NHS.

**Amapá can double its GDP every two years, says economist Charles Chelala**
Economist Charles Chelala presented a detailed analysis on the economic impacts of oil exploration on the coast of Amapá at the Margem Equatorial and Public Policies event. He divided the analysis into two parts: a diagnosis of the current Amapá economy and an evaluation of the possible impacts of oil production at sea. 'The positive impact is undeniable and will transform the current economy, which is dependent on public power,' he said. According to Chelala, Amapá has one of the smallest GDPs in the country, around R$ 23 billion, equivalent to 0.2% of the national economy. The majority of this wealth is concentrated in the services sector, with the public administration accounting for half of the state's GDP. 'The Amapá economy is, in fact, a public paycheck economy,' he said. Chelala pointed out recent advances, such as the reduction of the unemployment rate from 14% to 8.7% and the highest proportional growth of formal employment in the country in 2024: 10%, according to Caged. However, he warned of distortions such as the R$ 7 billion deficit in the inter-state commercial balance - Amapá imports more from the federation than it exports - and cited examples: 'We buy cassava from Pará, fish from Mato Grosso, and even hortifrúti from the Northeast,' he joked. In the second part of the presentation, Chelala presented scenarios based on studies by the National Industry Observatory. In the conservative scenario, with production of 50,000 barrels per day, the state's GDP could grow 23% per year and double in four years. In the more optimistic scenario, with 100,000 barrels per day, the GDP would double every two years, generating 54,000 new jobs, R$ 2.3 billion in revenue, and a 29% increase in tax collection. 'Amapá can double its GDP every two years,' he repeated, highlighting the transformative potential of oil activity on the Amazon coast. He rebutted concerns about supposed impacts on corals, saying that 'there have never been living corals in the area,' and cited Greenpeace studies indicating that oil dispersal would not reach the Brazilian coast. Repayment of royalties Chelala also warned of historical risks of large projects in the Amazon, mentioning the cases of the Jari project and manganese extraction. He drew attention to the vulnerability of the municipality of Oiapoque, which could suffer strong pressure with the arrival of the oil industry. 'Today, 91% of Oiapoque's population does not have access to treated water, and the municipality is not even connected to the national energy system,' he said. The region faces high infant mortality, lack of sewage disposal, and precariousness of the BR-156. In light of this, he defended the 'repayment of royalties' with a focus on mitigating social impacts. He expressed support for the project of law of Senator Randolfe Rodrigues that allocates 20% of royalties to environmental preservation, infrastructure, and sustainable development. 'It's not enough to collect ICMS, ISS, and royalties. We need direct social responsibility, especially from Petrobras and public entities.' Chelala also pointed out urgent measures such as workforce qualification, investments in infrastructure, electrical interconnection, and valorization of local economic vocations - such as bioeconomy, fishing, fruiticulture, tourism, and sustainable agriculture. He defended the reorganization of mining and the reactivation of the logistics sector, with the recovery of the port and the Serra do Navio railway. Finally, he emphasized the importance of inserting Amapá into energy transition strategies, exploring potential in solar, wind, biomass, and green hydrogen energy. 'Oil can be the lever of transformation. But the challenge is to ensure that development is sustainable, inclusive, and permanent,' he concluded.

**How Long Will It Take To Double Your Investment? Find Out With Rule Of 72**
The Rule of 72 is a simple formula used to estimate the time it takes for an investment to double in value, assuming a fixed annual rate of return. The formula is: Years to Double = 72 / Annual Rate of Return. For example, an 8% annual return would take approximately 9 years to double. The Rule of 72 is useful for setting realistic expectations about investment growth and understanding the impact of inflation. However, it has limitations, including assuming a constant annual return, not being accurate for extreme rates, and not accounting for taxes and fees. Despite these limitations, the Rule of 72 is a valuable financial tool for making informed investment decisions.
