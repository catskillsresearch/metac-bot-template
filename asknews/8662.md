**US Navy To Arm Its Destroyers With 'Game-Changer' Missiles To Counter China's Growing Fleet**
The US Navy is set to deploy a new anti-ship version of the Tomahawk cruise missile, known as the Maritime Strike Tomahawk, on its destroyers by September 30, 2025. According to Admiral Daryl Caudle, the missile is a 'game-changer' that increases the flexibility and lethality of the Navy's weapons. The Navy plans to purchase up to 1,302 of these missiles from RTX Corporation. The deployment is part of a broader effort to counter China's growing naval fleet, which is estimated to grow to 435 vessels by 2030. Admiral Caudle warned against getting locked into a 'shipbuilding arms race', instead advocating for building high-end, capable warships with large payload capacities. He noted that growing a naval fleet is not just about adding more ships, but also requires significant logistical and financial burdens, including crewing, maintaining, supplying, and housing the ships.

**UK Announces Construction of 12 New Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarines 'A Message to Moscow'**
The UK has announced the construction of 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines as part of its Defense Review, which Prime Minister Starmer said will give the British army more power against hostile states like Russia and China. According to Starmer, 'The threat is more serious, more immediate, more unpredictable than ever since the Cold War.' The new defense strategy is 'a message to Moscow,' said Defense Minister John Healey, referring to the 'growing' threat posed by Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Starmer has also committed to building at least six new ammunition factories in the UK, creating a hybrid Royal Navy combining drones with warships, submarines, and aircraft, improving living conditions and equipment for military personnel, and investing Â£15 billion in a nuclear program. The UK is preparing for war at a 'war footing' because Russia is showing it does not want peace, and the best way to deter aggressors is to be ready. Starmer has promised to create a stronger and fully trained reserve, strengthen NATO by making the largest contribution to the alliance since its creation, and invest in innovation. The UK's defense spending will increase to 2.5% by 2027 and 3% by 2030.

**Britain announces $20B boost to make armed forces 'battle ready' - UPI.com**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced plans to inject $20.3 billion into the country's nuclear weapons program to combat the 'threat from Russia' and China and build 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines. The new spending is part of a major Strategic Defense Review aimed at restoring Britain's fighting capability and making it 'war-ready' within two years for a conflict in Europe and/or the Atlantic. Starmer said, 'We are moving to war-fighting readiness as the central purpose of our armed forces. When we are being directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be ready, and frankly, to show them that we're ready to deliver peace through strength.' The plan includes six new munitions plants, adding 7,000 new long-range weapons to Britain's arsenal, and investing in improved housing and equipment for members of the armed forces. However, the opposition has criticized the plan, with some questioning the government's commitment to reaching the goal of 3% of GDP in defense spending by 2034.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**China rejects US defence chief's warnings on Taiwan invasion threat**
China has rejected US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's warnings about the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, calling them 'groundless accusations'. Hegseth had warned that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan 'would result in devastating consequences'. China's National Defence University vice president, Hu Gangfeng, said the accusations were 'nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region'. Australia's Defence Minister, Richard Marles, pointed out that China's largest conventional military build-up since World War II is happening without strategic reassurance and without a clear strategic intent. Australia is increasing its defence spending, aiming to reach 2.33 per cent of GDP by 2033-34, and is on track to receive eight new nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS agreement.

**India readies to face 2040 naval threat, as Pak-China-Turkey axis emerges  - The Sunday Guardian Live**
India is facing a growing maritime challenge from a coordinated China-Turkiye-Pakistan naval build-up by 2040. The three nations are not part of any formal alliance, but their hidden coordination and converging maritime postures suggest the emergence of a strategic triangle. China is expected to operate six aircraft carriers, 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines, and a surface fleet of over 150 warships by 2040. Turkiye is modernizing its navy with aircraft carriers, destroyers, and stealth submarines, while Pakistan is expected to field eight Hangor-class submarines and four Type 054A/P guided missile frigates. The combined strength of these three navies will outmatch India's projected naval capabilities by 2040, forcing the Indian Navy to split its forces across three distinct theatres. India must rapidly evolve its naval force structure to counter this challenge, including deploying three aircraft carriers, 200 warships, and 500 naval aircraft, and ensuring its submarine fleet is fully operational and technologically current.

**China crosses 600 operational nuclear warheads, to exceed 1,000 by 2030: US intel - BusinessToday**
According to a US Defence Intelligence Agency report, China has surpassed 600 operational nuclear warheads and is on track to have over 1,000 by 2030. The rapid buildup is part of China's effort to create a diverse and high-readiness nuclear force capable of delivering both low-yield precision strikes and large-scale intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) attacks. The report notes that China's current force modernization suggests that it seeks to have the ability to inflict far greater levels of overwhelming damage to an adversary in a nuclear exchange. The nuclear buildup aligns with China's broader goals of asserting dominance in East Asia, challenging US global leadership, pursuing reunification with Taiwan, and achieving technological self-sufficiency. Meanwhile, India and Pakistan continue to develop their nuclear arsenals, with India slightly expanding its nuclear arsenal in 2023 and Pakistan modernizing its nuclear command and control systems. As of June 2024, Russia had 4,380 warheads, while the US had 3,708, and India and Pakistan had 172 and 170 warheads, respectively.

**China Projected To Have 1,000 Nukes, Viewed As 'Primary Adversary' By India: US Report**
A US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) report states that China is rapidly advancing its military modernisation and is expected to reach at least 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030. China views the US as a global leader and aims to challenge its dominance, while India sees China as its 'primary adversary' and is focusing on countering Chinese influence. The report also states that China will continue to apply pressure on Taiwan through diplomatic, information, military, and economic means to advance its long-term objective of unification with Taiwan. According to the report, China's nuclear warhead stockpile has probably surpassed 600 operational nuclear warheads, and the country will continue growing its force until at least 2035. 'This supports the PLA's objective to achieve a more diverse nuclear force, comprising systems including low-yield precision strike missiles and ICBMs with multi-megaton yields, to provide a broader range of nuclear response options,' it said. China's approach to using nuclear force is based on the Army's 'deterrence' of an enemy first strike and 'counterstrike' against an adversary's military capability, population, and economy when deterrence fails. The report also states that India has reduced procurement of Russian-origin military equipment, but still relies on Russian spare parts to maintain and sustain its large inventory of Russian-origin tanks and fighter aircraft that help its military to counter threats from China and Pakistan.

**China's Nuclear Ambition: A Path to Energy Self-Sufficiency and Global Dominance**
China is moving towards energy self-sufficiency by activating 10 new nuclear reactors and strengthening its nuclear dominance. According to The Paper, the investment exceeds 200 billion yuan (approximately 26 billion euros). This is China's fourth consecutive year of approving large-scale nuclear initiatives. The three state-owned companies responsible for this ambition are China General Nuclear Power Corp. (CGN), China National Nuclear Corp. (CNNC), and State Power Investment Corp. As reported by China Daily, the authorities have tightened control measures to ensure that each new reactor meets the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safety standards. The Chinese strategy is deeply linked to the optimization of construction and operation costs, thanks to the state apparatus that facilitates low-interest loans, which has been crucial for the viability of nuclear projects, as noted by The Paper. According to Bloomberg's predictions, China's operational nuclear capacity will reach 110 million kilowatts by 2030, surpassing any other country. If this trend continues, China's nuclear park could reach 200 gigawatts by 2040, equivalent to around 10% of the country's total energy production. China's nuclear expansion is a strategic move, as it seeks to position itself as an exporter of nuclear technology, including its own Hualong One reactor design. If this trend consolidates, China will emerge as a geopolitical reference point in the new energy order, combining industrial capacity, state financing, and energy diplomacy to challenge Western hegemony.

**China Approves Construction of 10 New Nuclear Power Units**
China's State Council has approved the construction of 10 new nuclear power units, according to a report by the state-run newspaper The Paper, which estimated the total investment at 200 billion yuan (US$ 27.44 billion). This continues the country's expansion pace over the past few years, with 10 to 11 units approved annually between 2022 and 2024. The newly approved projects, all using domestic technologies, represent expansions at five operational nuclear power plants: Fangchenggang in Guangxi, Sanmen in Fujian, Haiyang in Shandong, Xiapu in Chongqing, and Taishan in Guangdong. China's investment in nuclear engineering and construction reached a record high last year, at 146.9 billion yuan, according to the China Nuclear Association's annual report. By the end of 2024, China had 57 operational units with an installed capacity of nearly 60 gigawatts, according to the report. The report predicts that China will reach the top spot globally in installed nuclear capacity by 2030, currently ranking third behind the US and France. Nuclear energy accounted for around 5% of China's energy generation in 2024 and is expected to increase to 10% by 2040. China has achieved 100% domestic production of essential nuclear equipment, according to the report, and will accelerate self-sufficiency while promoting international cooperation, particularly with major nuclear countries and Belt and Road Initiative nations.

**China, the war-monger - The Singapore Post**
China has rejected a proposal from US President Donald Trump to cut the defense budget by 50%, which would have reduced the chance of a global war and spared funds for development. Instead, China has increased its defense budget to a record high of $249 billion, a 7.2% increase over the previous year. This move has triggered an arms race, with the US and its allies stepping up their defense efforts to combat the threat. The US has announced plans to develop a next-generation fighter jet, the NGAD, which will be way ahead of any other fighter aircraft of the current generation. China has been modernizing its navy and air force, with plans to possess six aircraft carriers by 2035. The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is on the rise, and nations facing the Chinese threat are not sitting idle, increasing their defense budgets and developing advanced arms and weapon platforms. Posterity will brand China as the war-monger, having triggered an arms race through its aggressive moves.

**China and Russia Strengthen Nuclear Alliance, Lifting Restrictions on Chinese Warheads in 2026**
The Pentagon has warned that China is actively supported by Russia in building a more imposing nuclear arsenal, and starting from 2026, all restrictions on the number of Chinese warheads will be lifted. According to the report, China currently has around 600 nuclear warheads, but the number could rise to 1,000 by 2030. China is also developing a vast infrastructure plan that includes the construction of 320 missile launch sites in the western region of the country. The report highlights the role of Russia in providing technology and fissile material for the production of plutonium in Chinese autofertilizing reactors, which has effectively projected China towards a deterrence capacity similar to that of major nuclear powers. The US and Russia are also seeking an agreement on minerals, while China and Russia are strengthening their nuclear alliance, which could lead to a new arms race in 2026.

**China's Nuclear Modernization Accelerates, Raising Concerns About Global Power Balance**
China is accelerating its nuclear modernization, but still lags behind the US. According to a report by the American Federation of Scientists, China has approximately 600 nuclear warheads, with only 24 deployed, compared to the US's 3,748 in 2023. The report estimates that China will surpass 1,000 operational warheads by 2030, but will still be inferior to the US. China is advancing in the construction of its 'nuclear triad', including submarines, land-based missiles, and strategic bombers. The report warns that China's modernization of its conventional forces could raise the threshold for a potential nuclear response. The report also notes that in a scenario of extreme crisis, both China and the US could consider the preventive use of nuclear weapons if they see it necessary. A potential point of friction is Taiwan, a territory that China claims as its own. According to the Pentagon, Beijing could consider the use of its nuclear arsenal if a conventional military defeat in the region threatens the stability of the regime. The report concludes that 'China has continued to accelerate' its nuclear modernization, even in the worst-case scenario projected, where it would reach 1,500 warheads by 2035, it would still be inferior to the US.

**China Accelerates Nuclear Development, Arsenal Expected to Reach 1,000 Warheads by 2035**
China is accelerating its nuclear development, with its arsenal expected to reach 1,000 warheads by 2035. Currently, China has around 600 nuclear warheads, with many more in production. The country is also building three new missile silo fields for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). According to the Nuclear Notebook, the growth of the arsenal will depend on China's stockpiles of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and tritium. In 2023, the International Panel on Fissile Materials estimated that China had around 14 tons of HEU and approximately 2.9 tons of separated plutonium available for nuclear weapons. China aims to acquire significant stockpiles of plutonium using its civilian reactors, including two sodium-cooled fast breeder reactors (CFR-600). Experts note that the most significant development in China's medium- and intermediate-range missile force is the production and deployment of the DF-26 dual-capable missile. The number of DF-26 launchers has increased from 18 in 2018 to 250, with an estimated 500 missiles in 2024, according to Pentagon estimates. The DF-26 has an approximate range of 4,000 kilometers and can strike important US bases in Guam and northeast Asia, as well as much of Russia and all of India. The H-20 is also mentioned as a significant development in China's nuclear capabilities.
