**10 Trends That Will Shape the Future of Food by 2050**
By 2050, the world's food system will be under pressure due to the need to reach net-zero emissions and a projected global population of over 10 billion people. To reduce food waste, companies will need to rethink the food chain. According to food futurists Morgaine Gaye and Joseph Poore, there will be 10 key trends in food production, consumption, and preparation. These include: 1) 'community meals' where food is shared and valued for its emotional and relational aspects; 2) the end of weekly grocery shopping, replaced by AI-powered meal planning and home delivery; 3) clothing that can grow food, such as shirts with built-in gardens; 4) urban agriculture, with shared gardens, vertical farming, and local food systems; 5) food that absorbs CO2, such as seaweed and shellfish; 6) AI-powered food planning to reduce waste and use 'imperfect' fruits and vegetables; 7) climate-resilient crops, such as quinoa and soy in northern Europe; 8) a return to ancient crops, such as sorrel and dandelion; 9) 'niche' crops, such as teff and fonio, becoming mainstream; 10) personalized nutrition, with AI-powered meal planning to prevent disease. According to Poore, 'it's likely that our diet in 2050 will be significantly different from what we have today, although not necessarily in the ways we expect.' Gaye added, 'in the future, we will see significant changes in our daily habits and food models.'

**Are Countries' New Climate Plans Ambitious Enough? What We Know So Far**
The World Resources Institute analyzed the initial submissions of countries' new climate commitments, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), for 2025. The results show that while some countries, such as the U.S., U.K., and Brazil, have made ambitious commitments, many others, including major emitters like the EU and China, have yet to submit their NDCs. The analysis found that the new NDCs submitted so far have made a noticeable but modest dent in the 2035 'emissions gap', with a projected reduction of 1.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) by 2035 compared to 2030. However, this is far from what's needed to keep global warming within safe limits, and many countries, including developed and wealthy economies, have not strengthened their 2030 targets. The analysis also found that some countries, such as the U.K. and Brazil, have set ambitious targets, while others, such as Canada, have made only marginal increases to their targets. The report concludes that much greater ambition and action are needed to narrow the emissions gap and keep global temperature goals within reach.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**CIA Report Warns of Global Catastrophe by 2030: A Countdown to Disaster**
A 2003 report by the CIA, 'The 2030 Spike: Countdown to Global Catastrophe', written by Colin Mason, describes six factors that will converge in the next decade, leading to a global catastrophe. These factors include energy scarcity, demographic disparities, global poverty, climate change, food shortages, water scarcity, and international anarchy. The report proposes over 100 measures to mitigate the consequences of this crisis. According to the report, 'estimates place available petroleum resources at less than one billion barrels, and global consumption at 28 billion barrels per year, indicating depletion in as little as 34 years.' The report also cites studies by the International Water Management Institute, predicting that one billion people will face absolute water scarcity by 2025. To avoid this, the report suggests using science, particularly genetics and climatology, to address climate change, water and food scarcity. However, some measures proposed in the report are more controversial, including: diverting scientific effort from arms, space research, and 'doubtful' technologies to practical goals for humanity; establishing a global authority to define priorities and advise on implementation; forming a 'censor' body to examine new technologies and identify potential harm; creating a specialized international penal law body to prevent the application of harmful technologies; and establishing research institutes with secure funding. The report concludes that these objectives may not be achievable, but can be approached.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**WMO Sounds Alarm: 1.5-Degree Target May Be Reached Sooner Than Thought**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has sounded the alarm, warning that the 1.5-degree Celsius target may be reached sooner than previously thought. The accelerated timeline is due to higher temperatures than expected in recent years, decreasing air pollution that cooled the Earth, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide despite the growth of renewable energy. This means that irreversible tipping points in the climate system, such as the melting of Arctic ice shelves or the widespread collapse of coral reefs, are closer than scientists previously thought. According to the new WMO forecast, the next five years will likely average above 1.5 degrees Celsius. Combined with the recent hot years and expected rising temperatures after 2030, 2027 is likely to be the first year in which the long-term average temperature exceeds the limit, says Zeke Hausfather. The Paris Agreement aimed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, but some scientists and experts privately feared that the more ambitious goal would be impossible due to the difficulty of transforming the energy system. Despite the growth of renewable energy, it still only makes up about a third of the global energy mix. Even if wind, solar, and batteries grow in the power grid, the world consumes more electricity than ever before. The failure of the climate goal puts politicians and negotiators who have tried to gain support for reducing climate-damaging emissions in an uncomfortable position. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres claims that the 1.5-degree target 'hangs by artificial respiration' and 'will soon be dead.' Eventually, nations will acknowledge this failure and need to develop a new goal. 'You could imagine governments saying: 'Hey, 1.5 won't be achievable, but here's what we'll do, and here we'll strengthen our efforts,' says David Victor. 'That's an approach. Another approach would be to give up.' Zeke Hausfather, a climate researcher and head of climate research at Stripe, is personally skeptical about the willingness to spend billions of dollars on dealing with 'Overshoot.' After another decade of inaction, we will talk about the 2-degree target as we now talk about the 1.5-degree target. The nations could focus their attention on the less ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, keeping temperatures below two degrees Celsius. This goal is more achievable, but currently still unlikely. The planet is currently on its way to about 2.5 degrees Celsius. 'The longer we wait, the harder it will be,' emphasizes Hausfather. 'After another decade of inaction, we will talk about the 2-degree target as we now talk about the 1.5-degree target.'

**The World to Come: A Desolate Panorama**
A recent report by Bank of America predicts a paradigm shift of planetary dimensions that will affect values, institutions, and the goals of capitalism in the coming years. However, it has gone largely unnoticed: today it seems to spark more interest the outcome of sports competitions, the judicial verdict that exonerates a football player of the crime of rape, or the upcoming wedding of an influencer who has managed to enter the Olympus of fame by accumulating amateur records that would make Warren Beatty's pale in comparison. The Bofa's forecast for the world of 2030 is quite alarming: one would expect a wave of social fear about an immediate future marked by insecurity and wars, populist radicalization, growing demand for resources, the hegemony of artificial intelligence, or even the transformation of social, cultural, and consumption habits. However, it does not seem to worry much, despite the fact that the signs are becoming clearer and more evident. The report emphasizes the rise of AI, how it will transform and change the global economy, causing a collapse of employment and technological costs, and unprecedented automation, causing a brutal competition between powers and their areas of influence, with conflicts related to privacy and digital security. According to the report, the development of cybercrime could lead to online criminal activities becoming the third-largest economy in the world, after the US and China, causing losses to nations and companies of around $1.6 trillion by 2030. Cybersecurity will undoubtedly be a critical priority for all. So will the scarcity of resources and the growing demand for more energy, water, and essential materials for industry, which will skyrocket, requiring massive investments. Although investment in renewable energy sources will increase, it will not do so at a sufficient rate to sustain technological and economic development. Much less to meet the climate containment objectives that prevent warming. The report emphasizes the gravity of the infrastructure crisis, which will require at least $500 billion in additional annual investments over the next five years, just to avoid the collapse of an increasingly obsolete network of infrastructure. I wonder if governments will be able to spend such large amounts of money, even assuming they are willing to divert those resources from social welfare, healthcare, or military efforts. Because it is absolutely unlikely that healthcare spending will be reduced: the arrival of baby boomers at retirement age will turn health and pensions into a bottomless pit. Growth should allocate more resources to address well-being, but it is more likely to exacerbate the gap between the rich and the poor. It is not difficult for this to happen: populism will encourage radicalization, instability, and political fragmentation. It will weaken traditional parties, while protectionism and de-globalization will create disruptions in international trade. Migration will cause social and political tensions, with a direct impact on electoral processes and public policies in many countries. It could even stop being a determining factor in economic growth, or in the demographic compensation of rich countries with declining birth rates. The rivalry between powers, the competition for resources, and the growth of commercial and military conflicts could put global stability at risk: China and the United States will continue to be at the center of that fight, while Europe will have to choose between bleeding to maintain its defense policy or losing any political relevance. It is more than likely that -despite its political and regulatory stability- the EU will lose influence in a world that is becoming increasingly polarized, in the context of growing popularity of authoritarian models. Despite the speeches, governments will send less, and large technology multinationals will be key actors in shaping the world to come. Their dominance in AI, data management, and cybersecurity will give them unprecedented power, and they will control the economy, politics, and society. With the expansion of generative AI, information manipulation, and the absurdity of the media, this will become a growing problem, intensifying political fragmentation and the erosion of trust in institutions. A desolate panorama, the one of the world to come. Or that is already here, present in the screens of our devices and in the habits of our grandchildren.

**The World in 2030: A New Era of Transformation**
Bank of America has published a report identifying the factors that will transform the global order by 2030. The next five years will be a turning point, with a change in the old paradigms. The world will face a growing demand for resources, processing power, and bandwidth, as well as an increase in the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The report highlights the need for a new infrastructure and a modernized global network to support the growing demand for energy, water, and critical minerals. The report also notes that the populism will try to establish itself in power, there will be commercial conflicts, and the arms race will intensify. Additionally, the consumption pattern will shift from the baby boomers to the Generation Z, and there will be a growing need for healthcare services and biomedical discoveries. According to Vanessa Cook, strategist at Bank of America Institute, the world will break away from the old rules that have worked in the last decades. The report predicts that the prices of technology will drop, and the integration of AI will become more widespread. The report also notes that the cybersecurity will become a major concern, with the cost of cybercrime expected to reach $15.6 trillion by 2030.

**D√ºzce University Warns of Global Water Scarcity by 2030**
Prof. Dr. Deniz Yaƒülƒ±oƒülu, the head of the Biology Department at D√ºzce University, warned that the world's population will be at risk of water scarcity by 2030, with half of the world's population facing water shortages. Yaƒülƒ±oƒülu emphasized the need for immediate action to protect water sources and called on individuals to take responsibility for conserving water. According to Yaƒülƒ±oƒülu, the world's freshwater resources are being rapidly depleted due to agricultural, industrial, and domestic uses, and by 2030, half of the world's population will be at risk of water scarcity. Yaƒülƒ±oƒülu stated, 'Water is essential for both ecosystems and humanity. However, global climate change, population growth, pollution, and unconscious water consumption threaten water resources and put our future at risk. We cannot shift our responsibility to others. The source of pollution and its consequences are humanity itself, and the damage it causes to nature is a result of our actions.' Yaƒülƒ±oƒülu emphasized the need to take action to prevent water scarcity, saying, 'Let us take action to leave a clean world for future generations. Today, on World Water Day, I invite everyone to take responsibility and protect our water resources. Let us not forget that the problem is everyone's problem, and the solution is in everyone's hands.'

**The 2030 Prophecy: Are We Heading Toward a Global Reset?**
The year 2030 has been a recurring theme in global agendas, technological forecasts, and speculative theories. The World Economic Forum (WEF) has hinted at a 'new economic model', where ownership is redefined, and some believe this means digital currencies replacing cash or a world where 'you will own nothing and be happy.' The WEF has also warned about an unsustainable global economy, with rising debt, inflation, and a growing gap between the ultra-rich and the struggling masses. By 2030, artificial intelligence will have surpassed human intelligence in many fields, and automation will replace millions of jobs. Some experts warn of an AI-led economic and social shift, where humans become obsolete in the workforce, forcing an universal basic income (UBI) or a new form of economic survival. The United Nations' Agenda 2030 focuses heavily on climate change and sustainability, with many governments setting 2030 as the deadline for carbon neutrality, renewable energy transitions, and radical policy changes. The term 'Great Reset' has been widely debated, with some believing it is an effort to reshape capitalism and global governance, while others see it as an elite-driven plan to centralize power and limit individual freedoms. Whether planned or accidental, a global reset seems inevitable, with technology, economics, and environmental pressures converging toward a radical shift.

**Supercomputer Predicts End of World in 2050**
The supercomputer World One has made a prediction about the end of the world, stating that it will occur in 2050. The prediction is based on factors such as environmental pollution and population growth. According to the forecast, if no action is taken, the quality of life for all people on Earth will decrease by 2040. The pollution will be so severe that it will lead to a massive loss of human life, and the planet's population will decrease to levels seen in 1900. World One was created in 1973 and has made previous predictions about the future, including a decrease in access to natural resources and essential minerals.

**A Future World in 2040: Unequal and Plagued by Contradictions**
The book 'Come ne usciremo' (How will we get out of this) is a collective work of speculative nonfiction that imagines a future world in 2040. The authors, led by Fabio Deotto, have created a realistic scenario where the transition to renewable energy has occurred, but the world remains unequal and plagued by contradictions and problems. The book highlights the risks of a world where some people have more rights and privileges than others, and where the cost of the transition is borne by the global south. The authors also imagine a world where the climate crisis is hidden or distorted, and where the consequences of inaction are dire. They warn that continuing to seek emergency measures will only delay the collapse, and that a true solution requires addressing the root causes of the problem. The book is a call to action, urging readers to imagine a different future and to work towards creating a more equitable and sustainable world.

**Countdown to Save the World from Climate Chaos**
Experts see a glimmer of hope, but demand viable measures to curb climate change. The year 2025 is crucial for the planet, and according to experts, what happens in the coming months will have a decisive impact on the future of our species and the world we live in. This is the year in which, as stipulated in the Paris Agreement, countries must present new plans to reduce emissions that will allow them to limit global temperature increases and contain climate chaos. The goal is to design 'more ambitious' and 'more viable' measures to curb the climate crisis. According to an analysis by the International Energy Agency, if current trends continue, the world will be exposed to an increase of 2-3 degrees Celsius in average temperature by the end of the century. In places like Spain, this would translate to an increase of over 4 degrees Celsius in average temperature, as well as more droughts, more torrential rains, and more extreme weather events. Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Service, says that the current situation is 'a warning signal' but not a definitive defeat in the fight against climate change. The study highlights 2025 as a key year for global climate action. According to the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), this is the year in which greenhouse gas emissions must peak and then decline sharply to reach half by 2030 and net zero by 2050. However, current trends show that global emissions, especially those from fossil fuel combustion, continue to grow year after year. Experts emphasize that the effort must be common but not equal for all. 'Countries that have historically emitted more must make more efforts to reduce emissions,' says Olga Alcaraz Sendra, director of the group of researchers on climate change governance at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. According to her analysis, based on equity criteria, countries like the US should be the first to apply drastic cuts and achieve climate neutrality. Europe should reduce its emissions by 90-95% by 2035. Achieving these numbers is not just a matter of mathematics, but international cooperation. 'No country has a concrete goal for reducing emissions, but rather each government sets its own objectives,' says Ana P√©rez Catal√°, researcher at the Institute for Sustainable Development (IDDRI) in Paris. According to her, the current context will be decisive for designing these climate objectives. On the one hand, the convulsive geopolitical situation, wars, and the victory of Donald Trump could minimize the importance of the climate debate. On the other hand, the increase in natural disasters on the planet, from the floods in Valencia to the fires in Los Angeles, could serve to design more ambitious measures. The great challenge of reducing emissions is in the hands of national policies and large-scale measures in economic and industrial sectors. However, experts emphasize that citizens also have a key role in this fight. But how? A survey led by the Ipsos platform showed the 'gap' between the measures people believe help reduce emissions and those that actually have an impact. The 59% of the population believes that recycling is a key measure to reduce emissions, but in reality, this measure has a minimal impact on emissions. In contrast, a measure like reducing car use, which only 17% of the population mentions, is the one that would save the most CO2. Similarly, among individual actions that are most effective in reducing emissions, minimizing flights, and adopting a more vegetarian diet with less meat stand out. The 2025 year starts with the ambitious challenge of accelerating the global climate fight. At least on paper, countries will have to present their updated plans for reducing emissions in the coming months. The EU will present its objective during the first quarter. After that, at the UN assembly in Brazil, it will be discussed whether the sum of all these commitments is enough to avoid extreme global warming. 'What gives me more hope is that we don't need magic recipes or science fiction tools. The solutions already exist and are already here,' concludes P√©rez Catal√°.
