**Dems' suicidal groupthink, Israel haters' anti-aid insanity and...**
The Liberal Patriot's John Halpin questions why Democratic leaders ignored warnings about the party's decline with working-class voters and its economic and cultural agenda. He attributes this to 'groupthink' that suppressed dissenting voices and rejected information that didn't fit the group's consensus. Meanwhile, Spiked's Brendan O'Neill notes that Israel's Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which aims to provide aid to the Gaza Strip, is being criticized by activists who 'hate this initiative' due to their 'twisted minds, so addled by Israelophobia.' Additionally, City Journal's John Hirschauer highlights the resurgence of Christianity in America, particularly among Generation Z, who are rebelling against a culture that rejects traditional values. Furthermore, The Hill's Kara Dansky criticizes Sen. John Fetterman's chief of staff for dismissing women's concerns about female-only spaces and the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. Finally, The Wall Street Journal's editorial board argues that the budget bill's Medicaid reforms would improve healthcare by expanding private insurance options, which provide better access and health outcomes than Medicaid.

**Fetterman Went to Israel on NYC Mental Health Nonprofit's Dime**
Sen. John Fetterman took an all-expenses-paid trip to Israel in March, funded by the New York City nonprofit Relief Resources, which focuses on mental health in the international Jewish community. The trip, which cost over $36,000, included meetings with President Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, as well as a visit to a drone base and the 'Diamond' unit headquarters. Fetterman's office and Relief Resources did not respond to requests for comment. Former staffers have criticized Fetterman's focus on Israel, saying 'he's more the ambassador to Israel than the senator from Pennsylvania.' Fetterman has been under scrutiny for missing 30 floor votes this year and canceling town halls in his home state of Pennsylvania. 'There are 99 other senators who take trips to foreign countries but also show up in their state to do their job, and to vote and do their work,' said one former staffer. 'He's taken two all-expenses-paid trips to Israel, but can't drive down the street and hold a town hall. It's pretty crazy.'

**One Entry in Politico's Dem 'Shadow Cabinet' Piece Shows the Lib Media Has Learned Nothing**
A recent article in Politico features a list of 21 'unexpected heavy hitters' for a Democratic 'shadow cabinet', but the picks are seen as laughable and a reflection of the liberal media's failure to learn from their defeats against Donald Trump. The list includes Gisele Fetterman, the wife of Sen. John Fetterman, as the Department of Homeland Security secretary, despite her being an undocumented immigrant. Other picks include Letitia James, under investigation for mortgage fraud, as shadow attorney general, Jon Stewart as secretary of Veterans Affairs, and Bill Nye as hypothetical EPA administrator. The author argues that these individuals would never be confirmed and that the list highlights the lack of charismatic Democrats who could win the White House.

**Politico list floats 'Democratic shadow cabinet' of political celebrities to combat Trump**
Politico writer Bill Scher proposed a 'Democratic shadow cabinet' of 21 'heavy hitters' to take on the Trump administration. The list includes former Biden officials, comedians, and other accomplished individuals who can 'speak plainly and puncture the Trump administration's often Orwellian narratives.' Scher's suggestions include New York Attorney General Letitia James as 'shadow' U.S. Attorney General, comedian Jon Stewart as Secretary of Veteran Affairs, and billionaire Mark Cuban as Secretary of Commerce. He also suggested unconventional figures such as Gisele Fetterman, wife of Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, as Secretary of Homeland Security, citing her experience as an undocumented migrant. Scher's proposal is part of a growing call for a shadow cabinet, with Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin and Rep. Wiley Nickels, D-N.C., also proposing similar ideas.

**Who will Maine Democrats run against Susan Collins?**
Maine Democrats are still searching for a candidate to challenge Senator Susan Collins in the 2026 election. Governor Janet Mills has been mentioned as a potential candidate, but she has downplayed the idea of running. Other Democrats, including Maine Speaker of the House Ryan Fecteau and former state Sen. Cathy Breen, are considering a run. However, some Democrats may be waiting to see if Mills enters the Senate race before making their own decisions. 'I think most of the people who are considering running would consider (Mills) a friend and an ally, so I think people are looking to see what her intentions are before they move forward,' said David Farmer, a Democratic political consultant. Collins, who will be seeking her sixth term, is expected to face a tough election cycle due to her perceived lack of loyalty to President Donald Trump. 'Mainers know Susan Collins isn’t standing up for them, and in 2026, they will hold her accountable for selling them out,' said Maeve Coyle. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has expressed confidence that Democrats will have a strong candidate to challenge Collins. 'I’m aware many people have mentioned (Mills’) name, and I’m sure she is also aware of that and is giving it careful thought,' said Charlie Dingman, chair of the Maine Democratic Party.

**Photos of the week | May 16-22, 2025 - Roll Call**
It was a somber week in Washington with the passing of Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, D-Va., and the shooting of two Israeli Embassy workers. However, the House also made significant progress on the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act', with late-night markups and a visit from President Donald Trump. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Freedom Caucus members expressed their views on the bill, while Reps. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., and Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, comforted aides after a tribute to the late Rep. Connolly. The House Rules Committee hearing on the bill lasted from 1 a.m. to 8 a.m. on Wednesday, and President Trump met with House Republicans to discuss the budget reconciliation bill. 'It was a great week for the House,' said Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. 'We made significant progress on the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' and took important steps towards passing the budget reconciliation bill.' However, the week was not without its challenges, as Rep. LaMonica McIver was charged with assaulting law enforcement officers outside a New Jersey ICE detention facility. 'We will continue to work tirelessly to pass legislation that benefits the American people,' said House Republican Conference Chair Lisa McClain, R-Mich. 'We will not be deterred by the challenges we face.'

**Battle to be top Dem on Oversight begins**
The House Democratic Caucus has begun a secret ballot election to determine the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, following the death of Rep. Gerry Connolly. According to House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, the race is competitive, with no clear front-runner. Candidates include Stephen Lynch, Kweisi Mfume, Robert Garcia, and Jasmine Crockett. Crockett has gained support from liberal activists, including David Hogg, who said, 'I am hoping.' The timing of the election and the gathering of support will be crucial in determining the outcome.

**Blagojevich likens Adam Schiff to Elvis Presley: 'King of the Democratic liars'**
Former Governor Rod Blagojevich criticized the Democratic Party for its initial support of President Joe Biden's re-election, stating that the party is in 'serious trouble' due to its lack of integrity and tendency to spread lies. Blagojevich likened Adam Schiff to Elvis Presley, calling him the 'King of the Democratic liars.' He suggested that the party should 'atone for their sins' by seeking common ground with President Trump and 'put the people first' instead of prioritizing politics. Blagojevich also joked that Democrats should not 'put a hoodie on' like Sen. John Fetterman, but rather focus on getting things done for their constituents.

**PDP National Assembly Caucus fully behind party's revival plan - Abba Moro**
The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the National Assembly has expressed full support for the party's efforts to rebuild and reposition itself ahead of the 2027 general elections. According to Senate Minority Leader Abba Moro, the party's lawmakers are committed to the leadership's plan, which includes a series of strategic activities culminating in the national convention. Moro acknowledged recent defections from the party but insisted that they do not define the PDP's future, stating that the party remains the strongest political brand in Nigeria. 'While we acknowledge that the defection of senior members may pose temporary challenges, we are confident that the party, with its enduring ideals and vision, will emerge stronger and remain the party to beat in 2027,' he said. Moro urged members not to lose faith in the party's potential, stating that Nigeria deserves an alternative, and that alternative is the PDP. 'Given the antics of the ruling party to keep us down, we must remind ourselves that Nigeria deserves an alternative, and that alternative is the PDP,' he said.

**Will House Democrats pick seniority or a shake-up?**
House Democrats are set to choose a new leader in the upcoming June 24 caucus election. The question is whether they will stick with the traditional seniority system or shake things up and choose a new generation of progressive leaders. This comes as the party looks to move beyond the 'gerontocracy' that has defined their leadership for a long time. As one of the trending articles on the site notes, 'Are Democrats finally ready to shake off the gerontocracy that’s long defined their leadership—and pass the torch to a new generation of progressives?'

**Sen. John Fetterman says his mental health struggles have been 'weaponized' against him, shaming him into attending votes and hearings**
US Senator John Fetterman has spoken out about the media's portrayal of his mental health struggles, saying they have been 'weaponized' against him. Fetterman, who has been following a strict protocol from his doctors after treatment for clinical depression and a stroke, has been shamed into attending Senate votes and hearings, which he believes are a waste of his time. He told the New York Times, 'My doctor warned years ago: 'After it's public that you are getting help for depression, people will weaponize that.' Simple things are turned. That's exactly what happened.' Fetterman has missed 29 of 236 votes since January, but dismissed such duties as 'performative' and said he prefers to spend time with his family. He also portrayed himself as a victim of unfair attacks, saying, 'This became the Belichick girlfriend story of politics.' Despite support from friends in Congress, Fetterman does not attend the weekly Democratic caucus lunch and has quit the caucus group chat, saying, 'It's mostly just happy birthdays. Some days, it's just emojis.'

**Fetterman's response to AOC after she said Dems must 'fight harder'**
Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman continued his public feud with fellow Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after she criticized his vote to approve a Republican continuing resolution to avoid a government shutdown. Fetterman dismissed Ocasio-Cortez's call to 'fight harder' against Donald Trump, saying that shutting down the government would have harmed millions and plunged the country into chaos. Ocasio-Cortez appeared to respond by making peace with Fetterman's 2022 primary rival, Connor Lamb, and thanked him for his support. Fetterman has been pushing back on his own caucus' approach to the continuing resolution and accused Senate Democrats of 'theater' to save face. He also slammed his party's muted response to President Trump's address to Congress, calling it a 'sad cavalcade of self owns and unhinged petulance.' Fetterman has been floated as a potential presidential candidate in 2028.

Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman responded to criticism from fellow Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who said the party needs to 'fight harder' against Donald Trump.

He also accused Senate Democrats of 'theater' to save face, saying 'Shut the government down, plunge the country into chaos, risk a recession, or Exchange cloture for a 30 day CR that 100% fails.' Ocasio-Cortez appeared to respond by making peace with Fetterman's main rival in the 2022 Democrat Primary, Connor Lamb, saying 'I was wrong about you and I'm sorry.' Fetterman has taken a shot at AOC for criticizing his vote with Senate Republicans before, and has pushed back on his own caucus' approach to the continuing resolution.

**Democrats To Reject House Funding Bill Amid Looming Shutdown Threat**
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that Senate Democrats will reject the government funding bill passed by Republicans, casting doubt on whether Congress can prevent a shutdown before Friday's deadline. Schumer expressed hope that Republicans will collaborate with Democrats to avert a shutdown, saying, 'Our caucus is unified on a clean April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass.' However, Democrats are divided on whether to support the six-month funding measure, with some concerned that a shutdown would have worse consequences. Schumer proposed a one-month extension of current spending levels, but this proposal is seen as unlikely to gain traction. A shutdown is set to occur at midnight Friday unless President Donald Trump signs a new funding bill. Some Democrats, like Senator John Fetterman, may have little choice but to accept the current proposal to avoid a shutdown.

**US Senate Democrats fume over Trump-backed stopgap bill as shutdown deadline nears**
US Senate Democrats are opposing a 6-1/2 month funding bill passed by the Republican-controlled House, which would provide time for more comprehensive appropriations bills. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned that his caucus of 47 senators is 'unified' in opposing the bill, which would require at least 41 Democrats to vote against limiting debate. Schumer said, 'I hope our Republican colleagues will join us to avoid a shutdown on Friday.' Republicans are blaming Democrats for a potential shutdown, with Senator Markwayne Mullin saying, 'If they decide to shut down the government, it's 100% a Schumer shutdown at that point.' Democrats are seeking votes that could highlight spending cuts that many of their voters oppose, and Senator John Fetterman said he is willing to vote for the House-passed bill, but criticized its elements, such as a nearly $1 billion cut to the District of Columbia's budget. Fetterman said, 'I will never vote for chaos -- or even more chaos than we are already in right now by forcing a government shutdown.'

**Democratic 'frontrunner' for 2028 goes after his own party**
Senator John Fetterman, seen as a potential candidate for the 2028 presidential election, criticized his own party's response to President Trump's address to Congress, saying 'I don't think that was the best look for our party last night.' Fetterman took to X to share a more hostile take on his party's performance, calling it a 'sad cavalcade of self owns and unhinged petulance.' Bill Maher recently called for Fetterman to run, saying 'Democrats need to find their Trump.' Fetterman has been floated as a potential candidate due to his break from his party's liberal wing and his ability to connect with everyday Americans. Despite suffering health issues during his senate run in 2022, Fetterman has emerged as a potential Democrat presidential candidate. 'He's a commonsense person. He's not liberal or conservative. He's just a commonsense person, which is beautiful,' Trump said of Fetterman. Fetterman's potential candidacy comes as Democrats are searching for a standard bearer to lead them into the 2028 election, following Kamala Harris' resounding defeat in November.

**Senator Fetterman’s staffers quit in protest of his support for Israel**
A total of seven staffers, including Communications Director Charlie Hills and Legislative Director Tré Easton, have resigned from Senator John Fetterman's office in protest of his support for Israel during its war against Hamas. According to former staffer Carrie Adams, 'I don't agree with him,' Adams told The Free Press. 'I have a sense that his international views are a lot less nuanced than my generation.' The resignations, which began last year, have been attributed to differences with Fetterman regarding Israel. As reported by Yedioth Aharanoth, the office work environment was 'almost entirely consumed by Israel-related matters.' Fetterman's shift to the right has frustrated some within the Democratic caucus, who had campaigned as a progressive in the 2022 Senate race in Pennsylvania.

**Fetterman's Office Experiences Wave of Resignations Amid Shift to Right**
Senator John Fetterman's office in Pennsylvania is experiencing a wave of resignations and departures due to his consistent defense of Israel and his abandonment of progressive policies he advocated for during his 2022 election campaign. According to Aqila Lisi, a reporter for The Intercept, the departures reflect a deep sense of disappointment among Fetterman's staff due to his refusal to support progressive policies and his shift to the right, embracing Donald Trump's extreme views. One former staffer said, 'The big change in staff' in Fetterman's office 'is in a tough hiring environment for Democratic staff in Washington.' Another former staffer said, 'I don't find this surprising,' adding, 'I think the reason staff are frustrated is that working in Fetterman's office means working for Israel all the time.' Two of the latest departures are Charlie Heilz, Fetterman's communications director, who will leave on Friday, and legislative director Taryn Easton, whose departure date is unclear. Easton told NBC News in a statement, 'We've created a legislative team that I believe is a blueprint for how Democrats should govern when they have power.' Heilz and Fetterman's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A former campaign staffer said the staff exodus is a sign that people in Fetterman's office are tired of his abandonment of promises to ease the economy for the working class, defend the poor, immigrants, and the LGBTQ+ community, and push for criminal justice reform in the Senate.

**Fetterman loses two top staffers as he makes waves by bucking Democratic Party**
Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., is experiencing staff turnover as he continues to defy the Democratic Party. Two top staffers, Deputy Chief of Staff and Legislative Director Tré Easton and Communications Director Charlie Hills, have left Fetterman's office. Easton stated, 'Working for John afforded me the opportunity to build a diligent policy team from scratch,' and 'Together we created a legislative body of work that I think is a blueprint for how Democrats should be governing when they have power.' This is not the first time Fetterman has lost staff, as three communications staffers left in early 2024 and his previous communications chief, Carrie Adams, stopped working for him after publicly disagreeing with his stance on Israel. Fetterman has been making waves in the Senate by bucking his party on issues such as Israel, immigration, and supporting Trump cabinet nominees.
