**Govt May Impose 1.5% Tax on Import Payments in Upcoming Budget**
The government is considering a 1.5 percent withholding tax on import payments, targeting commercial importers and expected to be the largest revenue source in the FY2025-26 budget. The tax would be collected when banks process remittances to overseas suppliers, replacing the current system. The amount would be adjustable against the importers' final tax liabilities. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has briefed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on plans to collect taxes at various stages, including goods arrival, shipment, and foreign payment. The policy aims to curb under-invoicing by linking tax deduction directly to payment transactions. However, the FBR's increasing reliance on indirect taxes has led to concerns, such as the 45 percent decline in sales of packaged juices due to a 20 percent federal excise duty (FED) and 18 percent GST.

**Centre eyes tighter customs rules to curb smuggling by 'import carriers'**
The Indian government is planning to tighten customs rules to curb smuggling by 'import carriers', who bring in goods beyond permissible limits or which may be banned in the country. Current regulations allow Indian residents to bring in goods from overseas worth up to ₹50,000 duty-free, and up to ₹1,00,000 from some West Asian countries. Measures being discussed include making declarations more detailed, placing a cap on how often passengers can avail duty-free allowances annually, and enhancing the existing Atithi app's digital customs declaration system with AI-based profiling and stricter tracking. Experts suggest that a liberal trading regime with lower tariffs and fewer restrictions could reduce the incentive for smuggling and improve enforcement focus. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence seized over 1,300 kg of smuggled gold in 2023-24, while industry estimates suggest around 700 kg of gold is smuggled daily, causing annual losses of nearly $10 billion.

**The GOP's budget bill will pass in spite of itself**
Despite the recent layoffs and cutbacks in Washington, federal spending has continued to rise, increasing by 8.7% since January 21 compared to the same period in 2024, and 7.2% compared to 2023. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that spending in the 2025 fiscal year is up 7% through April over the same period a year earlier. The increase is driven by the growth of social insurance programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, as well as interest payments on the federal debt. The Trump-backed tax and spending bill that passed the House last week aims to cut Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, but most other big spending categories appear to be largely unaffected. Revenue from customs and certain excise taxes, also known as tariffs, is up 82%, but this is in doubt after a recent court ruling. Individual income taxes have generated most of this year's revenue gains, but this is volatile and may not continue. As Justin Fox notes, 'For all the action in Washington since Jan. 21, it's a remarkably familiar picture. Federal income tax revenue is volatile, and spending on Social Security, Medicare and other social insurance programs just keeps going up.'

**TFN Orders ARCA to Refund Impuesto PAIS Payment**
The Fiscal Court of the Nation (TFN) has ruled in favor of Ferrosider S.A.'s action for protection against the Agency for Collection and Customs Control (ARCA) due to the unjustified delay in processing the refund of the Impuesto PAIS. The court ordered ARCA to 'resolve the request for refund immediately'. This decision sets a precedent for other claims of unjustified delays in both the administrative and federal justice spheres. According to private sector sources, ARCA's debt to importers amounts to $3,000 million. The majority of this debt was generated when the tax was introduced with a 7.5% rate, which was later increased to 17.5% and then eliminated in December 2024. The court stated that 'the administrative delay incurred by the National Treasury exceeds the reasonable deadlines imposed by the duty of good administration and affects the rights of the taxpayer'. The court also noted that the delay was 'excessive' and that ARCA had failed to comply with its obligations, despite the taxpayer having fulfilled their part of the process.

**State Duma Passes Amendments to Federal Budget for 2025**
The State Duma has passed in the first reading a project of amendments to the federal budget for 2025. The budget's income is reduced by 1.79 trillion rubles, and the deficit increases by 2.62 trillion rubles, making up 1.7% of the GDP. According to the draft law (N914318-8), the federal budget's income will decrease by 1 trillion 789 billion 867 million rubles in 2025 and will be 38 trillion 506 billion 232 million rubles. 'The impact of the mentioned reduction on the balance of the federal budget is neutralized by the 'budget rule'', - it is stated in the explanatory note. The non-oil and gas income of the federal budget in 2025 is estimated at 30 trillion 188 billion 811 million rubles, which is 829 billion 157 million rubles more than the previously forecasted value. The main factors of the change in the federal budget's income are: the change of the basic parameters of the socio-economic development forecast (mainly in terms of the US dollar exchange rate and the price of Russian oil); the actual dynamics of the federal budget's income receipt for the past period of 2025; the adoption of separate decisions and changes in legislation affecting the receipt of the federal budget's income - including in relation to the tax on gas condensate, the tax on oil, the state duty, import and export customs duties, administrative fines. The total volume of expenses increases by 829 billion 157 million rubles within the receipt of additional non-oil and gas income and will be 42 trillion 298 billion 673 million rubles. The federal budget's deficit in 2025 will increase by 2 trillion 619 billion 24 million rubles and will be 3 trillion 792 billion 441 million rubles (1.7% of the GDP). The non-oil and gas deficit has remained at the level provided for by the previously adopted budget law - 12 trillion 109 billion 862 million rubles. The main changes are related to the increase in the volume of use of the National Wealth Fund, the decrease in the amount of foreign exchange funds previously accumulated on the federal budget's accounts due to additional oil and gas income, the decrease in the volume of receipts in the federal budget of funds from the sale of shares and other forms of participation in the capital, located in federal ownership, as well as the decrease in the volume of return of budget loans. The forecasted volume of the National Wealth Fund at the end of 2025 will decrease from 12 trillion 883.5 billion rubles to 12 trillion 757.2 billion rubles (or 5.8% of the GDP), or by 126.4 billion rubles, due to the planned use of the National Wealth Fund to ensure the balance of the federal budget and the negative exchange rate difference.

**Goldman Sachs: US Debt Levels Pose Greater Risk Than Tariffs**
According to Goldman Sachs Group executive John Waldron, bond investors are increasingly concerned about the US government's rising debt levels, rather than customs duties. In a speech at the Bernstein conference on Thursday, Waldron stated, 'While all eyes are on tariffs, the focus in the bond market is shifting to US budget discussions. I would say that's a bit concerning. I don't think the biggest macroeconomic risk is tariffs right now.' Waldron argued that the increase in US Treasury debt issuance is particularly driving up long-term bond yields. This is increasing the cost of borrowing for the US government and increasing the risk of budget deficits, growth, and rising borrowing costs. However, strong demand for US Treasury auctions has been welcomed in the bond market. In a 7-year bond auction worth $44 billion, the yield was 4.194%, below market rates.

**Brazil's Central Government Records R$17.782 Billion Primary Surplus in April**
The central government recorded a primary surplus of R$17,782 billion in April, due to stronger revenue collection, compared to a surplus of R$11,585 billion in the same month of 2024, according to the National Treasury. The result, which includes accounts from the Treasury, Central Bank, and Social Security, was better than expected by the market, as reported by Reuters, which forecast a surplus of R$15.9 billion for the month. The performance of the month was due to a 5.1% real increase in liquid revenue -- excluding transfers to regional governments -- and a 2.5% real increase in total expenses compared to April 2024. The increase in revenue was influenced by a 3.3% real increase in revenue managed by the Federal Revenue, which includes the collection of federal taxes. The main gains include an 18.2% increase in Import Tax collection, a 6.4% increase in Income Tax, and a 10.2% increase in Contribution on Corporate Profit (CSLL). Non-administered revenues also rose 18.2%, driven by increases in dividends and participations, as well as the exploration of natural resources. On the expense side, the increase was due to higher disbursements of pension benefits (+2.4%) and the Benefit of Continuous Payment (BPC, +9.9%). In the accumulated first four months of this year, the central government recorded a primary surplus of R$72,360 billion. In the same period in 2024, a surplus of R$31,756 billion was recorded. The 2025 primary result target is a deficit of zero, with a tolerance of 0.25 percentage points of the Gross Domestic Product, corresponding to approximately R$31 billion. The economic team announced last week a R$31.3 billion real budget containment to meet fiscal rules, also presenting a series of increases in IOF tax rates to avoid a further reduction in funds. Part of the decree increasing the tax was reversed, but the government continues to face political and market resistance to the initiative. Any additional reversal of the measure, which is estimated to raise around R$20 billion this year, is likely to further compress the government's accounts.

**Tariff Troubles: U.S. Economy Faces Uncertain Future | Law-Order**
The U.S. economy is facing an uncertain future due to mounting tariff-related costs. According to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, corporate profits fell by $118.1 billion in the first quarter, a stark contrast to the previous quarter's $204.7 billion surge. The imposition of sweeping import duties by President Donald Trump has led to turbulence in consumer and business sentiments, causing unprecedented volatility in the financial markets. The Federal Reserve highlighted the growing downside risks to employment and economic activity and upward risks to inflation due to potential tariff increases. Companies across various sectors, such as airlines and motor vehicle manufacturers, have refrained from offering financial forecasts for 2025, citing the uncertain tariff environment. As one economist noted, 'the uncertain tariff environment is a major concern for the country's economic outlook.'

**US Collects Record $16 Billion in Customs Duties in April**
The US Treasury Department reported that the government collected a record $16 billion in customs duties in April, an increase of approximately $9 billion compared to the same month in 2024. This increase occurred during a month in which President Donald Trump increased tariffs on Chinese products to 145%, while imposing tariffs of at least 10% on imports from other countries. According to the budget results, the US collected over $500 million per day in customs duties in April. Trump said last month that the collections were around $2 billion per day. In the first seven months of the fiscal year, net customs duties totaled $63 billion, compared to $48 billion in the same period last year. However, it is likely that these new revenues will decrease. Over the weekend, the US and China reached an agreement to temporarily reduce their high mutual tariffs: the US will reduce its tariffs from 145% to 30% over the next 90 days, while Chinese tariffs on US imports will decrease from 125% to 10%. As a result, the US government recorded a budget surplus of $258 billion in April, 23% more, or $49 billion, than the previous year, reflecting the strong tax collection in the last month of the fiscal season and the record collection of import duties.

**US Customs Revenue Surges 87% in April, But Experts Warn of Broader Economic Costs**
The United States recorded a significant increase in customs revenue in April, with $163 billion in customs revenue, a 87% increase from the previous month. This is the first tangible result of the trade war initiated by former US President Donald Trump. However, experts point out that the invisible losses far exceed this gain. According to the US Treasury Department, customs revenue in April was $160 billion, an 86% increase from $17.5 billion in March. This is more than double the $7.1 billion in the same month last year. Since October last year, the US has collected $6.33 trillion in customs revenue, a 154 billion dollar increase from the previous year. This is the highest monthly customs revenue in at least 10 years, according to Bloomberg. However, experts note that customs revenue is a small fraction of the federal government's total revenue (approximately $49 trillion per year) and that the negative impact on the US economy as a whole is likely to be much greater. The Tax Policy Institute estimates that the additional 'consumer burden' caused by customs duties will be up to $1,243 per household in 2025. The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a economic analysis institution created by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, warns that the US GDP could decrease by up to 6% due to customs duties. While customs revenue may have a positive impact on the US budget in the short term, the real cost may be widespread and affect consumers, businesses, and the economy as a whole.

**US Customs Duties Reach $15.6 Billion in April**
The United States collected $15.6 billion in customs duties in April, a 91% increase from March, according to the US Treasury Department. The April figure is nearly twice the March amount of $8.2 billion. The total customs duties collected since the start of the 2025 fiscal year, which began on October 1, 2024, have reached $59.2 billion, a 15 billion dollar increase from the same period last year. The increase is attributed to the implementation of tariffs on imported goods by President Donald Trump, which were aimed at reducing the US trade deficit. However, on April 9, the President announced that over 75 countries had not taken retaliatory measures and requested negotiations, and therefore, the basic import tariffs of 10% will be applied to all countries except China for 90 days.

**US Customs Revenue Sees Significant Increase in April 2025**
The US Treasury Department announced that the United States collected approximately $16.3 billion in total customs revenue in April 2025, a $7.6 billion increase from March of the same year. According to the US Customs and Border Protection agency, this monthly figure reflects the funds received by the government, which includes 'customs revenue' or the collected tariffs. Since President Donald Trump took office on January 20, the US has collected approximately $37.9 billion in customs revenue. Since the start of the 2025 fiscal year, which began in October 2024, the US has collected approximately $63.3 billion in total customs revenue, a $15 billion increase from the same period last year, as stated by the US Customs and Border Protection agency.

**US rakes in record $16B in customs duties in April from Trump tariffs**
The US collected a record $16 billion in customs duties in April, a $9 billion increase from the previous year and $7.6 billion more than the previous month. The surge in customs payments is attributed to President Trump's tariffs on imported goods, which have increased to as much as 145% on Chinese goods. The Treasury Department reported a $258 billion budget surplus for April, up 23% from the previous year. The US government also posted a record $63 billion in net customs duties for the first seven months of the fiscal year. However, the new revenue is expected to drop off after the US and China reached a deal to temporarily ease their steep tariffs. Receipts in April were driven by a 16% increase in individual non-withheld tax payments and a 16% rise in individual refunds. The Treasury Department reported a $1.05 trillion budget deficit for the first seven months of fiscal 2025, up 23% from the previous year.

The US Treasury Department announced on Monday that the United States collected approximately $16.3 billion in customs duties during the month of April 2025, representing a significant increase of around $7.6 billion compared to March of the same year. According to the department, this substantial rise in customs revenue reflects an increase in the volume of dutiable imports, as well as the impact of some changes in customs policies, including the increase of tariffs on certain goods coming from some countries. The Treasury emphasized that these revenues contribute to strengthening the federal budget and covering the costs of some government programs, noting that customs duties are an important source of government income, despite being directly affected by global trade movements and changing customs tariff policies. This announcement comes at a time when international trade is experiencing tensions due to ongoing trade disputes and the return of some protectionist policies, further fueling the debate over the impact of customs duties on the US economy and local consumers.

**Record April Surplus Amidst Tariff Turmoil | Science-Environment**
The U.S. government reported a record $258 billion budget surplus in April, a 23% increase from the previous year, due to robust tax receipts and a surge in customs duties. Customs duties reached $16 billion, a significant jump from $9 billion in the previous year, largely attributed to heightened tariffs on Chinese goods. However, a recent trade agreement with China is expected to reduce future tariff revenues. The surplus was also driven by increased individual tax withholdings and government spending on health and social programs for seniors, the disabled, and lower-income Americans.

**U.S. Budget Surplus Soars Amid Tariff Revenues | Science-Environment**
The U.S. government reported a significant budget surplus of $258 billion for April, driven by strong tax revenues and rising import duties. The customs revenue increase was fueled by high tariffs on Chinese goods, with April's customs duties bringing in $16 billion. However, the year-to-date deficit rose to $1.049 trillion, a 23% annual increase. Despite record receipts and spending, the Treasury noted an adjusted deficit increase of 4% considering deferred tax receipts and calendar anomalies.

**US budget surplus rises 23% to $258 billion in April, customs revenue surges**
The U.S. government reported a $258 billion budget surplus for April, a 23% increase from the previous year. The surplus was driven by strong tax receipts and surging collections of import duties, which totaled $16 billion, a $9 billion increase from the year-earlier period. However, this new revenue is likely to drop off as the U.S. and China have reached a deal to temporarily ease their steep tariffs on each other. The U.S. reported a $1.049 trillion budget deficit for the first seven months of fiscal 2025, a 23% increase from a year earlier. According to an agency official, the deficit would have been 4% higher if not for calendar differences and $85 billion in deferred tax receipts from California. 'The U.S. collected just over $500 million a day from tariffs in April,' said an agency official, contrasting with President Donald Trump's previous estimate of $2 billion a day.

**Fact Check Team: Tariffs instead of taxes? Trump proposes ditching federal income taxes**
President Donald Trump has proposed abolishing federal income taxes, suggesting that tariffs and taxes on foreign nations could replace the revenue. According to projections, the federal government would collect $518 billion in individual income taxes for fiscal year 2025, accounting for 48% of its total revenue. However, experts warn that this shift could lead to higher inflation, offsetting wage increases. As Crystal Stranger, CEO at Optic Tax, noted, 'This increase in disposable income would have the effect of stimulating the economy, but at the expense of likely increasing real inflation.' Several countries, including Bahrain, the Bahamas, and Oman, do not have a federal income tax, relying on alternative revenue sources such as oil and gas revenues or customs duties.
