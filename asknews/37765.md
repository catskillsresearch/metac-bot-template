**We're saving almost enough in our 401(k) retirement plans. Here's the magic number.**
According to Fidelity, the total 401(k) savings rate on their plans reached 14.3% in the first three months of 2025, an all-time high and approaching the 15% benchmark for optimal retirement savings. Employees contributed 9.5% of their salaries, and employers matched 4.8%, for a total savings rate of 14.3%. Retirement planners recommend a 15% contribution rate to 401(k) plans, citing that it will allow individuals to live comfortably in retirement. Experts attribute the gradual ramp-up in 401(k) contribution rates to several positive trends, including auto-enrollment, auto-escalation, and employer matching. Additionally, younger workers, particularly Gen Z, are showing good retirement savings habits, with a total 401(k) savings rate of 11.2%.

**US Budget Deficit Decreases by 9% to $316 Billion in May**
The US Treasury Department released the budget balance report for May, showing that the federal government's budget deficit decreased by 9% compared to the same period last year, reaching $316 billion. The report also noted a significant increase in customs duty revenue due to tariff policies. The budget deficit for May was lower than market expectations, which were $314.3 billion. Revenue increased by 15% to $371 billion, while government spending rose by 2% to $687 billion. The increase in revenue and spending helped to limit the budget deficit. The tariff policies have been a strong source of revenue, with customs duty revenue increasing by 270% to $23 billion in May compared to the same period last year. The total budget deficit for the first eight months of the 2025 fiscal year increased by 14% to $1.365 trillion compared to the same period last year.

**How Much Money You Would Have If the U.S. Made These 3 Policy Changes**
Three policy changes at the federal level could positively impact personal finances. Senate Bill 381 proposes capping credit card interest rates at 10%, which could save millions of Americans struggling with high-interest debt. According to Josh Richner, founder and senior advisor at FaithWorks Financial, 'at today's average APR, carrying a $6,455 balance results in roughly $1,380 in interest over a year. If interest were capped at 10%, the annual interest would drop to around $645, saving the average consumer more than $735 a year.' Another proposed policy, the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' would create a federally-funded savings account with a $1,000 deposit for children born between Jan. 1, 2025 and Jan. 1, 2029. Assuming a 7% annual return, the account could grow to approximately $170,000 by the time the child reaches 18. Lower interest rates could also have a ripple effect on the entire economy, influencing consumer spending, business investments, and the housing market. According to Aaron Razon, personal finance expert at Couponsnake, 'if borrowing costs decreased even by 1%, households might save thousands of dollars annually in loan and mortgage payments.'

**Trump Unveils '$1,000 Savings Account' For Every Baby Born During His Second Term**
US President Donald Trump has proposed a new federal program, 'Trump savings accounts', which would provide a $1,000 investment account for every baby born in the US between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. The accounts would be tax-deferred and track the overall stock market performance. Trump said, 'For every US citizen born after December 31, 2024, before January 1, 2029, the federal government will make a one-time contribution of $1,000 into a tax-deferred account that will track the overall stock market.' However, the Congressional Budget Office has warned that the program would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, necessitating cuts to existing federal programs. The proposal is part of a broader bill, which has cleared the House but faces stiff competition in the Senate.

**Child Allowance 2025: How High is it Now?**
The child benefit in Germany for 2025 is 255 euros per month, but parents may find it more beneficial to use the child allowance (Kinderfreibetrag) when filing their taxes. The child allowance is 3336 euros per parent, totaling 6672 euros, and can be used in conjunction with the child benefit. However, this is not possible, and the child allowance is only beneficial for higher-income families. The tax office will automatically calculate whether the child allowance is more beneficial than the child benefit in the tax return. The child allowance is not a separate application, but rather a calculation based on the tax return. Additionally, the allowance for childcare, education, and training (Betreuungs-, Erziehungs- und Ausbildungsbedarf, BEA) is 2928 euros, totaling 9600 euros. According to the Vereinigte Lohnsteuerhilfe (VLH), this is often mistakenly referred to as the child allowance, but it is actually two separate allowances. VLH provides a calculation example, where a couple with a small child and a yearly income of 79,000 euros may find it more beneficial to receive child benefit rather than the child allowance, despite saving 3000 euros in taxes. However, the difference is only 60 euros, and the child benefit is more convenient. The child benefit has been in place for 70 years and has increased significantly since its introduction.

**US Budget Deficit Reaches $316 Billion in May**
The US budget deficit reached $316 billion in May, with a 14% increase in the annual deficit compared to the previous year, according to CNBC. The growing expenses have once again become the main cause of financial problems, with interest on debt exceeding $92 billion at $36.2 trillion. The net interest expenses have surpassed all other payments, except for healthcare and social security expenses. It is expected that the debt financing volume will exceed $1.2 trillion this fiscal year, with a total of $776 billion for the first eight months of the financial year. According to expert estimates, customs duties helped to partially compensate for the deficit. The total customs duties for the month were $23 billion, with a total of $86 billion for the year, a 59% increase compared to the same period in 2024.

**Inflation Eases to Four-Year Low in April; Income and Savings Rate Spike**
According to the BEA's Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index, inflation eased to a four-year low in April, with prices increasing 0.1% from March. The core index, which excludes food and energy categories, also rose 0.1%. Compared to the same month last year, April's price index is up 2.1% and its core index is 2.5% higher. Meanwhile, Americans' disposable personal income (DPI) growth was significantly higher, increasing by 0.8%, the largest growth in four years. CNBC's Rick Santelli noted, 'Eight-tenths 90.8%) is the strongest month over month income jump since May of â¦. 'They're powerful numbers: up 0.6% in January, up 0.7% in February, up half of one percent last month, up 0.8% this month. This is a GREAT four-month start to any year.' The personal saving rate also jumped to 4.9% in April, the highest rate since 5.1% in April of 2024.

**Consumers Boosted Savings and Slowed Spending as Tariffs Loomed | PYMNTS.com**
The personal savings rate increased to 4.9% in April, the highest level in several months, as consumers grew wary of tariffs. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), personal income growth outpaced inflation, rising 0.8% on a monthly basis in April. Disposable income also gained 0.8%. However, personal spending grew by a mere 0.2%, with only spending on services increasing in dollar terms. The 12-month increase of the PCE index stood at 2.1%, its lowest since September 2024. The relief to the family budget may be temporary, as the impact of tariffs has yet to be fully felt. As a result, consumers are pulling back on nonessential, tangible items and allocating their spending elsewhere. The personal savings rate has grown for the fourth consecutive time, indicating a shift in consumer behavior.

**US Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index Rises 2.1% in April**
The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index in the US, a key indicator for the Federal Reserve (Fed) in its interest rate decisions, rose 2.1% year-over-year in April, slightly lower than the 2.3% in March, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This figure is below market expectations of 2.2%. On a monthly basis, prices increased by only 0.1% after remaining constant in March. This report is the first to reflect economic results after the implementation of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. Analysts see this as a sign that while an increase in prices is expected due to these policies, this inflationary impact is not yet reflected in concrete economic data. Excluding food and energy, the underlying PCE price index rose 2.5% compared to the same month last year, a tenth less than in March, in line with analyst expectations. According to the BEA report, consumer spending grew 0.2% intermonthly in April. Energy and service prices rose 0.5% in April compared to the previous month, while food prices decreased by 0.3%, after a 0.5% increase in March. The PCE price index is calculated by taking into account the inflation (or deflation) of a wide range of consumer spending and reflects changes in consumer behavior. This data is crucial for the Fed, which closely monitors it when deciding on monetary policy, along with underlying inflation, unemployment, or Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which, according to revised estimates, contracted 0.2% in the first quarter of the year, the first negative figure since 2022. Interest rates remain at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, although the Fed warned that it expects 'one or two cuts' by the end of the year. The next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to evaluate possible changes in rates will take place on June 17 and 18.

**Annual PCE inflation for April was 2.1%, in line with expectations - UPI.com**
The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the annual PCE inflation for April was 2.1%, in line with expectations. The PCE price index increased 2.1% from the same month one year ago, and 2.5% excluding food and energy. The annual rate was 0.1% lower than expected, but met the Dow Jones consensus forecast for the month. Personal income in the United States was up 0.8% in April, with a $189.4 billion increase in disposable personal income. The BEA also reported a $47.8 billion increase in current-dollar PCE, comprised of a $55.8 billion rise in spending on services partially offset by an $8 billion decrease in spending for goods. Personal savings amounted to $1.12 trillion in April, with a personal saving rate of 4.9%.

**Q1 GDP Revision Reveals Big Deterioration In Personal Spending In "Kitchen Sink" Report**
The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released a revised estimate of Q1 GDP, showing a 0.2% annualized decline, a slight improvement from the initial -0.3% print. However, personal consumption was revised down to 1.2%, the weakest quarter since Q2 2023, from 1.7% in the initial report. Real final sales to private domestic purchasers increased 2.5% in Q1, revised down 0.5% point from the previous estimate. The report paints an 'uglier picture' of the US economy in Q1, but the authors of Zero Hedge expect a rebound in Q2, potentially reaching 3% or higher due to a boost from imports and a surge in personal consumption.

The US economy is showing signs of weakness as Q1 2025 real GDP declined by -0.3%, the first negative quarter since Q1 2022. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the decline is attributed to elevated imports, which had a drag on growth of -5.0 percentage points, and a decline in government spending of 0.3 pp. The Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) has terminated around $32 billion in contracts, $37 billion in grants, and $291 million in leases as of May 3rd, 2025. The BEA's advance estimate of real GDP change for Q1 2025 will undergo two further revisions and a final annual revision as more economic data is collected and incorporated.

**US Family Incomes See Growth in February 2025**
The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the United States has reported that American family incomes have increased by 0.8% in February 2025, exceeding market expectations of a +0.4% growth. This result is also higher than the +0.7% growth seen in the previous month, indicating a positive trend in personal income growth. In contrast, personal spending has shown an increase of 0.4%, which, although positive compared to the -0.3% decline in the previous month, did not meet analysts' expectations of +0.5%. This discrepancy between income and personal spending suggests a more cautious behavior from American consumers. The core PCE price index, a key indicator of inflation, has also grown by 0.4% on a monthly basis, exceeding analysts' expectations of +0.3%, and by 2.8% on an annual basis, also higher than the +2.7% expected. As stated by the BEA, 'the increase in personal income and the decrease in personal spending suggest that consumers are being more cautious in their spending habits.'

**US PCE inflation expected to ease as markets assess next Federal Reserve rate cut in June**
The US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is set to release the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index data for January on Friday. Markets expect the core PCE Price Index to rise 0.3% on a monthly basis, following a 0.2% increase in December. Over the last twelve months, the core PCE inflation is forecast to soften to 2.6% from 2.8%. TD Securities said, 'We look for core PCE prices to register a notably weaker advance in January compared to the CPI equivalent's 0.45% m/m increase.' A print of 0.4% or higher in the monthly core PCE Price Index could support the US Dollar (USD), while a reading below 0.2% could have the opposite effect. However, the market reaction is likely to remain short-lived, with investors seeing a 98% probability of the Fed holding the policy settings unchanged in March and a 20% chance of a 25 bps rate cut in May.

**US GDP grows at 2.3% annual rate in fourth quarter**
According to the report published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 2.3% in the fourth quarter, which spans from October to December last year. Although the recent figure matches the expectations of economists polled by LSEG, it is lower than the 3.1% recorded in the previous quarter, indicating a significant slowdown in the economy. The decline is attributed to the weakening of business investment and a decrease in imports, but was offset by consumer spending, particularly in the last month of the year. Ryan Sweet, chief economist for the US at Oxford Economics, stated, 'The revisions to the fourth-quarter GDP seem calm, but the downward revision in real business equipment spending offers a warning that political uncertainty could be a bigger problem in the first half than we anticipated.' The report highlights that, for the fourth quarter of 2024, business investment decreased by 5.7%, while consumer spending grew by 4.2%, government spending increased by 2.9%, personal income also grew by 2.5%, and personal savings reached 3.8%.
