**Iran Denies Nuclear Ambitions, Calls for Transparency**
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated, 'Iran has a peaceful nuclear program and we are fully convinced of this. We have nothing to hide about this.' Araghchi made the statement before a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director Rafael Grossi. Grossi had previously called on Iran to be 'more transparent' about its nuclear activities. Iran received a proposal from the US for a new agreement on its nuclear program, after five rounds of negotiations mediated by Oman. Araghchi stated, 'If the objective of the negotiations is to ensure that Iran does not intend to acquire nuclear weapons, then a deal seems possible.' However, if 'the objective is to deprive Iran of peaceful activities, then there will certainly be no agreement.' Iran wants guarantees from the US that it will lift sanctions against Tehran. 'Until now, the American side has not clarified this issue,' said Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghai. The US proposal, according to the New York Times, asks Iran to stop all uranium enrichment and proposes the creation of a regional group to produce nuclear energy. Neither Iran nor the US has confirmed the content of the proposal revealed by the newspaper. The West, led by the US, and Israel, a declared enemy of Iran and considered by experts as the only nuclear power in the Middle East, suspect that Tehran intends to acquire nuclear weapons. Iran denies such military ambitions, but insists on its right to nuclear energy for civilian purposes, under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), of which it is a signatory. A recent IAEA report revealed that Iran increased uranium enrichment production to 60%, a level close to the 90% needed to produce nuclear weapons. 'We need more transparency - that is very, very clear - in Iran and nothing will give us that confidence, except complete explanations about a certain number of activities,' said Grossi.

**Iran to Respond 'Soon' to US Nuclear Proposal, Intends to Reject It**
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced that his country will respond to the US proposal on the nuclear agreement 'soon', while a senior Iranian diplomat told Reuters that Iran intends to reject it. Araghchi said that Tehran will not accept any agreement that aims to 'deny Iran's peaceful activities', adding that 'if the goal of the negotiations is to obtain assurances that Iran does not seek nuclear weapons, then I believe it is possible to reach an agreement. But if the goal is to deny Iran's peaceful activities, then there will certainly be no agreement'. The Iranian diplomat described the US proposal as 'unexecutable and does not take into account Iran's interests, nor does it include any change in Washington's stance on uranium enrichment'. Araghchi stated that Iran is ready to accept some restrictions on uranium enrichment but wants 'firm guarantees that Washington will not backtrack on any future nuclear agreement'. Iran has been demanding the lifting of all US-imposed sanctions and the release of its frozen funds. The US, however, wants to lift sanctions related to the nuclear file in phases. The Iranian diplomat said that Iran considers the US proposal as a 'negative response' and that it can be interpreted as a rejection of the US offer. The US has proposed a new nuclear agreement to Iran, which was presented by the Omani Foreign Minister Bader Al-Busaidi during a short visit to Tehran last Saturday. However, many issues remain unresolved after five rounds of talks between Araghchi and US Special Envoy to the Middle East Stephen Wietkof to resolve the nuclear crisis.

**Iran's Nuclear Program: A Point of Contention**
Iran's nuclear program has been a point of contention, with the country insisting on its right to nuclear activities for peaceful purposes. The US has proposed a new agreement, but Iran has expressed reservations, saying that if the goal is to deprive it of its 'peaceful activities', there will be no agreement. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated, 'If the objective of the negotiations is to ensure that Iran is not seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, then a deal seems possible.' However, he added, 'If the goal is to deprive Iran of its peaceful activities, then there will certainly be no agreement.' The US has described the proposal as 'acceptable' and in the 'best interest' of Iran, but the country's nuclear activities have raised concerns among Western powers and Israel. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has called for more transparency from Iran, and the country's nuclear activities have been the subject of a recent report by the agency, which showed that Iran has intensified its production of uranium enriched to 60%, a level close to the 90% needed for nuclear weapons.

**Iran Demands US Guarantees on Sanctions Before Nuclear Talks**
Iran has called on the United States to provide formal guarantees that it will lift sanctions in the ongoing nuclear talks with Iran, according to various media outlets. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Bakhai said, 'We need a formal guarantee that the sanctions will be lifted effectively.' He added, 'So far, the American side has not been willing to clarify this issue.' This comes after a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) showed that Iran has increased its enriched uranium production by up to 60%, which is close to the 90% level required for nuclear weapons. US envoy Stephen Wittkoff said last month that the Trump administration would oppose any enrichment program. He stated, 'There can never be a nuclear enrichment program in Iran again. That's our red line. No enrichment.' Iran has pledged to continue enriching uranium 'with or without an agreement' on its nuclear program. US media reported on Saturday that the US has sent a proposal to Iran on a nuclear agreement, which the White House described as 'acceptable' and 'in its interest.' The New York Times quoted informed diplomats as saying that the proposal calls for Iran to stop all enrichment activities and proposes the establishment of a regional assembly for nuclear energy production. Iran has held five rounds of talks with the US in an effort to reach a new agreement to replace the 2015 nuclear deal, which was withdrawn by Trump during his first term in 2018.

**Khamenei and Netanyahu Face the Real Test: Nuclear Agreement or 'Mother of All Wars'**
According to a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran's nuclear activities in recent months have shown that the country is close to having a nuclear arsenal. This contradicts statements made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who claimed that Israel had won against the Iranian axis. The report shows that at the beginning of the war on Gaza in October 2023, Iran had 128.3 kg of uranium enriched to 60%, which increased by more than three times, and Iran now has 408.6 kg of uranium enriched to 60%. Iran needs a single enrichment level to reach 90% to convert the fissile material into ten nuclear bombs. The head of Haaretz, Aluf Benn, believes that Iran exploited the war on Gaza to develop its nuclear program, and that it started on December 5, 2023, to collect as much enriched uranium as possible, which it then enriched to 60% at a rate seven times faster than before, moving the 'nuclear threshold' to the point of no return. Benn also believes that Iran has the capability and infrastructure to produce nuclear bombs, and that it only needs a few months to produce the necessary materials. Netanyahu's boasts about his victory in the war and the severe blow he dealt to Iran are now in the shadow of the strategic facts presented by Iranian leader Ali Khamenei, who chose to continue the fight and risk launching missiles on Israel, despite the opportunity to stop the war and save the situation. Khamenei's move has led to the collapse of Iran's military capabilities, but this is not a coincidence, as Iran has been focusing on its nuclear power. Now, Khamenei and Netanyahu are facing the real test, which will determine the outcome of the war and the balance of power in the Middle East. According to Benn, Iran believes that Israel is not capable of destroying its nuclear program, either due to a lack of suitable ammunition or due to Trump's opposition, and that a new nuclear agreement is in the works.

**Iran's Nuclear Negotiator to Meet with AIEA Head in Cairo**
Iran's nuclear negotiator, Abbas Araghchi, will meet with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA), Rafael Grossi, in Cairo on Monday, according to the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The meeting comes after the publication of a report by the United Nations agency showing that Iran has increased its production of enriched uranium to 60%, a level close to the 90% needed to make atomic weapons. Araghchi will also meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi during his visit. Iran has warned that it will respond if European countries 'exploit' the AIEA report for political purposes. The report was released as Washington and Tehran are engaged in talks to find a new agreement. Iran has received 'elements' of a US proposal and will respond appropriately, while the White House has said the proposal is 'acceptable' and in the 'best interest' of Tehran. Iran has called for 'guarantees' that sanctions will be lifted before any agreement on the nuclear issue, with the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Esmaïl Baghaï, saying, 'We want guarantees that the sanctions are well lifted. Until now, the American side has not wanted to clarify this question.'

**Iran Rejects UN Report on Nuclear Program, Denies Seeking Nuclear Weapons**
Iran rejected a UN report stating that the country is seeking nuclear weapons. The report claimed that Iran has significantly increased its stockpile of nearly weapons-grade uranium over the past three months, enough to fuel around 10 nuclear bombs. Additionally, it was stated that Tehran has not reported nuclear materials and activities in three undeclared locations. The report concluded that Tehran cannot 'provide guarantees that the nuclear program for peace will have an exclusively peaceful character'. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi rejected the report's findings, stating that it is based on 'fabricated data provided by the Zionist regime'. He also called the conclusions 'unjustified accusations' intended for 'political exploitation against Iran'. Gharibabadi said, 'Iran does not seek to create nuclear weapons and does not possess any undeclared nuclear materials or activities. As long as the country's nuclear activity is under the control of the IAEA, there is no reason for concern.' Following the report, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Aragchi met with IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi on Saturday, urging him to 'reflect reality'. Aragchi also warned that Tehran will 'respond accordingly to any unjust actions by European parties.' The UN Security Council is set to hold a meeting in late June, where the report may serve as the basis for a resolution condemning Iran for violating its nuclear obligations.

**US Proposal on the Table for Iran as Nuclear Talks Loom**
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi confirmed that his Omani counterpart conveyed the details of a US proposal to reach a nuclear agreement between Tehran and Washington during a short visit to Tehran on Saturday. The White House spokesperson Caroline Leavit later said that US Special Envoy Stephen Biegun 'sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian system, and it's in their interest to accept it.' Araghchi stated on the XAN platform that Iran 'will respond to the US proposal in line with national principles, interests, and the rights of the Iranian people.' This comes before a sixth round of expected talks between Washington and Tehran to resolve the decades-long dispute over Iran's nuclear program. The talks' date and location have not been announced yet. Leavit stated in a statement: 'President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never have a nuclear bomb,' confirming that the US proposal has been sent to Iran. Trump said on Friday that an agreement with Iran is possible in the 'near future.' Before that, Trump told reporters that he warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against taking actions that could disrupt nuclear talks with Iran. The comments suggest that the US is concerned about the possibility of Israel launching a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities amid ongoing diplomatic efforts. Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities if diplomacy fails to reach an agreement. One of the main sticking points in the talks between US and Iranian officials is the US insistence that Iran give up its uranium enrichment facilities, which Iran refuses to do. Trump, who reimposed 'maximum pressure' on Iran since February, had withdrawn from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers in 2018 and reimposed severe sanctions on Iran. Since then, Iran has consistently exceeded the limits set by the 2015 agreement on its nuclear program, which aims to increase the difficulties in developing a nuclear bomb, while denying Tehran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon.

**Iran's Araghchi: Nuclear Weapons are 'Unacceptable'**
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that nuclear weapons are 'unacceptable', as Iran continues to negotiate with the United States to reach an agreement on its nuclear program. Araghchi said, 'If the problem is nuclear weapons, yes, we also consider them unacceptable', in reference to the US stance. Iran has been accused by Western countries and Israel of seeking to develop a nuclear bomb, which Tehran denies, maintaining that its nuclear program is peaceful. US President Donald Trump reiterated on Friday that 'they cannot have a nuclear weapon', and that the two countries are 'very close to an agreement'. However, Araghchi wrote on Twitter that he is 'not confident' that an agreement is imminent. The fifth round of talks between Iran and the US, mediated by Oman, ended in Rome on May 23 without significant progress, but Araghchi and US envoy to the Middle East Stephen Biegun expressed a willingness to continue the negotiations, which they described as 'constructive'. No date has been set for the next round of talks. In the event of an agreement with Washington, Iran has stated that it may allow US inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit its nuclear facilities. Iranian nuclear organization head Mohammad Eslami said, 'If issues are raised and an agreement is reached, and Iran's demands are taken into account, we will reconsider the possibility of accepting US inspectors' from the International Atomic Energy Agency.

**Iran Proposes Nuclear Consortium as Alternative to Dismantling Program**
Iran has proposed an alternative to dismantling its nuclear program, suggesting the creation of a nuclear consortium with the participation of three Arab countries and the involvement of American investments. According to The New York Times, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Arakchi made this proposal to US special envoy Steve Witkoff on May 11. The plan involves enriching uranium to 3.67% and then sending it to other Arab countries for civilian use. The main difference from the 2015 nuclear agreement is the presence of observers from other countries, including the US, on Iranian sites. The deal would be permanent, unlike the previous agreement, which was set to expire in 2030. Iran has exceeded the agreed limits on uranium enrichment 18 times in 2023, according to the IAEA. 'It's a great achievement and a source of pride for the Iranian nation,' Arakchi said, commenting on the proposal. 'We will not give up on this achievement, which was achieved at the cost of the blood of Iranian nuclear scientists who died in the process.'

**Iran and the Nuclear Bomb: 2025, the Year of Diplomacy... or War?**
The West, led by the US, has long suspected Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons. An international agreement was reached on July 14, 2015, to limit Iran's nuclear program. However, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran currently possesses 275 kg of uranium enriched to 60%, exceeding the 2015 agreement's limit by more than 41 times. 'The Iranian nuclear program has never been as advanced,' warns Naysan Rafati, a specialist on Iranian nuclear issues at the International Crisis Group. Experts believe Iran may be just weeks away from having a nuclear bomb. This scenario is concerning, as Iran could use the bomb as a deterrent or to attack its enemies, including Israel. According to Frédéric Encel, a professor of geopolitics, it could also prompt neighboring countries, such as Saudi Arabia or Turkey, to develop their own nuclear capabilities. To prevent this scenario, new negotiations are underway. Will it be an agreement or war? Our new video analysis explores the two possibilities.

**Trump Threatens Iran, Khamenei Accuses Him of Lying**
US President Donald Trump has stated that 'leaders in the Middle East who I have met are great and love their countries' during his Gulf tour. He also expressed his belief that Iran wants to reach a nuclear agreement, while Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei accused him of 'lying' when he says he wants peace in the region. Trump said that Saudi Arabia will become 50% dependent on non-oil revenues in the coming years, which is already a reality according to the 'Vision 2030' report. He described the Middle East as 'great', but former President Joe Biden 'did not handle it well'. Trump stated that Iran wants to reach an agreement with the US on its nuclear program, preferring not to resort to military action. He reiterated that Iran will not be able to obtain a nuclear weapon and that any agreement will be beneficial to it. Trump also stated that Iran has a proposal and that they know they need to act quickly or face the consequences. In contrast, Khamenei said that Trump's statements 'do not deserve a response... they are an embarrassment to the speaker and the American people'. He accused Trump of 'lying' when he says he wants peace in the region and said that the US should 'leave the region, and it will leave'. Khamenei also described Israel as a 'cancerous tumor that is deadly to the region' and said that it should be 'eradicated from its roots'. President Masoud Beshkiyan stated that Trump is talking about peace and threat in the same breath, asking 'which one do we believe?' Beshkiyan also stated that Iran will continue to negotiate on the nuclear issue, but will not be intimidated by threats, saying 'we do not seek war'. He emphasized that Iran will not retreat from its legitimate rights and will not be intimidated by US pressure. Iraqji, the Foreign Minister, stated that Iran has not received any proposal from the US and that it will not give up its right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. He also warned that changing Washington's stance will prolong the nuclear talks.

**Iranian Parliament Speaker: Iran is Not a Pro-War Nation, But Will Not Surrender**
Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf stated that Iran is not a pro-war nation, but they will not surrender either. Qalibaf said, 'Iran is not a pro-war nation, but we are not those who surrender either.' This comes after US President Donald Trump criticized Iran, saying 'enemies motivate you,' and announcing that Tehran 'will never possess a nuclear weapon.' Trump stated at the American-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh, 'I love my permanent enemies, but sometimes you need enemies to complete the mission, and you have to do it the right way. Enemies motivate you.' Trump also expressed his desire to 'make a deal with Iran,' but warned that 'if the Iranian leadership refuses this olive branch and continues to attack its neighbors, we will have no choice but to exert maximum pressure, and drive Iran's oil exports to zero, as we have done before.' Trump emphasized that the US will take 'all necessary measures to prevent the regime from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Iran will never possess a nuclear weapon.' He concluded by saying, 'But Iran can have a brighter future, but we will never allow America and its allies to be threatened by an Iranian terrorist attack or nuclear strike. The choice is theirs. We really want them to be a successful nation. We want them to be a great, safe, and wonderful nation, but they cannot possess a nuclear weapon. This offer will not last forever. Now is the time for them to choose, now. We don't have much time to wait.'

**Iran's Nuclear Proposal Sparks Concerns in US**
The US and Iran are set to hold their second round of nuclear talks in Rome on Saturday. Before the talks, Iran proposed a 'three-stage nuclear agreement' that would limit uranium enrichment, but refuse to dismantle advanced centrifuges and nuclear facilities. US think tanks have warned that if Iran retains its current facilities, it could produce enough weapons-grade uranium in as little as 25 days, posing a significant threat to global security. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that Iran is willing to reach an agreement with the US, but only if the US is 'practical'. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that Iran's current nuclear capabilities are 'closer to nuclear weapons than ever before'. He also reiterated that the Trump administration will not accept any short-term agreement with 'sunset clauses' and stated, 'Iran cannot have nuclear weapons - now, nor in the future.'

**Saudi Arabia, US on 'pathway' to civil nuclear agreement, US Energy Secretary says**
U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced that the United States and Saudi Arabia are on a 'pathway' to signing a preliminary agreement to cooperate on Saudi Arabia's civil nuclear industry. Wright stated that a 123 agreement, required for U.S. involvement in nuclear development, will be necessary, but did not mention Saudi Arabia's agreement to the non-proliferation criteria. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has previously stated that if Iran develops a nuclear weapon, Saudi Arabia would follow suit, raising concerns among arms control advocates and U.S. lawmakers. Wright's comments come as Saudi Arabia seeks to generate renewable energy and reduce emissions under its Vision 2030 reform plan.

**Saudi Arabia, US on 'pathway' to civil nuclear agreement, US Energy...**
The United States and Saudi Arabia are on a 'pathway' to signing a preliminary agreement to cooperate on the kingdom's civil nuclear industry, according to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright. Wright stated that a 123 agreement, required to permit U.S. involvement in the Saudi civil nuclear program, will be necessary. However, Saudi authorities have not agreed to the non-proliferation criteria specified in the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which includes nine requirements to prevent the development of nuclear arms or transfer of sensitive materials. Wright noted that there are 'lots of ways to structure a deal' that will meet both Saudi and American objectives. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has previously stated that if Iran develops a nuclear weapon, Saudi Arabia would follow suit, raising concerns among arms control advocates and U.S. lawmakers. The agreement is part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 reform plan, which aims to generate substantial renewable energy and reduce emissions, with some of this expected to come from nuclear energy.

**IAEA: Iran Almost Has Nuclear Weapon**
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned that Iran has accelerated its production of near-weapons-grade uranium, with 274.8 kilograms (605.8 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60 percent as of February 8. This is a significant increase of 92.5 kilograms (203.9 pounds) since the IAEA's last report in November. According to experts, this material is a short technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90 percent. The IAEA expressed concern, stating, 'The significantly increased production and accumulation of highly enriched uranium by Iran, the only non-nuclear weapon state to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern.' The agency warned that time is running out for diplomacy to impose new restrictions on Iran's activities before the country has a nuclear weapon.

**Study Predicts Third World War and Increased Nuclear Tensions**
A recent study by the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security has revealed alarming data. Over 350 people were asked about possible scenarios for the next few years, including wars, nuclear tensions, and climate change policies. According to the study, more than 40% of respondents believe that a Third World War will occur by 2035, and over 48% expect nuclear weapons to be used by at least one of the world's major powers. The study also found that 45% of respondents expect a direct military conflict to take place in space, and 69% anticipate a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO. Additionally, 88% of respondents expect at least one new country to acquire nuclear weapons in the next decade, and over a third expect Israel to engage in a direct war with Iran before 2035. The study also suggests that North Korea and Russia are the countries most likely to launch a nuclear attack, with 48% of respondents expecting them to do so in the next decade.
