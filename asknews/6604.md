**Market Analysts Reduce Inflation Expectation for 2025, but Only Meet Target in 2026**
Market analysts have reduced their inflation expectation for this year to 5.46%, according to the Focus Report from the Central Bank, published on Monday. This is lower than the 5.53% forecast a month ago. However, inflation for the year is still above the target of 4.5%, which is expected to be reached only in 2026. The Central Bank's directors consider the inflation expectation when setting interest rates, making it more restrictive to reach the target of 3%. The Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) will meet on June 17 and 18 to discuss whether to maintain the Selic rate at 14.75% or make a new adjustment. Analysts believe that there will be no new increase in interest rates, keeping them at this level until the end of the year. It is expected that cuts will begin to be made only next year. On the other hand, market analysts predict a tighter advance of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which signals economic growth. The average projection in the Focus report was slightly reduced to 2.13%, compared to 2.14% forecast last week, but above the 2% estimated a month ago. For the next years, a GDP growth of 1.8% is expected in 2026 and 2% in 2027 and 2028. The average exchange rate of the dollar is expected to remain at R$ 5.80 this year and in 2027 and 2028, with an increase to R$ 5.90 only in 2026.

**Central Bank Analysts Reduce Inflation Projection for 2025**
Analysts consulted by the Central Bank have reduced their projection for Brazil's inflation in 2025, while maintaining the expectation for price growth in 2026, according to the Focus survey released on Monday. The survey showed that the expectation for inflation, measured by IPCA, is now 5.46% at the end of this year, above the previous forecast of 5.50%. For 2026, the projection for price growth was maintained at 4.50%. The Central Bank's target is 3%, with a 1.5 percentage point margin for tolerance. The change comes after the release of data for the IPCA-15 of May, which decelerated and was below expectations, leading to some relief in the 12-month result. The index rose 0.36% in May, after increasing 0.43% in the previous month, and 5.40% in 12 months, compared to a gain of 5.49% in April. The weekly survey with a hundred economists also showed the expectation that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow 1.80% next year, above the growth projection of 1.70% in the previous week. For 2025, the expectation for economic expansion fell slightly to 2.13%, from a gain of 2.14% previously. On monetary policy, there was maintenance of the expectation for the basic interest rate this year and next. The median of the projections for the Selic at the end of 2025 is 14.75%, while for the end of 2026, the expectation is that the rate will reach 12.50%, which was the 18th consecutive week of maintenance of this level. Currently, the Selic is at 14.75% per year. The survey also maintained the expectations for the price of the dollar at the end of 2025, at R$5.80, and 2026, at R$5.90. The US dollar has accumulated a 6.8% drop against the real this year, in a movement driven by a price correction process, after its surge at the end of last year, and greater uncertainty regarding US tariff plans.

The median projection for the exchange rate in 2026 was R$ 5.90, while the projection for 2027 remained at R$ 5.80. For 2028, the projection fell from R$ 5.82 to R$ 5.80. The GDP projection for 2026 rose from 1.70% to 1.80%. The projection remained at 2.00% in 2027. For 2028, the projection continued at 2% for 64 weeks. The projection for 2026 was 12.50%, while for 2027 it remained at 10.50%. For 2028, the estimate remained at 10% for 23 weeks. 'The revision of inflation projections is a sign of the economy's resilience,' said the Central Bank. 'However, we must remain vigilant and continue to monitor the situation closely.'

**May Inflation Rate to be Announced Tomorrow: What are the Economists' Expectations?**
The inflation rate for May will be announced tomorrow. According to a survey of 23 economists, the expected inflation rate for May is between 1.80% and 2.75%, with an average of 2.10%. This suggests that the annual inflation rate, which was 37.86% in the previous month, will decrease to 36.17%. Additionally, the economists' forecast for the end-of-year inflation rate for 2025, based on May's data, is 31.17%. The consumer price index (TÜFE) increased by 3% in April, while the producer price index (YİP) increased by 2.76%. The annual inflation rate, which was 37.86% in TÜFE and 22.5% in YİP, is the lowest rate since December 2021. As economist, 'the eyes are on the new data that will be announced tomorrow.'

**Fed's Christopher Waller Signals Caution On Rate Cut Amid Tariff-Driven Inflation Risks - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM)**
Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller warned that tariff-induced inflation could temporarily push prices higher, but signaled potential rate cuts later in 2025 if trade policy clarity and economic stability are achieved. Waller outlined two tariff scenarios that could drive inflation to peaks between 3-5% this year, with his base case assuming a 15% trade-weighted tariff on U.S. goods imports. He dismissed concerns about inflation persistence, citing key differences from the 2021-2022 period. Waller concluded that assuming tariff rates settle near his lower scenario and underlying inflation progresses toward the Fed's 2% target, he would support 'good news' rate cuts later this year.

**US Inflation Rate Approaches Fed Target, Despite Tariffs**
The inflation rate in the United States approached the Federal Reserve's target of 2% in April, according to the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index. However, experts predict a rise in prices due to the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The PCE Index increased by 2.1% annually in April, down from 2.3% in March. The inflation rate has moderated due to a decline in energy prices. The core inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also moderated to 2.5% annually. 'President Trump is defeating the inflation crisis of his predecessor Joe Biden and making the United States affordable again!' said Karoline Leavitt, White House spokesperson. Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve chairman, and the rest of the monetary policy committee 'deserve applause for achieving this smooth landing,' said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. 'Unfortunately, due to factors beyond their control, we will see an acceleration of inflation,' he added. The PCE Index rebounded to a positive monthly rate (0.1% compared to March) due to a rise in durable goods prices (0.5%). Consumer spending in the United States slowed down in April, as consumers delayed purchases to avoid price increases due to Trump's tariffs. Consumer spending, which accounts for over two-thirds of the US economy, increased by 0.2% in April, after a revised 0.7% increase in March, according to the Commerce Department's Economic Analysis Bureau. Economists consulted by Reuters had expected a similar increase.

**Fed Member Waller: Economy Meets Three Conditions, Rate Cut Possible This Year**
Federal Reserve (Fed) member Christopher Waller stated at the Bank of Korea's International Conference on Monday (June 2) that, despite the potential short-term increase in domestic prices due to the US government's tariffs, he believes there is still a possibility of a rate cut this year if the economy meets three conditions. Waller stated that, given the temporary nature of the inflationary pressure caused by the US's increased import tariffs, he supports ignoring temporary factors when making monetary policy decisions and not considering the recent inflationary impact. Waller said, 'If the tariff rate remains stable at the low end of my expected range, the core inflation rate continues to move towards our 2% target, and the labor market remains solid, I will support the Fed to release the 'good news' of a rate cut later this year.' 'Fortunately, as of April, the US labor market remains strong and inflation has eased, giving me more time to observe the progress of trade talks and economic development before deciding whether the Fed needs to adjust its monetary policy.' Waller's views on the economy and monetary policy are generally consistent with his previous comments. Waller reviewed the two trade policy scenarios he previously proposed: one with a high tariff rate of around 25% and another with a low tariff rate of around 10%, which would be gradually reduced through negotiations with other countries. In both scenarios, Waller expects the tariff's impact on inflation to be temporary, and he also expects the tariff to lead to an increase in unemployment, which 'may persist for a while.' However, he noted that under the lower tariff scheme, the scale of layoffs may be 'relatively limited.' Based on the current progress of trade talks, Waller estimates that the average trade-weighted tariff rate is around 15%, between the two scenarios he proposed. However, Waller also pointed out that there are many uncertain factors in future tariff policies. Waller said, 'I currently believe that economic activity and employment may be negatively affected in the second half of 2025, and inflation may worsen. However, the development of these risks is largely dependent on how trade policies will evolve in the future.'

**Fed Director Sees Inflation from Trump's Tariffs with More Intensity in Second Half of 2025**
Federal Reserve Director Christopher Waller stated that he expects the inflation caused by tariffs to be felt more intensely in the second half of 2025. Waller pointed out that the expectation is that tariffs will result in a temporary increase in prices, with a risk of a decline in the economy and the labor market, with unemployment likely to persist. He estimated a 'tariff-weighted average' of 15% on US imports, which falls between his scenarios of higher and lower rates. Waller also defended further interest rate cuts this year, provided that tariffs remain low, inflation continues to move towards the 2% target, and the labor market remains solid. He expressed skepticism that a 10% tariff would increase inflation to 3%.

**Weekly Market Outlook / Bizim Menkul – (2-6 June 2025)**
This week, global markets were influenced by various economic data releases, including growth and unemployment rates in Turkey, inflation in Germany, and growth data in the US. Additionally, developments related to US President Trump's tariffs were a major focus. In Germany, the consumer price index rose by 0.1% in May, while the annual inflation rate remained at 2.1% in May, down from 2.1% in April. The US economy contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, down from a previously forecasted 0.3% contraction. US President Donald Trump announced on May 23 that he would impose a 50% tariff on the European Union starting from June 1, but later postponed the decision to July 9, 2025. The US International Trade Commission ruled that Trump's tariffs on other countries exceeded his authority, effectively blocking their implementation. The Turkish economy grew by 1% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous quarter, and by 2% compared to the same quarter last year. The unemployment rate in Turkey rose to 8.6% in May, up from 7.9% in April, while the youth unemployment rate rose to 15.7% in May. The BIST100 index fell by 3.6% to 9,019.57, while the dollar/TL exchange rate rose to 39.25 and the euro/TL exchange rate rose to 45.00. Foreign investors bought $13.2 million worth of stocks, $148.4 million worth of government bonds, and $191.6 million worth of corporate bonds in the 16-23 May period. Domestic investors increased their dollar deposits by $1.947 million to $118.701 million, while corporate investors decreased their dollar deposits by $468 million to $74.386 million. The central bank's 5-year dollar-denominated CDS rate rose above 300. The central bank cut the policy rate by 250 basis points to 42.50 in its first two meetings of 2025. According to the central bank's market participant survey, the annual inflation rate is expected to rise to 2.36% in May, 1.77% in June, 30.35% at the end of 2025, and 20.55% at the end of 2026. The dollar/TL exchange rate is expected to rise to 43.70 at the end of 2025 and 46.62 in 12 months. The current account deficit is expected to be $19.2 billion at the end of 2025 and $24.4 billion in 2026. The GDP growth rate is expected to be 2.9% in 2025 and 3.7% in 2026. The central bank's weekly repo rate is expected to be 46.00 at the end of the current month, 42.96 in 3 months, and 30.08 in 12 months.

**IGP-10, Consumer Sentiment in the US, and Merger between Marfrig and BRF: What's Moving the Market**
The markets are operating on Friday, May 16, with a focus on the release of indicators in Brazil and the United States. In Brazil, the agenda starts at 8am with the release of the IGP-10 and the IPC-S preliminary data for May, both calculated by the FGV. At 10am, the Ministry of Finance will present the Prisma Fiscal bulletin, with updated projections for the main fiscal indicators. Meanwhile, investors are closely following possible signs of the government's next steps to contain the decline in popularity. In the US, the highlight is the release of the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which is expected to rise to 53.4, with a truce in the trade war. The same report will bring inflation expectations, which surged to 6.50% in two years and 4.40% in five years in response to the Trump administration's tariff increase. These readings come after a Thursday marked by signs of deceleration in the US economy, with the PPI index and retail sales below projections reinforcing bets that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates twice by the end of the year. At 2pm, Baker Hughes will release the number of oil wells and platforms in operation in the country. Later, two Fed officials will make speeches that may calibrate market expectations: Tom Barkin will speak at 7pm and Mary Daly at 10:40pm. The eurozone's trade surplus reached 27.9 billion euros in March, the highest in over two decades. In the US, futures indices are advancing after four consecutive days of gains on Wall Street, driven by inflation data below expectations and the trade truce between the US and China. Before the market opens, Dow Jones futures are up 0.3%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures are up 0.2%.

**US Futures Fall Back After Strong Rally, Inflation Data Due Today**
US futures fell back after a strong rally, with a decline of 0.24% in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 0.35% and 0.44% in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, respectively. Today, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April will be released, with expected inflation rate of 2.4% year-over-year and core inflation of 2.8% excluding energy and food prices. According to Thomas Altmann, CFA at QC Partners, 'the highlight of today's trading day is the US inflation rate for April', with expectations of a 0.3% increase in prices, keeping the year-over-year rate at 2.4%. Altmann notes that the Fed will closely watch the numbers, but the inflation outlook is more important, which may have improved significantly due to the recent 90-day tariff deal between the US and China.'

**100 Days that Could Decide the Fate of Wall Street (and the Global Economy)**
The US economy is slowing down, with consumption and investment in a pause, and car sales reaching their peak before the tariffs were implemented due to fear that the next 100 days will define more than just a trend, the beginning of a global recession. The US has registered a 0.3% contraction in GDP in the first quarter, the first decline in three years, and has been enough to unsettle analysts and investors. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has two options, both bad, at its next meeting on May 7: to lower interest rates, risking its credibility with high inflation, or to keep them steady, risking further slowing the economy. Meanwhile, President Trump is launching fiscal promises that are pure dynamite. The plan, valued at up to $5.3 trillion, aims to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security, but could lead to a public debt of $60 trillion in 2055, more than 230% of the US GDP. Goldman Sachs warns that 'the market will not touch bottom until the economy does first.' According to its strategist Vickie Chang, the S&P could not stabilize before the third quarter. And that's in the best-case scenario.

**US economic growth to slow in the next 30 years, fueled by debt and declining birth rates, CBO says**
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released a report stating that US economic growth will slow over the next 30 years due to weak population gains and increased government spending. The report projects publicly held debt to reach 156% of GDP by 2055, down from a previous projection of 166% of GDP by 2054. However, this is not a positive development, as the CBO also warns that the US population would begin to shrink in 2033 without immigration. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has advocated for a '3-3-3' plan to address the debt and economic growth issues, but has also criticized CBO scoring as 'crazy.' The CBO's warnings about population growth cut into Trump administration policy priorities related to mass deportations, which officials claim are fueling high inflation and depriving U.S. citizens of job opportunities.

**Some economists think U.S. inflation is likely to rise in 2025**
Wall Street analysts at Morgan Stanley Research expect U.S. inflation to rise 2.5% in 2025, up from their previous forecast of 2.3%. This is largely due to the Trump administration's tariffs on key U.S. trading partners and ongoing crackdown on immigration. The analysts also project that core PCE inflation, or price increases excluding food and energy costs, could rise to 3% this year. Tighter immigration restrictions can contribute to inflation by reducing the nation's supply of labor, according to economists. As one Morgan Stanley analyst noted, 'One factor that we think limits services disinflation is reduced immigration, which could lead to labor shortages in many face-to-face service sectors (retail, restaurants, leisure, hospitals) that could result in supply-side driven inflation.'

**Grid equipment manufacturers anticipate 2% annual US load growth through 2050**
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) expects a 2% annual growth in electricity demand in the US through 2050, driven by data centers and building electrification. According to NEMA CEO Debra Phillips, data centers will be the key driver of this growth, with a 300% increase in electricity demand expected over the next decade. Phillips emphasized the need for policy solutions to address this growth, citing the Inflation Reduction Act as a positive force in bringing manufacturing back to the US. However, with the US House passing a budget resolution including $1.5 trillion in spending cuts and $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, there are concerns that clean energy provisions in the IRA may be targeted for cuts. Sen. Tina Smith noted that the IRA's clean energy provisions are roughly a trillion dollars over 10 years, and warned that Republicans will 'come looking' to pay for their tax breaks. Rep. Bob Latta, R-Ohio, suggested that energy may not make up as much of the cuts as some people think, citing the Biden administration's efforts to push out money for energy projects last year.

**Global Markets in Turmoil: Inflation and Fed's Influence**
Recent inflation data in the US, showing a rapid increase in price growth, suggests that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will be cautious in reducing interest rates. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.5% monthly and 3% annually in January, the fastest inflation increase since 2023. Analysts believe that the inflation data exceeding expectations will increase concerns that President Donald Trump's policies may hinder the Fed's efforts to combat inflation. Today's release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) data will be crucial in determining the future direction of the markets. Fed Chairman Powell stated that they are close to their inflation target but still have not reached it, and will make decisions based on economic data. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee described the recent inflation data as 'a serious warning', while Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic predicted that inflation will reach 2% by early 2026. The current market situation is as follows: S&P 500 fell by 0.27%, Dow Jones fell by 0.50%, and Nasdaq remained stable. The Dollar Index fell by 0.3% to 107.6, while gold prices rose by 0.7% to $2,922 per ounce. Brent oil prices fell by 0.8% to $74.3 per barrel. European markets saw the DAX 40 rise by 0.50%, FTSE 100 by 0.34%, and CAC 40 by 0.17%, but FTSE MIB 30 fell by 0.14% in Italy. Asian markets saw the Nikkei 225 rise by 1.4%, Kospi by 1.1%, Shanghai Composite Index by 0.2%, and Hang Seng by 2.3% in Hong Kong. Following a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, an agreement was reached to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. In Turkey, the BIST 100 index fell by 1.04% to 9,779 points, and investors will closely follow the January trade balance data today. According to the AA Finance Trade Balance Expectations Survey, economists predict a trade deficit of $3.665 billion in December. The dollar/TL exchange rate rose by 0.1% to 36.1220. From a technical perspective, the BIST 100 index is seen as supported by 9,700 and 9,650 levels, and resisted by 9,800 and 9,900 levels.

**US Inflation Unexpectedly Rises to 3% in January**
The inflation rate in the United States unexpectedly rose to 3% in January, strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to proceed slowly with interest rate cuts and affecting government bonds and stock prices. The data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday exceeded the expectations of economists surveyed by Reuters, who predicted that inflation would remain at 2.9% in December. The monthly increase for January also exceeded expectations, with a 0.5% increase compared to a 0.3% forecast. Government bonds and stock futures plummeted sharply after the data was released. According to the article, the yield on two-year Treasury bonds, which closely follows interest rate expectations, increased by 0.09 percentage points to 4.37%. Stock futures contracts tracking the S&P 500 index fell 1%, while those tracking the Nasdaq 100 index fell 1.1%. The data comes a week after the US central bank defied President Donald Trump's calls for drastic cuts in debt costs and instead kept its main rate between 4.25% and 4.5%. Fed Chairman Jay Powell stated on Tuesday that he would continue 'doing our job and staying out of politics'.

**US STOCKS-Futures muted in run-up to latest inflation test**
US stock index futures were muted on Wednesday ahead of the release of the January consumer price index (CPI) data, which could influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate path this year. The CPI data is expected to show a 0.3% month-on-month increase in headline inflation and a 2.9% annual rate. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to testify before Congress shortly after the data is released. Analyst Lukman Otunuga warned of a 'perfect storm' for market volatility due to the combination of fresh tariffs, Powell's testimony, and key inflation data.

**BIST 100 Index Closes the Day with a Gain, TCMB Governor Expects Inflation to Reach 24% by 2025**
The BIST 100 index closed the day with a gain of 109.50 points, while the total trading volume reached 103 billion lira. The banking index lost 0.90% in value, while the holding index gained 1.73%. The sector indices showed the financial leasing and factoring sector gaining 3.57% and the communication sector losing 0.93%. The global markets are experiencing a mixed trend due to the limited decrease in concerns over the US's additional tariffs. In a separate development, the Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB), Fatih Karahan, announced at a briefing meeting held at the TCMB Headquarters in Istanbul Financial Center that they expect inflation to reach 24% by the end of 2025. Karahan stated, 'We have maintained our inflation forecast of 12% for the end of 2026. We aim to achieve stability at 5% in the medium term after inflation falls to 8% in 2027.' He also said, '(We are not making any sudden moves, we are going from meeting to meeting, data-driven, we are evaluating our area, but it is very important to be cautious.)' Meanwhile, in the US, non-agricultural employment increased by 143,000 in January, below expectations, while the unemployment rate fell to 4% from 4.1%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% monthly and 4.1% annually, above expectations. Analysts noted that despite non-agricultural employment being below expectations, the decrease in unemployment rate and the increase in average hourly earnings above expectations suggest that the Federal Reserve may not accelerate its interest rate cuts. Analysts pointed out that this week, the focus will be on the country's payments balance, the TCMB market participants' survey, and labor force statistics, while abroad, the attention will be on the statements of the US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, US inflation, retail sales, industrial production, and growth in the Eurozone and the UK, among other data.
