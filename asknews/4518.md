**Bringing Big AI Models to Small Devices | HackerNoon**
Researchers have been working to make Large Language Models (LLMs) more accessible on consumer devices by reducing their computational demand through a process called quantization. In a recent study, the feasibility of running code LLMs with 7 billion parameters on consumer devices was evaluated. The results showed that code LLMs quantized at 4-bit integer precision can be comfortably run on an average CPU-only consumer laptop while maintaining good performance relative to other quantized and non-quantized code LLMs. However, the study also revealed that the exact effects of quantization are not homogeneous among the five tested models, and a more in-depth study is necessary to explore how factors such as model architecture, pre-trained dataset, training procedure, and fine-tuning interact with quantization. Furthermore, the study highlighted the need for enabling consumers to not only quantize but also fine-tune models for specific tasks, and the democratization of training data, which also needs to be addressed in future work. 'The democratization of LLMs also involves the democratization of training data, which also needs to be addressed in future work.' said the researchers.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment,' the report reads. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer.'

**IIT-Bombay leads push for India-centric AI**
The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay has released 16 new datasets on AIKosh, a central government platform, to develop AI that understands India's linguistic and cultural landscape. These datasets will support innovation and research in AI and machine learning, especially in areas involving Indian languages, scripts, documents, media, and audiovisual content. IIT Bombay's effort is part of BharatGen, a multilingual large language model initiative led by IIT Bombay and funded by the Department of Science and Technology. The initiative has contributed 16 India-centric datasets and launched 21 AI models on AIKosh. Professor Ganesh Ramakrishnan, lead of BharatGen, said, 'Pre-training is an enormous undertaking and often a barrier for many. That's why we've taken on this challenge.' The team has also launched 'Param 1', a bilingual foundational language model with 2.9 billion parameters, which supports both English and Hindi and has been trained on 36% Indic language data. 'We hope our efforts toward creating a sovereign Generative AI ecosystem and milestones such as the release of such LLM model checkpoints, serves as a foundation for India-specific solutions,' said professor Ramakrishnan. Alongside Param 1, BharatGen has launched over 20 speech models across 19 Indian languages, including speaker adaptive text-to-speech systems and automatic speech recognition systems.

**ðŸ§  What Are Million and Billion Parameters in LLMs? (And Why You Should Care)**
Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are effective due to their vast number of parameters, ranging from millions to hundreds of billions. These parameters, or weights in a neural network, help the model decide what to focus on when making predictions or generating text. The model learns by adjusting these weights based on patterns in the training data, allowing it to capture nuances like implications, jokes, and miscommunications. According to the article, 'We don't just say things -- we imply, joke, hint, exaggerate, and occasionally miscommunicate beautifully.' This complexity requires a model with significant capacity, which is achieved through the large number of parameters.

**Machine Learning and Deep Learning: What's Behind the Algorithms?**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative innovations of our era. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global AI market was valued at over $292 billion in 2024, and growth is expected to continue at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of nearly 36% between 2025 and 2030. Machine Learning and Deep Learning are two fundamental sub-areas of AI that help explain how this revolution is happening. Machine Learning develops algorithms that can learn from data, identifying patterns, making predictions, and taking decisions based on the information received. This learning can occur in two main ways: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised learning is used in tasks such as classification, regression, and prediction, while unsupervised learning is ideal for grouping data and discovering hidden relationships without predefined labels. Deep Learning is a more advanced version of Machine Learning, based on artificial neural networks, which are inspired by the human brain's functioning. This technology is especially effective in complex tasks such as natural language processing, image and voice recognition, and sophisticated recommendation systems. The main method of learning in Deep Learning is reinforcement, where the system adjusts its behavior based on attempts, errors, and rewards. Examples of popular models include ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and DeepSeek, which are part of the category of Deep Learning models trained with billions of parameters and data. In medicine, advances are equally significant, with more precise image diagnostics and algorithms that help identify patterns in large volumes of clinical data.

**Large language models: The foundations of generative AI**
Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in recent years, with the global market expected to reach $140.8 billion by 2033 at a CAGR of 40.7%. LLMs are useful for various tasks, including text generation, code generation, text summarization, and language translation. However, they also have drawbacks, such as generated text being mediocre or even incorrect, and the potential for 'hallucinations' where the model invents facts. The quality of the training data, model architecture, and training process are crucial factors in determining the performance of LLMs. The number of parameters in an LLM is also important, but it's just one factor that contributes to its overall performance. The most popular LLMs in use today include ELMo, BERT, Gemini, T5, and the GPT family, which includes GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. These models have been trained on vast amounts of text data and have been fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, they also have limitations, such as the potential for 'hallucinations' and the need for large amounts of computational resources. The future of LLMs is expected to be shaped by advancements in areas such as multimodal understanding, handling longer contexts, and reducing hallucinations.
