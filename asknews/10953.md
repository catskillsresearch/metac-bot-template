**Jeff Bezos Finalizes Prenuptial Agreement Before Marriage to Lauren Sánchez**
Jeff Bezos is finalizing his prenuptial agreement before marrying Lauren Sánchez. The agreement aims to protect his $203 billion euro fortune, which he accumulated through Amazon. Bezos' previous marriage to MacKenzie Scott, the mother of his four children, ended with Scott receiving a 4% stake in Amazon, making her one of the wealthiest women in the world. Prenuptial agreements are common among the wealthy and famous, and often include clauses addressing infidelity, frequency of marital sex, and other aspects of the relationship. For example, Jennifer López and Ben Affleck's prenuptial agreement included a clause requiring them to have more than four sexual encounters per week. Other notable examples include Mark Zuckerberg and Priscila Chan's agreement to dedicate 100 minutes per week to solo activities, and Justin Timberlake's agreement to pay $5 million to Jessica Biel in case of infidelity. 'The goal is to avoid having to give up part of our fortune in case of a divorce, like what happened in my previous marriage,' Bezos said, according to sources.

**Musk and Bezos Bet on Robots: Experts Criticize Trump's Focus on Manufacturing Jobs**
The US manufacturing industry is facing significant challenges, including a labor shortage, an aging workforce, and a negative industry perception. Despite President Donald Trump's plans to revive the industry through tariffs, experts argue that this approach is overly simplistic and will not address the underlying issues. As 'Business Insider' reports, Trump's plans are hindered by outdated notions, high labor costs, and his own tech allies, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, who are investing in robotics and automation. 'Trump's fixation on jobs in the manufacturing industry is misguided,' experts say.

**Elon Musk's Ambitious Plan to Colonize Mars**
Elon Musk's SpaceX has been working towards establishing a human settlement on Mars, with the goal of making humanity a multi-planetary species. Musk has stated that he believes it is essential for the survival of humanity, and that Mars can serve as a backup plan in case of a global catastrophe on Earth. However, experts have raised concerns about the feasibility of establishing a human settlement on Mars, citing the planet's harsh environment, lack of water, and extreme temperatures. Musk's plan involves using his Starship spacecraft to transport people and cargo to Mars, with the goal of establishing a permanent human presence on the planet by 2028. However, many have questioned the practicality of this plan, and whether it is worth the estimated billions of dollars that Musk is investing in it. Other billionaires, such as Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, are also working on space-related projects, with Bezos' Blue Origin aiming to establish a human settlement on the moon. Musk's motivations for pursuing this goal are unclear, but some have speculated that it is a way for him to gain attention and build his brand, rather than a genuine scientific or humanitarian pursuit.

**Billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's complex prenup affecting 'foundation' of their marriage**
Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez are set to get married soon, with a prenuptial agreement likely in place. According to lawyers, the agreement is 'wise and necessary' and can 'strengthen' their love. Dain Dreyer, partner at Dreyer & Mazaheri, PLLC, advises couples to get a prenup in place at least six months before the wedding to avoid claims of duress or unfairness. Claudia Cobreiro, Esq., founder of Cobreiro Law, suggests that couples should get plans in motion even sooner, as prenups that protect a large amount of wealth or assets are generally more complex and detailed. The couple has planned a June wedding, but the exact date is not yet known.

**US Treasury Secretary Confident US Will Never Default on Debt**
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the US government will never default on its debt, despite the lack of a decision on raising its debt ceiling. 'The United States will never default, this will never happen', he said in an interview with CBS News. Bessent added that the US authorities 'are on a warning path and will not hit a wall'. According to the International Monetary Fund's calculations, the US government debt will increase to 122.5% of GDP by 2025 and continue to rise, reaching 128.2% by 2030. Earlier, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the country's government debt is on an 'unsustainable trajectory', but has not yet reached an unacceptable level, and it is unknown when this threshold will be crossed.

**Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's star-studded Italian wedding threatened by furious protesters in Venice | Daily Mail Online**
Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's highly-anticipated wedding in Venice, Italy, has sparked outrage among locals, who are planning protests to push back against the billionaire's plans. The couple, who are set to tie the knot on June 24, have taken over the island of San Giorgio Maggiore and booked up five luxury hotels and every water taxi in Venice. Laboratorio Occupato Morion, a self-described 'anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, anti-racist and trans-feminist political space,' is planning a demonstration on Friday, May 30, and a 'big demonstration' on the actual wedding day. The group's spokesperson, Alice Bazzoli, said, 'Jeff Bezos thinks he can buy the entire city - let's throw him a party!' and added that the event will exacerbate the already problematic movement around the city, particularly with the onset of the tourist season. The group is furious with the city's mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, who is under investigation for corruption and has been accused of selling parts of the city to investors linked to his private interests. Bazzoli said, 'We aim to create a space for discussion and action, which we feel is urgently needed. Everyone in Venice, from locals to entrepreneurs, university students, and families, is discussing the event, and outrage is widespread, particularly towards our administration, led by Mayor Luigi Brugnaro, who is currently on trial for corruption.'

**Jeff Bezos pitched Trump a different VP pick last summer - months before he pulled endorsement for Harris, new book claims**
According to a new book by Axios' Alex Isenstadt, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos privately pitched an alternative vice president pick to President Donald Trump in July 2024, months before The Washington Post killed its endorsement for Kamala Harris. Bezos praised Trump's resilience after an assassination attempt and declared North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, who has since been picked as Trump's Secretary of the Interior, an 'excellent choice'. Burgum, a former owner of Great Plains Software, is now a foreseer of one of Trump's most controversial land bills, 'Drill, baby, drill'. Bezos had been fostering a relationship with Trump for months and had previously overruled The Washington Post's editorial branch to write in support of personal liberties and free markets. The Post's opinion editor, David Shipley, resigned in protest. Bezos also axed a political endorsement for Harris just 10 days before Trump's landslide victory in the U.S. Election, and Amazon donated $1 million to the Trump inauguration fund.

**Jeff Bezos Orders The Washington Post to Publish Daily Columns in Support of Free Markets and Individual Freedoms**
Jeff Bezos, the owner of The Washington Post, has ordered the newspaper to publish daily columns in support of 'individual freedoms and free markets'. According to Bezos, 'We will write every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal freedoms and free markets.' Bezos, who has been increasingly aligned with US President Donald Trump, stated that the newspaper will also cover other topics, but opposing viewpoints will be left for other publications to publish. The editor of the Post's opinion section, David Shipley, has resigned due to this decision. Bezos explained that in the past, it made sense for newspapers to provide a section of opinion that covered 'all viewpoints', but 'today, the internet does that job.' This is not the first time Bezos has intervened in the Post's editorial decisions, as he previously blocked the newspaper's decision to endorse Democratic candidate Kamala Harris during the 2024 election. The Post had a strong anti-Trump editorial stance during his first term (2017-2021), but Bezos donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration and attended his inauguration ceremony in 2025.

**Democracy Dies at “The Washington Post”**
Jeff Bezos, the owner of The Washington Post, has announced a significant shift in the paper's opinion section, stating that it will now focus exclusively on supporting and defending personal liberties and free markets. Bezos claims that these viewpoints are 'underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion,' but critics argue that this move will only amplify the billionaire class's echo chamber and stifle dissenting voices. The change comes after Bezos's decision not to endorse Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, despite the paper's editorials advocating for her bid. The new direction will require 100% commitment from the paper's staff, and Bezos has announced that he will be searching for a new Opinion Editor to lead this new chapter. Critics argue that this move will not free up or expand the economic debate in the United States, but rather remove the measure of skepticism that sometimes crept into the commentary from the Post editorial board.

**Bezos Announces Restrictions on Opinions in Washington Post Editorial Pages**
Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, announced on Wednesday that the newspaper will no longer publish opinions that are against 'personal freedoms and free market' in its editorial pages. Bezos wrote on the social media platform X, 'We will write every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal freedoms and free market.' He added, 'We will also cover other topics, of course, but opposing views to those pillars will be left for others to publish.' This decision marks a significant departure from the norm of pluralism in editorial pages of The Post and most credible media outlets worldwide. The move comes at a time when US media is facing growing threats to their freedom and accusations of bias from President Donald Trump. Bezos has been increasingly close to Trump since his election in November 2024, along with other US tech moguls.

**Asteroid Anxiety: A Reluctant Perspective**
The author was surprised to learn about the Office of Planetary Defense Coordination, which is dependent on NASA and responsible for monitoring asteroids that pass close to Earth. Given the current situation, the author wonders if President Trump will pay attention to this office, which may seem unprofitable at first glance. However, she is confident that Elon Musk, the president's advisor, has informed him that 100 tons of dust and particles the size of a grain of sand bombard the Earth daily. The author feels somewhat relieved upon learning this, as she would prefer to be hit by an asteroid than to wait daily for Trump's next occurrence or treaty. The article also mentions the asteroid 2024 YR4, which has a 3 out of 10 risk of impacting Earth on the Turin scale, but is not expected to do so until 2032. Meanwhile, Spanish adventurer Jesús Calleja is traveling to Texas to fulfill his dream of flying on the New Shepard rocket from Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos.

**Trump and Xi Jinping: A Threat to Global Cooperation**
Both Trump and Xi Jinping are known for disregarding international norms for the sake of their own countries' interests. However, they have shown a willingness to think about their countries' futures in the face of existing threats. Trump invited tech industry leaders such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to the front row at his inauguration last month, sending a message to China that the US will surpass it economically by 2049. Xi Jinping has responded by announcing plans to train tens of thousands of digital soldiers to create a Chinese-centered AI ecosystem. The commitment of these two leaders to prioritize their countries' interests is a reflection of the current global reality, where countries must fend for themselves rather than relying on cooperation to solve problems.
