**Saudi Arabia Resumes Flights to Transport Iranian Pilgrims After 7-Year Hiatus**
Saudi Arabian Airlines has resumed flights to transport Iranian pilgrims after an eight-year hiatus, marking a significant improvement in diplomatic relations between Riyadh and Tehran. The initiative, which began with flights from Imam Khomeini Airport in Tehran, paves the way for an exceptional Hajj season that brings the two countries together after a long period of tension. According to a source from the General Authority of Civil Aviation, Saudi Arabian Airlines has resumed flights to transport Iranian pilgrims for the first time since 2015. The low-cost airline, Fly Nas, a subsidiary of Saudi Airlines, began flights from Imam Khomeini Airport in Tehran on Saturday and will also operate similar flights from and to Mashhad Airport in Mashhad, northeast Iran. This year's Hajj season is expected to begin in the first week of June, with pilgrims from around the world already arriving in the holy sites in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi airline will operate 225 flights until July, transporting over 35,000 Iranian pilgrims, with the source emphasizing that these flights are only for Hajj purposes and not commercial. This move comes as part of the improvement in relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which re-established diplomatic relations in March 2023, mediated by China, ending a seven-year diplomatic rift that began in January 2016. The diplomatic rift had a direct impact on the coordination of Hajj and Umrah affairs, leading to the suspension of direct flights to transport Iranian pilgrims to Saudi Arabia. Since then, several practical steps have been taken to solidify this rapprochement, including the resumption of direct flights to transport Iranian pilgrims, which represents an important symbol of enhancing trust and understanding between the two countries.
