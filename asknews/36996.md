**How Trump's Proposed Changes to PSLF Could Affect Your Loan Forgiveness**
President Donald Trump's executive order, signed on March 7, 2025, aims to limit who can qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by changing the definition of 'public service.' The order excludes organizations engaging in activities with a 'substantial illegal purpose,' including those that aid and abet federal immigration law violations, support terrorism, or engage in child abuse. While the order doesn't directly alter the PSLF program, it instructs the Department of Education and the Treasury Department to propose regulatory changes making certain public-sector employees ineligible for taxpayer-funded student loan forgiveness. The affected jobs are unclear, but may include federal employees, nonprofit sectors involved in issues like immigration, terrorism, or child abuse, and organizations that engage in 'violence for the purpose of obstructing or influencing Federal Government policy.' The proposed changes are currently under review, and no definitive time frame for implementation has been set.

**Public Service Loan Forgiveness Under Threat: GOP Tax Bill Would Let Treasury Revoke Eligibility Unilaterally**
The House GOP's 2025 tax bill includes a provision that would give the U.S. Treasury Secretary unilateral power to strip nonprofits of their tax-exempt status by designating them as 'terrorist supporting organizations.' This could instantly disqualify employees of targeted nonprofits from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, upending the financial plans of thousands of student loan borrowers. Critics warn that this power could be easily abused for political purposes, and that it would capsize due process protections. The provision is a direct assault on charities, churches, universities, and other groups that might not align with the administration's ideology. For nonprofit employees, the stakes are especially acute, as a sudden revocation of a nonprofit's status would instantly derail PSLF credit for its employees through no fault of their own. 'This is a power grab that would let any administration punish any group that doesn't fully align with its political agenda,' said Cole Leiter of Americans Against Government Censorship.

The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Postsecondary Education has announced plans to form a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee, the Student Loans and Affordability Committee, to develop proposed regulations for federal student aid programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act.

Acting Under Secretary James Bergeron said, 'The negotiated rulemaking process that we are announcing today will allow key stakeholders to help improve federal student aid programs, including the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, so they work for students, families, and taxpayers.'

**Hacienda initiates debt forgiveness process for autonomous communities**
The Ministry of Finance has launched a public consultation on the draft law to implement the promised debt forgiveness to the autonomous communities of 83.252 million euros. The Department led by María Jesús Montero has opened a 15-day consultation period from May 15 to 30, during which observations and comments can be presented on the proposal. The text outlines the background of the debt, stating that 'the excessive borrowing experienced by the autonomous communities of common regime during the Great Recession, which led to a significant accumulation of public debt between 2010 and 2013'. According to the document, 'by assuming part of the autonomous debt, the state will reduce the communities' spending on interest and facilitate their gradual return to the markets to obtain financing, which will strengthen their financial autonomy and sustainability'. The Ministry of Finance aims to have the law approved before the end of 2025, after which each region will need to sign a convention with Hacienda to accept the debt forgiveness.

**Union 'payoffs will continue' until Department of Ed is closed, Betsy DeVos says * WorldNetDaily * by Tyler O'Neil, The Daily Signal**
The Department of Education under President Joe Biden relaxed requirements for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, allowing more public sector and nonprofit workers to have their student loan debt canceled. This change came after unions that stood to benefit from the change sent a letter to then-Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, arguing that the program should cover more government and nonprofit employees. Betsy DeVos, who led the department in Trump's first term, stated, 'The payoffs will continue until the department is closed.' The Biden administration's move has been criticized by some as self-serving and a misuse of taxpayer funds, while supporters argue that erasing student debt promotes education and assists the less fortunate.

**This Mistake Could Erase Your Student Loan Forgiveness Progress Overnight**
Borrowers seeking student loan forgiveness through Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) or Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans should avoid consolidating their federal loans in 2025. Consolidating now may reset their qualifying payment counts to zero, erasing years of progress toward loan cancellation. The Department of Education has warned borrowers that consolidating will temporarily reset their PSLF counts to zero. Additionally, the one-time IDR count adjustment program ended in January 2025, and consolidating now will likely cost borrowers all prior months or years of progress. The SAVE plan, which was supposed to offer lower payments and faster forgiveness, was blocked by a federal court in late 2024, and the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals imposed an injunction halting SAVE and pausing aspects of its predecessor, the REPAYE plan. This has thrown many borrowers' repayment strategies into chaos. As Persis Yu, Deputy Executive Director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said, 'This has thrown the entire system into chaos... it is not entirely clear what it is going to mean for those borrowers.'

**Tracking SCRD project progress to get simpler**
The Sunshine Coast Regional District (SCRD) has developed a reporting and prioritization tool to track project progress and simplify the process of finding out what's going on with current projects. The tool is a spreadsheet that lists approved projects with resourcing details, including monetary budget and assigned staff hours. A red line indicates the limits of the organization's current capacity, with projects above the line prioritized for implementation in 2025 and those below it formally deferred for reconsideration in 2026. Chief administrative officer Tina Perreault explained that as projects above the red line are completed, capacity is anticipated to free up for projects below the line to move up. The plan is to act as a tool for both board decision-making and operational execution, and an updated version of the workplan report is slated to be in front of directors every two months. Perreault said this might not happen when 2025 Q1 reports come forward in April, but she will be pushing for it to be available when 2025 Q2 results go to elected officials in July. The tool is expected to provide something that is not too cumbersome and highlight areas where attention is needed rather than going line by line through a couple of hundred different things.' Kelly Backs, committee chair and Area D director, was 'overjoyed' to introduce the item, stating, 'It is one of the best pieces I have seen in my two and a half years on the board,' and something that will help 'organize the organization.'

**8 Student Loan Dates And Deadlines Borrowers Should Know For 2025**
The Department of Education has announced that it will push out income recertification dates for income-driven repayment plans (IDR) to 2026, due to the Trump administration's decision to suspend processing for IDR plans. Borrowers who were due to recertify on or before March 17, 2025, were due to recertify on or before February 20, 2025. Borrowers who experienced a jump in their monthly payments due to failure to recertify 'must submit a recertification request as soon as possible to potentially lower your payment,' says the guidance. A key court hearing will be held this month in the legal challenge over the Trump administration's decision to suspend processing for IDR plans. Republican lawmakers in Congress are proposing an array of reforms that could dramatically reshape federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Proposed changes include repealing Biden-era regulations that have expanded access to several federal student loan forgiveness programs. Millions of borrowers remain in limbo on their student loans due to the ongoing forbearance associated with the SAVE plan legal challenges. According to current Department of Education guidance, 'Servicers expect to complete the necessary technical updates to be ready to begin moving borrowers back into repayment no earlier than September 2025. Because this transition will take time, servicers expect first payments to be due no earlier than December 2025.' Tax relief associated with student loan forgiveness will come to an end on December 31, 2025.

**Student loans: How Donald Trump's plans overlap with Project 2025**
President Donald Trump's recent education initiatives and tentative plans, including the potential dismantling of the Department of Education (DOE) and restructuring of student loan programs, reflect similar recommendations outlined in Project 2025, a conservative policy agenda. Trump has called for the dismantling of the DOE, stating that student loan portfolios would be moved, and has signed an executive order 'Restoring Public Service Loan Forgiveness' which is more moderate than Project 2025's call for the program's total termination. Project 2025 suggests phasing out existing income-driven repayment plans and implementing a new plan with stricter repayment structure and no forgiveness. Trump's education-related policy suggestions align closely with Project 2025, which urges the creation of a new loan agency entirely and privatizing lending programs. Critics, including Democrats and experts, have raised concerns over affordability and potential impacts on students with disabilities and low-income families.

**Students with loans seeking forgiveness for public service are feeling anxious, expert warns. Here's what you need to understand. - Internewscast Journal**
Many borrowers in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program are feeling anxious due to recent changes and uncertainty. According to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz, 'There's a lot of panicking by PSLF borrowers due to the uncertainty.' The Trump administration has taken down the applications for income-driven repayment plans, which are required for PSLF. Some borrowers' progress has stalled, and it's unclear when the forbearance will end. Borrowers are advised to keep records of their payment history and create a spreadsheet to track their qualifying payments. The Education Department is reworking the applications to comply with a recent court order, and it may take months before they are available again. In the meantime, borrowers can consider switching to the Standard Repayment plan, but payments may be too high for those working in the public sector or for a nonprofit. An option called 'Buyback' may help, which allows borrowers to pay for certain months that didn't count towards their 120 qualifying payments.

**Student loan borrowers pursuing public service forgiveness are 'panicking,' expert says. Here's what to know**
Student loan borrowers pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) are 'panicking' due to uncertainty, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. PSLF allows certain not-for-profit and government employees to have their federal student loans canceled after 10 years of payments. However, recent changes and court rulings have affected the program. Borrowers in the program need to know that the pause in payments and accrual of interest does not count toward their required 120 payments for loan forgiveness. The Education Department is reworking the applications for IDR plans, which may take months. Borrowers who switch to the Standard plan will continue to get PSLF credit, but payments are often too high for those working in the public sector or for a nonprofit to afford. Kantrowitz recommends that borrowers who've been pursuing PSLF for 10 years or more put in their 'buyback' request sooner than later, as the benefit may be eliminated by the Trump administration. Borrowers should also keep accurate records of their payment history and create a spreadsheet to track their qualifying payments.

**Student loan forgiveness: How to apply for debt cancellation**
Millions of Americans burdened by student debt have various options for loan forgiveness, cancellation or discharge. Programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan aim to alleviate financial pressures on borrowers. However, Republicans plan to crack down on student loan forgiveness. The PSLF program has no employer eligibility requirement and had 208,300 borrowers with applications pending from June 2024 to December 2024. Borrowers can also apply for Teacher Loan Forgiveness, which forgives up to $17,500 on Direct Loans or Federal Family Education Loans, and Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Forgiveness, which forgives any remaining balance after 20-25 years of qualifying payments. Experts like Michael Lux and Persis Yu emphasize the importance of navigating complex eligibility requirements and application processes to benefit from forgiveness programs.

**From forgiveness to frustration: How Trump can upend Biden's already troubled student loan policies - The Times of India**
President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plans have provided relief to over 5 million borrowers, with $183.6 billion in waived loans. However, the future of these plans is uncertain under a potential Trump administration, which opposes student loan forgiveness and has proposed rollbacks that could undo Biden's progress. Trump's 'Project 2025' suggests ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program and narrowing eligibility for borrower defense, which could limit avenues for students and public servants to have their loans forgiven. Additionally, Trump's proposed changes to income-driven repayment plans could result in higher monthly payments and delay loan cancellation for millions of borrowers.

**7 Student Loan Forgiveness Updates As Trump Returns To The Presidency**
As President-elect Donald Trump takes office, the federal student loan system is in a state of turmoil. President Biden's administration has made significant progress in student loan forgiveness, discharging nearly $190 billion in debt and canceling balances for 5.3 million borrowers. However, several Biden administration programs have been struck down or rescinded, and the SAVE plan, a new income-driven repayment program, remains mired in a legal battle. The Education Department has extended the SAVE plan forbearance, but borrowers won't be able to resume repayment until December 2025 at the earliest. The future of the SAVE plan is uncertain, and the incoming Trump administration has not indicated whether it will try to revive or replace it. Borrowers who want to switch to a different IDR plan can now do so, and the Education Department has published a tracker to help borrowers view their IDR progress. However, student loan forgiveness under IDR programs remains taxable, and collections and negative credit reporting for defaulted federal student loans are expected to resume later in 2025.

**Public Service Loan Forgiveness | The White House**
The White House is offering a temporary change to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, allowing borrowers to receive credit for past payments, even if they were not on time or for less than the amount due. Borrowers who have worked in public service for 10 years or more, or have made 120 monthly payments, may be eligible for forgiveness. Examples of eligible borrowers include Elena, a psychiatrist who has worked in public service for 11 years, and Vishal, an elementary school teacher who has made 6 years' worth of monthly payments. Borrowers who have not yet served 10 years, but have made significant payments, may also be eligible for credit towards forgiveness. The temporary changes are available until October 31, 2022.
