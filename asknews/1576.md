**2.8 Billion People Worldwide Lack Access to Suitable Housing, UN Report Finds**
According to the United Nations' Habitat Programme annual report for 2024, approximately 2.8 billion people worldwide lack access to suitable housing. Of these, 1.1 billion people live in poor or informal settlements, which is 'the main challenge for sustainable urban development', as stated in the report. Around 90% of the population of these poor settlements live in Africa and Asia, where there is a shortage of housing units of around 170 million. Anna Claudia Robisch, Executive Director of the United Nations' Habitat Programme, said in the report that 'climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters continue to force millions of people to leave their homes in search of safety, stability, and better living conditions.' The report estimates that 318 million people are homeless, equivalent to the population of the United States. Globally, 'one in four people lives in conditions that harm their health, safety, and well-being', according to the United Nations' Habitat Programme report. Only 14% of urban residents and 40% of rural residents have access to clean water, and two in five people do not have access to sanitation services. The report states that 'safe and managed sanitation is a fundamental element of human development and is often used as a measure of progress in reducing poverty, diseases, and premature deaths.' Anna Claudia Robisch called for 'rethinking urban policies, land use, laws, and financing to prioritize housing and basic services as key drivers of climate action and sustainable development.' By 2040, it is expected that 2 billion urban residents will be exposed to significant temperature increases. The United Nations' Habitat Programme member states adopted the programme's strategic plan for 2026-2029, which focuses on access to housing, land, and basic services, such as clean water and sanitation.

**UN-Habitat Reports 2.8 Billion People Worldwide are Inadequately Housed**
According to the United Nations' Habitat agency, 2.8 billion people worldwide are inadequately housed, with 318 million people homeless. The report highlights that 1.1 billion people live in slums or informal settlements, which is the 'principal challenge of sustainable urban development.' Anacláudia Rossbach, executive director of ONU-Habitat, states, 'Climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters continue to displace millions of people, forcing them to leave their homes in search of security, stability, and better living conditions.' The agency reports that 14% of urban residents and 40% of rural residents lack access to clean water, and two out of five people do not have access to sanitation services. Anacláudia Rossbach calls for 'rethinking urban policies, land use, legislation, and financing to prioritize housing and basic services, as they are essential levers for climate action and sustainable development.' By 2040, 2 billion urban residents are expected to face significant temperature increases.

**Countdown to 2030: Achieving global targets on disaster displacement**
A new report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) reveals that disasters triggered 264.8 million forced movements of people across 210 countries and territories between 2015 and 2024. In 2024 alone, disasters forced people to flee their homes nearly 45.8 million times, the highest annual figure on record. IDMC director Alexandra Bilak said, 'Disaster displacement is not a future problem. It's happening now, it's happening more often, and it can happen anywhere, although it is hitting the poorest the hardest.' The report highlights that while climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent and intense, lack of preparedness, inadequate infrastructure, and high exposure to risks are also major factors in disaster displacement. The IDMC warns that displacement risk is likely to grow, with 100 million people globally at risk of internal displacement caused by disasters in any given year under a pessimistic warming scenario. Bilak added, 'Our window to act is closing. It's time to turn what we've learned from the data into political solutions and financial commitments.'

**We Have a Distribution Problem**
According to WFP data, 733 million people worldwide are suffering from chronic hunger, with over 300 million experiencing acute hunger. The number of acutely hungry people has increased significantly in recent years, said Husain. Additionally, nearly 150 million children under five are stunted, and almost 50 million are severely malnourished. Husain attributed the dire food situation in many regions to wars and armed conflicts, which led to economic poverty. He also cited extreme weather events and natural disasters, partly caused by climate change, as well as rising living costs, which are causing poverty not only in developing countries but also in developed ones. Husain emphasized the importance of international trade in solving distribution problems and criticized the US administration's tariff policy, which he believes is harmful to the global economy, including the US economy itself. The negative effects on poor countries are even more severe, as they mainly export raw materials to earn foreign exchange. Husain also criticized recent cuts in funding by major donor countries, including the US, Germany, France, and the UK, which have worsened the food situation. The WFP had $9.8 billion in funding from these countries in 2024, but this year it has only $6.4 billion.

**CIA Report Warns of Global Catastrophe by 2030: A Countdown to Disaster**
A 2003 report by the CIA, 'The 2030 Spike: Countdown to Global Catastrophe', written by Colin Mason, describes six factors that will converge in the next decade, leading to a global catastrophe. These factors include energy scarcity, demographic disparities, global poverty, climate change, food shortages, water scarcity, and international anarchy. The report proposes over 100 measures to mitigate the consequences of this crisis. According to the report, 'estimates place available petroleum resources at less than one billion barrels, and global consumption at 28 billion barrels per year, indicating depletion in as little as 34 years.' The report also cites studies by the International Water Management Institute, predicting that one billion people will face absolute water scarcity by 2025. To avoid this, the report suggests using science, particularly genetics and climatology, to address climate change, water and food scarcity. However, some measures proposed in the report are more controversial, including: diverting scientific effort from arms, space research, and 'doubtful' technologies to practical goals for humanity; establishing a global authority to define priorities and advise on implementation; forming a 'censor' body to examine new technologies and identify potential harm; creating a specialized international penal law body to prevent the application of harmful technologies; and establishing research institutes with secure funding. The report concludes that these objectives may not be achievable, but can be approached.

**Turkey sees sharp rise in obesity**
Turkey is experiencing a sharp rise in obesity, with 66.8% of its population affected, according to a 2022 WHO report. By 2030, it's estimated that 27 million people in Turkey will be obese, or one in three. Experts attribute this trend to insufficient nutrition, social inequality, unhealthy food supplies, and a lack of coherent policy strategies. Hacer Foggo, a Turkish poverty researcher, said the growing number of obese children can be linked to extreme poverty, while Bulent Sik, a food researcher, sees a direct link between the rise in child obesity and the widespread consumption of highly processed foods with low nutritional value and a high sugar content. Sik also warned of the use of toxic chemicals in food production, such as pesticides and certain additives that are related to hormonal imbalances and weight gain. Turkey's Health Ministry has launched a national public health campaign to combat obesity, but experts say the effort has drawn criticism for stigmatizing overweight individuals and overlooking the country's broader economic struggles. 'Political decision-makers are responsible for creating solutions,' said Sik. Both Sik and Foggo support a nationwide free school meal program, citing the need for adequate guidelines for healthy eating and restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy foods.

**Trump's Cuts to USAID Will Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under the age of five. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.'

**UNESCO Warns of 2.5 Billion People Living in Extreme Conditions by 2050**
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has warned that 2.5 billion people will live in extreme conditions by 2050. The study found that 239 million of them will live in extreme poverty, 'with no or few possibilities of overcoming their precarious socio-economic situation in increasingly threatening climate scenarios.' This highlights the need to protect the most vulnerable. The report, 'Who assumes the cost? How to address inequalities derived from climate change and climate action,' aims to put a spotlight on and address the 'deep social and economic inequalities' that have been 'aggravated' by climate change and introduced into current climate policies. The study's main author, Rodolfo Lacy, explained that the research presents a set of composite indices that evaluate how different sectors and populations will be affected in mid-century climate scenarios. The results show 'significant inequalities' in exposure to climate risks and adaptation capacity, particularly among marginalized groups and low-income households. The analysis indicates that the global south bears an 'unequal' burden of climate change, based on data such as 3.6 billion people living in highly vulnerable areas to climate change effects or 2.5 billion people exposed to extreme heat in 2050, of which 239 million in extreme poverty and with temperatures above 35 degrees for more than 12 weeks a year. According to the study, indigenous peoples, children, irregular workers, and women, of whom 1.4 billion will be directly affected between 2040 and 2060, suffer a 'higher risk.' Lacy argued, 'If equity and justice are not placed at the center of climate agendas, the grave risk of exacerbating current inequalities, undermining global stability, and hindering the shared goal of sustainable development will be taken.' UNESCO's Social Policy Director, Gustavo Merino, explained that the study proposes integrating equity, social justice, and human rights into climate policies to ensure a 'just and inclusive' transition. 'The first effects of global climate change disproportionately affect countries and communities that have barely contributed to the crisis but are extremely vulnerable to its effects,' Merino noted. The study found that the 10% of the richest countries are responsible for nearly 50% of global emissions, while the most vulnerable countries (Chad, South Sudan, Niger, Central African Republic, and Somalia) face complex crises of poverty, lack of infrastructure, and climate stress.

**Joaquim von Braun: 'More than 590 million people could live in extreme poverty by 2030'**
Joaquim von Braun, president of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, has stated at the International Congress on Poverty and Hunger in Valencia that 'it is necessary to prioritize investments to eradicate hunger by 2030 or 2040'. 'The global rate of extreme poverty increased in 2020, reversing decades of progress' and, if current trends continue, 'more than 590 million people could live in conditions of extreme poverty by 2030'. Braun emphasized that 'this phenomenon reflects the multidimensional nature of poverty, strongly influenced by factors such as armed conflicts, trade wars, climate change, humanitarian crises, debt accumulation, and cuts in international aid'. He stressed the need for short-term (25 years) and long-term (25-100 years) plans, and highlighted the importance of 'rapid and multifaceted action': from reducing emissions to innovative financing, passing through climate-based solutions on nature. Braun also emphasized 'the role of rich nations in empowering countries that have contributed less to the crisis, but suffer its effects more'. The V International Congress on Poverty and Hunger, held under the motto 'Diversity, Integration, and Universality', was inaugurated by Archbishop Enrique Benavent, who also delivered a lecture where he stressed that 'Christian faith must not only detect poverty, but also the poor' because 'this is how a Christian response to poverty can be given, which is embodied in each person in a unique way'. Benavent referred to the social magisterium of recent popes as a key to understanding the ethical dimension of the poverty problem. He noted that 'the Christian response to this problem is summarized in two words that Pope Benedict XVI highlighted in his encyclical 'Deus caritas est': justice and charity. Charity without a search for justice will never solve the causes of poverty'. The Congress has also featured the Nobel laureate in Medicine, Richard John Roberts, and the Dean of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Notre Dame in Lebanon, Viviane Naimy.

**More Nigerians Expected To Fall Into Poverty By 2027 - World Bank**
According to the World Bank, sub-Saharan Africa has the highest extreme poverty rate globally, with 80% of the world's estimated 695 million extreme poor residing in the region in 2024. The report noted that non-resource-rich countries are expected to continue reducing poverty faster than resource-rich countries. Specifically, for Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo, poverty is expected to increase by 3.6 percentage points between 2022 and 2027. The World Bank stated that rapid urbanisation could accelerate poverty reduction 'under the right conditions', with the urban population projected to grow by over 238 million by 2035, surpassing the rural population. However, the success of the transition would depend on the ability of urban areas to provide the necessary infrastructure, services, and employment opportunities to support the increased population.

**World Bank: 622 million people will continue to live in extreme poverty in 2030**
According to the World Bank, 622 million people will continue to live in extreme poverty in 2030. Almost as many will suffer from hunger and malnutrition. The World Bank notes that the gap between rich and poor countries has widened, with only six of the 26 low-income countries expected to reach middle-income status by 2050. The World Bank also states that the debt of states has reached record levels, with public spending exploding without being accompanied by an increase in revenue. The bank also notes that the slowdown in global economic integration has had a particularly acute impact on low-income countries, which account for more than 40% of the world's population living on less than $2.15 per day. 'It is now clear that the great goals of the past decades will not be achieved,' the World Bank says. 'The perspectives of long-term growth of developing economies are at their lowest since 2000.' The World Bank also notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy, with a decline in global economic growth from 5.9% in the 2000s to 3.5% in the 2020s. 'For the rest of them, including the Sudan and Syria, the situation has simply not evolved: over the past 15 years, in these 26 low-income countries, the average annual growth of real GDP per capita (adjusted for inflation) has been less than 0.1%,' the World Bank says. 'This succession of vicissitudes highlights what developing economies have succeeded or failed to do in this first quarter of the century. It also highlights what they can do in the coming years to progress and chart their own course, independently of the circumstances prevailing beyond their borders.'

**The Current Situation of the SDGs: Far from the Goal II**
The United Nations' latest report on the Sustainable Development Goals (ODS) shows that progress has been uneven, with some countries advancing faster than others. While developing nations have made progress in reducing extreme poverty, others face economic crises and conflicts that hinder their progress. According to the report, by 2030, 590 million people could still be living in extreme poverty if current trends persist. Additionally, 733 million people suffered from hunger in 2023, and 2.330 million experienced moderate to severe food insecurity. If current trends continue, one in five children under 5 years old will suffer from growth retardation in 2030. The report also highlights the need for more efforts to achieve the goals of zero hunger, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, and decent work and economic growth. While some progress has been made, such as a reduction in the number of people without access to electricity, much work remains to be done to achieve the ODS by 2030. As the report states, 'The fulfillment of the Agenda 2030 is an ambitious goal that requires collective and sustained commitment. While the obstacles are significant, the opportunity to build a more just and sustainable future is within reach. The responsibility lies with all of us. Only through a joint effort can we transform the vision of a sustainable world into a reality for future generations.'

**Developing economies need immediate and fresh game plan to kickstart growth**
The World Bank has released a report stating that without a sustained improvement in growth rates, only six of today's 26 low-income countries are likely to attain middle-income status by 2050. The report notes that the long-term growth outlook for developing economies is the weakest it has been since the start of the century. By 2030, 622 million people will remain in extreme poverty, and hunger and malnutrition will continue to affect roughly the same number. The World Bank emphasizes that developing economies need an immediate and fresh game plan to kickstart growth, strengthen their capacity to fend for themselves, and seize growth opportunities. With the right policies, some challenges can be turned into opportunities, and developing economies can reap significant rewards by increasing reforms to attract investment and deepen trade and investment ties with other economies.

**622m to face extreme poverty by 2030 – W’Bank**
A new World Bank report projects that 622 million people will still live in extreme poverty by 2030, despite decades of global efforts to end hunger and want. The report attributes this grim projection to weak economic growth, low investment, stalled reforms, and the escalating impacts of climate change. The challenges are particularly pronounced for low-income economies, which have made minimal progress in reducing poverty. However, the report identifies a path forward for developing economies to address these challenges and reduce extreme poverty, including strengthening economic ties with other developing nations, implementing domestic reforms, and transitioning to climate-resilient economies. The report warns that complacency is not an option and that urgent and coordinated action is required now to prevent 622 million people from remaining in extreme poverty by 2030. As stated in the report, 'Currently, more than 40 per cent of exports from developing economies go to other developing economies, a significant increase from 20 years ago. By deepening trade relationships and attracting intra-regional investment, these economies can foster shared growth and reduce their reliance on advanced economies.'
