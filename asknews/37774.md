**Trump says China will ship rare earth elements in 'done' trade deal**
President Donald Trump announced that a trade framework with China has been completed, with Beijing agreeing to supply rare earth elements and magnets 'UP FRONT' and the US allowing Chinese students into its colleges and universities. The US and China will maintain tariffs at their current, lower levels. Trump's comments have raised questions about the terms of the pact, with some analysts suggesting that he is being misleading. The agreement includes China supplying rare earths and magnets, and the US easing some export controls. However, curbs related to advanced chips will remain in place. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the pact will be completed within days and that he doesn't expect a written version to be released publicly. Trump's initial post suggested that China may have to restart rare earth shipments before the US agrees to lower export controls on key technology. 'OUR DEAL WITH CHINA IS DONE, SUBJECT TO FINAL APPROVAL WITH PRESIDENT XI AND ME,' Trump posted on social media. 'WE ARE GETTING A TOTAL OF 55% TARIFFS, CHINA IS GETTING 10%. RELATIONSHIP IS EXCELLENT!'

**Trump-Xi Phone Call Sparks Multiple Reactions**
After a phone call between US President Trump and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Xi Jinping, multiple effects have been triggered. Firstly, the US-China trade talks resumed in London on June 9. The US side has taken a tough stance, with the US Secretary of Commerce stating that the US will propose to China that China's scholars attempted to bring agricultural terror pathogens into the US. Secondly, Trump invited Xi to visit the US, but the CCP's statement was strange, seemingly strengthening the rumor that Xi's power is waning. Russia also does not trust the CCP, with leaked Russian security documents showing that Russia activated anti-spy operations three days before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine to prevent CCP infiltration. Meanwhile, the CCP secretly strengthened the recruitment of potential spies. Trump's phone call with Xi has sparked a series of reactions, with some saying that Trump has retreated, while others believe it is a negotiating tactic. The CCP's statement only mentioned that Trump was invited to visit China, but did not mention Xi's invitation to visit the US. This has led to speculation that Xi is unwilling to visit the US or has lost the opportunity to do so. The CCP's leader Xi Jinping has been questioned for his unusual behavior, with some speculating that he has lost power. Trump said that Xi invited him to visit China, and he accepted, and also invited Xi to visit the US, saying that Xi also 'hopes' to come to the US. However, the CCP's statement only mentioned that Trump was invited to visit China, but did not mention Xi's invitation to visit the US. This has led to speculation that Xi is unwilling to visit the US or has lost the opportunity to do so. Russia's security documents show that Russia activated anti-spy operations three days before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine to prevent CCP infiltration. The CCP secretly strengthened the recruitment of potential spies. The new South Korean president, Lee Jae-myung, has spoken with Trump and agreed to quickly reach a trade agreement. The US has urged its major trading partners to submit their proposals by June 4, and the US and China will meet in London on June 9. The key factor is whether the US and South Korea can reach a trade agreement. Lee Jae-myung has spoken with Trump and agreed to quickly reach a trade agreement.

**Trump-Xi Phone Call Triggers Multiple Effects: CCP's Power in Decline?**
After a phone call between US President Trump and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Xi Jinping, multiple effects have been triggered. Firstly, the US-China tariff talks will take place in London on June 9. The US side has taken a counterattack against the CCP's 'supreme limit' strategy. US Secretary of the Interior has stated that the US will propose to the CCP that CCP scholars have attempted to bring agricultural terror pathogens into the US. Secondly, Trump invited Xi Jinping to visit the US, but the CCP's statement was strange, seeming to strengthen the rumor that Xi Jinping's power is in decline.

This has led to speculation that Xi Jinping does not want to visit the US or has lost the opportunity to do so. The CCP's high-level dynamics have been abnormal recently, with various versions of rumors pointing to Xi Jinping's decline. Some people believe that Xi Jinping's power is in decline, while others think that he has been stripped of his power. Russia has also taken measures to prevent CCP infiltration, including recruiting potential spies. The situation is complex and unclear.

**Trump Announces 'Deal' with China, But Tensions Remain**
US President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that a 'deal' has been reached with China. However, the 'truce' is largely a return to the tense situation before April 2. The tariffs and export restrictions remain high, and the US has not opened its doors to Chinese cars or high-end AI chips. China is not treating the US more 'fairly' after the agreement than before. The US and China are still at an economic stalemate. The US has imposed unprecedented trade barriers, including a 10% tariff on almost all products entering the US and an additional 20% tariff on Chinese products to pressure China to reduce the flow of fentanyl across the border. The White House has also canceled the minimis exemption, which allowed packages worth less than $800 to enter the US without tariffs. The accumulation of tariffs creates significant trade barriers with the US's second-largest trading partner, raising prices for US businesses and consumers without easy solutions or clear alternatives in the market.

**Trump and Xi Agree to Meet Amid Escalating Trade War**
US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have agreed to meet in person, despite an ongoing and escalating trade war. According to Trump, the date and location of the summit will be announced later. Trump also appreciated the invitation to China, which was extended by the Chinese government. This development comes as a welcome respite from the unprecedented escalation of tariffs initiated by Trump against all countries, including China, since taking office in January. The last time Trump and Xi met was in 2019 at the G20 summit in Japan, where they agreed to reduce tariffs by 115% for 90 days. However, the current trade war is on a much larger scale, with the US imposing monumental tariffs and making more serious accusations against China. China has had time to prepare and adapt to the reality of a more reluctant US trade partner, and has expanded its trade to other markets.

**Oil Prices Fall as Markets Assess US-China Trade Talks**
Oil prices fell in early trading on Wednesday as markets assessed the results of US-China trade talks, which have yet to be reviewed by President Donald Trump. The talks were held in London and focused on re-establishing a trade truce between the two nations. According to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the two sides agreed on a framework to restart the trade talks and lift Chinese restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals and magnets. Lutnick stated that Trump will be briefed on the outcome before it is finalized. However, data on China's oil imports and continued increases in OPEC+ production have put downward pressure on the market. OPEC+ plans to increase oil production by 411,000 barrels per day in July, aiming to ease production cuts for the fourth consecutive month. Meanwhile, Chinese customs data showed that the country, the world's largest oil importer, imported 46.60 million tons of crude oil in May, a 3% decrease from the previous month, with oil product imports falling by 12.9%.

**EU and China to Hold Summit in July Amid Economic Tensions**
Representatives of the European Union will visit China in July for a summit amidst economic tensions and US tariffs. The summit is scheduled for July 24-25, according to Politico, citing diplomats. The first day of the meeting will take place in Beijing, and the second in Anhui province. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa will represent the EU. It is unclear whether Chinese leader Xi Jinping will participate in the summit. One of the goals of the summit for China is to persuade the EU to lift tariffs on electric vehicles. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce reported last week that negotiations with Brussels on this issue are at a final stage. The July summit will mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the EU and China. The Chinese embassy in the EU declined to comment on the meeting, while an EU Council representative confirmed that the summit will take place in mid-July. In October 2024, EU countries approved the introduction of tariffs up to 45% on Chinese-made electric vehicles. In May 2025, the US and China agreed to reduce tariffs on imports by 90% for 90 days. US President Donald Trump accused China of violating the trade agreement with the US on May 30. New rounds of trade talks began in London on June 9 to resolve the trade war between the US and China. On June 11, the US and China signed a framework trade agreement, with Trump stating that the tariffs for China would be 55% and for the US 10%.

**US and China Reach Trade Deal**
US President Donald Trump announced that the US and China have reached an agreement on a trade deal. According to Trump, 'China has agreed to provide magnets and rare earth minerals to the US, while the US will allow Chinese students to study in American colleges and universities.' Trump also stated that the US will reduce tariffs on Chinese goods by 55%, while China will reduce tariffs on US goods by 10%. Trump said, 'President Xi and I will work closely together to bring China into the US market. This will be a huge victory for both countries!' The US has been reducing tariffs on Chinese goods since February 2025, and by April, the tariffs had reached 145%. In response, China increased tariffs on US goods by 125%. The trade negotiations between the US and China have been ongoing since May, with the first round taking place in Geneva and the second round in London. The agreement reached in Geneva in May resulted in the US reducing tariffs by 30% and China reducing tariffs by 10%. However, the countries later accused each other of violating the agreement.

**Markets extend gains as China-US talks head into second day**
Stocks mostly rose on Tuesday as China-US trade talks entered their second day, with optimism that the negotiations will bring calm to markets and ease tensions between the two economic superpowers. Donald Trump's top adviser, Kevin Hassett, said he expected 'a big, strong handshake' at the end of the talks, which will focus on exports of rare earth minerals used in smartphones and electric vehicle batteries. Hassett stated that Beijing had agreed to lower tariffs on these minerals in Geneva, but the release was slower than expected. He added that the Trump administration might ease some recent curbs on tech exports. Despite a strong start, Asian markets stuttered in the afternoon, with investors growing nervous ahead of the talks. Analysts remain cautious, warning that tariffs will likely remain a feature of US trade policy under President Trump and could impact the global economy.

**Stocks, Futures Gyrate Before US-China Trade Talks: Markets Wrap**
Equity-index futures fluctuated and stocks lost momentum ahead of the second day of US-China trade talks. Despite no significant breakthroughs announced after the first day, US officials sounded optimistic about the negotiations. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said discussions were 'fruitful', while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cited a 'good meeting.' President Donald Trump said 'I'm only getting good reports' on the talks. The two sides are looking to ease tensions over shipments of technology and rare earth elements. Chinese shipments to the US last month had the worst drop in more than five years, but stock markets are rallying on optimism that trade tensions will cool down. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said the central bank is still some distance from its inflation goal, which helped accelerate a weakening of the yen. 'People seem to be speculating that the talks didn't go well,' said Fu Shifeng, investment director at Cheng Zhou Investment. 'We are doing well with China. China's not easy,' Trump added. 'China was earnest about trade talks but is at the same time principled,' said a commentary listed in a social media account affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV. 'US should remove all negative measures against China and objectively view the progress that has been made so far,' it added.

**Lula rewrites Brazil’s geopolitical playbook**
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is redefining Brazil's geopolitical strategy by establishing alliances with Asian countries, particularly China, Japan, and Vietnam. Lula's visit to China in May 2025 aimed to demonstrate Brazil's resistance to US President Donald Trump's tariff bullying and showcase Lula's leadership in Latin America. Brazil has recently joined OPEC+ and upgraded its bilateral relationship with Vietnam to a strategic partnership. Lula has also taken a clear stance against Trump's tariff policy, calling it 'absurd'. China is concerned that sustained US pressure might compel Mexico to close its market to Chinese goods, and Lula's visit to China is seen as a model for the global south in resisting Trump's hegemony. Brazil is also exploring cooperation with China on the South American transcontinental railway, which could be a key project for deepening cooperation between China and Latin America.

**Trump Announces Meeting Between US and China in London**
US President Donald Trump announced on his social media platform, Truth Social, that a meeting between the US and China will take place on Monday, June 9, 2025, in London. The meeting will be attended by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer, who will discuss the Commercial Agreement with Chinese representatives. Trump expressed his optimism about the meeting, saying 'I am pleased to announce that the Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, the Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, and the US Trade Representative, Ambassador Jamieson Greer, will meet in London on Monday, June 9, 2025, with Chinese representatives to discuss the Commercial Agreement. It is expected to be a very successful meeting. Thank you for your attention.' This announcement comes after a phone conversation between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, in which the two leaders agreed to accelerate the negotiations to reach a commercial agreement before the 90-day truce expires. The two countries had agreed to a 90-day commercial truce in May after a intense escalation of tariffs, and during this period, the relations have been marked by ups and downs, with the US accusing China of violating the conditions agreed in the agreement. However, it seems that the tone has improved, as the two presidents have invited each other to visit their countries. Trump explained, 'During the conversation, President Xi had the kindness to invite the First Lady and me to visit China, and I reciprocated. As presidents of two great nations, this is something we both look forward to with enthusiasm.'

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese plans to visit China this summer and meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to South China Morgan Post. The visit is expected to take place in July or August, with the main goal being trade negotiations. Albanese has been working to improve economic relations with China since taking office in 2022.

Albanese's visit is expected to be a priority for him in his second term after the Australian Labor Party's victory in the federal elections in May. 'It is expected that interaction with China will remain a priority for Albanese', the article says.

**Trump Announces Fair Trade Agreement with China**
US President Donald Trump has confirmed that the US will sign a fair trade agreement with China, according to a report by Al-Qahira Al-Moharrir. Trump is set to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE in May 2025, in his first foreign trip since taking office for his second term. According to White House spokesperson Caroline Leavitt, Trump's visit to the Gulf countries will take place from May 13 to 16, 2025. The visit comes as the Trump administration seeks to re-establish diplomatic relations with Iran over its nuclear program. Trump's officials have sent mixed signals about their goals, but have recently confirmed that their minimum goal is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, with the threat of military force. Trump said, 'We will sign a fair trade agreement with China.'

**EU Officials Plan Visit to China Amid Shift in Global Order**
European Union (EU) officials are planning a visit to China to meet with President Xi Jinping, according to the South China Morning Post. The trip is scheduled for late July, and will be led by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU Council President António Costa. This move breaks protocol, as the EU typically alternates visits between the two sides. The visit comes as the EU and China are negotiating over EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. Relations between the EU and China have been strained due to China's support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, analysts believe that the return of Donald Trump to power in the US could lead to a re-alignment of geopolitical alliances and economic partnerships. During a phone call on Tuesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang told von der Leyen that China has the tools to 'fully compensate' for any negative external shocks and reiterated his optimism about China's economic growth in 2025, saying 'It was a great day' for China's economy, according to Li Qiang. 'China has the tools to fully compensate for any negative external shocks,' he said. 'We are confident that our economy will continue to grow in 2025.'

**Trump Announces Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington**
US President Donald Trump announced that Chinese leader Xi Jinping will visit Washington 'in the not too distant future', according to Bloomberg. Trump did not specify a date for the meeting. This comes after a series of recent visits to the US by leaders of India, France, the UK, and Ireland. Bloomberg notes that high-ranking leaders of China and the US typically visit each other's countries in rotation, so Trump should have visited Beijing before hosting Xi, as Xi was supposed to visit California in late 2023. Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, was the first US president since Jimmy Carter not to visit China during his term, according to the publication. Trump and Xi last spoke in January, just before Trump's inauguration. Bloomberg reports that the visit is necessary given the growing trade tensions between the two largest economies in the world. Trump has been engaged in a trade war with China, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing is defending itself in the face of an internal economic crisis, trying to save as much as possible from the global trade system that saved China from poverty. Meanwhile, Trump aims to restructure the trade system, which he believes has benefited the rest of the world - and most of all, China - at the expense of the US. China has criticized Trump's policy towards Europe, with China's special envoy to European affairs, Lou Xiaoli, saying that he is shocked by Trump's behavior towards partners, calling it arrogant and dominant, and noting that the fate of a peace agreement for Ukraine cannot be determined solely by Washington and Moscow.

**Trump Announces Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington**
US President Donald Trump announced that Chinese leader Xi Jinping will visit Washington 'in the not too distant future', according to Bloomberg. Trump did not specify a date for the meeting. He made the statement during a board meeting at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, discussing a series of recent visits to the US by leaders of India, France, the UK, and Ireland. Bloomberg notes that it is customary for the leaders of China and the US to visit each other's countries in turn, so Trump should have visited Beijing before hosting Xi, who visited California at the end of 2023. Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, was the first US president since Jimmy Carter not to visit China during his tenure, according to the publication. Trump and Xi last spoke in January, a few days before Trump's inauguration. The visit is being discussed at a time when trade tensions between the two largest economies in the world are increasing. Trump has been waging a trade war with China, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing is defending itself in the face of internal economic crisis, hoping to save as much as possible from the global trade system that saved China from poverty. Trump aims to rebuild the trade system, which he believes has benefited the rest of the world, particularly China, at the expense of the US. China has criticized Trump's policy towards Europe, with China's special envoy to European affairs, Lu Shaye, saying he is shocked by Trump's treatment of partners, calling it arrogant and dominant, and stating that the fate of a peace agreement for Ukraine cannot be determined solely by Washington and Moscow.

**Xi Jinping to visit US 'soon,' Trump hints amid tariff disputes**
President Donald Trump announced that Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States in the near future, amid ongoing trade disputes between the two countries. Trump stated, 'He'll be coming in the not-too-distant future,' without providing further details. The visit could play a crucial role in reshaping US-China relations, which have been strained due to recent trade disputes and tariffs imposed by Trump. China has retaliated with levies on US agricultural exports, and has pledged to take 'all necessary measures' in response to US tariffs on steel and aluminum. Beijing has urged dialogue with Washington to ease tensions, and Xi's most recent visit to the US was in November 2023, when he met with Joe Biden in California.
