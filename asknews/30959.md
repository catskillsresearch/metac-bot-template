**How 'bogus' science is pushing Trump officials to go after abortion drugs**
A dubious report from anti-abortion activists, claiming that the widely used abortion drug mifepristone causes serious complications 22 times higher than previously reported, is now in the hands of top health officials in the Trump administration. Abortion rights advocates and public health researchers have condemned the report as unscientific and politically motivated, citing methodological flaws and a lack of transparency. The report's authors claim to have reviewed 865,727 insurance claims, but the database used is not disclosed due to a confidentiality agreement. Dr. Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco, called the report 'the statistical equivalent of a category 5 hurricane hitting the prevailing narrative of the abortion industry.' The FDA has noted that the adverse events associated with mifepristone cannot be causally attributed to the drug due to concurrent use of other medications and co-existing medical conditions. A spokesperson for GenBioPro, the manufacturer of mifepristone, said the report is 'clearly flawed' and 'another attempt by the anti-abortion movement to spread misinformation about the safety of the abortion pill.'

**Bill to stop flow of abortion pills into Texas clears House panel**
A comprehensive bill to crack down on abortion pills in Texas has passed the House State Affairs committee, despite concerns over its constitutionality. The bill, Senate Bill 2880, would allow the state to sue individuals who manufacture, distribute, or provide abortion-inducing drugs, even if the pills aren't proven to be the cause of death for the fetus. It also expands the wrongful death statute to allow men to sue providers of abortion pills for up to six years after the event. The bill's passage was urged by 43 Republican members of the House, who signed a letter to Chairman Ken King, saying 'Texas is in crisis' due to the influx of abortion pills. The bill now faces a tight turnaround to preliminarily pass the House before the Tuesday deadline.

**Abortion providers challenge FDA’s remaining mifepristone restrictions in federal court • New Jersey Monitor**
Abortion providers are challenging the FDA's remaining restrictions on mifepristone, a medication used for abortion and miscarriage treatment, in federal court. The plaintiffs argue that the restrictions are not medically necessary and are arbitrary, as they do not apply to other drugs with similar risks. Linda Goldstein, senior counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights, stated, 'The FDA has acknowledged that staying pregnant is more dangerous than not staying pregnant.' The FDA's current regulations require medical professionals to register with the drug manufacturer, pharmacies to apply for special certification, and patients to review and sign a counseling form. The plaintiffs argue that these restrictions are burdensome and limit access to the medication. The U.S. Department of Justice is arguing in favor of the current regulations, stating that they are necessary for the most common form of pregnancy termination to be considered safe. U.S. District Judge Robert S. Ballou appeared sympathetic to the plaintiffs' argument and did not rule at the end of the hearing. The case is significant for the South, as Virginia is the least restrictive state in the region and has seen an uptick in people traveling from elsewhere to receive care.

**Texas House Passes Abortion-Related Bills**
The Texas House has passed two abortion-related bills that already passed the Senate. The bills ban taxpayer money from being used to assist with travel outside of Texas to have an abortion. The first bill, SB 33, filed by state Sen. Donna Campbell, R-New Braunfels, passed the House by a vote of 87-57. The second bill, which was not specified, also passed the House. The bills aim to restrict access to abortion services in Texas.

**House Votes To Defund Planned Parenthood In 'Big Beautiful Bill'**
The House of Representatives passed the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act', a spending bill that significantly cuts federal funding to organizations responsible for abortions, including Planned Parenthood. The bill does not explicitly name Planned Parenthood, but prohibits any nonprofit organization that provides abortions and received over $1 million in taxpayer funding in 2024 from receiving Medicaid dollars. Planned Parenthood received nearly $800 million in taxpayer funds from 2023 to 2024 and performed over 402,000 abortions during that period. If the bill passes the Senate and is signed into law by President Donald Trump, up to half of Planned Parenthood facilities in pro-abortion states may be forced to close. Pro-life organizations celebrated the passage of the bill as a 'crucial win in the fight against abortion' and urged the Senate to pass the bill. 'More than 400,000 babies a year, their mothers, and countless American taxpayers are depending on you,' said SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser.

**Bill to close abortion pill loophole advances in Texas House**
A bill to close the abortion pill loophole in Texas has advanced in the House after passing out of committee with an 8-5 vote. The bill, Senate Bill 2880, aims to crack down on the distribution of abortion-inducing drugs, including through the mail, and allows for lawsuits against those who distribute them. The bill also expands the wrongful-death statute and gives people up to six years to file a lawsuit after an abortion takes place. Texas lawmakers are pushing for the bill's passage, with Rep. Mitch Little saying, 'We are in a war right now, and you need to understand we are running out of time. Senate Bill 2880 will make a difference in the lives of Texans. It will save the lives of babies.' The bill's passage comes as Texans have turned to out-of-state doctors and other avenues to get abortion-inducing drugs in the wake of the state's abortion ban.

**US Strengthens Measures Against 'Birth Tourism' at Mexico Border**
The US has strengthened measures against 'birth tourism' at the border with Mexico. Pregnant women are rethinking their plans to give birth in the US, Ciudad Juárez, and are modifying their decisions to avoid giving birth in the US. According to EFE, 'It is very difficult for a law to completely stop this practice, but it is a step in the right direction.' The new measures aim to reduce the flow of migrant women giving birth in the US, which has been seen as a way to obtain US citizenship for their children. The number of women giving birth in the US has decreased, and clinics and hospitals in Ciudad Juárez are now attending to a higher number of births. This is a new phase in the restriction of migration policies.

**Abortion providers' lawsuit seeks to strike more than a dozen AZ laws 'once and for all'**
Abortion providers and their advocates have filed a lawsuit to block Arizona laws they say restrict access to health care and are unconstitutional under a voter-approved amendment passed in 2024. The lawsuit challenges more than a dozen laws and regulations, including those requiring two in-person doctor visits, a 24-hour waiting period, and banning telemedicine abortions. Abortion providers argue that these laws create unnecessary and burdensome restrictions that do not pass muster under the amendment, which created a right to an abortion in the Arizona Constitution. 'Arizonans were clear when they voted to protect their right to abortion, and this lawsuit is honoring the will of those voters and looking to strike down these restrictions once and for all,' said Gail Deady, senior attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights. The lawsuit seeks a permanent prohibition on enforcement of the laws and a declaration that they are unconstitutional under the amendment.

**Chilean Police Detain Man for Selling Illegal Abortion Pills**
The Chilean police, PDI, detained a 34-year-old man for selling illegal abortion pills, Misotrol or Misoprostol, through a website and social media. The pills, valued at 12 million pesos, were smuggled from Peru and sold for between 70,000 to 160,000 pesos. According to the PDI, the man had been distributing the pills to buyers across the country through mail and in person. 'We identified a man who was selling these pills without a medical prescription or health authorization, for the purpose of inducing an abortion,' said sub-inspector Ana María Álvarez. 'He was acquiring these pills by smuggling them from Peru and selling them in Chile through the internet and social media, then distributing them by mail to the entire country and also in person.' The police found over 950 doses of the pills in the man's possession and his home, as well as 5 cannabis plants and cannabis in bulk. The man has a police record and was taken into custody to face charges for this flagrant crime against public health.

**The right’s new playbook to restrict access to abortion pills**
A new report by the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) claims that serious complications from abortion pills are much higher than previously known, citing insurance claims data from 2017 to 2023. However, experts say the evidence for the safety of medication abortion is 'so robust' and that one report will not change the entire body of evidence. The report is part of a coordinated effort by anti-abortion advocates to restrict access to abortion pills, which has been a common method of abortion in the US. If the FDA restricts access, several levels of regulation could be reimposed, affecting not just states with abortion bans but also those where abortion remains legal. The FDA has not yet responded to the report, and it is unclear how President Trump will act. Some advocates are skeptical that Trump will dedicate his political capital to restricting access to mifepristone, and manufacturers can sue the FDA if it tries to roll back access to approved drugs.

**The right's new playbook to restrict access to abortion pills**
Republican Sen. Josh Hawley introduced a bill to reimpose restrictions on mifepristone, citing a report claiming it causes high rates of health complications, which contradicts decades of rigorous drug safety testing. This comes as a New York abortion provider faces a first-of-its-kind criminal charge for prescribing abortion pills to a pregnant minor in Louisiana. The FDA approved mifepristone 25 years ago, and it's used in two-thirds of abortions in America. Reinstating federal restrictions could effectively end telemedicine abortion access, which thousands rely on each month. Anti-abortion leaders have stated that this is just a 'first step' towards banning the drug entirely.

**Sen. Josh Hawley Introduces Severe Restrictions on Abortion Pills, Citing New Junk Science Report**
Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a bill to restrict the abortion pill mifepristone, citing a biased report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center that claims medication abortion is unsafe. The bill would require in-person visits for doctors to prescribe the medication, ban telemedicine access, and restrict use past seven weeks. Hawley said, 'The data shows 1 in 10 women who take mifepristone experience adverse health effects, like going to the ER or suffering from sepsis.' However, experts have criticized the report, calling it 'junk science' and 'patently propagandistic.' Anti-abortion leaders are using the report as a new strategy to ban medication abortion, which accounts for 20% of all abortions in the U.S. and has been crucial for people in abortion-banned states to get care.

**Trump administration asks judge to toss suit restricting abortion medication access**
The Trump administration has asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit from three Republican-led states (Idaho, Kansas, and Missouri) seeking to restrict access to the abortion medication mifepristone. The government argues that the states don't have the legal right to sue, and that the case should be dismissed or transferred to a different venue. The lawsuit aims to prohibit telehealth prescriptions for mifepristone, require three in-office visits, and restrict the point in a pregnancy when it can be used. The case is being considered in Texas by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump nominee who has previously ruled in favor of halting approval for the drug. The Department of Justice attorneys also argue that the states are challenging actions the FDA took in 2016, which is beyond the six-year time limit to sue. Abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy in Idaho, while it is generally legal up to 22 weeks in Kansas. Trump has stated that he would not restrict access to abortion medication, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed his opposition to abortion, calling it a 'tragedy'.

**Trump Administration Seeks to Dismiss Lawsuit Limiting Access to Abortion Pill**
The Trump administration has requested a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by three Republican-led states (Idaho, Kansas, Missouri) aimed at limiting access to the abortion pill 'Mifepristone' through telemedicine services. The Department of Justice has not taken a direct stance on the issue, but stated that the states lack the legal authority to bring the lawsuit. The three states have asked the FDA to reverse current guidelines allowing 'Mifepristone' to be prescribed remotely, and to only allow it after three in-person visits to a clinic, in addition to reducing the time frame for using the medication during pregnancy. Idaho has a complete ban on abortion, while some clinics in Missouri have recently resumed providing abortion services after voters approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing reproductive health rights. In Kansas, abortion is allowed until the 22nd week of pregnancy, despite age restrictions, after voters rejected a ballot initiative to restrict abortion in 2022. Despite the states' stance, Trump stated in a December interview with Time magazine that he does not intend to impose restrictions on access to abortion pills, and reiterated during his presidential campaign that abortion should be left to state decisions, citing his appointment of Supreme Court justices who were part of the majority that overturned the national right to abortion in 2022.

**Trump to continue Biden's court defense of abortion drug mifepristone**
The Trump administration has continued to defend the U.S. rules easing access to the abortion drug mifepristone in a Texas federal court, despite a lawsuit filed by three Republican-led states. The U.S. Department of Justice has urged a judge to dismiss the lawsuit on procedural grounds, arguing that the states lack standing to sue because they are not being harmed by the challenged regulations. The states, Missouri, Kansas, and Idaho, claim that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration acted improperly when it eased restrictions on mifepristone, including allowing it to be prescribed by telemedicine and dispensed by mail. Trump previously stated that he did not plan to ban or restrict access to mifepristone, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that Trump has asked for a study on the safety of abortion pills. The Justice Department has repeated their arguments that Texas is not the proper venue for the lawsuit, and that the states lack standing to sue. 'Regardless of the merits of the States' claims, the States cannot proceed in this Court,' they wrote. The lawsuit has been ongoing for nearly two years, with the original plaintiffs initially seeking to reverse FDA approval of mifepristone, but that aspect was rebuffed by a lower court.

**Debate over abortion pill resurfaces**
The safety of the abortion pill, mifepristone, is being questioned by some as the new Republican administration in Washington considers restrictions. Dr. Marty Makary, the newly confirmed head of the FDA, has not committed to specific action on the pill. Medical professionals call it 'among the safest medications' ever approved by the FDA, with a 97.4% success rate in ending early pregnancies. However, a Christian conservative group claims it has caused 'tens of thousands' of 'emergency complications.' OB-GYNs say a tiny fraction of patients suffer 'major' or 'serious' adverse events after taking mifepristone, with less than 0.32% of patients experiencing significant infection, excessive blood loss, or hospitalization. The FDA has eased restrictions on the pill over time, and it can now be prescribed online and sent through the mail. 'When used in medication abortion, major adverse events -- significant infection, excessive blood loss, or hospitalization -- occur in less than 0.32% of patients,' said Ushma Upadhyay, one of the authors of a 2015 study. 'Any time a procedural abortion is done, the clinicians ensure that it was a complete abortion' by examining the tissue that is removed or performing an ultrasound during or after the procedure, said Dr. Pratima Gupta, a board member for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

**The Next Round of the Abortion Wars Is Just Beginning**
The abortion battle is escalating as conservative states try to restrict access to medication abortions. In 2024, Louisiana passed a law regulating misoprostol and mifepristone, requiring women to obtain prescriptions and pharmacists to track who used the medications. This law has inspired other states to tighten abortion access. Medication abortions have become the frontline of the battle, with 63% of U.S. abortions now using this method. Women prefer medication abortions for their privacy, anonymity, and protection from protesters. However, conservatives are trying to choke off these options by persuading the FDA to reinstate a rule that only doctors can prescribe mifepristone, and by enforcing the Comstock Act to prohibit the mailing of abortion information. Red state attorneys general are also setting up attacks on blue-state abortion policies, with Texas suing a New York physician for providing abortion medications to a Texas woman. The effort to nationalize a ban on abortions has escalated into a war between the states, with abortion proponents fighting back against these new strategies.

**‘The Pill That Changes Everything’: The Ms. Q&A With Carrie N. Baker, Author of ‘Abortion Pills: U.S. History and Politics’**
Carrie N. Baker's book 'Abortion Pills: U.S. History and Politics' explores the history and politics of abortion pills in the US. The use of abortion pills has skyrocketed, accounting for 63% of all abortions performed in medical settings. The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000, but with many restrictions, including requiring certified physicians to prescribe and administer it. In 2016, the FDA removed many of these restrictions, and in 2019, a generic mifepristone product was approved. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the growth of telehealth abortion, with the FDA lifting restrictions on in-person dispensing in 2020. Today, Massachusetts has 16 telehealth abortion providers, and an estimated 10,000 pills are being mailed into states with abortion bans each month. Advocates have developed community networks to share free abortion pills with people living in states with restrictions, and services selling abortion pills online are also available. Opponents are now focused on rolling back telehealth abortion or reversing FDA approval of mifepristone, but research shows that abortion pills are as safe as Tylenol and easy to use.
