**Gas Prices Hit Multi-Year Low Under Trump, GasBuddy Predicts It Will Be Like 2003 All Over Again**
GasBuddy predicts that gas prices will hit a multi-year low of $3.08 per gallon on Memorial Day, the cheapest since 2021. Adjusted for inflation, this would be the best price since 2003. The US Energy Information Administration shows a clear upward trend in gas prices adjusted for inflation since the Biden administration. GasBuddy attributes the recovery to President Trump's 'Unleashing American Energy' executive order, which revoked several executive orders from the Biden administration that hindered oil and gas production. The American Energy Alliance lists 100 ways in which the Biden administration made it harder to produce oil and gas, including canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline and suspending new oil and gas leases on public land. Trump supporters cited the economy as the leading issue in the 2024 election, with many feeling that Biden's policies were causing their money to disappear.

**Tariffs Haven't Yet Triggered Inflation, and Economists Are at Odds as to What's Next**
Despite predictions that President Trump's tariffs would lead to inflation, the latest data shows that price increases are still under control. The US inflation rate fell to 2.6% in April, the lowest since February 2021. Some analysts believe that this may be a calm before the storm, as supply chain disruptions will take time to affect inventory and ultimately lead to shortages and price increases. However, others argue that the tariffs' impact on inflation is limited or will be offset by other factors. A study by Yale Budget Lab estimated that the tariffs would lead to a 2.3% increase in prices nationwide, equivalent to a $3,800 loss in purchasing power per household. Harvard Business School professor Willy Shih noted that the current supply chain situation is similar to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, with a significant increase in cancelled flights and trade disruptions. He warned that the true impact of these disruptions will not be felt until later. Despite this, Trump has negotiated a temporary reduction in tariffs with China, and some economists believe that other factors will mitigate the impact of the tariffs on inflation. Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates predicted that inflation will rise in the near future, but will remain below 4% in the long term. He noted that the US is a relatively closed economy, with a significant portion of goods and services produced domestically. According to a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, imports account for only 14% of US GDP in 2024. The report also noted that even imported goods have a significant amount of domestic value added, with an average of 70% of the retail price coming from domestic sources. As a result, the impact of tariffs on investment goods will be much greater than on consumer goods, with a predicted price increase of 9.5% compared to 2.2% for consumer goods. The Federal Reserve is currently taking a wait-and-see approach to whether to adjust interest rates in response to the uncertain inflation outlook. Long-term inflation expectations remain stable, with most economists predicting a return to the 2% target in 2025.

**Breakfast briefing: Risk premiums keep on rising**
The global expansion is slowing down, with economic activity rising by just +0.1% in the first quarter of 2025, down from +0.5% in the previous quarter. The US and Japan were the main drags in their data. In the US, initial jobless claims eased lower marginally, but existing home sales fell -0.5% in April 2025, to their lowest in seven months. The US PMI survey reported output growth improved in May, but prices spiked higher from tariff impacts. The Kansas City Fed factory survey for May slipped more negative again, even if hopes for the future remain positive. The US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) revealed rising risk premiums investors are demanding, even as background inflation rises. In Canada, producer prices slipped in April to be just +2.0% higher than a year ago, due to cheaper input costs from the falling US dollar. In Japan, machinery orders rose by +8.4% in March, but export order contributions were weak. In China, local authorities are using bond funds to buy back unused land from struggling developers. In Singapore, officials downgraded their full 2025 expectations, saying they will be lucky to get +2.0% growth this full calendar year. The Indian PMI for May stayed little-changed with a robust expansion, but they too are now noting rising price pressures. The flash Australia PMIs for May reported a growth stall, for both their factory sector and their services sector. Global container freight rates stayed low last week, up +2% from the prior week to be -28% lower than year-ago levels. The UST 10yr yield is now at 4.55%, and down -5 bps from this time yesterday. Wall Street is having a small bounceback, with the S&P500 up +0.5% in Thursday trade.

**Mexico's Inflation Rate Rises to 4.22% in May 2025**
According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), Mexico's inflation rate rose to 4.22% in the first half of May 2025, surpassing the Bank of Mexico's target range of 3% with a ±1% margin. The increase in prices has been driven by the rise in high-consumption products, affecting the purchasing power of millions of Mexican families. The main contributors to the inflation are: papaya (+16.25%), cinema tickets (+14.82%), chicken (+8.96%), and tomatoes (+4.37%). Experts warn that if this trend continues, the Bank of Mexico may maintain high interest rates for a longer period, affecting credit and investment. The inflation has a direct impact on consumers, as it reduces the purchasing power of salaries and increases the cost of basic necessities, such as food. Analysts predict that the inflation will continue to show fluctuations in the coming months, influenced by seasonal, climatic, and logistical factors, as well as the uncertainty of the upcoming elections in Mexico and the United States.

**Americans aren't buying Trump's economic agenda. The numbers prove it.**
President Donald Trump claims the economy is strong and inflation is not a worry, but the numbers tell a different story. Gas prices are 8 cents higher per gallon since he took office, grocery prices are higher, and inflation is at 2.3% with prices rising faster in April than in March. Consumer spending patterns are moderating, and real-time data shows a 2% decline in domestic air travel this month. Broader measures of consumer sentiment are also souring, with the University of Michigan's benchmark survey falling to its second-lowest reading on record. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecasting tool suggests a current-quarter advance of 2.4%, but a surprise first-quarter economic contraction is expected. The housing market is also slowing, with existing home sales slumping to the slowest pace since 2009. Trump's 'one big, beautiful' tax-and-spending bill has been approved by the House, but a larger challenge looms in convincing Americans that the economy is strong.

New home sales in the US rose to an annualized rate of 743,000 in April, the highest level since mid-2022. However, housing starts remained weak, and new building consents are declining. China's central bank injected ¥500 bln of new liquidity into financial institutions, but net foreign direct investment fell in April. Japanese inflation held high at 3.6% in April, while Singapore's April CPI inflation was very low at 0.9%. Taiwanese retail sales growth was weak again in April, but industrial production rose sharply by 22%. The UST 10yr yield is now at 4.52%, and the Australian 10 year bond yield starts today at 4.39%. Wall Street ended its week lower, with the S&P500 down -0.7% in Friday trade. The Fear & Greed index is still in the 'greed' zone, unchanged from a week ago.

**Turkey's Central Bank Maintains Tight Monetary Policy Stance to Combat Inflation**
Turkey's Central Bank (TCMB) President Fatih Karahan announced that the inflation rate for the end of 2025 is expected to be 24%, the same as the previous report period. He also stated that the inflation rate for the end of 2026 is expected to be 12%, and that the inflation rate will decrease to 8% in 2027 and then stabilize at 5% in the medium term. Karahan emphasized that they have taken into account the increasing uncertainty in recent times and have adjusted their predictions accordingly. He also stated that they will continue to maintain a tight monetary policy stance until a clear and lasting improvement in the inflation outlook is achieved. Karahan noted that the recent decrease in global trade protectionism has reduced the risk of a downward trend in global growth, but that they have still adjusted their external demand assumptions downward. He also stated that they have adjusted their assumptions for crude oil and import prices downward for 2025 and 2026, but have increased their assumptions for food prices due to the increase in unprocessed food inflation in 2025. Karahan emphasized that they will continue to monitor all developments and factors that may affect the inflation outlook and will take necessary measures to prevent a significant deterioration in the inflation outlook. He also stated that they will maintain a cautious and tight monetary policy stance in the face of high uncertainty and will not compromise on their commitment to reducing inflation.

**April's CPI inflation ticks up with surge in food and drink prices, says Stats SA**
South Africa's Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rose by 0.3% in April 2025, driven by a 1.3% increase in food and non-alcoholic beverages (NAB) prices, the highest monthly rise since October 2023. The NAB category saw a 4.0% annual inflation rate, the highest since September 2024, mainly due to higher meat prices, which increased by 2.3% on average between March and April. Instant coffee prices rose by 20.2% in the 12 months to April, with the World Bank commodity index for coffee beans (robusta) increasing by 28.1% over the same period. Meanwhile, fuel prices declined by 3.2% between March and April, with motorists paying 13.4% less for fuel than a year ago.

**Primerica Household Budget Index™: Purchasing Power for Middle-I**
The Primerica Household Budget Index (HBI) report reveals that middle-income households experienced a 0.2% increase in purchasing power for necessities in March 2025, reaching 99.6%. This is a 1.3% rise compared to the previous year. The increase was due to a decrease in gas prices by 0.9% and auto insurance costs by 0.6%. However, higher expenses in food, utilities, and healthcare categories offset some of the gains. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) recorded a 2.4% increase in March, but the adjusted CPI, which focuses on essentials, showed a 2.9% increase over the past year. This translates to an estimated 3.0% inflation rate for middle-income households year-over-year.

**Articles with the Highest Price Increases in the US in the First Quarter of 2025**
According to the OECD, prices in the US have been rising for two years. Despite a 0.1% decrease in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in March, inflation remains higher than expected, causing families to pay high prices for certain products and services. The following are the articles that have increased in price the most in the first quarter of 2025: 'The index of food at home increased by 0.5% and the index of food outside of it increased by 0.4% in March.' (El Diario) The OECD notes that prices in the US have risen rapidly compared to other G7 countries, affecting American wallets. The imposition of tariffs by the Trump administration and supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters are contributing factors. 'The index of all articles rose 2.4% over the past 12 months, before seasonal adjustment.' (El Diario) However, the energy index fell 2.4% in March due to a 6.3% decrease in the gasoline index, which offset increases in electricity and natural gas indices.

**Gasoline Prices Expected to Rise by 7-8% in 2025, Analyst Predicts**
According to Igor Yushkov, a leading analyst at the National Energy Security Fund, gasoline prices in 2025 are expected to rise by 7-8%. Yushkov believes that inflation will inevitably affect fuel prices, and that the government will take measures to keep prices at gas stations under control. In 2024, gasoline prices did not match the inflation rate, but diesel prices were kept within those limits. Yushkov noted that the price difference between A-92 and A-95 gasoline has increased significantly, with A-95 now being 6-7 rubles more expensive per liter. It is unclear what tools the government will use to keep prices under control, but if inflation is kept within 9-10%, all types of fuel are expected to increase in price.

**US Inflation Rate Increases Less Than Expected in February 2025**
The inflation rate in the United States increased by 0.2% in February 2025, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS), which is lower than the expected 0.3% increase. The housing index contributed significantly to the increase, rising by 0.3%, but this was partially offset by a 4.0% decline in airfare prices and a 1.0% decrease in gasoline prices. Despite the decline in gasoline prices, the overall energy index rose by 0.2% due to increases in electricity and natural gas prices. On an annual basis, inflation increased by 2.8%, below the 3.0% recorded in the previous month and the 2.9% expected by analysts. The 'core' rate, which excludes volatile components such as food and energy, also increased by 0.2% monthly, below the expected 0.3% increase, after a 0.4% increase in the previous month. The annual growth rate of the core rate was 3.1%, a slight decline from the 3.2% expected and the 3.3% of January.

**Colombia's Inflation: How Will the Gas Price Increase Affect Various Regions?**
The Colombian National Administrative Department of Statistics (Dane) will release inflation data for February. Analysts expect inflation to continue its downward trend. The inflation rate is expected to be between 4.89% and 5.31%, with the highest optimism at 4.89%. The increase in gas prices in various regions of the country, which reached 36% in some cases, is a key factor in this release. The regions affected include the Bucaramanga metropolitan area, where prices increased by 20%. According to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, Gasoriente, the company that announced the adjustment, has 67.1% of gas natural users in Santander under its attention, with over 359,000 users. The department's affected municipalities are Bucaramanga, Floridablanca, Girón, Piedecuesta, Sabana de Torres Puerto Wilches, Lebrija, and Barrancabermeja. According to the Dane, Bucaramanga was the second city with the highest annual variation in gas prices (as of December 2024) with a 47.6% increase, only surpassed by Neiva with an 87.87% increase. The Banco de la República has projected that inflation will close at 4.1% in 2025, which is slightly above the estimated data. The convergence of inflation towards the target will face several obstacles, including global uncertainty due to the war of tariffs and local factors such as the increase in the minimum wage. 'These projections continue to face high uncertainty, mainly associated with the future behavior of the exchange rate, with possible increases in tariffs in global trade, with supply shocks that affect food prices, with adjustments in the prices of some regulated goods and services, and with the increase in the minimum wage for 2025, among others,' warned the entity in its monetary policy report.

**US Jan-25 inflation bounces to 3.0%, led by core inflation**
US inflation has risen to 3.0% in January 2025, driven by a spike in energy and core inflation. The increase in energy inflation was due to a sharp rise in gasoline prices, while core inflation was driven by rental costs, medical costs, and motor insurance. The Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut interest rates in response to the inflation, given the elevated inflation, trade war risks, and GDP growth above 2.5%. The CME Fedwatch probabilities suggest that there may be one more rate cut of 25 bps in 2025 and another 25 bps in 2026. The author of the article, a critic of Trump's economic policies, warns that the punitive tariff policies will have a negative impact on global demand and drive inflation higher.

**US Inflation Rises to 3% in January, Challenging Trump's Economic Promises**
The inflation rate in the United States rose to 3% in January 2025, according to official data from the Department of Labor. The increase was driven by the rising prices of essential goods such as eggs, whose price surged 15.2% compared to the previous month, while gasoline prices rose 1.1%. This price hike poses a challenging scenario for the government of Donald Trump, who returned to the White House promising to boost the economy and reduce costs for citizens. However, the increase in basic products generates concern among consumers and could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates, delaying possible reductions in the short term. 'The strong increase in egg prices, up 53% compared to the same period last year, is a key factor behind the inflationary trend,' said an expert. The shortage of supplies and problems in the production chain have contributed to this phenomenon, directly impacting the household budgets of American families. The trend of rising energy prices affects not only consumers but also the costs of production and transportation of essential goods. The inflation rate in the United States represents a challenge for the Trump administration, which has promised to strengthen the purchasing power of citizens and improve the competitiveness of the economy. The escalation of prices could affect consumption levels and slow down economic growth, forcing the White House to adopt new strategies to contain the impact on American wallets.

**US Inflation Unexpectedly Rises to 3% in January 2025**
The US inflation rate has unexpectedly risen to 3% in January 2025, up from 2.9% in December 2024, and above market expectations of 2.9%. Energy costs have increased by 1% on an annual basis, the first increase in six months, mainly due to a decrease in gasoline (-0.2% vs -3.4%), fuel oil (-5.3% vs -13.1%), and natural gas (4.9% vs 4.9%). Used car and truck prices have increased (1% vs -3.3%), transportation costs have increased (8% vs 7.3%), and new vehicle prices have decreased less (-0.3% vs -0.4%). On the other hand, food prices have stabilized (2.5% vs 2.5%) and housing costs have slowed (4.4% vs 4.6%). The IPC has increased by 0.5% on a monthly basis, exceeding the 0.4% of the previous month and market expectations of a slowdown to 0.3%. The housing index has increased by 0.4%, representing almost 30% of the increase. The core annual inflation rate has unexpectedly risen to 3.3%, up from market expectations of a slowdown to 3.1%, due to wage dynamics and the housing component. This makes it less likely for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates soon, which will have negative effects for Trump, as government bond yields have risen, as shown by the following graph of US 10-year bond yields. Trump has promised to lower inflation, but this is the latest data from the Biden administration, or rather, no administration. We will see the first, partial, effects of the new president in March. The fact that there are plans to cut hundreds of billions of dollars in spending suggests a possible reduction in this data.
