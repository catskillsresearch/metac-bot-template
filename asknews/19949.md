**UN Reports 160,000 New Displaced in Gaza, No Safe Place to Flee**
The United Nations reported that over 160,000 Palestinians were forced to flee their homes in Gaza last week, with no safe place to escape, amidst ongoing Israeli airstrikes on various areas. The UN stated that Israeli forces killed 629 Palestinians in one week, including 148 women and children, with more than half of the victims killed in their homes or tents, highlighting the danger faced by civilians even in displacement areas. The UN also noted that Israel appears to be intentionally targeting journalists, in an attempt to limit the flow of information from the Gaza Strip, with 9 journalists killed in one of the deadliest weeks for journalists since the war began on October 7, 2023. The displacement is a recurring humanitarian tragedy, with civilians facing difficult conditions due to deteriorating economic and health situations, while military operations continue in an area largely destroyed by Israel. Most families forced to flee have no choice but to seek shelter in schools converted into emergency centers, without any services, amidst a blockade that constitutes a horrific humanitarian catastrophe. Since the resumption of the genocide war on Gaza on March 18, over 140,000 people have fled, in addition to thousands who were relocated last week after Israeli occupation forces issued evacuation warnings. Israeli forces continue their genocide war on Gaza for the 592nd day, backed by American political and military support, amidst international silence and unprecedented abandonment by the international community.

**Over 161,000 Palestinians Forcibly Displaced in Gaza in Past Week**
According to a report by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), over 161,000 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced in Gaza over the past week. The report highlights the increasing Israeli occupation and forced displacement of Palestinians in the region. A map published in the report shows that 81% of Gaza's land is under Israeli occupation or subject to 'evacuation orders' that result in forced displacement. This means that a large portion of Gaza's population is being squeezed into a small area, approximately 19% of the land. Israeli forces have been expanding their ground attacks in Gaza since May 18, with the goal of making the occupation permanent. They also issue 'evacuation orders' almost daily, forcing Palestinians to flee their homes. The people of Gaza have been forcibly displaced multiple times since October 7, 2023, due to Israeli attacks. In a recent statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that they aim to fully occupy Gaza.

**Forced Displacement in Gaza: A Desperate Search for Safety**
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are experiencing a new wave of forced displacement due to the ongoing Israeli bombing and siege. The situation has worsened with the spread of famine and the lack of basic necessities such as food and water. Many families have been forced to flee their homes multiple times, with some reporting that they have been displaced 11 times. The United Nations has called for a ceasefire and the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, which is in dire need of it. The situation is described as 'mortal' and 'apocalyptic', with many families living in tents and struggling to access basic necessities. The article quotes a Palestinian man, Ghnam Ghnam, who says 'We are living like ghosts, without a home or a future. We are tired of being displaced and want the war to stop.' The article also mentions that the number of displaced people in Gaza has reached 270,000, with many more expected to flee in the coming days.

**Assange Draws Attention at Cannes Film Festival with Shirt Honoring Palestinian Children**
Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, drew attention at the Cannes Film Festival by wearing a shirt with the names of 4,986 Palestinian children killed in the Israeli bombing of Gaza. According to a statement by Assange's support committee on the X platform, he participated in the festival to showcase the documentary film 'The Man of Six Million Dollars'. The other side of the shirt reads 'Stop Israel'. The festival, in its 78th edition, started on May 13 and will continue until May 24. Medical sources told Al Arabiya and Al Hadath that the number of casualties in Gaza has risen to around 100 in the past 24 hours due to the intense Israeli airstrikes. As of Tuesday evening, at least 76 Palestinians have been killed, including 33 children and a woman, in a massacre that targeted the Abu Umasha family who were displaced from Beit Hanoun in the north of Gaza, as well as a shelter at a school in Gaza City. More than 14 Palestinians were killed in an airstrike that targeted the Abu Samra family's home in Deir al-Balah in the center of Gaza, including displaced people who had fled from the town of Al-Qarara in the north of Khan Yunis to their relatives' home. 10 others were killed in an airstrike that targeted the home of a detainee in the Jabalia refugee camp in the north of Gaza. This comes as Israel continues its military operations, including artillery shelling and airstrikes, in various areas of Gaza, causing widespread destruction and panic among the population. Since the start of the operation on Friday, at least 100 people have been killed daily in Gaza, according to media reports. The Israeli military campaign has caused widespread destruction and displacement in Gaza, with over 53,000 killed and nearly all 2.3 million residents of the territory displaced.

**Israel Prepares to Launch New Phase of 'Operation Guardian of the Walls' in Gaza**
According to Israeli media, Israel is preparing to launch a new phase of 'Operation Guardian of the Walls' in Gaza, which includes the introduction of thousands of additional soldiers into the territory. This move is part of a broader war effort that has been ongoing for 20 months. The Israeli military is reportedly planning to occupy new areas in Gaza, particularly in the north and center, as part of a ground maneuver. This development comes after Israel announced the start of a large-scale ground operation in several areas of Gaza four days ago. The operation aims to evacuate Palestinians from areas of conflict and occupy them. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has confirmed his intention to continue the war in Gaza, despite facing external pressure to allow humanitarian aid. The US has provided support for Israel's actions, which have resulted in the deaths of over 175,000 Palestinians, mostly children and women, and the displacement of over 11,000 people, as well as hundreds of thousands of refugees.

**Egypt's Sisi and UK's Sunak Discuss Gaza Situation and Ceasefire Efforts**
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi discussed the situation in Gaza with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, according to a statement from the Egyptian presidency. The two leaders discussed the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza since October 7, 2023, and efforts to stop the violence. Sisi emphasized that Egypt rejects the 'complete settlement of the Palestinian issue or the displacement of Palestinians from their land.' He also highlighted the importance of implementing the Arab-Islamic plan for the reconstruction of Gaza, which has been supported by the international community. Sunak expressed a positive stance towards the developments in the Palestinian issue and the situation in Gaza. The two leaders agreed to continue coordinating between their countries in light of regional and international developments. Egypt, Qatar, and the United States have been mediating efforts to stop the violence in Gaza since October 7, 2023, and have successfully brokered two ceasefires, one in December 2023 and another in January 2025. However, Israel has continued to commit war crimes in Gaza, killing over 175,000 Palestinians, including many children and women, and displacing over 11,000 people, in addition to hundreds of thousands of refugees. The British government has recently suspended trade talks with Israel and imposed sanctions on Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank.

**Repeated Exodus Towards the Unknown: Gaza Seeks Safety and Bread**
Thousands of families from the north are fleeing towards Gaza City, carrying with them unending pain and postponed dreams of returning to their destroyed homes or makeshift tents. The hardships faced by the displaced include food shortages, lack of shelter, and overcrowding in makeshift camps. 'Umm Muhammad', a mother of five, recounts her story with tears: 'The situation is dire, with a severe shortage of clean water, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks.' Many families are unable to bathe or meet their basic needs with dignity, exacerbating their physical and psychological suffering. Abu Karim says, 'I set up my tent in the Al-Saftawi area after fleeing from the Jabalia camp, but only hours later, Israeli forces issued new orders to evacuate the area.' In Gaza City, streets are now used as makeshift pathways for the displaced, with families spreading out on the ground and others seeking shelter under tattered fabric. Children are seen running barefoot between stopped cars, while dozens wait in long lines for water. Relief teams have reported heartbreaking scenes of malnourished children and mothers who can only offer their children water, if available. The lack of healthcare facilities has worsened the crisis, with a rise in skin infections and gastrointestinal diseases. According to official estimates, the recent intense attacks have led to the displacement of over 300,000 Palestinians from northern Gaza. These displaced individuals have left their homes and livelihoods behind, heading towards the already devastated Gaza City, which lacks the infrastructure to accommodate this massive number of refugees.

**Russia 'disappointed' by Israel's decision to step up military activity in Gaza Strip**
Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, expressed disappointment over Israel's decision to intensify military activity in the Gaza Strip, resulting in a significant increase in civilian casualties. According to Zakharova, approximately 300 people have been killed in attacks on social facilities and sites housing internally displaced persons over the past three days. Zakharova emphasized that the only path to normalizing the situation in Gaza is through a political and diplomatic framework, which requires a complete ceasefire and restoration of humanitarian aid. Russia is actively working towards achieving these goals in cooperation with international partners, including the UN. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of at least 53,573 Palestinians since October 2023, with 3,427 killed and 9,647 injured in the past month alone.

**Gaza: Over 97,000 People Forcibly Displaced in Past 4 Days**
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) shared a statement regarding the forced displacement of people in Gaza due to Israel's attacks and blockade. The statement read, 'In the past 4 days, over 97,000 people have been forcibly displaced in Gaza. Humanitarian aid should never be used to restrict people's movement.' The IOM emphasized the need for an immediate ceasefire, stating, 'We need full, safe, and sustainable access to work.' Since Israel's renewed attacks on Gaza on March 18, 3,340 Palestinians have been killed, and 9,357 injured. Since October 7, 2023, Israel's attacks on Gaza have resulted in the deaths of 53,475 Palestinians and injuries to 121,398. Israel's military has begun implementing a plan to expand and make its occupation of Gaza permanent, with plans to relocate Palestinians to 'collection camps' in southern Gaza. Israeli officials have announced that they will provide Palestinians with humanitarian aid in the camps, but will destroy all remaining infrastructure in Gaza and relocate Palestinians to other countries.

**420,000 Palestinians newly displaced in Gaza since Israel shattered ceasefire: UNRWA**
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported that 420,000 Palestinians have been newly displaced in Gaza since March 18, following Israeli violation of a ceasefire agreement. The agency warned that humanitarian aid and supplies have not entered the Gaza Strip since March 2, with the siege now lasting three times longer than the one enforced in October 2023. The agency estimated that nearly 420,000 people have been displaced, and resumed bombardments and aid restrictions are severely hampering humanitarian agencies' ability to respond to urgent needs, especially food, clean water, sanitation, shelter, and medical supplies. 'This is already three times longer than the one enforced in October 2023 when the war started,' the agency said. 'Humanitarian aid and supplies have not entered the Gaza Strip since 2 March 2025, when the Israeli Authorities imposed a siege.'

**500,000 Palestinians Displaced in Gaza Since Israel's Relaunched Offensive**
According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), approximately 500,000 Palestinians have been displaced in Gaza since Israel relaunched its offensive on March 18. The displacement is a result of Israel's renewed attacks on the Gaza Strip, which ended a ceasefire agreement with Hamas. 'The humanitarian situation in Gaza is catastrophic,' said the OCHA. Since October 2023, nearly 51,000 Palestinians have been killed in the enclave, with the majority being women and children. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Israel is also being pursued for genocide by the International Court of Justice due to its war against the Palestinian enclave.

**500,000 Palestinians Displaced in Gaza Since March 18**
According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), approximately 500,000 Palestinians have been displaced from their homes in the Gaza Strip since March 18, 2024, due to Israel's resumption of its genocidal campaign and its refusal to adhere to the 'ceasefire agreement'. The displacement has been ongoing, with over 110,000 people having fled the city of Rafah, which is threatened by a major Israeli military attack, to other areas in the besieged Palestinian territory. OCHA's head, Georgios Petropolous, stated, 'Around 30,000 people have been displaced from Rafah alone.' Additionally, the UN has reported that over 260,000 people have been displaced within Gaza since Saturday, as a result of the ongoing war between Hamas and Israel. The Israeli military has continued its intense airstrikes on Gaza, causing widespread destruction and displacement.

**UNRWA Reports 1.9 Million Palestinians Forced to Flee Gaza**
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) reported that approximately 1.9 million Palestinians have been forced to flee their homes in Gaza, with a new wave of displacement affecting over 142,000 people. This comes after Israel's recent military operation in Gaza, which began on March 18, 2024. UNRWA also stated that the ongoing Israeli military operation in the north of the West Bank has resulted in the 'largest wave of displacement since the 1967 war'. The agency emphasized that the Israeli military operation has led to 'systematic destruction and forced displacement of Palestinians, including orders to demolish homes that have affected Palestinian families and refugee camps.' UNRWA continues to work with its partners to provide emergency humanitarian aid and psychological and social support to displaced families in the West Bank. The agency also noted that its teams in the West Bank are providing essential services, including mobile health clinics and online learning services, but the situation remains 'extremely worrying'. Since the start of the current war on Gaza, Israel has escalated its attacks in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, resulting in the deaths of over 944 Palestinians, injuries to nearly 7,000, and the arrest of over 15,700, according to official Palestinian statistics. With US support, Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza since October 7, 2023, leaving over 165,000 Palestinian dead or injured, mostly children and women, and over 11,000 missing.

**Thousands of Palestinians Displaced in West Bank Due to Israeli Military Operations**
The United Nations and local authorities have reported that almost 5,500 Palestinian families have been displaced in the occupied West Bank since December due to Israeli military operations in two refugee camps. Jonathan Fowler, spokesperson for the UNRWA, stated that between 2,450 and 3,000 families were displaced from the Tulkarem refugee camp. Faisal Salama, director of the camp's committee, estimated that 80% of the 15,000 residents had to leave their homes. Fowler and Salama agreed that it is difficult to obtain precise numbers due to the security situation and population fluctuations in these settlements. Salama told AFP, 'The displaced people from the camp are scattered in the suburbs and the city of Tulkarem.' The 'Iron Wall' military operation launched by Israel on January 21 in Yenín, west of Tulkarem, also forced many people to leave their homes. Fowler reported that 3,000 families, representing around 15,000 people, fled the Yenín camp since December, initially escaping a Palestinian security operation against combatants and later due to the Israeli offensive. The displacement of the population has increased in recent days with the intensification of Israeli operations. Israeli media and the official Palestinian agency Wafa reported on Sunday that Israel destroyed 20 buildings, after placing explosives and detonating them. The refugee camps of Tulkarem and Yenín are known for being strongholds of Palestinian combatants. The Palestinian Ministry of Health reported that 70 people have died in the West Bank at the hands of Israel this year, 38 of them in Yenín. The army reported that it killed over 50 'terrorists' since January 14 in the West Bank. Israeli operations in the West Bank intensified after the ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas in the Gaza Strip took effect on January 19. Palestinian authorities report that almost 900 people have died in Israeli army operations or actions by settlers in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza on October 7, 2023. At least 32 Israelis, including several soldiers, have died in Palestinian attacks or during operations in the West Bank in the same period, according to official Israeli figures.

**UN agency concerned over displacement of 1.9M Palestinians, dire humanitarian situation in Gaza**
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) expressed concern over the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where at least 1.9 million people have been displaced due to Israel's 15-month genocidal war. Many have been forced to live in makeshift shelters, and most homes are either completely destroyed or uninhabitable. UNRWA emphasized that rebuilding infrastructure and lives, and addressing the trauma, will take years. The organization has been working to distribute food aid in northern Gaza, where people are in dire need of assistance. The first phase of a Gaza ceasefire agreement took effect on January 19, suspending Israel's war that has killed nearly 47,300 Palestinians and injured nearly 111,500 since October 7, 2023.
