**Elon Musk Resigns from US Government, Focusing on Business Ventures**
Elon Musk has announced his resignation from the US government, citing his desire to focus on his business ventures. Musk, who served as the head of the Efficiency Department for four months, saw his approval ratings plummet to historic lows. He stated, 'I will be doing much less in terms of politics going forward. I think I've done enough.' The decision comes as Musk's performance in the Efficiency Department was lackluster, with him claiming to have achieved only $160 billion in savings by 2025, a far cry from his initial promise of $20 trillion. Musk's company, Tesla, has also suffered due to his political stance, with many employees protesting by blocking factories and customers from the Democratic Party shunning the brand. However, Musk remains unfazed, saying, 'Yes, we may have lost some sales on the left, but we've gained some on the right. Our sales data is stable, and we don't see any issues with demand.' Despite this, Tesla's sales have declined by 20% in the previous quarter, with profits plummeting by over 70%. The company's board of directors has even considered finding a replacement for Musk. With his decision to step down, Musk plans to focus on his business ventures, including SpaceX, which aims to send humans to Mars by the end of 2026.

**Elon Musk Criticizes Donald Trump's Fiscal Plan: 'I Am Disappointed'**
Elon Musk expressed his disappointment with Donald Trump's fiscal plan in the US, saying, 'I am disappointed'. The new legislation was approved by a narrow margin in the House of Representatives, with 215 votes in favor and 214 against. However, it still needs to pass through the Senate, where there are also doubts. All Democrats and two Republicans, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio, voted against it. Even the chairman of the Liberty Caucus, Andy Harris, abstained with a 'present' vote. The plan aims to reduce government spending by approximately $1.5 billion, while extending tax cuts mainly for the wealthy and large corporations. However, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the reform will cause a $3.8 billion deficit increase by 2034, a fact that even some sectors of the officialdom acknowledge as inevitable. Musk, who has promised to focus on his businesses, especially Tesla, whose profitability fell in the first quarter of 2025, seems to still be committed to the legacy of his former office, created by himself when he took a central role in the administration. Through the DOGE, Musk promoted massive layoffs of public employees, closed federal agencies, and promoted the elimination of social programs, arguing against waste and abuse of state resources.

**Elon Musk Criticizes Trump's Budget Proposal**
Elon Musk expressed disappointment with President Trump's proposed budget, stating, 'I am disappointed to see a budget with enormous spending, which again increases the deficit. It undermines the work that Doge does.' Musk made these comments in an interview with CBS News, which will be aired on Sunday. The proposed budget includes an extension of the 2017 tax cuts, new temporary cuts, and tax exemptions for tips and interest on home loans. Additionally, it allocates more funds for border security and defense. The 'big, beautiful bill' is estimated to increase the federal debt by around $3.3 trillion over ten years. Musk's 'efficiency unit' Doge has been tasked by Trump to implement massive cuts in the government and grants. Moody's has downgraded the US credit rating due to the sustained increase in debt. Although the budget has been passed in the House of Representatives, it still needs to be approved by the Senate, which is expected to vote in June. However, it is uncertain whether the budget will pass, as several Republicans have expressed concerns about increased spending.

**Trump's Approval Rating Plummets to 42-43% Amid Economic Concerns and Internal Divisions**
President Trump's approval rating has dropped to 42-43% in most important polls, with a disapproval rate of 52-54%. According to Gallup, his average approval rating is 43%, slightly higher than his first term but lower than any other post-war president at this stage. The decline has been significant, with a 14-point drop in The Economist/YouGov's continuous polling since January. Reuters/Ipsos recorded the lowest approval rating of his second term so far, at 42%. The decline is consistent across all demographic groups, including Trump's 2024 voters, whose popularity has fallen from 91% to 85% in just two months. Trump's presidency is not only struggling with the economy, but also with its own internal divisions. He has made contradictory promises to different sectors of his coalition, including Arab-American voters and pro-Israel groups. His tariffs have hurt his own supporters, such as the oil and gas industry, and even Elon Musk has publicly mocked his trade advisor and posted videos against the tariffs. Trump's coalition is built on contradictions, and his presidency is now facing a universal reaction of discontent. Consumers are delaying purchases due to expected price increases, and even the president of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, has acknowledged that the speed and magnitude of this collapse are unprecedented. The leaders of major companies, such as Amazon, are also concerned and are considering labeling their higher prices with a 'tariff surcharge'.

**Elon Musk distances himself from Donald Trump and US government**
Elon Musk has distanced himself from Donald Trump and will no longer finance the US government, stating 'I've done enough'. This change in direction comes after a decline in his influence within Trump's inner circle, who announced internally that he will leave his role in the White House as leader of the massive cuts in the administration. According to the Wall Street Journal, Musk said, 'I think I've done enough'. This statement coincides with the failure of his campaign to support conservative judge Brad Schimel in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election. Musk donated over $20 million to Schimel and even hosted a meeting in his favor, using a similar tactic to the one he used with Trump in 2024. The defeat of Schimel was seen by some experts as a confirmation of Musk's declining popularity since his alliance with Trump and his campaign of massive cuts in the administration. Musk has also lost positions within the presidential cabinet, where his controversial and problematic figure has generated clashes with the rest of the government team. Musk had previously announced that he would dedicate less time to the US government to focus on Tesla, his luxury electric car company. Despite Tesla's poor performance, Musk has downplayed the decline in car sales. The company has suffered significant losses since its owner became more active in politics. Tesla's stock price fell by 45% this year before recovering.

**Tired of political attacks, Musk turns back to Mars and autonomous cars**
Elon Musk has announced that he is pulling back from politics, citing the personal costs and difficulties in producing results. He has become disillusioned with the impact his money can have in the political system and would rather spend his time and fortune elsewhere. Musk's attention is now needed back at Tesla and SpaceX, where he serves as CEO. Tesla is preparing to launch a fully autonomous car in June, and SpaceX is expected to launch its next-generation Starship rocket next week. Musk's goal is to send an unmanned fleet to Mars in 2026, a crucial step in attaining his decades-long goal of putting humans on the Red Planet. His pullback from politics could be a significant loss for the Republican Party, which had relied on his ground game efforts in the past.

The decline is even more dramatic among Democrats, with Musk's rating falling from plus-35 points to minus-91 points. This shift has led to Musk being referred to as 'political kryptonite'.

**Elon Musk's Popularity Plummets Among Americans**
Elon Musk's popularity has plummeted among Americans, with a recent survey by Silver Bulletin showing that only 39% of voters have a favorable view of him, a drop of over 20 points from April 2024. According to the publication, directed by Nate Silver, Musk's numbers have inverted as he has increased his support for President Trump, especially since becoming a 'special employee of the government' and de facto director of the Office of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Silver notes, 'Elon Musk was once quite popular. But his numbers have turned as he has increased his support for President Trump.' Musk's recent actions, including massive budget cuts as leader of DOGE, have damaged his reputation and led to a decline in his popularity.

**People are turning on Elon Musk**
According to the latest polling average from Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin, Elon Musk's popularity with the American public is waning. The billionaire CEO's unfavorable rating has increased to 53.5%, while only 39.6% of Americans see him favorably. This shift in public opinion is attributed to his heavy support for Donald Trump's second Presidential campaign and his work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has led to widespread federal agency layoffs and access to sensitive government areas. Silver writes that his process for tracking Musk's ratings is similar to how he tracks President Trump's, but with 'slightly more conservative settings as Musk is polled less often than Trump.' The growing distaste for Musk has already had electoral consequences, as his attempt to bolster a conservative Supreme Court candidate in Wisconsin backfired, with more than half of voters disapproving of his involvement.

**Elon Musk acknowledges the toll DOGE is taking on him**
Elon Musk has acknowledged the toll his work as the head of Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has taken on him. Musk, who has a net favorability rating of -13.8 percent, said he has 'at times' been 'digging my own grave way better than my enemies do' due to the 'political propaganda war' waged against him. Musk's poor approval ratings began after he endorsed Trump in July 2024 and has continued to decline since Trump became president and established DOGE. Demonstrations against Musk and Tesla have ramped up after the billionaire began firing thousands of federal workers, including veterans, via DOGE. Musk is now stepping down from DOGE amid controversy, with Trump purchasing a Tesla and labeling anyone enacting violence against Teslas and dealerships as 'domestic terrorists'.

**Elon Musk's approval rating goes off a cliff**
Elon Musk's approval rating has plummeted to a record low of -19, according to a recent poll. This is a significant drop from his previous net favorability of +24. The author of the Palmer Report attributes this decline to Musk's actions, including firing thousands of employees and being 'arrogant and grossly negligent' in his handling of various issues. The author suggests that the American people are seeing through Musk's tactics and recognizing that he is working against their interests. Musk's company, Tesla, has also suffered significant losses, with the author stating that this is a result of Musk's own actions.

**'He used to be beloved!' CNN analyst stunned by new data on Elon Musk**
CNN political analyst Harry Enten stated that Elon Musk's public image has significantly deteriorated due to his association with President Donald Trump and his actions against federal programs. According to Enten, Musk's net favorable rating has dropped from +24 to -19 overall from 2017 to 2025, with a particularly significant decline among Democrats, from +35 to -91. This shift in perception has led to a decline in Tesla's core business performance, including a 5% drop in new car registrations in the United States in 2024 compared to 2023, and an 11% drop in the new year. Enten attributed this decline to Musk's loss of popularity among Democrats and independents, as well as his failure to gain traction among Republicans, who have seen his net favorable rating increase from +18 to +51.

**Signs pointing to Trump-Elon Musk breakup?**
Protests against Elon Musk are gaining momentum across the US, with many targeting him rather than Donald Trump. Musk's popularity has been declining since inauguration, with his net favorability rating dropping to -13 points, according to CNN polling chief Harry Enten. This is a significant decline from his pre-2016 election rating of +29 points. Musk's actions, including hiring hackers, demanding prison sentences for media companies, and suggesting cuts to Social Security and Medicare, have been widely criticized. Democratic strategist James Carville believes that the organic protests will ultimately sink Musk and Trump, and predicts that a gubernatorial election in Virginia later this year will send a strong message. The betting markets are also down on Musk, predicting that he will not be able to cut the deficit or reduce government jobs. Trump may eventually cut ties with Musk, blaming him for his own declining polling numbers.

**Elon Musk gets bad omen on his future with Trump**
Elon Musk's relationship with Donald Trump is facing a potential challenge. Despite Trump giving Musk access to government files, Musk's net favorability rating has dropped to -13 points, down from -3 points before the election and +29 points before the 2016 election, according to CNN data guru Harry Enten. A Wall Street Journal poll found that 60% of respondents thought it was a bad idea for a president to rely on billionaires for policy advice. The betting markets are also predicting a 71% chance of Musk being out as the head of DOGE before July, according to Polymarket. Trump has not wavered in his support for Musk, but it remains to be seen how he will handle the situation.
