**Iran Launches Rocket Attack on US Military Bases in Qatar and Iraq**
Iran launched a rocket attack on US military bases in Qatar and Iraq on June 23, 2025. The attack came after the US struck Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran is a country in southwestern Asia with a population of 83 million people. It shares a border with Iraq to the west and is separated from Qatar by the Persian Gulf, which is approximately 190 kilometers wide. The US has a major military base in Qatar, Al-Udeid, which is also home to a small contingent of British Royal Air Force personnel. Iraq has a population of over 45 million people and shares a border with Iran to the west. The US has a military base in Iraq, Ain al-Asad, which was activated its air defense system after the rocket attack. The distance from the base to the Iranian border is over 160 kilometers. 'The attack on US military bases in Qatar and Iraq is a clear indication of the escalating tensions in the region,' said a spokesperson for the US military. 'We will continue to take necessary measures to protect our personnel and interests in the region.'

**US Escalates War of Aggression in Middle East, Targeting Iran's Nuclear Sites**
The US, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, has escalated the war of aggression in the Middle East, attacking three peaceful nuclear sites in Iran. This move is seen as a repeat of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, where the US claimed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven to be false. The US and its proxy in the Middle East, Israel, are nuclear powers that have attacked a sovereign country, giving Iran the right to legitimate defense. The operation is a military-ideological-propagandistic one, with Trump and Netanyahu using the excuse of Iran's nuclear program to justify the attack. The US has been planning to attack and destroy the governments of seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran, as revealed by former NATO commander General Wesley Clark. The negotiations proposed by Trump to Iran were a trap and a diplomatic deception to allow Israel to attack. The US has committed perfidy by appealing to the good faith of the adversary with the intention of betraying it, a practice considered prohibited by international customary law and constituting a grave war crime in international armed conflicts. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports have not provided evidence. The bombing of Iranian nuclear centrifuges by the US (and Israel) is a pretext, and the real objective is to consolidate Israel's dominance as an enclave of Western imperialism in the Middle East, a plan that is part of the US strategy to maintain its global hegemony against China. The attack is also seen as an attempt to disrupt China's growing influence in the region, particularly with the arrival of the first Chinese train to a logistics center in Iran, which is a key achievement in the competition for strategic multimodal corridors with the US and Europe.

**Iran: A New Iraq in the Making?**
The early morning of June 21, 2025 marked a new chapter in the already tumultuous history of the Middle East: the United States launched an aerial attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, claiming to prevent the regime in Tehran from acquiring atomic weapons. The precise but strategically significant raid immediately evoked a difficult-to-ignore historical shadow: the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Then, as now, a unilateral American military action was justified by the threat of weapons of mass destruction. However, today's enemy is not a weakened and isolated regime, but a regional power with advanced military capabilities, a network of allies and militias on the ground, and a more disillusioned and nationalist public opinion. The question lingers in Western chancelleries and among analysts: are we witnessing the birth of a new Iraq, or something much more perilous? ' as one analyst noted, 'The consequences of this action are unpredictable and potentially catastrophic.'

**Iran's Possible Scenarios: A New Iraq?**
The US-led large-scale bombing of three strategic Iranian nuclear sites opens a potentially explosive scenario of uncertainty. This comes after 11 days of unprecedented attacks by Israel on key infrastructure of the Iranian atomic program. The crucial question now is how Tehran will respond. In the days leading up to this, Iran had warned the US, threatening a harsh retaliation if they intervened directly in the conflict. The first statements from the Guardians of the Revolution speak of an unprecedented reaction: 'Iran will resort to options that go beyond the predictions and calculations of the aggressors'.

**Iran's Smart Move Vs Tensions At US Bases In Middle East**
Iran's leader, Khamenei, may have outsmarted Trump by preparing for a US attack on its Fordow site. According to a Reuters report, Iran had already removed enriched uranium and cleared important areas before the strike, minimizing damage. Satellite images showed smoke and closed tunnels, but Iran claims its nuclear work will resume soon. This suggests that Iran was ready for the attack and acted quickly to save its equipment, putting it one step ahead of the Americans. The situation highlights the tense relationship between the US and Iran, with both sides making moves and trying to gain an advantage. Iran has warned that the US will face serious consequences, and every American base in the Middle East will be a target, further escalating tensions. 'Every American base in the Middle East will be a target,' Iran warned, putting Bahrain, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait under threat.

**Iran President issued chilling 'invasion' warning right before US airbase bombed in Qatar - The Mirror**
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian issued a chilling warning on X before a US airbase was bombed in Qatar, stating, 'We neither initiated the war nor seeking it. But we will not leave invasion to the great Iran without answer.' Iran launched missile attacks on US military bases in Qatar and Iraq, retaliating for the American bombing of its nuclear sites. The attacks came after Qatar closed its airspace as a precaution amid threats from Iran. The US had inserted itself into Israel's war against Iran by striking three Iranian nuclear sites, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict. Iran said the US had crossed 'a very big red line' with its risky gambit to strike the sites. The situation remains volatile, with Iran threatening to retaliate directly against American troops or interests in the Mideast.

**Iran-Backed Forces Prepare to Attack US Bases in Iraq and Syria**
Iran-backed forces are preparing to attack US military bases in Iraq and Syria, according to The New York Times, citing an American official. The official stated that the targets are located in Iraq and possibly in Syria. Iraqi authorities are 'making every effort' to stop the impending attacks, the source claims. The US State Department issued a 'global warning' to American citizens on June 22, urging them to exercise increased caution abroad after US strikes on Iranian nuclear targets. The US Department of Homeland Security also announced a 'heightened threat' in the country following the US strikes on Iran. 'Iran-backed forces are preparing to attack US military bases in Iraq and Syria,' said the source, 'Iraqi authorities are making every effort to stop the impending attacks.'

**US Issues Global Warning, Reduces Missions in Iraq and Lebanon**
The United States has issued a global warning to its citizens, both within and outside the country, and has decided to reduce its missions in Iraq and Lebanon, as a precaution against any retaliatory attacks following the strikes it launched against Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday. The warning, issued by the US State Department, stated: 'The conflict between Israel and Iran has led to disruptions in travel and the closure of airfields in the Middle East region. There is a possibility of protests against American citizens and interests abroad.' The department advised citizens to exercise 'increased caution.' Iran has threatened to launch retaliatory attacks on US bases in the Middle East. Ali Akbar Velayati, an advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, said that there is 'no place' for the US in the Middle East 'from now on,' adding that the US should 'wait for the consequences that cannot be rectified.' Velayati also warned that the US bases used to launch the strikes 'will be considered legitimate targets.' The US has begun evacuating its citizens and permanent residents from Israel. In this context, the US embassy in Iraq has reduced the number of its personnel, with some employees leaving on Saturday and Sunday. The US has also ordered non-essential families and employees of its embassy in Beirut to leave. The embassy said in a statement on its website: 'On June 22, 2025, the US Department of State ordered the departure of non-essential family members and US government employees not essential to official business from Lebanon due to the deteriorating security situation in the region.' The US has also advised its citizens not to travel to Lebanon. Domestically, the US Department of Homeland Security has warned of a 'heightened threat environment in the United States' following the US military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites during the night. The department issued a memo on Sunday through its National Counterterrorism Center, stating that the ongoing Iranian conflict is causing a heightened threat environment. The memo stated that it is likely that limited-scale cyber attacks will be carried out on US networks by 'Iranian-affiliated hackers,' and that Iranian government-affiliated cyber actors may also conduct cyber attacks. It also noted that 'it is likely that domestic extremists will become radicalized and engage in violence in response to the conflict if the Iranian leadership issues a fatwa calling for retaliatory violence against targets in the US.' The memo also mentioned that 'it is likely that individuals in the US will be inspired to carry out attacks in response to the conflict.' The US President, Donald Trump, announced on Saturday that he had 'wiped out' the main Iranian nuclear sites with massive bombs that penetrated the fortifications.

**2003 vs 2025: Why Americans Aren't Rallying Behind War Against Iran**
The US invasion of Iraq in 2003 was met with broad public support, but in 2025, US airstrikes on Iran's nuclear sites faced widespread opposition. According to a YouGov/Economist poll, 60% of Americans opposed military action against Iran before the strikes. A Washington Post survey found similar trends, with 45% opposing and only 25% supporting. Even Trump's traditionally loyal base is showing signs of fracture, with some questioning his 'America First' credentials and criticizing the lack of congressional approval. The scepticism crosses party lines, with Democrats, independents, and even some Republicans opposing the move. As one user wrote on X, 'Trump calls Iran the 'bully of the Middle East...' Israel has bombed 5 countries and invaded 3 in the past two years alone. But IRAN is the bully...This man is a pathetic fraud.' The contrast with 2003 could not be more stark, with more than two-thirds of Americans supporting military action in Iraq at the time.

**US attack on Iran 'outrageous,' Tehran says, vowing response**
The United States launched a military strike on three nuclear sites in Iran on Saturday, according to President Donald Trump. The strikes, which included B-2 bombers and Tomahawk cruise missiles, were met with concern from several countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq, and Oman. Saudi Arabia expressed 'great concern' and called for restraint, while Qatar warned of 'catastrophic consequences' if the situation escalates. Oman described the strikes as 'illegal aggression' and a 'serious violation of international law.' Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein stated that such actions could lead to 'widespread chaos and destabilize the entire region.' The international community is urging caution and calling for a return to diplomatic channels to resolve outstanding issues.

**US Enters War with Iran, Igniting Open-Ended Consequences**
The United States has entered the war with Iran, sparking open-ended consequences. Donald Trump, who had previously stated that he would decide 'in two weeks' whether to go to war, has crossed the line. The US operation has targeted three nuclear sites in Iran: Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordow. According to official statements, the US employed high-penetration bunker-busting bombs. However, there is no independent visual confirmation or satellite imagery from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the level of damage to Fordow. The risk of radioactive contamination is a concern if the attack compromised uranium reserves or confinement structures. French President Emmanuel Macron had spoken directly with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian hours before the attack, but the US operation has seemingly left the diplomatic channel in ruins. The European Union is expected to express publicly its concern over the escalation and the possible collapse of the nuclear agreement (JCPOA). A direct US entry into the conflict could bring new waves of migration, energy volatility, and increased militarization of the Strait of Hormuz. The consequences of this intervention are far-reaching, with possible scenarios including expanded Iranian attacks on US bases in Iraq or Syria, Hezbollah's involvement in Lebanon, and the closure of the Strait of Hormuz. Destoying Fordow may have temporarily disrupted Iran's operational capacity, but it will not stop its nuclear program. The Iranian program has been designed to be dispersed geographically and redundant, with scientists trained in different locations, material reserves, and designs. At a medium-term, the US attack could strengthen the Iranian regime's narrative among its population. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's call for the Iranian people to 'rise up' against their government seems naive in the face of nationalism that often arises from external aggression.

**Washington Post Warns of Regional Catastrophe if US Launches Attack on Iran**
The Washington Post has warned of an impending regional catastrophe if US President Donald Trump decides to launch a direct attack on Iran. According to the newspaper, Iran's potential response could turn all US military bases in the Middle East into 'burned earth' as described by the newspaper, due to Tehran's retaliatory strikes against the US. Iranian officials have recently expressed a clear readiness to respond strongly, with Defense Minister Esmail Ghaani warning that 'all US bases are within our reach and we will target them boldly' if the attack occurs. The newspaper also cited a statement by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on social media on Wednesday, saying that 'the damage that the US will suffer will certainly be irreparable if it enters this conflict militarily.' US troops are under threat of Iranian retaliation, with thousands of soldiers stationed in military bases across the region. The newspaper focused on the Ain al-Assad airbase in western Baghdad, which is the largest US base in Iraq and has been targeted by Iran and its proxies several times, including in January 2020, after the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, when Iran launched 16 missiles at US positions, with 11 of them hitting the Ain al-Assad base, resulting in injuries and massive damage. The newspaper also mentioned the US base in Arbil in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, which was targeted by Iranian-backed groups with missiles and drones in August. The newspaper considered the statement by the Trump administration this month to reduce the US military presence in Syria from eight bases to one, the Tafas base, located in a strategic location south of Syria near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders, to be unclear in its timing. The newspaper also mentioned the exposure of the 22nd tower, a US site in Jordan near Tafas, to a drone attack in January 2024, which resulted in the death of three US soldiers and the injury of dozens, in the worst attack since the fall of Kabul in 2021. Vital facilities in the Gulf region are on the line, including the largest US base in the region, the Al-Udeid airbase in Qatar, which has more than 10,000 US soldiers. The newspaper also mentioned the Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, with its headquarters in Manama, which has around 8,300 sailors, as well as the Al-Dhafra airbase in the UAE, which includes the headquarters of the US Air Force's 380th Air Expeditionary Wing. The newspaper also mentioned the Buriyang base and the Ali al-Salem airbase in Kuwait. The newspaper reported that Iranian officials informed Qatar this week that these bases would be 'legitimate targets' for any military retaliation if the US launches an attack on Iran, according to a European diplomat who spoke to the newspaper on condition of anonymity. US embassies and diplomatic missions in the region, particularly in Iraq and Israel, have become vulnerable, with the US withdrawing some of its personnel and family members from these locations. The newspaper quoted Abu Ali al-Askari, the security official of the Hezbollah Brigades in Iraq, saying that 'US bases in all parts of the region will become like hunting grounds' and that there will be 'unexpected surprises' for US aircraft. In response to these threats, the Pentagon has maintained its defensive posture, according to the newspaper, while Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has announced the deployment of additional capabilities in the region. The newspaper noted that US attacks may not be launched from bases in the region, but from distant bases, including the Whiteman airbase in Missouri, which launches B-2 stealth bombers capable of carrying bunker-busting bombs to target sites such as the Fordo nuclear facility in Iran. The newspaper also mentioned Diego Garcia Island in the Indian Ocean, which is a strategic launch point for US bombers. The newspaper reported that B-2 bombers have previously conducted direct missions to the Middle East from Missouri, refueling in the air during flights that take over 30 hours. The newspaper also mentioned that the US has sent 30 aircraft to refuel in Europe on Sunday, in preparation for a possible escalation, before citing the Pentagon's redeployment of the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier to the Middle East, to join the USS Carl Vinson, making it the second US aircraft carrier in the region.

**Iran-Iraq Escalation: A New Era of Regional and Global Tensions**
The Middle East is witnessing a heightened state of tension between Iran and Israel, one of the most intense phases of escalation in recent years. As the pace of attacks and counterattacks accelerates, new alliances are beginning to form, while other countries are taking unexpected military steps, such as Pakistan's announcement of closing its borders with Iran. Amidst these developments, concerns are growing about the region entering a vortex of military and political chaos. Israel launched a wide-scale aerial attack on sensitive Iranian targets, including military and nuclear facilities, on Friday morning. The attack was followed by a series of Iranian retaliatory missile strikes targeting Israeli military sites. US President Donald Trump warned Iran to stop its war against Israel, calling for the opening of negotiations over its nuclear program. Trump stated that Iran has already sent signals indicating its willingness to engage in dialogue, but emphasized the need for swift negotiations before it's too late. The US president also noted that 'the war is painful for both sides, but Iran will not win.' The fourth day of the escalation saw Iran intensify its missile strikes, targeting strategic sites deep within Israeli territory. North Korea announced its support for Iran in the face of Israeli aggression, stating its readiness to provide military and technical assistance. The country's strategic expert, Samir Faraj, explained that Iran has received complete support from North Korea, particularly in terms of its hypersonic missile system. Faraj noted that North Korea is not currently objecting to providing Iran with new missiles to replace those lost in recent days, indicating a clear desire to enhance Iran's military capabilities despite international sanctions and regional concerns. The expert also emphasized that Iran will not stop enriching uranium unless through a negotiating table, with several proposals on the table to resolve the crisis, including freezing enrichment at 60%, putting enriched uranium in Russia under international supervision, and enhancing the International Atomic Energy Agency's oversight. These scenarios remain dependent on the outcome of ongoing negotiations between Iran and the US, which aims to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for economic relief. Pakistan has emerged as a key supporter of Iran, with Faraj stating that Islamabad has provided military support to Iran, including alternative weapons used in recent confrontations. This development raises questions about the involvement of neighboring countries in the conflict and their adoption of positions that go beyond neutrality.

**Israel Launches Attacks on Tehran, Iran**
Israel's military has launched attacks on various targets in Tehran, including a petroleum refinery. This is the 5th day of Israel's attacks on Iran. An Israeli official stated, 'There are 48 critical hours left before the war with Iran begins.' Iran's media reported a large explosion in the Andarzgo region, north of the capital, and heavy smoke rising from the area. The Israeli military has targeted various points in Tehran, including the petroleum refinery. Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani stated, 'Iraq is in full solidarity with Iran; the attack must be stopped and the spread of war must be prevented.' Sudani also stated, 'Israel has committed crimes and massacres in the region since October 7, 2023, disregarding international and humanitarian law.' He called on the international community and the US to take responsibility and for negotiations to be held for a peaceful solution. Sudani added, 'We reject any violations of Iraq's sovereignty. These attacks are not only a threat to Iran's security and stability but also to Iraq's.'

**Fact Check: These four videos DON'T show Iran's strikes on Israel at all**
As the Israel-Iran conflict escalates, numerous videos have been shared on social media allegedly showing the conflict. However, fact-checking has revealed that four such videos are unrelated to the present conflict. A video claiming to show an Iranian missile attack on the Haifa oil refinery in Israel was actually footage of the Shahran Oil Depot in Tehran, Iran, which was targeted in an Israeli missile attack on June 15. Another video purporting to show a massive blast at Israel's Haifa port caused by an Iranian attack was actually a warehouse explosion in Tianjin, China, in August 2015. A third video showing a drone descending over a city, causing an explosion, was from a Russian kamikaze drone attack on Kyiv, Ukraine, in October 2022. A fourth video showing explosions in an urban area at night was actually footage of Baghdad being attacked by US-led coalition forces during the Iraq War in 2003. 'These videos do not depict the Iranian attack on Israel,' according to the article.

**Iraq Closes Airspace and Suspends Flights Amid Regional Escalation**
The Iraqi Ministry of Transportation announced the closure of the country's airspace and the suspension of all flights at Iraqi airports until further notice, as a precautionary measure amid regional escalation. The United States confirmed that it did not participate in the Israeli attack, but had previously informed them of their intention, and expressed concern over the escalation, urging all parties to exercise restraint. This escalation comes at a sensitive time, as Iran had recently announced the establishment of a third uranium enrichment site and the use of advanced centrifuges, increasing regional and international tensions. This attack is the latest in a series of escalations between Israel and Iran, following an Israeli attack on Iranian sites in October 2024, targeting Iranian missile facilities in response to previous Iranian rocket attacks. As the situation in the region remains tense, there is anticipation for potential responses from Iran and its allies, and the impact on regional and global security.

**The D Brief: Will Israel attack Iran?; CJCS sees no "invasion"; Budget testimony; AUKUS under review; And a bit more.**
The possibility of an Israeli attack on Iran is being considered, with diplomats and military officials expressing concerns. The US has authorized the evacuation of personnel in Iraq and the Pentagon has greenlit the departure of military family members across the Middle East. Iran's atomic-agency chief announced the country will accelerate its production of near-weapons-grade uranium and open a new enrichment site. Iran's Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh stated that if a conflict is imposed, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps will target all US bases in host countries. The US military is deploying 700 Marines to Los Angeles to protect immigration officials from protests, with some lawmakers disagreeing with the characterization of the situation as an 'invasion'. The Pentagon is proposing to halve its planned F-35 buy and boost funding for the sixth-gen F-47 fighter jet in its 2026 budget proposal. Defense Secretary Hegseth is testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, facing criticism over the flat Pentagon budget. The Pentagon may also push to scrap the AUKUS technology-sharing pact between the US, Australia, and the UK. DHS has been promoting social media posts that evoke WWII and the migrants-as-'invaders' theme, and is asking Americans to report on their neighbors.
