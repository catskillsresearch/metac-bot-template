**Belarus Discusses National Action Plan for Gender Equality by 2030**
The National Council on Gender Policy in Belarus discussed the National Action Plan for Gender Equality by 2030 in Minsk. The plan includes four directions: ensuring equal rights and opportunities for women and men, expanding education and employment opportunities, improving healthcare, and promoting equal rights and opportunities in society. The plan will be renamed to the National Action Plan for Implementing the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in Belarus by 2030. According to Minister of Labor and Social Protection Natalia Pavlyuchenko, the main indicator of women's position in the economy is the difference in salaries between men and women. In Belarus, the corrected gender gap (taking into account industry, education, and other factors) in 2024 was 6%, indicating minimal inequality.

**Chilean Government's Sports Promises: A Mixed Record**
Chilean President Gabriel Boric's government has made several promises in the field of sports, but many of them have not been fulfilled. One of the promises was to improve the conditions of women's football, which was achieved in 2022 with the passage of Law 21.436, requiring companies to hire at least 50% of their players as employees. However, the process has been slow, and the Ministry of Labor has issued numerous fines for non-compliance. Another promise was to create a social and community program to replace the 'Estadio Seguro' plan, but it was never implemented. The government also proposed a model of administration of professional football in Chile, but it was not implemented and instead supported a project to reform the Law of Societies, which aims to end conflicts of interest and separate the leagues from the federations. The government has also announced its candidacy for the 2036 Olympics and the 2030 Youth Olympics, and has formalized its postulation through the regular channels. Additionally, the government has proposed a project to promote physical activity in schools, which has been well received by the legislature and has been approved in the Senate. However, many of these promises have been delayed or have not been fulfilled, and the government's focus has shifted to organizing mega-events, such as the Panamerican Games and the World Cycling Championships. 'We have proven that our country has the conditions to organize and manage international events,' said President Boric. 'So, I announce that we will start the process to make Chile a candidate to host the Olympics 2036. It will not be easy to compete with the great powers of the north, but I invite you to dream big and to unite for this beautiful challenge of being, for the first time in our history, hosts of the Olympics,' he added.

**Labour's landslide victory: expert reaction**
Experts are urging the new Labour government to speed up the transition to net zero by implementing its green policies and tackling the plastic crisis. Christophe Williams, CEO of Naked Energy, called for an end to subsidies on fossil fuels, saying 'We have an opportunity to become world leaders in renewable energy, and it won’t require historical levels of funding.' Thomas Farquhar, co-founder of Heatio, said the UK has been 'dangerously reliant' on fossil fuels, leaving it vulnerable to price fluctuations. Sian Sutherland, co-founder of A Plastic Planet & Plastic Health Council, urged the government to implement lasting policies to tackle the plastic crisis, saying 'Clear and comprehensive policy that takes a long-term vision over short-term tokenism is the only vehicle to fight the impact of plastic on our bodies and planet.' The government has promised to double onshore wind, treble solar power, and quadruple offshore wind by 2030, and experts welcome the scale of ambition. However, they also emphasize the need for 'continuity and certainty' in policy and investment to support the transition to net zero.

**UK to Invest £3 Billion in Training Local Workers to Reduce Dependence on Migrants**
The UK government plans to invest £3 billion ($4.1 billion) to train 120,000 local builders, engineers, and caregivers to reduce dependence on foreign labor. This move aims to create 30,000 new job opportunities by the end of the parliamentary term. Additionally, 45,000 training places in key sectors will be funded through a 32% increase in the skills levy paid by companies for hiring foreign workers. Education Minister Bridget Phillipson stated, 'We take our responsibility to provide more employment opportunities seriously.' The UK faces a labor shortage in construction, particularly with the goal of building 1.5 million new homes by 2030. However, experts warn that even large-scale training programs may not quickly resolve the issue, as training professionals takes time, potentially leading to inflation and congestion in the sector.

**Half of Women in Tech Leave Industry Before 35, Catalan Government Launches Pact to Address Gap**
According to the latest Baròmetre DonaTIC report, 50% of women who start their careers in the technology sector as TIC specialists (those who actively develop or program) leave the industry before the age of 35, a much higher percentage than in other fields (20%). Accenture attributes this to the industry being more demanding or the 'bro-grammer culture' (toxic masculinity and machismo in the tech industry). The Catalan government and the Cercle Tecnològic see this as a sign that tech companies have a longer way to go to ensure a promising career path for these profiles. To address this, the government has announced a Pacto Nacional para el Talento Digital in Catalonia, aiming to reduce the gap between supply and demand of professional profiles, double the number of tech workers in the community by 2030, and have 50% of new hires be women. The initiative will focus on promoting scientific and technological vocations in school and implementing policies to attract, promote, retain, and retrain professionals. Maria Galindo, secretary of Polítiques Digitals, notes that 'it's evident that we need to join forces to make these increases more significant in the future.' Xavier Sellarès, director of the Cercle Tecnològic, adds that having a plan of equality is crucial, as it shows a company's commitment and has been proven to increase the insertion of female talent.

**Empowering Women: A Key Part of Egypt's Efforts to Increase Human Capital**
Egypt's Minister of Planning and Economic Development, Dr. Rania Al-Mashat, emphasized the importance of the 'Women Lead to Implementations' program, a training program offered by the National Academy for Training in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development and International Cooperation. The program aims to train women in executive positions in various institutions, aged between 22 and 50 years old. Dr. Al-Mashat stated that she notices a development in the level of participants in the program and a keenness from women to acquire skills that enable them to contribute to the advancement and progress of their country. She added that empowering women economically, socially, and politically is a key part of the country's efforts to increase investment in human capital, develop the skills of youth and girls, and enhance their ability to take on leadership roles. Dr. Al-Mashat also mentioned that the government has taken steps to enable women to occupy leadership positions that were previously inaccessible to them, as part of the National Strategy for Women's Empowerment 2030.

Dr. Rania Al-Mashat said, 'Empowering women economically, socially, and politically is a heavy burden on them, as they are required to prove their capabilities and qualifications to take on leadership positions. In addition, they have a big responsibility to encourage more women and girls to enter various fields of work, increasing the percentage of women's participation in the labor market.'

**Putting the brakes on the 2030 petrol ban is good for business, but not air quality**
The UK government has announced that the sale of new purely petrol or diesel cars will be banned from 2030, as promised in last year's Labour Party manifesto. However, the government has also decided to allow the continued sale of petrol-powered full hybrids beyond 2030, which has been met with criticism from Steve Fowler, who says that this move is 'the wrong move' and that the government has 'gone soft' by trying to please all car makers. Transport secretary Heidi Alexander has said, 'We will always back British business. In the face of global economic challenges and stifled by a lack of certainty and direction for too long, our automotive industry deserves clarity, ambition and leadership.' However, Fowler argues that this move will hinder the UK's goal of becoming a 'global automotive leader in the switch to EVs'.

**Labour Party Faces Energy Crisis Ahead of Elections**
The Labour Party in the UK is facing a political crisis due to rising energy bills, despite their promise to reduce them before the next election, according to Politico. The energy crisis in the UK is gaining momentum, causing concern within the government, Politico reports. Labour, which came to power promising to lower high energy bills, is now facing growing pressure from voters, the publication notes. Energy Minister Michael Shanks emphasized in parliament that the prime minister considers reducing bills to be 'critically important'. Experts point out that the rise in gas prices is the main cause of high bills, not Labour's climate policy, as their opponents claim. The party aims to reduce fossil fuel use to 2030, which should help lower energy costs, but this may not happen until the next election in 2029. The Conservative Party and Reform UK are intensifying their criticism of Labour, blaming their climate policy for high prices. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has already scrapped support for the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, claiming it will make families poorer. Labour is considering various measures to reduce bills, including possible redistribution of so-called 'green taxes'. However, this is fraught with political risks and may require tax increases. Other options include renegotiating renewable energy contracts and localizing electricity prices, but they require significant reforms. Earlier, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the European Commission plans to present a new energy plan, which would involve abandoning Russian gas and reducing energy prices in Europe; however, some European Union countries have refused to support the initiative to ban the import of Russian liquefied natural gas.

**Labour Hypocrisy Over Welfare Cuts as Starmer Braces for Backbench Rebellion**
Labour leader Starmer held a meeting with his MPs to address concerns over sweeping welfare cuts set for later this month. Around 80 MPs are opposed to the plans, with some threatening to revolt, saying they 'won't tolerate' billions in welfare cuts. Starmer warned that if action isn't taken, the cost of disability and sickness benefits will reach £70 billion by 2030. However, he reportedly dodged questions from four brave MPs who challenged him on the cuts. This comes as a surprise, given Labour's past criticism of the Tories for slashing welfare spending, which they branded as the 'nasty party'.

**Net Zero is hiking your bills - UK industry is being MASSACRED by Labour**
Reform UK is criticizing Labour's Net Zero policy, claiming it is deindustrializing Britain and leading to increased energy bills. The party argues that the policy has resulted in the closure of industries and job losses, with the UK becoming reliant on imports of goods manufactured abroad. Reform UK's leader says, 'We are quite simply living through an industrial massacre.' The party proposes scrapping the Net Zero targets and exploiting the UK's gas resources to create tens of thousands of jobs and make the country energy independent. According to Reform UK, the UK's household bills will rise by at least 18% by April, and up to one million British jobs in car manufacturing could disappear by 2030 if Net Zero targets are not changed.

**Five female SNP MSPs targeted by allies of 'hard man' Stephen Flynn to be replaced in 2026**
SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn has been accused of creating a 'hit list' of female MSPs he wants to replace with his allies. The list allegedly includes Karen Adam, Evelyn Tweed, Collette Stevenson, Jackie Dunbar, and Emma Roddick, who have been outspoken against Flynn's plans. According to the Scottish Sun, Flynn's allies are trying to install failed MPs in their seats instead. Scottish Tory Deputy Leader Rachael Hamilton said, 'It’s pretty telling that what looks like a hit list is comprised of women MSPs who he and his henchmen are trying to edge out, presumably to boost Flynn’s chances of becoming SNP leader. It’s not a good look.' Scottish Labour Deputy Leader Jackie Baillie urged Flynn to 'come clean' about the alleged plot. An SNP spokeswoman said, 'There is a high level of interest in representing the SNP at what will be a crucial Scottish Parliament election in 2026. We look forward to fielding a strong selection of candidates who are ready to stand up for their communities and move Scotland towards independence.'

**Labour's landslide victory: expert reaction**
Experts are urging the new Labour government to speed up the transition to net zero by implementing its green policies and tackling the plastic crisis. Christophe Williams, CEO of Naked Energy, called for an end to subsidies on fossil fuels, saying 'We have an opportunity to become world leaders in renewable energy, and it won’t require historical levels of funding.' Thomas Farquhar, co-founder of Heatio, said the UK has been 'dangerously reliant' on fossil fuels, leaving it vulnerable to price fluctuations. Sian Sutherland, co-founder of A Plastic Planet & Plastic Health Council, urged the government to implement lasting policies to tackle the plastic crisis, saying 'Clear and comprehensive policy that takes a long-term vision over short-term tokenism is the only vehicle to fight the impact of plastic on our bodies and planet.' The government has promised to double onshore wind, treble solar power, and quadruple offshore wind by 2030, and experts welcome the scale of ambition. However, they also emphasize the need for 'continuity and certainty' in policy and investment to support the transition to net zero.
