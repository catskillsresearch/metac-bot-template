**India's critical mineral challenge threatens its 2030 economic goals**
India's electric vehicle (EV) makers are facing a critical challenge due to China's restrictions on rare earth magnet exports. Rare earth magnets are essential inputs for electric motors and other auto parts. According to reports, Indian auto component and automobile companies are close to exhausting their current inventories of rare earth magnets. To address this issue, a delegation from the industry is planning to visit China to negotiate a solution to the new procedural bottlenecks that are hindering supplies. 'India's 2030 economic goals are at risk due to this challenge,' said an industry expert, emphasizing the need for a swift resolution.

**US-China rivalry requires Indonesia to review defense posture - Academia - The Jakarta Post**
The US-China rivalry is reshaping the global order, with significant ramifications for Indonesia. As Hans Morgenthau said, 'International politics, like all politics, is a struggle for power.' The economic front of this rivalry, which began in 2025 with a 10% tariff imposed by the US on imported goods, has ignited a tit-for-tat tariff war, impacting global supply chains and economies worldwide, including Indonesia's. The military aspect of this rivalry has also presented a new and alarming dimension, as seen during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, where Pakistan's military, equipped with Chinese-made weaponry, could match India's more expensive Western and Russian platforms in a three-day war.

**India Must Stop Comparing Its Air Force to Pakistan  --  The Real Challenge Is China**
India's defense discourse has been fixated on Pakistan for decades, but this mindset is outdated. The real challenge is China. India needs a comprehensive, long-term strategy to revitalize its air power, which includes prioritizing indigenous fighters like the Tejas Mk1A and Mk2, expanding the Rafale fleet, upgrading the Su-30MKI fleet, and investing in jet engine programs. The author argues that India should stop comparing itself to Pakistan and focus on becoming a self-reliant air force by 2040, capable of withstanding embargoes and supplier politics. The author notes that India is now the 4th largest economy in the world, but has only ~30 fighter squadrons and numbers dropping, making national survival a pressing concern.

**Top Singaporean expert warns: 'Asia will be in trouble if India and China don't get along' - BusinessToday**
Kishore Mahbubani, a former Singaporean diplomat and public intellectual, has warned that Asia's future stability hinges on how India and China manage their complex relationship. He noted that the relationship is 'asymmetrical' due to the fact that most Chinese are unaware of the 1962 border war with India, while most Indians are aware of it. Mahbubani urged young people in both countries to look beyond recent tensions and focus on the region's long history of peaceful coexistence. He said, 'If China and India don't get along, then Asia is in trouble.' Mahbubani's comments come amid renewed efforts to revive diplomatic engagement between the two Asian giants, including a bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping at the 2024 BRICS Summit. However, strategic trust remains low due to China's deepening partnership with Pakistan.

**China's 'Made in China 2035' Plan: A Response to US Pressure or a Desperate Attempt to Revive Economy?**
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has announced its plan to prioritize manufacturing, dubbed 'Made in China 2035', in response to pressure from the US. However, experts question whether this shift will be enough to address the country's deep-seated economic issues, including inflation, overcapacity, and extreme imbalance. The CCP's plan is seen as a response to the US's efforts to promote American re-industrialization, led by President Trump's global tariffs. The tariffs have been a key factor in the US-China trade war, with the US seeking to block China's practice of 'dumping' goods on the global market. The CCP's financial system is also facing risks, with six major state-owned banks experiencing declining profits and rising non-performing loans. Some experts warn that China may enter a period of negative interest rates, which could have significant implications for the economy.

**India readies to face 2040 naval threat, as Pak-China-Turkey axis emerges  - The Sunday Guardian Live**
India is facing a growing maritime challenge from a coordinated China-Turkiye-Pakistan naval build-up by 2040. The three nations are not part of any formal alliance, but their hidden coordination and converging maritime postures suggest the emergence of a strategic triangle. China is expected to operate six aircraft carriers, 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines, and a surface fleet of over 150 warships by 2040. Turkiye is modernizing its navy with aircraft carriers, destroyers, and stealth submarines, while Pakistan is expected to field eight Hangor-class submarines and four Type 054A/P guided missile frigates. The combined strength of these three navies will outmatch India's projected naval capabilities by 2040, forcing the Indian Navy to split its forces across three distinct theatres. India must rapidly evolve its naval force structure to counter this challenge, including deploying three aircraft carriers, 200 warships, and 500 naval aircraft, and ensuring its submarine fleet is fully operational and technologically current.

**China crosses 600 operational nuclear warheads, to exceed 1,000 by 2030: US intel - BusinessToday**
According to a US Defence Intelligence Agency report, China has surpassed 600 operational nuclear warheads and is on track to have over 1,000 by 2030. The rapid buildup is part of China's effort to create a diverse and high-readiness nuclear force capable of delivering both low-yield precision strikes and large-scale intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) attacks. The report notes that China's current force modernization suggests that it seeks to have the ability to inflict far greater levels of overwhelming damage to an adversary in a nuclear exchange. The nuclear buildup aligns with China's broader goals of asserting dominance in East Asia, challenging US global leadership, pursuing reunification with Taiwan, and achieving technological self-sufficiency. Meanwhile, India and Pakistan continue to develop their nuclear arsenals, with India slightly expanding its nuclear arsenal in 2023 and Pakistan modernizing its nuclear command and control systems. As of June 2024, Russia had 4,380 warheads, while the US had 3,708, and India and Pakistan had 172 and 170 warheads, respectively.

**US intelligence flags risk to India's security, cites 'military threats' from Pakistan and China**
A recent U.S. intelligence report, the 2025 World Threat Assessment, highlights growing concerns over China and Pakistan's military ambitions, citing them as two of India's most significant security challenges. The report notes that India views China as its primary strategic rival, while Pakistan is seen as a persistent, though secondary, security concern. Pakistan is intensifying efforts to enhance its nuclear strategy, including the development of tactical nuclear weapons, and is acquiring sensitive materials and technology through networks linked to China and other intermediary nations. China is rapidly upgrading its military across all domains, with a goal of securing dominance in East Asia, unifying Taiwan with the mainland, and challenging the U.S. on a global scale. The report estimates that China's nuclear arsenal has exceeded 600 operational warheads and is expected to surpass 1,000 by 2030. Both China and Pakistan are key geopolitical flashpoints that will significantly shape regional and global security dynamics in the years ahead.

**China Projected To Have 1,000 Nukes, Viewed As 'Primary Adversary' By India: US Report**
A US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) report states that China is rapidly advancing its military modernisation and is expected to reach at least 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030. China views the US as a global leader and aims to challenge its dominance, while India sees China as its 'primary adversary' and is focusing on countering Chinese influence. The report also states that China will continue to apply pressure on Taiwan through diplomatic, information, military, and economic means to advance its long-term objective of unification with Taiwan. According to the report, China's nuclear warhead stockpile has probably surpassed 600 operational nuclear warheads, and the country will continue growing its force until at least 2035. 'This supports the PLA's objective to achieve a more diverse nuclear force, comprising systems including low-yield precision strike missiles and ICBMs with multi-megaton yields, to provide a broader range of nuclear response options,' it said. China's approach to using nuclear force is based on the Army's 'deterrence' of an enemy first strike and 'counterstrike' against an adversary's military capability, population, and economy when deterrence fails. The report also states that India has reduced procurement of Russian-origin military equipment, but still relies on Russian spare parts to maintain and sustain its large inventory of Russian-origin tanks and fighter aircraft that help its military to counter threats from China and Pakistan.

**The 2025 War between India and Pakistan: A Fantasy War Fueled by Hindu Nationalism**
The 2025 war between India and Pakistan was a brief and intense conflict that was marked by a series of airstrikes and counter-strikes between the two countries. The war was sparked by a dispute over the Kashmir region, but it was also fueled by the complex relationships between India, Pakistan, and China. The Chinese military played a significant role in the war, with their J-10C fighter jets and HQ-9 air defense system proving to be highly effective against Indian and French military equipment. The war was also marked by a series of bizarre and humorous moments, including a viral video of a Chinese blogger parodying the Indian air force's use of French-made Rafale fighter jets. The war ultimately ended with both sides claiming victory, but the real winners were the usual suspects: the Chinese military-industrial complex and the forces of division and domination. The war highlighted the deep-seated problems in India, including its complex relationship with China and its own internal conflicts. The article concludes that the war was a 'guerre fantasmée' (fantasy war) that was fueled by the ambitions of the Indian government and the Hindu nationalist ideology of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

**The next wars will be silent -- fought with semiconductors, software, invisible lines of code**
A study by the RAND Corporation, The Future of Warfare 2030, predicts that future conflicts will be fought with semiconductors, software, and invisible lines of code. The report warns that the US and India must recalibrate their information capabilities to counter grey-zone operations by nations such as China, Russia, and Iran. The US has imposed export controls on China to curb its access to advanced semiconductor technology, sparking a tech cold war. India must invest in indigenous quantum research and build a robust semiconductor ecosystem to protect its digital public infrastructure and prevent strategic weaknesses. The report forecasts conflict flashpoints across Asia, Europe, and the Middle East by 2030, and India cannot afford strategic complacency. 'We have the minds. We now need the mission,' according to the report.

**China's military surge signals urgency for India's defence readiness**
China's military is undergoing significant modernization, with a focus on developing capabilities to achieve its 'national rejuvenation' by 2049. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is adopting more coercive actions in the Indo-Pacific region and elsewhere, while accelerating its development of capabilities and concepts to strengthen China's ability to 'fight and win wars' against a 'stronger enemy'. The PLA is also improving its joint operations capabilities, with a focus on integrating technology into warfare. China's military strategy is to integrate technology into warfare, including artificial intelligence, big data, and other technologies. The PLA is also enhancing its nuclear capabilities, with estimates suggesting that China will have around 1,000 warheads by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035. The PLA is also developing new ICBMs that will significantly improve its nuclear-capable missile forces. China's military is also expanding its presence in the Indian Ocean, with a focus on projecting power globally. The PLA is also improving its logistics capabilities, with a focus on improving joint strategic and campaign-level logistic efficiencies. China's military is also enhancing its cyber capabilities, with a focus on persistent cyber-enabled espionage and attack capability. The PLA is also developing new technologies, including hypersonic missiles and advanced aircraft. China's military is also expanding its presence in the South China Sea, with a focus on challenging the US military in the Western Pacific. The PLA is also engaging with many groups that oppose the US, including Iranian proxies, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, or Iran-backed militia groups in Iraq. China's military is also trying to engage with Afghanistan through Pakistan to discuss stability, regional peace, counterterrorism, security for Chinese nationals, institutions, and projects in the region. However, China's military is also employing a more coercive approach to deal with disputes over maritime features, rights to potentially rich offshore oil and gas deposits, and border areas, including India. China's military is also building overseas military bases and logistics facilities to allow the PLA to project and sustain military power at greater distances. China is the largest contributor of peacekeepers among the five UN Security Council permanent members, having deployed about 50,000 personnel over the last 31 years.

**China, the war-monger - The Singapore Post**
China has rejected a proposal from US President Donald Trump to cut the defense budget by 50%, which would have reduced the chance of a global war and spared funds for development. Instead, China has increased its defense budget to a record high of $249 billion, a 7.2% increase over the previous year. This move has triggered an arms race, with the US and its allies stepping up their defense efforts to combat the threat. The US has announced plans to develop a next-generation fighter jet, the NGAD, which will be way ahead of any other fighter aircraft of the current generation. China has been modernizing its navy and air force, with plans to possess six aircraft carriers by 2035. The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is on the rise, and nations facing the Chinese threat are not sitting idle, increasing their defense budgets and developing advanced arms and weapon platforms. Posterity will brand China as the war-monger, having triggered an arms race through its aggressive moves.

**How US-China Trade War May Have An Unexpected Winner - India**
India may emerge as an unexpected winner in the US-China trade war. Chinese firms are prioritizing access to the Indian market by abiding by local conditions for expansion. With the US imposing a 'reciprocal' tariff of 245 per cent on Chinese exports, Indian companies are seeing an opportunity to attract Chinese manufacturers. According to Rajesh Agarwal, director at Bhagwati Products, 'There is a complete change in attitude of the Chinese companies, who are now extremely comfortable to own minority ownership in an Indian joint venture or form technical alliance.' Chinese giants like Shanghai Highly Group and Haier are reportedly agreeing to retain a minority stake in joint ventures, and have even formed technical collaborations with Indian companies. India is on track to sign a trade deal with the US, aiming to achieve $500 billion in bilateral trade by 2030. With the government's recently announced production-linked incentive scheme for electronic components, production in India may become cost-neutral compared to China.

**The Year 2025: A Pivotal Moment in Human History**
The year 2025 marks a pivotal moment in human history, where the world is at a crossroads, and the future of humanity is being rewritten. The United States has announced its intention to prioritize its own interests, with President Trump's 'America First' policy, which aims to protect its economy, improve job opportunities for Americans, and enhance national security. However, this policy has been met with criticism, as it has led to a trade war with China, which has imposed tariffs on American goods, and the US has retaliated with its own tariffs. The trade war has escalated into a global conflict, with the US and China vying for dominance in various sectors, including technology, energy, and infrastructure. The conflict has also led to a re-evaluation of global trade systems, and the potential collapse of the World Trade Organization. The US and China are also engaged in a technological cold war, with the US imposing restrictions on Chinese companies, such as Huawei, TikTok, and Nvidia. China has responded by developing its own digital yuan, which is expected to challenge the US dollar's dominance in global trade. The conflict has also led to a re-evaluation of global alliances, with the US seeking to strengthen its ties with countries in Asia, such as India, and China seeking to expand its influence in the region. The outcome of this conflict will have far-reaching consequences for the global economy, trade, and security, and will shape the future of humanity. The world is at a critical juncture, and the choices made in 2025 will determine the course of human history for generations to come.

**Explained: What the US-China trade war means for India and the world**
The US-China trade war has reignited in 2025, with tariffs flying thick and fast, supply chains unravelling, and geopolitical tensions rising. India is not directly in the line of fire, but it's standing close enough to feel the heat. The country's manufacturing sector is heavily reliant on Chinese components, and any disruption in that flow could increase production costs and delay drug deliveries. However, India's IT and tech services industry could stand to gain, with American companies accelerating outsourcing to India due to rising costs and instability in China. The US has also announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for dozens of countries, including India, which is being seen as an opening for a trade pact. A senior official quoted in a Reuters report said the pause is a 'relief for Indian exporters, especially shrimp exporters.' The two sides are now working to conclude the first phase of a trade deal by autumn 2025, targeting $500 billion in two-way trade by 2030. 'We believe it is better to stay calm and patient rather than chase short-term gains. Long-term investing needs stability, and with tariffs possibly returning after 90 days, risks remain,' said Trivesh, COO Tradejini. 'The US government's move of imposing country-specific tariffs is a significant development in the context of the global trade landscape. The impact goes beyond tax and may lead to disruption of supply chains, business models, and could potentially pause existing investment and business plans,' added Prashant Bhojwani, Partner, Tax & Regulatory Services at BDO India.
