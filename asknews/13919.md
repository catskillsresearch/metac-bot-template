**The moon: Why we want to go back**
NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole, called Artemis Base Camp, and launch a new space station, Gateway, into the moon's orbit. A joint China-Russia project, the International Lunar Research Station, also plans to build a moon base by 2035. The moon's resources, including water, regolith, and helium-3, make it an attractive destination for future space missions. These resources can be used to sustain lunar bases, extract minerals from asteroids, and even provide fuel for nuclear fusion power. The moon's distance from Earth also makes it an ideal location for testing technologies and equipment for future Mars missions. According to Sara Pastor, ESA's Lunar and Gateway Program Manager, 'Humans have had a continued presence in space for the past 20 years aboard the International Space Station. But the ISS is only 250 miles away in low-Earth orbit, which is as little as four hours after launching from Earth. The moon is 250,000 miles away -- about three days' spaceflight -- and a far riskier journey for astronauts.' The first research on the moon aims to make that journey safer and easier, and to determine how human activity affects the lunar environment. 'ESA is developing instruments for radiation environment measurements, drilling and in-situ sample analysis, geophysics and lunar space weather,' Pastor said. The long-term goal of building surface and orbital moon bases is to serve as a staging post for more distant space travel, and to provide a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration, as Pastor noted, 'A colony on the moon will be extremely useful and a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration.'

**NASA Prepares for Solar Storms: Protecting Astronauts from Radiation Risks**
As we are in the solar maximum phase of the 25th solar cycle, which began in December 2019 and is expected to end around 2030, there is a real risk to space missions, especially those that travel beyond Earth's orbit. Without a dense atmosphere or a magnetic field to act as a natural shield, astronauts are exposed to direct radiation from solar storms, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares. Ian Cohen, deputy chief scientist for space exploration at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, explained that most spacecraft designed for human exploration, including those for the Artemis program, are built to protect astronauts from radiation risks. 'There are also protocols in place at NASA to monitor and respond to such events and areas of the spacecraft specifically designed where astronauts can take refuge,' Cohen added. The Orion spacecraft is equipped with radiation detectors and warning and alert systems, and crew members will wear active dosimeters to monitor their exposure. The biggest threat arises when astronauts perform extravehicular activities in space or on the lunar surface. In such cases, NASA may modify or cancel these activities to ensure the safety of the crew. The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is working with NASA's radiation experts to strengthen support for space weather for human missions to the Moon. 'We are well-prepared' for the upcoming Artemis II mission, they say, and will do 'the best job of predicting, warning, and alerting astronauts' in case of solar events that could pose a health risk. Currently, there is a good set of forecasting tools, with improved modeling capabilities, higher-quality data, and advanced technology to detect and warn about solar events that could affect astronaut health. However, more detailed information is needed about the duration and intensity of solar events to improve forecasts. The launch of the NOAA's GOES-U satellite and the Space Weather Follow On Lagrange 1 (SWFO-L1) satellite in June will significantly contribute to this task.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**2030 Generation: A Swing Vote in the Upcoming Election**
The 2030 generation, estimated to be around 2.14 million voters, is still undecided on which candidate to support. This group accounts for about 5% of the total electorate and is considered a 'swing vote' that could tip the balance in the upcoming election. As the election approaches, the value of the 2030 generation is increasing, and each candidate is trying to win them over. Experts say that only candidates who have a clear strategy to appeal to the 2030 generation, who are known for being pragmatic and seeking benefits, will be the ultimate winners. According to a recent Gallup poll, 21% of 18- to 29-year-olds and 11% of 30-year-olds said they had not yet decided on a candidate, which is a significantly higher percentage than other age groups. A young voter, Imo (25, male), said, 'I haven't decided on a candidate yet, but I don't think Kim Moon-soo is a good choice because he's been portrayed as a 'national traitor' and a 'follower of Pastor Jeon Kwang-hoon.' I also don't trust Lee Jae-myung because he's been criticized for his lack of experience.' Imo also expressed reservations about Lee Jun-seok, saying, 'I think he's a reasonable person, but he's been using 'divide and conquer' tactics for political gain, which makes me question his ability to unite the country.' Lee Jae-myung, who visited Ah-Yu University on May 26, emphasized the importance of listening to the voices of young people and promised to address their concerns, including the high cost of living and the need for more affordable housing. Kim Moon-soo also announced a series of policies aimed at appealing to young people, including the introduction of an 'automatic adjustment mechanism' for national pensions and the provision of 10,000 units of affordable housing per year. Lee Jun-seok, who has been visiting universities and eating with students, has also announced a series of policies aimed at appealing to young people, including the provision of a 'den-don departure fund' with an annual interest rate of 1.7% and a maximum loan of 500 million won. A political analyst, Park Sang-byeong, said, 'The 2030 generation is likely to be a 'swing vote' that is not tied to any particular region or ideology, but rather seeks rationality and benefits. Lee Jae-myung will focus on ending the national crisis and implementing youth policies, Kim Moon-soo will focus on distancing himself from the far right and implementing youth policies, and Lee Jun-seok will focus on criticizing the two major parties and appealing to young people with a message of investment in the future.'

**China and Russia to Build Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon**
China and Russia have signed an official agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon, with the goal of completing it by 2036. The plant will supply energy to the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), a joint project between Roskosmos and CNSA. According to Yuri Borisov, former Roskosmos director, the reactor will be built autonomously, without human presence on the Moon's surface, using robots and automated systems controlled from Earth. The ILRS will enable fundamental space research and test technologies for long-term, unmanned operation. A manned operation is also planned. The station will be connected to an orbiting complex and nodes on the Moon's equator and far side. The energy supply will be based on solar power, radioisotope generators, and the planned nuclear reactor. The reactor is crucial for long-term human presence, as it can provide power during the 14-day lunar night. China aims to integrate 50 countries, 500 research institutions, and 5,000 scientists into the '555-project' by 2050. The ILRS is also seen as a geopolitical signal, as the US Artemis program and Gateway station are facing budget cuts.

**The New Space Race: Who Will Be the First to Return to the Moon?**
The competition to explore and potentially exploit the Moon has been ongoing since the Cold War era between the USSR and the US. The US was the first to land humans on the Moon in 1969, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin being the first to set foot on the lunar surface. Since then, 12 American astronauts have visited the Moon, with the last being Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt in 1972. The private sector has recently become involved in the competition, with China successfully landing a spacecraft on the Moon's far side in 2019 and announcing plans to send humans to the Moon by 2030. The US has also announced plans to return to the Moon, with a mission scheduled for 2027, but this has been delayed due to budget cuts. The US is counting on private companies to participate in the competition, with companies such as Intuitive Machines and Firefly Aerospace launching modules to the Moon in recent months. As the competition heats up, other nations such as India and the UAE are also joining the race.

**China Advances Manned Mission to the Moon by 2030, Pressuring the US**
China continues to advance its manned mission to the Moon by 2030 without any setbacks, with large-scale tests of its main components: the Long March 10 rocket, the Mengzhou spacecraft, and the Lanyue lunar module, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA). CMSA's deputy director, Lin Xiqiang, confirmed that the escape, propulsion, and control systems have been successfully evaluated on the ground, in preparation for the lunar landing expected before 2030. Meanwhile, the US is delaying its Artemis program: NASA announced that its human lunar landing mission is now projected for mid-2027. The main cause was a problem detected in the thermal shield of the Orion spacecraft during the re-entry of the Artemis I mission, which forced the postponement of the next phase of crewed flights. The Long March 10 rocket, with its three stages and large payload capacity, will be responsible for launching the Mengzhou spacecraft and the Lanyue lunar module into space. These systems have already completed propulsion tests, landing verification, and escape simulations under maximum dynamic stress conditions. Additionally, the CMSA confirmed tests of the lunar suit Wangyu and the Tansuo rover, both designed to operate in the lunar south pole, a priority area due to its possible water ice reserves. The current phase includes the integrated review of launch and lunar landing from the Jiuquan and Wenchang launch centers, as well as the development of the lunar remote sensing satellite, whose project has already been approved. These advances aim to consolidate a solid platform for establishing a permanent scientific base on the Moon, in collaboration with Russia and other countries. The lunar race between China and the US intensifies with similar objectives: sustained presence on the natural satellite and control of key resources. However, while Artemis accumulates delays, China maintains its goal for 2030. 'We will guarantee the success of all tests to establish a solid foundation,' Lin Xiqiang assured, referring to China's manned lunar mission. A key point is the cooperation between China and Pakistan, which includes the selection of two Pakistani astronauts for a future joint mission to the Tiangong space station. This alliance shows China's interest in projecting its space leadership in Asia and the rest of the world. Despite not having yet completed a manned mission to the Moon, its technical preparation and constant pace position it as a capable power to challenge NASA's lunar leadership.

**Musk Predicts 1 Million People on Mars in 20 Years, Establishing a Self-Sufficient City**
Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has predicted that humans will establish a self-sufficient city on Mars within 20 years, with a population of 1 million people. He also revealed that 2029 will be a historic moment when humans first set foot on Mars. According to Deutsche Welle, Musk stated on X platform that SpaceX plans to execute a landing mission in 2026, aiming to send Tesla's humanoid robot 'Optimus' to Mars using the 'Starship' rocket. If the mission is successful, he estimates that humans will complete their first Mars landing in 2029, but the most likely implementation time is 2031. Musk emphasized the importance of establishing a self-sufficient Martian city for the continuation of human civilization, saying, 'Even if Earth faces a disaster, Martian residents can survive independently.' He added, 'We need to build a self-sufficient city on Mars as soon as possible, which is the key threshold to ensure the survival of civilization. Even if Earth's supply ships stop flying or a major disaster occurs, the Martian civilization can continue.' Musk also mentioned that building a self-sufficient Martian city requires rebuilding all industrial foundations on Earth, and the primary task in the harsh Martian environment is to build a living module similar to a glass dome to provide a suitable space for human habitation. The 'Starship' rocket, developed by SpaceX, is considered the core of Musk's Mars plan. This reusable heavy-lift rocket will not only support NASA's 'Artemis' program to help humans return to the Moon but also undertake the mission of humans setting foot on Mars.
