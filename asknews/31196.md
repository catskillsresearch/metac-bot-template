**Israel's New Plan for Gaza Aid Distribution Sparks Controversy**
A document obtained by 'Associated Press' reveals that Israel has changed its plan to control all aid to Gaza, and will allow humanitarian organizations to continue distributing non-food aid, while leaving the distribution of food to a new group established with American support. This development indicates that Israel may be backing down from its plans to take control of all aid to Gaza and prevent established humanitarian agencies from delivering aid in the same way they have in the past. Israel accuses Hamas of stealing aid and diverting it to its own use, but Hamas, the UN, and humanitarian organizations deny this. The UN has expressed its rejection of Israel's plan, saying it allows Israel to use food as a weapon and violates humanitarian principles and will not be effective. Israel has banned the entry of food, fuel, medicine, and all other supplies to Gaza for nearly 3 months, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis affecting over 2 million Palestinians in the devastated territory. Experts warn of the risk of famine, amidst international criticism and outrage over the Israeli attack, and even the US, Israel's closest ally, has expressed concern about the hunger crisis in Gaza. A letter dated May 22, 2025, from the head of 'Gaza Humanitarian Foundation', a US-backed organization approved by Israel, to the Israeli government's coordination unit in the Palestinian territories, states that Israel and the foundation have agreed to allow the exchange and distribution of non-food humanitarian aid, including medical supplies, hygiene materials, and shelter, within the existing system led by the UN. The UN has provided the majority of aid to Gaza so far. The letter states that the foundation will maintain control over the distribution of food, but there will be a period of overlap with other humanitarian organizations. The letter states: 'The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation acknowledges that we do not have the technical capacity or field infrastructure to manage these distribution operations independently, and we fully support the leadership of these active parties in this field.' The foundation confirmed the authenticity of the letter. A spokesperson for the foundation said that the agreement with Israel came after continuous appeals. While the foundation has acknowledged that many humanitarian organizations still oppose the plan, it said that the foundation will continue to call for expanding aid to Gaza and allowing humanitarian groups to proceed with their work in the territory. The Israeli government's coordination unit in the Palestinian territories refused to comment on the letter, and referred the request for comment to the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who did not respond. The UN also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

**Israelis Consider Leaving as War Rages On**
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been ongoing for 19 months, with no end in sight. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that Israel will take control of the entire Gaza Strip. However, 70% of Israelis want the war to end, and 40% are considering leaving the country. In 2023, 60,000 Israelis emigrated without returning, double the number from the previous year. According to statsvetaren Isabell Schierenbeck, most people leave due to the war, but the government's proposed reforms are also a common reason. Schierenbeck warns that a mass exodus would be a significant knowledge loss for Israel. Ophir Bromberger, a resident of Tel Aviv, is pessimistic about the future and has purchased a house in Italy as a safety net. He believes that many Israelis are tired of protesting and are now exploring options for obtaining European citizenship. Bromberger notes that the Israeli government's handling of the gisslan situation has eroded trust among Israelis. The international community is increasing pressure on Israel to allow aid to enter Gaza, but the government has long opposed this. Schierenbeck believes that the situation is reaching a critical point, and the next election will be crucial in determining Israel's future direction. 'A healthy state does not wage war against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not set goals to expel an entire population,' said Yair Golan, an Israeli opposition politician and former top military officer. 'It's good that he said it. It's becoming increasingly difficult for the Israeli public to live in denial. More and more people are starting to show their discontent, but not enough,' said Bromberger.

**Collboni to Propose Re-Establishing Break in Relations with Israel**
Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni plans to propose to the plenary to re-establish a break in relations with Israel due to the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, according to El Periódico and confirmed by city hall sources. The PSC municipal group will bring a proposal to suspend relations with the Israeli government to a vote next Friday, aimed at demanding a ceasefire and respecting the rights of the Palestinian people. This move comes after former Mayor Ada Colau suspended relations with Israel in February 2023, only to be reinstated by Collboni seven months later. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students,' said no one, but Collboni's decision is expected to be a significant move in the city's relations with Israel.

**Israel's New Plan to Divide Gaza into 5 Regions and Control 75% of Territory**
According to Israeli media, the Israeli military has a new plan to divide the Gaza Strip into 5 regions and control 75% of its territory. The plan, which is set to be implemented over the next three months, involves 5 military brigades that will divide the strip into 5 areas, each under the control of one brigade. The Israeli military aims to 'destroy the infrastructure used by militants and kill them' in each area, as per the 'Rafah model'. The plan also involves relocating residents from northern Gaza to the central and southern areas, where food and logistical aid will be distributed. Israel has established 4 distribution centers, 3 in the south and 1 in the center, with a capacity to hold around 300,000 Palestinians each, and plans to establish 4 more. However, US officials have not shown sufficient interest in the plan, according to Israeli sources.

**Israel Warns Civilians in Gaza to Evacuate Before Intensifying Military Offensive**
Israel has issued an urgent warning to civilians in the north of the Gaza Strip to evacuate before intensifying their military offensive. The warning includes the cities of Beit Lahia and Jabalia, the Jabalia refugee camp, and the northern neighborhoods of Gaza City, where Israel has already carried out intense airstrikes in recent days, leaving dozens dead and forcing a third evacuation of the population. 'The Israeli Defense Forces will significantly expand their military operations in your areas', warned Avichay Adraee, the spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces, stating that Palestinian militants are operating in the targeted zones. Israel has rejected international calls to stop the war and reach an agreement with Hamas to release hostages. Israeli officials said their goal is to defeat Hamas and ensure the return of the 58 hostages being held in Gaza. According to Israeli sources, the operation involves taking control of the entire Gaza Strip, maintaining military control of the territory, and relocating the population to the south. Since October 2023, the number of Palestinians killed has reached 53,655, according to Gaza's health authorities.

**Israel's Policies have already Created Catastrophic Starvation Risk for Millions in Gaza: a Trickle of Aid won't Avert It**
According to a U.N. report, Israel's policies have created a catastrophic starvation risk for millions in Gaza. The report warns that by September 2025, half a million people (1 in 5 of the population) will face starvation, and the entire population will experience acute food insecurity at crisis level. The blockade and destruction of parts of the Gaza Strip have made food sovereignty nearly impossible, with the unemployment rate standing at around 50%. The Israeli government has been accused of using food as a weapon of war, which is strictly forbidden under the Geneva Conventions. As of May 2025, 57 children have died from malnutrition, and the situation is expected to worsen. As Oxfam International notes, 'the annihilation of the Palestinian population in Gaza' is a real possibility. Yara M. Asi, a University of Central Florida expert in Palestinian public health, warns that the situation is 'the most urgent warnings yet' and that a 'trickle of aid' will not be enough to avert the catastrophe. 'Putting Palestinians 'on a diet'' is a reality, and the consequences are devastating.

**Protest in Paris Demands Sanctions Against Israel for Gaza Genocide**
A protest was held in Paris, France's capital, calling for sanctions against Israel for its ongoing genocide in Gaza. The protesters, who gathered in the Bourse Square, expressed their anger towards Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip. They demanded that France impose sanctions on the Tel Aviv government and allow humanitarian aid trucks to pass through to Gaza. The protesters brought empty pots and spoons to draw attention to the famine in Gaza, and chanted slogans such as 'Israel is a killer, Macron is a partner in crime' and 'There is genocide in Gaza, we will not be silent.' They also carried banners that read 'Occupation is a crime, resistance is a right. Israel, leave Palestine' and 'Allow aid trucks to enter Gaza.' Myriem, a 44-year-old protester, said she participated in the demonstration to show her opposition to the French government's policy on the attacks in Gaza. She also expressed her support for the Palestinian people, who are still suffering, and said, 'We all need to take to the streets immediately.' Myriem described the refusal to allow more aid to enter Gaza as 'scandalous' and said, 'I don't understand how you can do this to a people in 2025. It's inhumane to deliberately starve men, women, children, and breastfeeding women.'

**Israel's Plan to Divide Gaza into 5 Parts: A Military Operation to Control 70-75% of the Strip**
According to a report by Israel Hayom, the Israeli army has a plan to divide the Gaza Strip into 5 parts and control 70-75% of it within the next 3 months as part of a large-scale military operation led by 5 combat units. The units will work to divide the strip into 5 parts, with each unit responsible for one part. The first phase of the operation will last 3 months, followed by additional months to clear the area of Hamas fighters. The army aims to apply the 'Rafah model' in each area, which involves 'destroying the infrastructure used by the armed groups and killing them', while also increasing the presence of military units throughout the strip. The army plans to relocate the population from the north to the center and south of the strip, where food and logistical aid centers are located. Israel is trying to speed up the process of transferring Gaza residents outside the strip in coordination with the US, but Israeli officials told the newspaper that Washington has not shown sufficient interest in the proposal. Israel has established 4 aid distribution centers, 3 in the south and 1 in the center, which can accommodate around 300,000 Palestinians each, with plans to establish 4 additional centers. The US has managed to pressure Israel to allow humanitarian aid into the strip, but aid centers have not yet started operating fully.

**Israel's New Humanitarian Aid Plan: A Tool of War in Gaza?**
According to Zeliha Eliaçık, a strategic analyst at the Anadolu Agency, Israel has transformed humanitarian aid into a tool of war in Gaza, following the current hunger crisis. Since March 2024, Israel has completely blocked the import of food and all humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. However, under growing international pressure, especially from the US, Israel has agreed to allow humanitarian aid to enter the strip in a limited and controlled manner. This move is seen as a forced maneuver by the Netanyahu government, which is under international pressure due to the threat of mass starvation in the Gaza Strip. The UK, Canada, and France have announced plans to impose sanctions on Israel if humanitarian access to the Palestinian enclave is not restored. Zeliha Eliaçık writes that the new system of humanitarian aid distribution, which is being implemented by Israel and the US, is not a humanitarian but a military logic. The plan involves creating a new mechanism for distributing aid, bypassing existing UN mechanisms, and allowing private military companies to control the process. This plan has been criticized by human rights organizations and the UN, who see it as a 'trap' aimed at concentrating the population in certain areas and restricting their movement. According to the plan, aid will be distributed only in certain points in the south of the Gaza Strip, and transportation will be subject to Israeli military control. The correspondent for the German magazine Der Spiegel, Tor Schreder, believes that this system is a 'trap' aimed at directing the population from the north to the south and concentrating them in certain areas, which is the first step in a larger plan. He also believes that the next step will be to check the identity of individuals arriving in the so-called 'safe zones' and provide aid only to those deemed suitable by the Israeli military. Additionally, it is planned to forcibly relocate groups of the Gaza population, who have become dependent on aid, to a third country or another region. If humanitarian aid to Gaza is distributed according to this plan, it is clear that Israel will use it to restructure settlements in Gaza through demographic engineering and restrict the movement of people by concentrating them in certain areas.

**Netanyahu: Israel to Control Gaza, Defends 'Trump Plan' Amid International Criticism**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel will control the entire Gaza Strip after the current military operation, 'Carri di Gedeone', is concluded. He also defended the 'Trump plan', which aims to transform Gaza into a Mediterranean resort under US control, with Palestinians who do not want to stay being resettled in other areas. Netanyahu opened the possibility of short ceasefires to facilitate the release of 20 of the 58 hostages still held by Hamas, emphasizing that this decision would also be driven by the need to maintain international allies' support. The Prime Minister also addressed the issue of humanitarian aid, which is being allowed into Gaza in limited quantities for strategic rather than humanitarian reasons. The UN has denounced the situation in Gaza as catastrophic, with aid shipments from recent days still blocked and not distributed. Netanyahu has also challenged the Attorney General, Gali Baharav-Miara, who had declared that the Israeli government cannot appoint a new head of the internal security services (Shin Bet). Netanyahu has announced that he will proceed with the appointment, directly challenging the judiciary.

**Germany Rejects Israeli Plans to Occupy Gaza Strip**
Germany has rejected Israeli plans to occupy the Gaza Strip, with a spokesperson for the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating, 'Gaza belongs to the Palestinians.' The spokesperson expressed concern over reports of Israeli plans to occupy the territory. Sources within the Israeli government revealed that the Israeli National Security Council has approved the military control of the Gaza Strip and the continued blockade of the territory. The plan also includes the relocation of residents from the northern coastal area to the southern area. The goal is to defeat Hamas, which controls Gaza, and secure the release of Israeli hostages held in the territory. Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz stated last month that Israeli soldiers will maintain permanent control over all areas occupied within Gaza. The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson emphasized that the G7 countries, including Germany, France, and the United States, rejected in 2023 'the occupation of the Gaza Strip, settlement, and reduction of its territory.' The spokesperson also reiterated the need for all parties to return to negotiations on a ceasefire and the release of hostages, as well as the lifting of the blockade on Gaza, which has prevented essential humanitarian aid from entering the territory for over 60 days. The Israeli military has prohibited the entry of humanitarian aid since March 2, 2025. According to the spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Israel requires UN staff to distribute aid through an Israeli checkpoint, with the Israeli military wanting to control the distribution route. In contrast, the UN and non-governmental organizations demand that the distribution process be based on humanitarian principles.

**Israel Gives Negotiations Another Chance Amid Internal Divisions**
The Israeli government has decided to give negotiations another chance before deciding to expand military operations in the Gaza Strip, amid internal divisions over the level of violence. According to Israeli media reports, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized during a meeting in May 2024 the need to avoid direct military management of the strip, and asked his advisors to keep this approach secret from the two hawkish ministers, Benny Gantz and Itamar Ben-Gvir, who are pushing for a wider military operation and a 'decisive phase'. The Israeli military has also warned that any direct military management of Gaza would require the deployment of four to five permanent military units, adding significant logistical and strategic burdens on the security establishment. Despite pressure from some ministers to set a deadline for returning to fighting, Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid insist on presenting a picture of genuine efforts to exhaust opportunities for a prisoner exchange or ceasefire, despite deep divisions within the government. A political and security cabinet meeting is scheduled to discuss the future of military operations in the strip later today, amidst cautious anticipation domestically and internationally about Israel's direction in the next phase.

**Israel Redraws Map of Gaza, Expands Settlements in West Bank**
Israel has redrawn the map of the Gaza Strip, designating 30% of its land as a 'security operational zone' where Palestinians are prohibited from entering. According to the Israeli army, this area covers approximately 187 square kilometers, more than half of the strip's area. The move is part of Israel's efforts to control the strip and reduce the smuggling of arms. The army has also established three military checkpoints, dividing the strip into sections. The population of Gaza, which was 2.4 million before the 2023 war, has been further reduced due to the destruction of 80% of its civilian infrastructure. The area has become a field of rubble, and the majority of hospitals have been damaged or shut down. The schools have become refugee centers, and many residents are forced to live in tents. The Israeli army has systematically destroyed civilian buildings in the security zone, according to testimonies from soldiers who requested anonymity. The Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has expressed a desire to 'control' Gaza. In November 2025, Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich mentioned the possibility of 'reducing the number of Palestinian residents by half' through 'voluntary migration.' The Israeli government has also welcomed the idea of making Gaza a 'Middle Eastern Riviera' and expelling its residents. In the West Bank, Palestinian herders are facing increasing pressure from Israeli settlers who are grazing large flocks in the hills. For example, Fatima Abu Naim, a mother of five, lives in a cave on a hill in the West Bank, where she is being pressured by Jewish settlers to leave the area. The settlers claim they are trying to steal her flock and have repeatedly asked her and her husband to leave the land. The situation is similar in other areas of the West Bank, where Palestinian herders are facing increasing pressure from settlers. According to a report by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, nearly half of the attacks by settlers in March 2025 and April 2025 targeted Bedouins and herders, including cases of arson, invasion, and destruction of essential resources. The Israeli police have not responded to requests to comment on the situation. The West Bank, which covers an area of approximately 5,600 square kilometers, has been under military occupation since 1967. The Israeli government has expressed a desire to annex the entire area, which is considered a fundamental part of the future Palestinian state. The majority of the world considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be illegal under international law, but Israel disputes this. A recent report by two Israeli organizations, Peace Now and Kerem Navot, found that settlers have taken control of approximately 194,000 dunams, or 14% of the West Bank's total area, using tactics of harassment and intimidation to force out local residents. The report also stated that nearly 20,000 dunams of West Bank land have been allocated to settlers for grazing, with significant financial and material support from the government. Human rights organizations in Israel and Palestine say that there is no legal way to compensate the herding communities and that the war in Gaza has exacerbated these situations. 'The Israeli government is trying to control the West Bank and Gaza, and the settlers are taking advantage of this situation to expand their territory,' said a spokesperson for the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem. 'This is a clear example of the Israeli government's policy of displacement and annexation.'

**Israeli Defense Minister Threatens to Make Gaza 'Smaller and More Isolated'**
Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz threatened to make the Gaza Strip 'smaller and more isolated'. He stated on his X platform, 'Gaza will be reduced further and become more isolated, while more residents will be forced to leave combat zones.' Katz also mentioned that the Israeli army will control the Morag axis, which separates the cities of Khan Yunis and Rafah, during the Jewish holiday. He added, 'The area between the Philadelphia and Morag axes will become part of the Israeli security belt.' Katz claimed that this is part of a strategy to pressure Hamas into accepting a prisoner exchange deal. He stated that the 'Israeli policy aims to dismantle Hamas's infrastructure and reduce its control area.' Recently, the Israeli army issued forced evacuation notices in the northern Gaza Strip, including the cities of Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun, and Jabalia, as well as the city of Rafah and parts of Khan Yunis. The Israeli army also claimed to have completed the siege of Rafah and the establishment of the Morag axis, which separates the city from Khan Yunis. Israel has been committing war crimes in the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, with the support of the United States, resulting in over 167,000 Palestinian deaths and injuries, mostly children and women, and over 11,000 missing persons. The Israeli army has also imposed a tight blockade on the Gaza Strip, preventing the entry of food, water, medicine, and fuel, which has led to a humanitarian catastrophe, according to the Gaza government.

**Hamas Willing to Hand Over Gaza Control, But Only If Palestinian State is Established**
Hamas is willing to hand over control of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian unity government, but will not disarm unless an independent Palestinian state is established, said Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official. 'We are willing today, if not yesterday, to take a step back in governance to hand it over to an organization, a government, a committee, that is ready to lead the Gaza Strip,' Naim said. However, Israel has not been officially notified of its intention to resume negotiations, and it is unclear whether they will seek to extend the first phase of the agreement or negotiate the terms for a second phase. Naim accused Israel of deliberately delaying new negotiations to create a pretext for returning to war against Hamas. 'We believe this is done intentionally to escalate the situation or to push the negotiations of the second phase under the threat of returning to war and not withdrawing from the Gaza Strip,' he said. Hamas has already declared its willingness to hand over the government of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian organization, but Israel has made it clear that any plan for the 'day after' Gaza must not include Hamas, which led the October 7, 2023 terrorist attack in southern Israel. The most contentious issue blocking the negotiation of the second phase of the agreement remains whether Hamas will disarm. Netanyahu has declared that the destruction of Hamas is the main goal of Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, sometimes, according to its critics, above the freedom and well-being of the Israeli hostages still held there. Naim reiterated Hamas's offer to integrate into a Palestinian unity government, but said the group will only disarm and transform into a purely political party if a Palestinian state is granted independence, a condition that Netanyahu and his right-wing allies in the government have repeatedly rejected.

**The Trump Plan for Gaza Has Failed, and the Palestinians Will Remain**
The Trump plan for Gaza has failed, and the Palestinians will remain, but it will not be Hamas that will manage the Strip. Israel and the US are threatening the possibility of a return to war, but they are also continuing to negotiate for a peace agreement and the future of Gaza. The US and Israel are using the carrot and stick approach, with Trump and Netanyahu wanting to keep Hamas on its toes and bring home all the hostages, while also making it clear that the future of Gaza will not be managed by Hamas. According to Marco Rubio, the US Secretary of State, Hamas must be eliminated. The plan for a Middle Eastern Riviera is unrealistic, and the Israeli Defense Minister Katz has said that an agency will be opened for Palestinians who want to leave voluntarily. It is more likely that the government of Gaza will be given to other Palestinians who are not Hamas or will remain under Israeli control. The US and Israel will not allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons and do not rule out a new violent Israeli intervention. The current ceasefire is being used by Israel to prepare for new battles and to replenish its arsenal. The arrival of US-supplied bombs is a deterrent for Hamas and Iran, but it is also possible that they will be used. According to Vincenzo Giallongo, a general of the Carabinieri, the US and Israel are using the carrot and stick approach to keep Hamas on its toes and bring home all the hostages. Netanyahu has said that the Palestinians should leave Gaza voluntarily, but since they want to stay, this means that the Trump plan is already failed. The alternative to the Middle Eastern Riviera is that Hamas will be removed from power and that a new government will be established, possibly with the participation of ex-Al Fatah or under Israeli control. It is too early to say what will happen, but it is certain that Hamas will not manage the future of Gaza.

**Israeli Finance Minister Threatens to Demolish More Buildings in West Bank than Palestinians by 2025**
Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich threatened to demolish more buildings in the occupied West Bank than the Palestinians have built since 1967 by 2025. According to a report by Israel's Channel 7, Smotrich said at a meeting, '2025 will be the first time since 1967 that we have demolished more than they have built.' Smotrich stated that they are continuing to demolish buildings in the West Bank at full speed, saying, 'We are doing it with all our might, with more demolitions. The essence of the conflict is control of the land. Whoever controls the land determines its future.' Smotrich emphasized that the Tel Aviv government is working to increase demolitions in areas under Israeli control and to prevent Palestinian construction, and that they are striving to ban all Palestinian construction and re-establish Israeli control over the land. Since Israel launched its attack on the Gaza Strip on October 7, 2023, it has intensified its efforts to annex the West Bank, which has been under Israeli occupation since 1967, as part of its annexation efforts. All these developments are taking place in the shadow of the Israeli government's official statements, which reject the establishment of a Palestinian state by violating and disregarding relevant international legitimacy decisions. The United Nations has emphasized that the construction of Jewish settlements in occupied Palestinian territories is illegal and has weakened the chances of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and has been calling for their cessation for years. Palestinians say that Israeli authorities have prevented construction without permission or land improvement in the C area, and that obtaining a permit is almost impossible.

**Gaza: The Uncertain Future of the Hamas**
The Hamas has regained control in the Gaza Strip, despite the Israeli army's efforts to weaken the Islamist movement. The group's military wing has resurfaced, and it is now providing protection and distributing humanitarian aid to the 2.3 million residents of the enclave. The Hamas has also relaunched its administrative apparatus, with 18,000 employees mobilized to provide services to the inhabitants. However, the group faces a significant challenge: the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, estimated to cost $80 billion. The Hamas lacks the necessary funds to finance the massive reconstruction efforts, and it relies on international aid, including from the Gulf states and Europe. A diplomat notes that it will be difficult to mobilize funds for the Hamas, as many countries do not want to help the group maintain power and finance projects that could be destroyed in case of a new war. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Gaza Strip will be competing with the Lebanon and Syria for donor funds to launch large-scale reconstruction operations. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing pressure to establish a commission of inquiry into the failure of the 7 October 2023 operation, which saw the Hamas infiltrate southern Israel and kill over 1,200 people. Netanyahu opposes the creation of such a commission, fearing that he will be held accountable for allowing Qatar to fund the Hamas for years to finance the weakening of the Palestinian Authority. The situation in the Gaza Strip remains uncertain, with the Hamas maintaining control and the Israeli government refusing to allow the Palestinian Authority to take control of the enclave. The return of Donald Trump to the White House could change the situation, as the former US president has expressed his desire to convince Saudi Arabia to normalize its relations with Israel, as part of the Abraham Accords. However, this would require Israel to release pressure on the issue of a Palestinian state, which could destabilize the Israeli government.
