**Google DeepMind CEO Predicts AI Will Cure Diseases and Bring Radical Abundance**
Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, believes that artificial intelligence (AI) could potentially cure diseases, 'even all of them... if everything goes well.' He made this statement at the SXSW London festival, where he discussed the advancements of AI and its enormous potential for humanity. Hassabis predicts that in the next decade, general artificial intelligence (AGI) will be able to dominate all areas and be used 'to solve fundamental problems in science.' He believes that solving these problems will 'open up new branches of discovery or applications that did not exist before.' Hassabis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024 for creating the AlphaFold model, which can predict the structure of proteins. He thinks that more breakthroughs like this are needed, especially in fields like energy and materials science, which would lead to significant advancements in many other areas. Hassabis predicts that if everything goes well, humanity will reach a state of 'radical abundance,' where diseases can be cured and clean energy is available in abundance. He compares the arrival of AI to other historical processes, such as the Industrial Revolution and the Internet, but believes that this will be 'even bigger, perhaps like electricity, because it will be able to transform everything.' However, he also emphasizes the need to regulate the use of AI and AGI with an ethical approach that benefits everyone.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Four Psychics Predict a Catastrophic 2025: A Devastating War and Global Chaos**
Four well-known psychics, including Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, French astrologer Nostradamus, Brazilian psychic Atos Salome, and London hypnotherapist Nicolas Aujula, have made a chilling prediction that 2025 may be a catastrophic year for humanity. According to them, the world may be shaken by a devastating war that will lead to catastrophic consequences. Baba Vanga, known as the 'Balkan Nostradamus', has previously made accurate predictions, including the 9/11 attacks, the death of Princess Diana, and China's rise to power. She warned that Europe will be engulfed in a destructive war in 2025, marking the 'fall of humanity' and 'devastating' the population. Interestingly, her predictions about devastating earthquakes in 2025 have already begun to come true, as Myanmar and Thailand were hit by destructive tremors last month. Nostradamus, in his famous 'Book of Prophecies', written in 1555, also warned of a great war that will affect Britain. He wrote: 'When those who come from European lands see how England has established its throne behind. With its flanks, fierce wars will arise.' He said that 'the kingdom will be marked by fierce wars, enemies will arise from within and without. The great sea from the past will return, there is no more deadly enemy under the sky.' Atos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian psychic, known as the 'Living Nostradamus', also predicts an inevitable Third World War. Salome is known for accurately predicting the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of Queen Elizabeth II, and a global Microsoft system failure. He warned that 'the worst is yet to come' and noted the growth of problems related to cyberwar and the use of technology as the main forms of combat in the 21st century. 'This is a war not just of people, but also of machines,' he said. London hypnotherapist Nicolas Aujula, also 38, agrees that 2025 will be 'a year when the world will lack compassion.' He expects 'horrific acts of human cruelty and violence against each other - in the name of religion and nationalism,' predicting that the Third World War may occur before mid-year.

**Proteins x LLMs: Unravelling 3D Protein Structures From 1D Sequences**
The protein-folding problem, which involves determining the 3D structure of a protein from its 1D amino acid sequence, has been a long-standing challenge in the field of biochemistry. Recent breakthroughs, particularly the development of AlphaFold 2, an artificial intelligence system by Google DeepMind, have made significant progress in solving this problem. AlphaFold 2 uses a transformer-driven architecture and attention mechanisms to predict protein structures with unprecedented accuracy. The model treats proteins as natural language sequences and applies attention mechanisms to learn from evolutionary relationships between amino acids. The model's performance was benchmarked in the Critical Assessment of Structural Prediction (CASP) competition, where it achieved a median GDT-TS score of 92.4 across several proteins. The accurate structure prediction of proteins has far-reaching effects in various fields, including drug synthesis, environmental sustainability, and disease research. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper for their contributions to advancing research of protein structures.

**New algorithm enhances prediction of disordered protein structures**
Researchers from the Biomedical Sciences Research Center Alexander Fleming and the Centre for Misfolding Diseases at the University of Cambridge have developed a new algorithm that enhances the prediction of disordered protein structures. The algorithm, which was tested on proteins associated with serious diseases such as ALS and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, outperformed existing algorithms like AlphaFold in accuracy, matching or exceeding the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations in 80% of cases. According to Dr. Faidon Brotzakis, a senior postdoctoral researcher, 'We were surprised to find that although AlphaFold does not accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of IDPs, it can predict the distances between amino acids with quite good accuracy.' The new algorithm can predict the structures of a significant fraction of all human proteins that were previously considered 'dark' and notoriously difficult to observe. This breakthrough could lead to the discovery of molecules of pharmaceutical interest that can interact strongly with these proteins and modify their dynamics, potentially preventing their problematic folding into toxic forms. 'In the future, we can use this information to discover molecules of pharmaceutical interest that can interact strongly with these proteins and modify their dynamics,' says Brotzakis. 'This could prevent their problematic folding into toxic forms, such as amyloid fibrils, which are observed in many neurodegenerative diseases.'
