**Carney's Symbolic Decree: A Borrowed Page from Trump's Book**
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has been campaigning on the back of Donald Trump's style, but that doesn't stop him from borrowing from the American president. Carney has signed a symbolic decree, similar to Trump's, to lower taxes, but the decree itself has little legal weight. Carney is asking his Finance Minister, François-Philippe Champagne, to introduce a bill to implement the tax cut before July 1st. The tax cut, which lowers the first taxable income bracket from 15% to 14%, will save families around $800. The move is seen as a demonstration of strength by the minority government, which will need to find a partner in the Parliament to pass the measure. However, some critics argue that the government's focus on symbolic decrees rather than concrete action is a sign of inefficiency. Carney has promised to make Canada's economy the strongest in the G7, reduce interprovincial barriers, and manage a unprecedented trade war with the US. The government will be judged on its results, not the number of symbolic decrees it signs.

**Politics Insider: No 2025 federal budget tabled before summer, Finance Minister suggests**
Prime Minister Mark Carney's government will not table a 2025 federal budget before summer, according to Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne. Instead, the government will release a fall economic statement. Ontario and Manitoba have pledged to cooperate on removing trade barriers within Canada, with a deal on direct-to-consumer alcohol sales expected by the end of June. Canada Post has paused negotiations with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, and the government has promised to introduce legislation to tackle internal trade and labour mobility barriers by July 1. Meanwhile, Canada's Prime Minister has criticized British Labour leader Keir Starmer's invitation to former US President Donald Trump for a second state visit, saying it undermines Canada's united front against Trump's talk of annexing Canada.

**Carney says new govt will 'relentlessly' protect Canada sovereignty**
Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney has stated that his government will 'relentlessly' protect the nation's sovereignty as it works to redefine its relations with the United States. Carney's election win was largely defined by threats from President Donald Trump, who has discussed absorbing Canada into the United States. Carney said, 'Canadians elected this new government with a strong mandate to define a new economic and security relationship with the United States.' He added that his government will work 'relentlessly to keep Canada secure as a sovereign nation.' Carney's cabinet retains several key figures involved in negotiating with the Trump administration, and he has promised to act fast on a middle class tax cut and remove inter-provincial trade barriers by Canada Day. According to opinion polls, the Liberals trailed the Conservatives by more than 20 points at the start of the year, but Carney's replacing Justin Trudeau combined with Trump's threats sparked an unprecedented comeback, with the Liberals falling just short of majority control of Parliament.

**Carney Announces Cabinet to Strengthen Canada-US Ties**
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who won the recent election promising to take on US President Donald Trump, presented a new cabinet on Tuesday that he says will help define a new relationship with Washington. Carney reduced the number of ministers to 29, compared to 39 under the previous Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, but kept some key players in their roles, such as Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne and Dominic LeBlanc, responsible for US trade. However, he transferred Melanie Joly from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Ministry of Industry after four years and replaced her with Anita Anand. 'The Canadians elected this new government with a strong mandate to define a new economic and security relationship with the United States and to build a stronger economy,' said Carney's cabinet in a statement. 'This focused team will act on this mandate for change with urgency and determination.' Carney met with Trump in Washington last week but did not secure the removal of tariffs imposed by the president on Canadian exports. Carney claims that Canada needs to invest billions to shift the focus of the economy away from the United States, end internal trade barriers, and cut public spending. Chrystia Freeland, whose resignation as Finance Minister in December helped to bring down the increasingly unpopular Trudeau, remains in her role as Minister of Transportation and Internal Trade. The former Goldman Sachs banker Tim Hodgson takes over as Minister of Natural Resources, replacing Jonathan Wilkinson, who was removed from the cabinet. Carney's immediate promises include a tax cut and the end of all trade barriers between the 10 provinces by July 1. The Liberal platform, which promises additional spending of around $130 billion Canadian dollars over the next four years, predicts a deficit of $62.3 billion Canadian dollars in 2025-26, much higher than the $42.2 billion Canadian dollars forecast in December.

**Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney Announces New Cabinet with Focus on US Relations**
Mark Carney, the Prime Minister of Canada, has stated, 'The Canadians have chosen this new government with a strong mandate: to define a new economic and security relationship with the United States, reduce the cost of living, and build a stronger economy.' He has announced the 28 ministers who will form his new cabinet, with Anand taking a key role in smoothing over tensions with the US. The Canadian Prime Minister will be supported by a team including Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne and Dominic LeBlanc, the current minister responsible for bilateral trade relations. All 28 ministers have taken the oath of office on Tuesday during a ceremony at the Governor General's residence, as reported by CBC. The cabinet change comes after Carney's meeting with Trump at the White House earlier this month, where he defended Canada against Trump's public outbursts, saying the country 'is not for sale'.

**Mark Carney Presents His Economic Team: A New Era for Canada-US Relations?**
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has presented his new economic team, which will be responsible for renegotiating the USMCA trade agreement. The team will consist of 29 ministers and 10 secretaries of state. Carney has stated that he will not accept the first agreement offered by US President Donald Trump without negotiation. He aims to find a long-term solution to the commercial conflict with his main commercial partner, but this could involve extensive conversations to modify the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that the US, Canada, and Mexico signed during Trump's first term. To gain time for Canada, Carney has committed to promoting the national economy to protect it from the damage caused by US tariffs. He plans to implement measures such as a reduction in income tax, a budget, and a bill in Parliament to eliminate federal trade barriers to goods circulating between provinces. Carney also promised to build and approve important infrastructure and energy projects, focusing on those 'that will connect Canada, deepen our ties with the world, and grow our economy for generations,' he said to journalists shortly after the election. 'The commercial war has plunged Canadian businesses into a constant state of uncertainty, threatening to put the livelihood and well-being of Canadians at risk,' said Matthew Holmes, executive vice president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, in a statement.

**Canada's PM Carney triggers snap election, vote set for April 28**
Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney has called for a snap election on April 28, less than two weeks after taking office. Carney, a former economist and central banker, has promised to continue Justin Trudeau's firm response to US President Donald Trump's tariffs and threats to Canadian sovereignty. The Liberal Party leader said, 'We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump's unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty.' Carney is hoping to capitalize on the momentum gained since Trudeau's announcement to step down and amid repeated threats from Trump. The election is expected to be a neck-and-neck fight between the Liberals and the opposition Conservatives, with the central 'ballot question' being which party leader is best equipped to respond to Trump and manage Canada-US ties. According to an Ipsos poll, Carney has the highest approval ratings of any federal party leader, and Canadians view him as the leader best able to deal with Trump's tariffs and their fallout.
