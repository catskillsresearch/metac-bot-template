**Park Ji-won Predicts Narrowing Gap in Approval Ratings for 2025 Presidential Election**
Park Ji-won, the joint campaign committee chairman of the Democratic Party of Korea, predicts that the gap in approval ratings between Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo will narrow to less than 5% by the 2025 presidential election. Park said, 'The trend of supporting a single candidate is becoming more solid, and voters are trying to prevent a landslide vote for a specific candidate.' He added, 'Lee Jae-myung's approval rating has been distributed to some extent to Jun-seok Lee and Won Young-guk, the presidential candidate of the Democratic Labor Party.' Park emphasized, 'We should pay attention to the fact that the indicator of regime change is consistently above 50% in opinion polls.' He also stated, 'Even if the approval rating gap narrows and the opposing candidates unify, Lee Jae-myung will still win.' Additionally, Park said, 'Jun-seok Lee will not participate in unification even if he gets around 10% of the votes, as he has a future in politics.' He also stated, 'Even if unification occurs, our people will not support a faction that seeks to overthrow the government.'

**Lee Jae-myung's Lead in Presidential Election May Not Be as Large as Expected**
Recent polls in South Korea show that Lee Jae-myung, the candidate of the Democratic Party of Korea, is leading in the presidential election, but the gap between him and Kim Moon-soo, the candidate of the People's Power Party, is not as large as expected. According to a survey conducted by Dailyian, Lee Jae-myung has 45.8% of the votes, while Kim Moon-soo has 38.8%. However, a telephone survey conducted by NBS showed a different result, with Lee Jae-myung having 49% of the votes and Kim Moon-soo having 27%. The difference between the two candidates is 22% in the telephone survey. The article argues that the telephone survey may not accurately reflect the opinions of the 'shy' or 'sheep' voters, who may be hesitant to express their opinions. On the other hand, the automated response system (ARS) survey may be more accurate in capturing the opinions of these voters. The article concludes that the presidential election is likely to be close, and the outcome will depend on the level of participation of the 'shy' or 'sheep' voters.

**Lee Jae-myung Criticizes Yoon Suk-yeol's Election Fraud Claims**
Democratic Party of Korea presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung criticized former President Yoon Suk-yeol, saying, 'The leader of the rebellion and foreign exchange is parading on the streets while watching a movie about election fraud and laughing.' He added, 'Is it fair that the leader of the rebellion and its followers are walking around on the streets while those who committed crimes are being tried in prison?' Lee Jae-myung also questioned Yoon Suk-yeol's claim of 'election fraud,' saying, 'If they had cheated in the election, I would have won, not him.' He further stated, 'If they want to cheat, they should win by a landslide of 7% points, not by a narrow margin of 0.7% points. Why would they make the people suffer for three years?' Lee Jae-myung also mentioned that he is curious about Yoon Suk-yeol's intentions, saying, 'Are they really believing what they are saying, or is there some ulterior motive?' He also criticized Kim Moon-su, the presidential candidate of the People Power Party, saying, 'I asked him if he would cut ties with the leader of the rebellion and its followers, but he didn't answer. I don't know if he meant to cut ties or not. It's up to the people to interpret.' Lee Jae-myung concluded by saying, 'Now they are trying to come back, and if we let them, it will be a disaster. If we give the management of Korea to capable and honest workers, the lives of the people will definitely improve.'

**Conservatives miss merger deadline as ballots go to print**
The deadline for a potential consolidation of candidacies within South Korea's conservative bloc has passed, with ballot printing for the June 3 presidential election commencing. The ballots feature the names of Kim Moon-soo of the People Power Party and Lee Jun-seok of the New Reform Party, making it difficult for either candidate to withdraw without affecting voters. Attention now turns to whether the two conservative camps can reach an agreement before early voting, which has proven decisive in recent elections. A Realmeter survey showed Lee Jae-myung leading with 46.6 percent, followed by Kim at 37.6 percent and Lee Jun-seok at 10.4 percent. Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo and Rep. Na Kyung-won have urged Lee to withdraw and endorse Kim, emphasizing that time is running out. Lee Jun-seok has remained defiant, ruling out any withdrawal. The Democratic Party is closely monitoring conservative merger talks, framing any potential unification as both inevitable and ultimately self-defeating.

**The Centrist Voter's Dilemma: A Trilemma in the 2025 South Korean Presidential Election**
The upcoming presidential election in South Korea has presented a difficult choice for the centrist voters, who are torn between three options: incumbent President Yoon Suk-yeol, Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party, and Kim Moon-soo of the People Power Party. The centrist voters are concerned about the potential consequences of each option, including the risk of economic collapse and the impact on the country's future. Lee Jae-myung's candidacy has raised concerns about his potential to lead the country towards a populist and authoritarian direction, while Kim Moon-soo's candidacy has been seen as a safer option, but with the risk of a prolonged period of political stagnation. Meanwhile, the candidacy of Yoon Suk-yeol has been criticized for his lack of leadership and his failure to address the country's pressing issues. The centrist voters are faced with a difficult decision, as they weigh the pros and cons of each option and consider the potential consequences of their choice. As the author notes, 'this is a trilemma for the centrist voters, who are forced to choose between the devil and the deep blue sea.'

Lee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party of Korea, stated on May 24 that 'the former President Yoon must be held accountable for the foreign exchange crime investigation.'

He also criticized Kim Moon-soo, the presidential candidate of the People Power Party, saying that 'if a person who failed to cut off the former President Yoon, who attempted to provoke North Korea and sacrifice national security, becomes the President, can we expect national security?' Lee Jae-myung also criticized Kim Moon-soo's statement that 'the 'RE(100)' is impossible,' saying that 'what is impossible? Everyone else is doing it, but we can't. If we can't, we will be eliminated. If we say 'we can't,' we will be eliminated.' He also responded to the former President Yoon's claim of election fraud, saying that 'if there was election fraud, I would have won, not him. Why did he win? If he wanted to commit election fraud, he should have won by a margin of 7%, not 0.7%.'

**South Korea's Presidential Election: Lee Jae-myung Leads, Kim Moon-soo Closes Gap, Yoon Suk-yeol Makes Comeback Bid**
The 2025 presidential election in South Korea is heating up as the 22-day campaign period has reached its midpoint. According to the latest nationwide survey conducted by the National Broadcasting System (NBS), Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party of Korea is leading with 46% of the vote, followed by Kim Moon-soo of the People Power Party with 32%, and Yoon Suk-yeol of the Reform and Openness Party with 10%. Lee Jae-myung's lead has narrowed by 3% since the previous survey, while Kim Moon-soo and Yoon Suk-yeol have seen their support increase by 5% and 3% respectively. The survey was conducted using a random sample of 1,000 people and has a margin of error of ±3.1%. The remaining 11 days of the campaign will be crucial, with Lee Jae-myung trying to solidify his lead, Kim Moon-soo attempting to close the gap, and Yoon Suk-yeol seeking to make a comeback. The People Power Party is considering a last-minute alliance with Yoon Suk-yeol, but he has refused, saying 'the people will see my name clearly on the ballot paper.' The Democratic Party is cautious about 'optimism,' and has instructed its candidates not to mention 'expected vote share' or 'winning' in public. Lee Jae-myung has emphasized the importance of voting, saying 'if you don't vote, you're just ignoring the injustice and silence of the 12·3 martial law.'

**Lee surges ahead as conservative strongholds shift left**
With just 13 days remaining until South Korea's presidential election, a sharp reversal in regional dynamics has emerged between the two leading candidates, Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo. Recent polling suggests Lee is now leading Kim in 15 of the country's 17 major cities and provinces, including key battlegrounds, compared to the 2022 election where conservative candidate Yoon Suk-yeol won in 10 of those regions. Lee's gains are especially notable outside the traditionally conservative regions of Daegu-North Gyeongsang and Busan-Ulsan-South Gyeongsang, where Kim still holds a lead, but with narrowing margins. According to a poll commissioned by the Maeil Shinmun, Lee is polling at 31.2% and Kim at 54.2% in the Daegu-North Gyeongsang region, a 23-point gap that marks a dramatic reduction from the 51-point lead Yoon had over Lee in the same region during the last election. In the Busan-Ulsan-South Gyeongsang region, the latest Korea Gallup poll shows the race has tightened considerably, with Lee and Kim now within the margin of error, highlighting a competitive contest in what was once considered safe conservative territory.

**South Korea's Presidential Election: Lee Jae-myung Leads, Kim Mun-su Trails, Yoon Jun-seok Lags Behind**
The 2025 presidential election in South Korea is heating up, with three main candidates: Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party, Kim Mun-su of the National Assembly, and Yoon Jun-seok of the Reform Party. Lee Jae-myung is currently leading the polls with a 51% approval rating, according to a recent Gallup survey. He has maintained a stable lead since the beginning of the election, with a strong support base in the Seoul metropolitan area and among moderate voters. Kim Mun-su, on the other hand, is struggling to close the gap with Lee Jae-myung, with a 29% approval rating. Yoon Jun-seok, who is positioning himself as a alternative to the two main candidates, has a relatively low approval rating of 8%. The election is expected to be closely contested, with various factors such as the impact of former President Yoon Suk-yeol's resignation and the potential for a single candidate to emerge as a consensus choice. The survey was conducted by Gallup Korea from May 13-15, with a sample size of 1,400 adults aged 18 and above, and a margin of error of ±3.1% at a 95% confidence level.

**South Korea's Opposition Party Chooses Lee Jae-myung as Presidential Candidate**
The main opposition party in South Korea, the Democratic Party, has chosen its former leader Lee Jae-myung as its candidate for the presidential election in June. Lee, who won the nomination with a landslide 89.7% of the votes, will represent the party against a candidate from the conservative People Power Party, which is affiliated with the ousted President Yoon Suk-yeol. Lee said in a party conference in Goyang, north of the capital Seoul: 'I have entrusted the people with the mission of restoring power with a crushing victory and ending the old era of rebellion and regression.' He added: 'I will repay your trust by building a new nation - a genuine Korean Republic overflowing with hope and passion.' Lee lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon Suk-yeol by the narrowest margin in the country's history. Recent polls show Lee leading his competitors by a significant margin, with 38% of voting intentions in the latest poll by the 'Gallop' institution. The People Power Party is expected to announce its candidate on Saturday, with former party leader Han Duck-soo and former Labor Minister Kim Moon-su among the contenders.

**South Korea's Opposition Party Announces Presidential Candidate**
The main opposition Democratic Party of South Korea has announced its candidate for the upcoming presidential election on June 3. It is former party leader Lee Jae-myung. Lee Jae-myung has been leading in public opinion polls for several weeks with a significant margin over opponents from the conservative People's Power Party, which plans to announce its candidate on May 3. In a speech after being nominated as a candidate, Lee Jae-myung promised to strengthen South Korea's defense capabilities and make the country a leader in high-tech industries, a cultural center, and a model democracy. He also vowed to reduce tensions with North Korea. In 2024, Lee led the Democratic Party to victory in parliamentary elections and has since been considered a favorite in party primaries. Lee Jae-myung is a 61-year-old lawyer who turned to politics. He lost the 2022 presidential election by the narrowest margin in South Korean history. The Constitutional Court later removed the winner, Yoon Suk-yeol, from office for attempting to declare a state of emergency. In his speech, Lee Jae-myung compared Yoon's attempt to Lee's own past problems, saying he would lead the country out of political and economic crisis. However, Lee Jae-myung has also had his own issues. Recently, an appeals court overturned his conviction for violating election law, and the Supreme Court is still reviewing the case. He is also facing trial for bribery and a $1 billion real estate development scandal. Lee Jae-myung took over the Democratic Party in 2022 and stepped down in April 2025 to run for president. Before that, he served as the mayor of Seongnam and governor of Gyeonggi Province, the most populous region in South Korea.

South Korea's main opposition Democratic Party of Korea has named Lee Jae-myung, the party's ex-leader, as its candidate for the snap presidential election on June 3.

Lee said, 'From this point on, Lee Jae-myung is not only the candidate of the Democratic Party, but also the candidate of all the people yearning for the end of insurrection, an overcoming of the crisis, for those who seek unity and happiness.' He plans to strengthen South Korea's defence capabilities and make the country a leader in high-tech industries, a cultural powerhouse, and an exemplary democracy. Lee led the Democratic Party to a landslide victory in a parliamentary election in 2024 and has been widely expected to win the primary election.

She emphasized that the essence of this presidential election is a 'systemic war' and that it is a 'second 6·25 war and a founding war' between those who will protect a free and democratic Korea and those who will surrender Korea to anti-free and anti-constitutional forces. Na said, 'Even if our party wins the election, we will still be a minority ruling party and will have to deal with the unreasonable opposition party. It is impossible for someone who does not know the National Assembly and politics to do this. Only a 5-term member of the National Assembly with political power like me can do this.' She also emphasized that she will 'defeat the opposition party with a proven record of winning against injustice and will integrate and unite the party without factions, and will lead the party to victory with a crushing margin.' Na promised to 'pursue fundamental system reform, including the introduction of a 4-year presidential term, a parliamentary recommendation system for the prime minister, and a division of power between the executive and legislative branches. She also promised to 'introduce a system to prevent the abuse of power by the National Assembly and to prevent the impeachment of the president for political reasons.' Na also vowed to 'reform the Election Commission, which has caused public distrust with 'election bribery' and 'vote buying,' and to abolish the Special Prosecutors' Office for High-ranking Government Officials, which has been used for political persecution and revenge. She also promised to 'abolish the left-wing judicial cartel and to improve the system to ensure fair trials in accordance with the Constitution and laws, so that the judiciary and the Constitutional Court can become the last bastion of the people.'

**South Korean Presidential Election: Lee Jae-myung Emerges as Front-Runner**
Following the impeachment of South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, the presidential election has effectively begun. The progressive camp is led by Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the main opposition party, who is currently the most likely candidate. However, the conservative camp, led by the ruling party, People Power, does not yet have a strong candidate. In this divided society, the focus is on how to attract the middle class. Lee Jae-myung is currently leading in opinion polls, with 34% of the vote, according to Gallup's March 28 survey. He has also recently won an appeal in a court case, reducing the number of criminal charges against him. Lee Jae-myung ran for president in 2022 and lost to Yoon Suk-yeol by a margin of 0.73 points. Since then, he has been the leader of the main opposition party and has been critical of the government, filing around 30 impeachment charges against government officials and reducing the government's budget proposal to a level that could be passed by the opposition party alone.
