**Julia Garner and Anthony Boyle Join Netflix Series About FTX Collapse**
Actors Julia Garner and Anthony Boyle have joined the cast of the Netflix series about the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The project will tell the story of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and his girlfriend Caroline Ellison, who faced charges of fraud after the exchange's collapse. Julia Garner, known for her roles in 'Ozark' and 'Inventing Anna', has joined the cast of the Netflix project about the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, according to Deadline. The Netflix series will tell the story of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and his girlfriend and former CEO of Alameda Research Caroline Ellison, who faced charges of fraud after the exchange, which was valued at $32 billion in early 2022, collapsed in November 2022. The creators describe the series as a 'wild Bonnie and Clyde romance of Generation Z'. The cast also includes actor Anthony Boyle, known for his roles in 'Tolkien' and 'Tetris'. The project has been titled 'The Altruists'. Showrunners and executive producers will be Graham Moore ('The Imitation Game') and Jacqueline Hoyt ('Underground Railroad'). The first episode will be directed by James Poniewozik, who previously worked on 'Daisy Jones and The Six'. The release date of the series is unknown. In the spring of 2024, the Federal Court of Manhattan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison for fraud that led to the collapse of FTX. Prosecutors in the case stated that Bankman-Fried 'organized one of the largest financial frauds in history, stealing over $8 billion from his clients.' Caroline Ellison was sentenced to two years in prison in 2024. Previously, in 2024, it was reported that Apple and the A24 studio were also working on a project about the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. It is expected that the film will be based on the book by writer Michael Lewis 'Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon', which will be adapted for the screen by actress and screenwriter Lena Dunham.

**Netflix to Produce Series on FTX Collapse, Starring Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison**
The collapse of FTX, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, will be the subject of a new Netflix series. Announced by the streaming giant last week, the production 'The Altruists' will depict the rise and fall of FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in 2022. According to Netflix, the series will follow 'two brilliant and idealistic young men who try to remake the global financial system in the blink of an eye... but end up seducing themselves to steal $8 billion.' The series will have eight episodes and will star Anthony Boyle as Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and CEO of FTX at the time of its collapse, and Julia Garner as Caroline Ellison, Bankman-Fried's girlfriend and the head of Alameda Research, a company that was part of the FTX group. The FTX collapse in 2022 caught the market by surprise and generated billions in losses for thousands of investors. The bankruptcy occurred after it was discovered that the exchange used customer funds to cover investments in high-risk startups and crypto projects. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The case of FTX draws attention beyond the cryptocurrency market, as it is one of the largest collapses in the history of the financial market. The Netflix series will be produced by Higher Ground, a company founded by former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama.

**Fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried Set To Leave Prison Four Years Early As 'Good Conduct' Credits Trim His 25-Year Sentence**
Sam Bankman-Fried, the former cryptocurrency mogul, is expected to be released from prison on December 14, 2044, four years earlier than his original 25-year sentence. This is due to 'good conduct time' credits that can cut up to 54 days from each year of a sentence. Bankman-Fried was convicted of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy for 'commingling money with Alameda Research' and channeling billions in customer deposits into risky bets, political donations, and luxury real estate. His defense team has appealed both his conviction and sentence, arguing that the trial moved too quickly and misinterpreted cryptocurrency practices. However, regulators and lawmakers continue to sift through FTX's wreckage, and a separate civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission seeks billions in disgorgement.

**SBF Says He Was Shocked By Democrats' Crypto Stance Prior to FTX Collapse**
Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried suggested that his harsh prison sentence was due to his increasing ties to the Republican Party before his arrest. He stated, 'By late 2022 I was giving to Republicans privately as much as Democrats.' Bankman-Fried donated over $40 million to 196 members of Congress, including top Republicans and Democrats. He was found guilty of multiple charges of fraud and conspiracy in March 2024 and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Bankman-Fried's parents have reportedly been meeting with lawyers in President Donald Trump's orbit to secure a presidential pardon. He also criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during his trial, calling it 'something out of a nightmare' due to difficulties for crypto companies to register.

**Private Jets, Political Cash Among $1B in Sam Bankman-Fried's Forfeited Assets: Court**
A federal court has confirmed that Sam Bankman-Fried's forfeited assets total $1 billion, including $606 million from Robinhood stock sales and two private jets. The court document revealed a wide range of assets, including extensive crypto holdings and over 250 political donations. According to the court, one in three members of Congress during the last session received money from Bankman-Fried or other FTX executives. The first payouts in the FTX bankruptcy began on Tuesday, with $1.2 billion going out to those who were owed relatively small amounts, allowing them to recover about 119% of what they'd initially had in their accounts during the 2022 collapse.

**FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Claims Exchange Was Solvent at Time of Collapse**
Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of FTX, has stated that the cryptocurrency exchange was solvent at the time of its collapse and had enough assets to pay back clients. He made these claims in an interview with the New York Sun, while serving a 25-year prison sentence for fraud and misusing client funds. Bankman-Fried also expressed his dissatisfaction with the Democratic administration of former US President Joe Biden, stating that he prefers the Republican party. He criticized the Biden administration, saying it was 'difficult to work with' and that the Republican party is 'much more reasonable'. Bankman-Fried also mentioned his shared criticism of Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over his trial and a civil case against former US President Donald Trump. In 2020, Bankman-Fried was the second-largest donor to Biden's campaign, but he also stated that he donated an equivalent amount to Republican candidates. He said that he has changed his views and no longer considers himself a left-centrist. Bankman-Fried claimed that FTX had enough assets to pay back all clients in November 2022, but instead, clients had to wait two and a half years while the company claimed it was insolvent. The company has started making payments to clients, with around $800 million being distributed to creditors with claims under $50,000.

**Sam Bankman-Fried's Assets Confiscated for $1 Billion**
A New York court has ordered the permanent confiscation of Sam Bankman-Fried's (SBF) assets, totaling around $1 billion. This historic decision comes as FTX begins to repay its first creditors. The court's final order, dated February 18, 2025, details the impressive list of seized assets, including a block of 55.2 million Robinhood shares worth $605.7 million. The shares were initially seized by the US Department of Justice in January 2023. Bankman-Fried's personal fortune also included two luxury jets: a Bombardier Global 5000 and an Embraer Legacy. Additionally, authorities have seized assets belonging to Alameda Research, the trading company co-founded by Bankman-Fried, which is at the center of the FTX scandal. The authorities have also seized a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio, including significant amounts of Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano, Dogecoin, and millions of dollars in stablecoins Tether, primarily held on the Binance.US platform. The confiscation order also reveals a complex network of political contributions orchestrated by Bankman-Fried, including donations to candidates and organizations across the American political spectrum. FTX has begun its first phase of repayment to creditors, distributing $800 million to over 162,000 accounts via Kraken and BitGo platforms. The total value of seized assets exceeds initial estimates, with investigators discovering additional assets, bringing the total to nearly $1 billion. This confiscation represents a major breakthrough for FTX victims, who collectively lost around $9 billion. Sam Bankman-Fried, sentenced to 25 years in prison, continues to fight his case in appeal, contesting the jury's decision and arguing that prosecutors presented a truncated version of the facts regarding the management of user funds on FTX.
