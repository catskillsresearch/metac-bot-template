**France's Agricultural Landscape to Change Drastically by 2050**
According to agroclimatologist Serge Zaka, France has the means to adapt to new climate elements until 2050, but after that, it will be a different story. The country's agricultural landscape will change more radically, and it will be more profitable to switch to new crops. In the south, where droughts will be more pronounced, crops like maize, soy, and sunflower will be less profitable. In contrast, in the north, where there will be more rainfall, crops like wheat, rapeseed, and potatoes will remain profitable. Zaka emphasizes the need to adapt techniques and anticipate climate change, especially in the north, where the region of Hauts-de-France could become a major player in the economy. However, if nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, France will face an impasse, and its agricultural power will decline globally. 'The only true solution is to avoid reaching +4°C,' Zaka stresses.

**Russia Aims to Maintain Grain Market Leadership Despite Export Decline**
Russia aims to maintain its leading position on the global grain market. According to Patrushev, the country may export around 53 million tons of grain (including 44.5 million tons of wheat) this season, down from over 71 million tons (including 55.5 million tons of wheat) in the previous agricultural year. However, Russia needs to increase its grain production to 170 million tons and export to 80 million tons by 2030, as per the president's order. 'But judging by the latest trends, we are moving in the opposite direction. And this needs to be urgently corrected,' said the vice-premier. To achieve this, the government needs to take quick measures to speed up export shipments and remove unnecessary barriers, believes Patrushev. 'We must together maintain Russia's positions on the global market,' he emphasized. Experts suggest adjusting the base price (also known as the cutoff price) for calculating the grain export duty. The vice-premier noted that the government does not plan to abolish the duty, which is a regulatory mechanism to control prices on the domestic market. However, the base price is reviewed annually by the Ministry of Agriculture. Patrushev instructed the ministry to work on this issue this year. The current base price is 18,000 rubles, and the export duty is 70% of the difference between the base and indicative prices, calculated from export contract prices registered on the Moscow Exchange. As a result, the higher the base price, the less burden on farmers. This year's harvest is expected to be higher, with experts agreeing on their forecasts. The sowing campaign is progressing ahead of schedule. Approximately 48 million hectares are planned for planting cereals, including winter crops. All affected by the return frost plantings have already been re-seeded, noted Patrushev. This gives hope for 'decent grain yields,' says the vice-premier. In the 2025/2026 season, grain production may increase to 132-138 million tons (compared to 125.9 million tons in the previous agricultural year), with wheat production reaching 85-90 million tons (82.6 million tons in the previous season), predicts Igor Pavensky, head of the expert committee of the Union of Grain Exporters and Producers. The yield of barley may also increase to 18-18.4 million tons (16.7 million tons in the previous season), and corn to 14.7-15 million tons (13 million tons in the 2024/2025 season). This growth will be possible due to increased yields. Last year, they fell due to drought. The yield of legumes may reach a record 6.7-6.9 million tons (5.4 million tons in the previous agricultural year). Another record may be set for oilseeds, with 33.8 million tons expected to be harvested, according to Mikhail Maltsev, executive director of the Oilseed Union, compared to 31.6 million tons in 2024.

**Turkey's Agricultural Sector Faces Drought Threat**
Turkey's agricultural sector is facing a significant threat from drought and zirai don, according to Şemsi Bayraktar, the president of the Turkish Farmers' Association. Bayraktar stated, 'We are facing a drought threat, and we cannot ignore it.' He emphasized that the drought has had a negative impact on wheat production, particularly in the 65 provinces affected by the zirai don. Bayraktar also highlighted the importance of taking precautions in the agricultural sector, as Turkey is expected to become a water-scarce country by 2030, with a projected decrease in water consumption from 1300 cubic meters per person to 1000 cubic meters per person. He said, 'We need to take the biggest precaution in the agricultural sector, as 77% of our water is used for agriculture.' Bayraktar also expressed hope that the government will provide a fair price for farmers, considering the increased costs due to the drought, and that the harvest will be successful this year.

**Scientists Develop Less Allergenic Wheat Varieties**
Scientists from the University of California, Davis, have made a significant step towards creating less allergenic wheat varieties by removing the cluster of genes responsible for synthesizing alpha-gliadins, proteins that trigger the strongest immune response in people with celiac disease. The researchers used gamma radiation to edit the genes and tested the resulting seeds in the California Department of Food and Agriculture's laboratory. The new varieties showed excellent results and have been placed in the GRIN database for distribution. 'We're not creating safe wheat for people with celiac disease, but we're getting closer. Alpha-gliadins are our top priority for reducing allergenicity,' said lead author and biologist Maria Rotterman. 'Surprisingly, the flour from this wheat showed even better quality than regular flour,' noted geneticist Jorge Dubcovsky. The project has attracted the interest of farmers, bakers, and millers, and was developed in collaboration with researchers from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the US Department of Agriculture, and the Center for Proteomics.

**CO2-Reduced Wheat Production Increases Tenfold**
AGRAVIS Raiffeisen AG, OCI Global, and Dossche Mills have made significant progress in their joint project to increase the production of CO2-reduced wheat. Since 2023, the partnership has shown how cooperation in the value chain can contribute to climate protection. The area under wheat cultivation has increased from 200 hectares in 2023 to 1,700 hectares in 2024, resulting in a nearly tenfold increase in the production of low-carbon wheat. In 2024, a total of 14,000 tons of CO2-reduced wheat were harvested. The key role in the project is played by the fertilizers Nutramon-Novo and Dynamon-Novo from OCI Nitrogen, which are produced with biogas instead of fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by over 60%. Farmers participating in the program use the low-carbon fertilizers without changing their cultivation methods, maintaining the same yields and quality while reducing their carbon footprint. They also receive guaranteed premiums from Dossche Mills for their wheat, creating both environmental and economic incentives. The partnership is part of Dossche Mills' 'Terah' footprint program, which aims to work with partners throughout the value chain to not only produce wheat with a reduced CO2 footprint for Terah flour production but also to have a positive and tangible impact on biodiversity and soil health. For consumers, this means that products like bread, cookies, and pasta made from Terah flour are more sustainable without compromising on quality. The partners are also exploring other ways to reduce emissions, including the use of biocoal and improved fertilizers that further reduce emissions during production and use. The goal is to harvest 25,000 tons of CO2-reduced wheat in 2025 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from wheat cultivation by 50% by 2030. AGRAVIS plays a decisive role in expanding the initiative with its extensive network of farmers, while Dossche Mills processes the wheat into flour used for bread, cookies, and other wheat products. The fertilizers from OCI Nitrogen are fully ISCC+-certified, with their environmental impacts calculated and verified according to ISO 14067 standards. The CO2 footprint of the wheat from each participating farm is calculated using a Cradle-to-Gate approach developed by Veravis GmbH, a subsidiary of AGRAVIS, and verified using an ISO 14067-verified method in a self-developed tool. This ensures a fair and transparent assessment of the project's benefits. By promoting sustainability throughout the entire value chain, from fertilizers to farms and mills to consumers, the project ensures that environmental benefits are realized at every stage. The collaboration is a significant milestone on the way to a more sustainable food value chain, enabling consumers to make informed decisions at the supermarket shelf that support a low-carbon future.

Arnaud Lemoine, director of Ceneca, the owner of the Salon, explains, 'The choice of Morocco was confirmed by the cooperation agreements between our two countries.' 'We share many themes, including water management. The Moroccans are very advanced. We have a lot to learn from each other,' he adds. Morocco has invested 12.7 billion euros in its national water strategy 2010-2030 to ensure access to drinking water and irrigation. The country is also building an 'autoroute de l'eau' to transfer water from northern to southern regions. Additionally, Morocco has 12 desalination plants, with seven more planned by 2030, and 42 mobile units. The country also reuses wastewater through treatment plants and artificially recharges aquifers. This honor also marks a diplomatic rapprochement between France and Morocco, following the recognition of Morocco's sovereignty over Western Sahara by France. Emmanuel Macron signed an agreement to strengthen agricultural cooperation between Paris and Rabat, including securing French wheat exports to Morocco. Today, 55% of Morocco's wheat imports come from France.
