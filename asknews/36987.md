**Gil Shaham and Akira Eguchi to Perform Beethoven's 10 Violin Sonatas in Taiwan**
Gil Shaham, a renowned violinist, and Japanese pianist Akira Eguchi will reunite in Taiwan to perform Beethoven's 10 violin sonatas. The two musicians have been collaborating for over 35 years, and their friendship and musical journey will be showcased in three concerts from June 19 to 22. When asked about the significance of Beethoven's music, Eguchi said, 'I think Beethoven's music is full of struggle and human depth, which is different from Mozart and Chopin.' Shaham shared his personal feelings, 'I agree. I've been practicing Beethoven's violin sonatas since last month, and I think each one is a musical miracle. Beethoven is like Shakespeare: he has both joyful and tragic elements, which is the most inspiring music.' Shaham also shared two personal memories related to Beethoven's music: 'When I was a child, my parents would play Beethoven's 8th sonata's minuet together on their old violin and piano. This scene has stayed with me.' 'About a year ago, I received a call to participate in a fundraising concert. My 12-year-old son Simon, who also plays the piano, asked me, 'Why did you get the call?' I explained it to him, and he said, 'Then let's perform together!' So, we performed Beethoven's violin sonata 'Spring' together last week. This is a memory from my early and recent life about Beethoven and family.' Shaham also introduced the rare violin he will play in Taiwan, 'This is a 1719 Stradivarius violin 'Haupt' provided by Rare Violins In Consortium. This will be my first time bringing it to Taiwan! I love its sound, which is rich and layered, even on the high E string. It's a beautiful and luxurious sound.'

**Ask Billboard: The Weeknd Ties Mariah Carey & Prince for the Most Consecutive Years With a Hot 100 Top 10**
The Weeknd has tied Mariah Carey and Prince for the most consecutive years with a Hot 100 top 10, with 12 years. He achieved this feat with his song 'Rather Lie' with Playboi Carti. Another artist, Drake, is close behind with an active streak of 11 years. Meanwhile, Kidz Bop Kids have achieved a record 7 consecutive years with new Billboard 200 top 10s, thanks to their steady stream of all-ages covers of big pop hits. Victor Zaraya, a former executive for the ensemble, noted that the act's singers contribute to the enduring appeal of Kidz Bop, which has sold 18.7 million albums and drawn 8.1 billion official streams in the U.S. 'It's favorable to have your song being sung,' Zaraya said. 'Maybe a kid heard the Kidz Bop cover of an artist's song before they heard the actual version. Will they remember it as a Kidz Bop song? Maybe. Will they remember it with the original artist? Maybe. But it's only furthering that artist's song.'
