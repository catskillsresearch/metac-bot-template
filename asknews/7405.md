**The global crisis behind America's new nuclear bomb**
The US dropped 'Little Boy', a uranium bomb, on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, killing 245,000 people. The 'Fat Man' plutonium bomb in Nagasaki three days later ended World War II but opened the door to nuclear terrorism. Historian Hobsbawm noted that Hiroshima marked 'the beginning of nuclear blackmail.' The US government initially justified the bombings as a 'humanitarian action to end the war,' but the true motive was to avoid a costly war of attrition on the mainland and demonstrate nuclear deterrence to the Soviet Union.

**Debunking Common Misconceptions about Nuclear Power**
There are misconceptions about nuclear power, such as the idea that a nuclear accident is catastrophic. However, the only nuclear accident where radiation caused deaths was the Chernobyl disaster. South Korea does not have a nuclear power plant like Chernobyl, where the output was out of control or the containment building was not present. Therefore, it is unlikely that a similar accident will occur in South Korea. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster showed that the plant can withstand earthquakes but is vulnerable to flooding. South Korean nuclear power plants are designed to withstand earthquakes and flooding, and their containment buildings are five times larger than those at Fukushima. While it is possible for machines to fail and people to make mistakes, the probability of a nuclear accident is low. If Fukushima had a containment building like South Korea's, radioactive materials would not have leaked out and hydrogen explosions would not have occurred. The Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear accident in the US is an example that supports this claim. Although a nuclear accident occurred at TMI, radioactive materials did not leak out of the containment building, and there was no significant radiation leakage. Therefore, Jimmy Carter, the then-US President, visited the site without wearing a mask. TMI is similar to South Korea's Yonggwang nuclear power plant. The TMI 1 reactor, which was shut down in 2019, will be restarted in 2028 to supply power to Microsoft's data center. The cost of decommissioning a nuclear power plant and managing spent nuclear fuel is often misunderstood. However, these costs are already included in the cost of nuclear power generation. In 2024, the average cost of nuclear power generation in South Korea was 66 won per kWh, while the cost of electricity from solar and wind power was around 210 won per kWh. Nuclear power generation is not only cost-effective but also environmentally friendly. The claim that spent nuclear fuel can kill people or remain hazardous for 10,000 years is also an exaggeration. Spent nuclear fuel is currently stored in cylindrical containers above ground and can be seen at the Wolseong nuclear power plant. The radiation level near the containers is lower than that in Seoul. If the spent nuclear fuel is buried underground, it is not a significant risk. In fact, the cost of burying spent nuclear fuel is not a major concern, but rather the difficulty of securing a site for burial. For example, the 27,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel from South Korea's nuclear power plants can be buried in a 500-meter thick underground rock formation, which already contains 80,000 tons of uranium and 160,000 tons of thorium. The cost of dealing with a nuclear accident is often exaggerated. The cost of dealing with the TMI accident was around 300 billion won, which is equivalent to the cost of generating 2,000 billion won worth of electricity through nuclear power. The cost of managing spent nuclear fuel is also not a significant concern, as it is already included in the cost of nuclear power generation. South Korea has been accumulating a significant amount of funds for post-accident management, which is higher than that of Sweden, France, and the US. The claim that nuclear power plants cannot be built near cities is also an exaggeration. There are already research reactors operating in the middle of Boston and Cambridge, near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Similarly, small modular nuclear reactors can be built near cities without any significant concerns. Large nuclear power plants can also be built near cities if the site is available and the cooling system is secure. The only reason why large nuclear power plants are not built near cities is that it is more expensive than building them near the coast. However, there are already nuclear power plants operating near cities, such as the one located 95 kilometers upstream of the Seine River in Paris.

**15 Jahre nach tödlichem Bombenunglück: Gefahr besteht weiterhin**
Fifteen years after the deadly bomb explosion in Göttingen, the danger of unexploded bombs remains. An investigation is underway at six suspected sites, where possible unexploded bombs may be located. In 2010, three men from the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit were killed when an unexploded bomb exploded while they were trying to defuse it. According to Luftbilder from World War II, there are 80 possible unexploded bombs still buried in the ground. The next phase of the investigation will begin on June 10, with ground-penetrating radar and magnetometer surveys at six suspected sites, three of which are on private property. Wojtek Bolimowski, a 73-year-old retired violinist, is worried about the potential costs of the investigation, which could be up to €400,000. However, the city of Göttingen has decided to exempt people with a net worth of up to €500,000 from paying for the investigation and potential removal or detonation of the bomb. Christian Schmetz, the First Mayor of Göttingen, stated that the city believes the current regulation is in need of revision and that the federal and state governments should take on more responsibility for the costs. The city of Göttingen has already paid a seven-figure sum for the removal of unexploded bombs in recent years. In Niedersachsen, unexploded bombs with long-delay fuses are no longer defused, but detonated instead. The 'Göttingen Model' has been developed to safely detonate these bombs: a 'bunker' made of water-filled containers is built around the bomb, and a roof is placed on top. However, the work is still hazardous, according to Sprengmeister Thorsten Lüdeke. The investigation is expected to be completed by the end of July, and residents within a 50-meter radius of the suspected sites will be required to leave their homes during the day for safety reasons.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

The Danish government has announced that it will hold a meeting with other countries in the region to discuss the possibility of seizing ships from Russia's 'shadow fleet'. The meeting will take place on Wednesday. France's president, Emmanuel Macron, has compared the situation in Ukraine to the tensions between Taiwan and China, saying that if Russia is allowed to take control of parts of Ukraine without consequences, it could send a dangerous signal to Taiwan. China has rejected the comparison, saying that the two situations are not comparable. Pierre-Emile Højbjerg has signed a permanent contract with Marseille, leaving Tottenham Hotspur. Iran's foreign minister has said that the country has the right to enrich uranium, but not to develop nuclear weapons. The US has proposed a new nuclear deal to Iran, which would stop the country's uranium enrichment program. The deal is still being negotiated. Aarhus Pride will take place on Saturday, with a parade and festivities in the city. The event is expected to attract thousands of people. Nanna Koerstz Madsen is competing in the U.S. Women's Open golf tournament, where she currently holds a 62nd place after the first round. She hopes to move up the rankings after the second round.

**Trump's Cuts to USAID Will Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under the age of five. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.'

**Surviving a Nuclear Attack: A Step-by-Step Guide**
In the event of a nuclear attack, it is essential to know how to behave to increase chances of survival. According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), when the blast wave hits, one should lie on the ground with their face down, arms and hands under their body, and close their eyes to protect themselves from the intense light. After the explosion, it takes 10-12 minutes for the deadly radioactive fallout to subside. It is recommended to stay in the shelter for at least 12-24 hours. The radioactive fallout loses about 99% of its strength after two weeks. To protect the shelter from incoming radiation, one should seal off air conditioning and chimneys, and cover gaps in door frames with tape. The ICRP advises against independent evacuation until the affected areas are identified and safe evacuation routes are established. If one comes into contact with radiation, they should decontaminate themselves by washing with warm water and soap, avoiding conditioners, lotions, and creams that may contain radioactive particles. One should also clean their eyelids, ears, and fingernails thoroughly. Worn clothing and used towels should be sealed and disposed of immediately. After a nuclear explosion, it is recommended to consume iodine-rich foods and only drink water from sealed bottles.

**Houthi Militia's Criminal Behavior: Turning Residential Areas into Explosive Weapon Caches**
A violent explosion rocked a Mawia junction in the eastern suburbs of Taiz city on Thursday, May 29, 205, killing and injuring at least eight civilians. According to local sources, the explosion was caused by a cache of ammunition belonging to a trader loyal to the Houthis, highlighting a recurring pattern of criminal behavior by the militia. The Houthis have repeatedly turned residential areas into explosive weapon caches, putting the lives of civilians at risk at any moment. Sources stated that the Houthis imposed a tight security cordon around the blast site and prevented civilians from approaching, in a desperate attempt to conceal the truth and downplay the actual losses. The explosion in Taiz comes just days after a similar blast in the nearby 'Surf' area near Sana'a airport, which killed dozens of civilians. This tragic repetition confirms that the Houthi militia has learned nothing from its deadly mistakes, but continues to engage in criminal behavior without regard for the lives of innocent Yemenis, according to military analysts. Human rights activists said that turning this area into a delayed-action bomb to kill civilians is a blatant violation of international humanitarian law, which strictly prohibits the use of civilians as human shields or storing weapons in residential areas, violating the basic principles of the Geneva Conventions, which distinguish between combatants and civilians and protect the latter from violence. Analysts say that the Houthis' criminal approach is not new, as they have been accused of storing weapons and ammunition inside or near residential areas, confirming that this is a deliberate and calculated approach, not just an isolated incident, placing the Houthi militia in the same category as terrorist groups that use civilians as human shields to protect their military assets.

**US Nuclear Arsenal: A Legacy of Toxic Waste and a Growing Risk of Accidental War**
For 40 years, the United States produced four nuclear bombs per day, leaving a vast legacy of toxic radioactive waste. The plants in South Carolina, Washington, Ohio, and Idaho that helped produce the 60,000 atomic bombs have tons of waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years. The production of plutonium and bombs stopped in 1989, but with technological improvements, the country plans to reach a production capacity of at least 80 plutonium cores per year by the mid-2030s. Dr. Carlos Umaña, co-president of the International Association of Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, warns that a large-scale nuclear war would not only be quick but also extremely destructive: 'According to the Federation of American Scientists, there are currently 12,000 nuclear warheads in the world, of which 2,000 are at maximum alert, ready to be detonated in just 60 seconds,' he said. Umaña also explains that the detonation of these types of arms in the context of a large-scale nuclear war could destroy the planet in just 72 minutes. Umaña also highlights the risk of cyberattacks or human errors that could trigger a nuclear explosion accidentally, 'As technology advances, so does the risk of cyberterrorism and human error,' he said.

**US Cities and Military Bases at Risk in a Nuclear War: A Study Reveals the Devastating Consequences**
A new study by Halcyon Maps, based on data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and nuclear impact simulations, reveals the regions most affected by a large-scale nuclear war in the United States. The study shows that up to 250 million people could die, equivalent to 75% of the US population. The main cities, military bases, and defense installations would be the first targets of such an attack. The study explains that the main cities, such as New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Houston, and Washington D.C., would be the first targets due to their economic, political, and military importance. The silos of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and North Dakota would also be priority targets, as they house the country's main nuclear deterrent. The study warns that the destruction of these areas would have a devastating impact on the economy and make it difficult to respond to the crisis. 'The detonation of multiple bombs would cause massive destruction in the affected cities, with explosions capable of leveling buildings, roads, and infrastructure within a radius of several kilometers,' the study said. 'Millions of people would die instantly, while many others would suffer severe burns and injuries from the shockwave.' The study also highlights the dangers of radiation, which would spread throughout the affected area. 'The radioactive rain, consisting of contaminated debris, would disperse with the winds, exposing the population to lethal levels of radiation,' the study said. 'Those who receive high doses of radiation would experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin damage, and in extreme cases, convulsions and coma.' In the long term, the US would face a nuclear winter, a phenomenon in which the dust and particles generated by the explosions would block sunlight, causing a drastic drop in temperatures. 'This scenario would affect the supply of water and food,' said John Erath, director of policy at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, as reported by Daily Mail.

**A Whole Lot of Nuclear Madness in One Week**
In a week filled with nuclear madness, several alarming events have unfolded. US Intelligence warned of an impending Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear centers, while Iran vowed to rebuild any destroyed facilities. Meanwhile, Japan aims to increase its nuclear power output by 20% by 2040. Additionally, a PhD student, Andrew Haverly, proposed using a massive nuclear explosion to accelerate carbon sequestration, which would involve detonating an 81-gigaton nuclear device in the seabed. Haverly downplayed the risks, stating that the increased global radiation would have 'minimal impact on the world.' However, experts argue that there are safer and more effective methods to reduce carbon emissions. Furthermore, a missile-armed drone exploded on the roof of the Chornobyl reactor dome, causing a fire and raising concerns about the safety of the nuclear site. The article also mentions Trump's proposal to talk to China and Russia about nuclear disarmament, which sounds sensible but is suspect due to its source.

**Scientist Proposes Detonating Massive Nuclear Bomb to Save Environment**
Andrew Haverly, a scientist from the Rochester Institute of Technology (USA), has proposed detonating a massive nuclear bomb to save the environment. According to Haverly, a thermonuclear explosion at the bottom of the ocean would significantly delay the rise in global temperature. He suggests that the resulting basalt particles could react with carbon dioxide and neutralize it. The bomb would need to have a power of around 81 megatons, 1600 times more powerful than the 'Tsar Bomba' thermonuclear bomb. Haverly proposes placing the charges under the Kerguelen Plateau in the Southern Ocean, which is approximately 5 kilometers deep. Haverly notes that the basalt would not only absorb carbon dioxide but also take on a significant portion of the radioactive fallout. However, he acknowledges that the radioactive background at the blast site would increase in the long term, potentially leading to some casualties, but considers this a 'drop in the ocean'. Haverly points out that humanity releases massive amounts of radiation into the atmosphere every year, comparable to 2000 nuclear bombs. He also notes that by 2100, climate change will threaten 30 million lives.

**Scientists Suggest Detonating a Thermonuclear Bomb to Save the Environment**
Andrew Haverly, a scientist from the Rochester Institute of Technology in the US, has proposed the idea of using a nuclear bomb to save the environment. According to his research, published on the arXiv server, using a thermonuclear bomb in the depths of the ocean could be an effective way to slow down global warming. Haverly believes that after the explosion, particles of basaltic rocks, formed as a result of the explosion, would react with carbon dioxide and help reduce its concentration in the atmosphere. The scientist estimates that the bomb's power should be around 81 megatons, which is 1600 times more powerful than the 'Tsar Bomba'. Haverly suggests placing the charges under the Kerguelen Plateau in the Southern Ocean, which is about 5 kilometers deep. The study notes that basalt would absorb not only carbon dioxide but also a significant portion of radioactive emissions. Haverly acknowledged that in the long term, the radioactive background at the explosion site would increase, which could lead to negative consequences, but he called it 'a drop in the ocean'. He noted that people release a huge amount of radiation into the atmosphere every year, comparable to 2000 atomic bombs. Additionally, he emphasized that by 2100, climate change will pose a threat to 30 million lives.

**Nuclear Bomb Detonation to Combat Global Warming: A Shocking Proposal**
Andrew Haverly, a researcher from the Rochester Institute of Technology in the US, has proposed a shocking idea to combat global warming. He suggests detonating a powerful nuclear bomb at a great depth in the ocean to help nature. According to Haverly, the explosion of a thermonuclear device would break down basalt rocks into microscopic particles, which would then react with carbon dioxide and neutralize it. The researcher estimates that the bomb would need to be around 81 megatons in power, 1600 times more powerful than the infamous 'Tsar Bomba'. Haverly believes that the best location for such an explosion would be under the Kerguelen Plateau in the Southern Ocean, at a depth of approximately 5 kilometers. He also claims that basalt would not only absorb carbon dioxide but also partially neutralize radiation. However, Haverly acknowledges that the radiation level in the area would increase in the long term, potentially causing some casualties. Nevertheless, he considers this a 'drop in the ocean' compared to the current problems. Haverly notes that humanity already releases a massive amount of radiation into the atmosphere, equivalent to 2000 nuclear bombs annually. He also states that climate change could threaten the lives of 30 million people by 2100, making his idea a lesser evil.

**Map shows where 75% of US population will die in WWIII nuclear attack**
A new map created by Halcyon Maps reveals the devastating effects of a large-scale nuclear attack on the US, with up to 250 million Americans (about 75% of the country's population) potentially killed. The map, based on data from FEMA, shows that every populated city on the East Coast, Midwest, West Coast, and South could be targeted, with severe fallout and radiation exposure affecting millions. Major metropolitan cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Washington DC would likely be hit first, with the US economy, leadership, and workforce crippled. Even areas that would avoid immediate obliteration would become uninhabitable in the nuclear winter that would follow. As John Erath, Senior Policy Director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said, 'Any nuclear war or weapons detonation would be bad for everyone. Nowhere is truly safe from fallout and other consequences.'

**Surviving a Nuclear Explosion: Expert Advice**
Scientist Aythami Soto explains the key steps to minimize risk and survive a nuclear explosion and its consequences. If you're close to the epicenter, survival is unlikely. 'People would be directly vaporized in a certain range', warns Soto. At a distance, the extreme heat would cause third-degree burns, while the shockwave could topple buildings and throw people in the air. 'If you're on the street, you die', he states. The main threat after the explosion is radioactive fallout. 'If the wind blows towards you, you'll get hit with the 'fallout', radioactive rain', explains Soto. To minimize exposure, it's crucial to quickly find a closed space, away from windows and doors. 'Put wet towels in the gaps to prevent radioactive dust from entering', he recommends. The highest radiation risk occurs in the first hours. 'The most radioactive products emit radiation freely at first', says Soto. The radiation dose decreases dramatically in 48 hours, so it's essential to stay in the shelter during that time. 'If you leave before, you'll be exposed to a lethal dose of radiation'. Contaminated water and food can also be a threat. 'Isolate water and food to prevent contamination', suggests the expert. Seal containers tightly and avoid consuming exposed products to prevent radioactive poisoning. After the critical period, it's possible to leave with caution. 'Cesium and strontium will remain present for decades, but the immediate danger decreases after 48 hours', explains Soto. However, the chaos, emergency service saturation, and desolation will make long-term survival a challenge. According to Soto, total safety depends on distance and attack conditions. 'At 20 or 30 kilometers, the 'fallout' could reach, but it depends on the wind and explosion magnitude', he comments. Getting away from the affected area as soon as possible, if possible, can make a difference. Knowing how to act in an extreme situation like this can save lives. Although the possibility of a nuclear war remains low, knowing these basic survival measures is essential.
