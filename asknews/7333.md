**Syria's Stock Exchange Reopens After Six-Month Hiatus**
The Damascus Stock Exchange in Syria has reopened after a six-month hiatus. The new Syrian government is expecting investments to double by the end of the summer. According to Economy and Industry Minister Nidal Şaar, 'The economic atmosphere in Syria is already ready for investments from both within the country and from the Arab world and the international community.' He added that the priority in the coming period will be to 'eradicate the remnants of the previous regime's mentality.' The exchange reopened with 14 out of 28 listed companies' shares trading again. The Syrian economy has been isolated for years, but the lifting of US and EU sanctions in May has opened the door to cooperation with regional and international financial institutions. Syria has recently signed a $7 billion deal with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish, and US companies, and a 20-year investment agreement with a Chinese company for free trade zones.

**Syrian Minister Announces Reopening of Damascus Stock Exchange**
The Syrian Minister of Finance, Muhammad Yasser al-Berni, announced the reopening of the Damascus Stock Exchange after a 6-month hiatus. The exchange had stopped trading on December 5, 2024, due to the need to assess the operational and financial situation of the participating companies, complete the disclosure of the damages and losses incurred, and reduce the risk of manipulation and money laundering. Al-Berni said during the ceremony: 'The reopening of the Damascus Stock Exchange is a message that the Syrian economy has started to move and grow.' He added that 'the Damascus Stock Exchange will be a private company and a real center for developing the Syrian economy, and we will work to keep up with digital developments.' Al-Berni also stated that 'our economic vision is based on justice and fairness, private sector leadership, and attracting investment, and we will work to facilitate work, and there are promising investment opportunities.' The executive director of the Damascus Stock Exchange, Dr. Basel As'ad, said: 'The opening of the Damascus Stock Exchange is a historic and important day for Syria, and we are ready to return and perform our role in the coming period, where investments will be greater and wider in the new Syria.' Dr. As'ad added: 'Despite the limited capabilities, we were able to implement what was required of us with transparency and preserving the ownership of investors, and we will be able to keep up with future developments.' The chairman of the board of directors of the Securities and Stock Market Authority, Dr. Abdul Razzaq al-Qasim, said that the resumption of trading in the Damascus Stock Exchange means a new chapter in the history of the Syrian securities and stock market sector. He explained that 'after lifting the sanctions and opening up to Arab and international investments, Syria will be a fertile land for investment opportunities, and our vision is a long-term one that suits the capabilities and capacities of our country towards the future.'

**US STOCKS-Wall Street set for lower open after Trump's steel tariff threat | Headlines**
Wall Street's main indexes are expected to open lower on Monday after President Donald Trump announced plans to double tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to 50% from 25%, starting Wednesday. This move has fueled uncertainty around U.S. trade policies. Shares of U.S. steel companies rose in premarket trading, but shares of automakers fell. Peter Andersen, founder at Andersen Capital Management, said, 'People have been thinking about that (steel tariffs) and trying to formulate the economic impact. It presents the markets with a lot of uncertainty right now.' The increased levies risk deepening Trump's global trade war and dousing enthusiasm in markets. A temporary relief on some levies on China and a rollback of steep tariff threats on the European Union helped the benchmark S&P 500 log its best monthly performance in 18 months in May. However, Kyiv's strike on Moscow's nuclear-capable bombers on Sunday has renewed concerns around further escalation of the war. Most megacap and growth stocks were down, with Alphabet leading losses, down 2.2%. Tesla lost over 1% after it reported lower monthly sales for Portugal, Denmark, and Sweden. The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will present opening remarks before the Federal Reserve Board International Finance Division's 75th anniversary conference later in the day, which may provide insight into interest rate cuts. On the data front, a reading of S&P Global U.S. manufacturing PMI is due at 9:45 a.m. ET and ISM's manufacturing activity index is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. ET. Investors are also looking ahead to a crucial nonfarm-payrolls report on Friday to gauge the U.S. labor market's strength amid tariff volatility.

**Damascus Stock Exchange Reopens After Six Months, Hopes to Double Investments**
The Damascus Stock Exchange reopened after six months of closure, with the hope of doubling investments. The Syrian government is counting on a significant increase in investments by the end of the summer. 'Today's reopening of the Damascus Stock Exchange marks a crucial step in the economic relaunch process,' said Fadi Jleilati, president of the exchange's board of directors, while highlighting the challenge of 'integrating into global financial markets.' Fourteen of the 28 listed companies resumed their market activities on Monday. The exchange has moved to new premises in the Yaafour complex, near the capital. The reopening follows the lifting of US and European sanctions against Syria, allowing public and private actors to reconnect with regional and international financial institutions. The lifting of sanctions has also enabled authorities to conclude investment contracts, including a $7 billion energy agreement signed last Thursday with a consortium of US, Qatari, and Turkish companies to rehabilitate the war-torn country's electricity sector. The government's priority is to improve living standards, with the minister of economy, Mohammad Nidal al-Chaar, stating that 'God willing, investments and capital have begun to flow into Syria, and we expect their volume to double by the end of this summer.' The authorities aim to create a favorable investment climate by promoting a new investment law and lifting international sanctions progressively. According to al-Chaar, 'the economic environment is now almost ready to welcome investments,' and the priority is to 'break with the inherited mentality of the old regime.' The government's efforts focus on 'improving the standard of living of citizens by creating economic opportunities and attracting foreign capital.' The minister emphasized his commitment to building 'a competitive market economy where the state facilitates the production process.'

**Tokyo Stock Exchange Expected to Open with Bearish Tone Amid US-China Trade Tensions**
The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is expected to open with a bearish tone today, driven by concerns over the escalation of US-China trade tensions and the potential imposition of a 50% tariff on steel imports. The TSE's Nikkei 225 futures contract fell 255 yen to 37,705 yen in the overnight session. The market is expected to open with a sell-off, following the US court's decision to stop a lower court's ruling that temporarily suspended the Trump tariffs. The market's downward momentum is expected to continue, with the 200-day moving average (37,794 yen) serving as a key support level. However, the market's short-term bullish trend is expected to persist, with the 5-day moving average (37,875 yen) above the 200-day average. Investors are expected to remain cautious, with the Trump administration's criticism of China on social media adding to the market's negative sentiment. The Nikkei 225 futures contract is expected to face resistance at the May 29 high (38,454 yen) and the psychological level of 39,000 yen.

**Stock Exchanges Closed on Good Friday and Easter Monday**
Most stock exchanges in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland), the UK, and many other international markets will be closed on Good Friday, April 18, 2025, and Easter Monday, April 21, 2025. This means that there will be no trading, buying, or selling of stocks on these classical markets. However, there are some markets that will remain open.

On Easter Monday, most European stock exchanges will also be closed, including those in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the UK, and Hong Kong.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are not affected by holidays and are traded 24/7. However, trading in stocks is more challenging on holidays, with the OTC market (Over-the-Counter) often having lower capital volumes and higher spreads between buying and selling prices.

**Is The US Stock Market Open On Good Friday?**
The US stock market will be closed on Good Friday, April 18, and will reopen on Monday, April 21. The Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) will remain closed on this day, while the U.S. bond market will close early at 2 p.m. ET on Thursday, April 17.

Interestingly, historical data suggests that this Good Friday break tends to have a positive impact on the markets. While trading is paused on major exchanges, other parts of daily life carry on, including the U.S. Postal Service and most banks.

However, supermarkets, restaurants, and government offices will be open, although some stores and businesses may close or change their hours on Easter Sunday. Many Christians in the US will celebrate Good Friday with fasting and religious services, and churches will hold special events to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Although Semana Santa is not a national holiday, Spring Break is a period expected by students and families, but its date is not yet fixed as it varies by educational institution.

**Market: Initiatives become more limited**
The Paris Stock Exchange is expected to open without much enthusiasm on Friday morning, as the dominant trend that has been in place since the beginning of the year seems to be fading, with the decline of US stocks and the approach of the German elections this weekend. The CAC 40 index is expected to open in a very slight increase, or around equilibrium. The market is heading for a weekly loss of around 0.7%, which could end a series of five consecutive weeks of growth. A small trend of profit-taking is emerging after the strong upward movement at the beginning of the year, which had led the CAC to return to a trent of points from its historic record set last year. Investors seem to be stuck between the hopes of a possible peace agreement in Ukraine and strong corporate results on the one hand, and economic uncertainties on the other. 'Investors are desperately searching for a theme or a catalyst to cling to, and in the meantime, the markets seem to be a bit lost,' observes Michael Brown, strategist at Pepperstone. The appetite for risk is also waning on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 index ended down 0.5% yesterday after setting new highs on Wednesday. Investors are also tempted to play it safe two days before the German legislative elections, which will take place this Sunday. Analysts fear the scenario of a 'status quo' politics, while the first European economy needs, in their view, real reforms to relaunch its growth. 'The greatest hope of the markets seems to be that the next German government will finally reform the debt brake rule created during the 2009 global financial crisis to ensure the country's financial stability,' comments Lowie Debou, manager at DPAM. 'This rule currently limits the government's additional structural spending to 0.35% of GDP, a figure that most agree is insufficient to meet the growing investment needs of Germany,' he recalls.

**Wall Street Closed: Alternative Markets for Trading**
Wall Street will be closed on February 17, 2025, due to the Presidents' Day holiday. This means that trading on US stocks and indices will not be possible. However, there are alternative markets that can be used for trading. These include the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Nikkei 225), the London Stock Exchange (FTSE 100), the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (DAX 40), and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (Hang Seng). Additionally, the Forex market is open 24/7 and can be used for trading currencies. The CME Group will also maintain some of its markets open, including futures on metals and energy products. It's worth noting that trading on these alternative markets may require different strategies and approaches than trading on Wall Street. As always, it's essential to do your own research and consider your own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.

**Why is the US stock market closed today?**
The US stock market will be closed on February 17, 2025, in observance of President's Day. The Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchanges will be closed, but there are pre-market and after hours trading sessions available. Some online brokers allow trading during these hours, but it's essential to check with your broker to see if you're eligible. Extended Markets carry risks, with higher volatility and less liquidity. The US bond market will be closed, but the federal bank, currency, commodities, and global financial markets are expected to remain open. Japan's 10-year government bond yield rose to its highest level in nearly 15 years, driven by robust economic growth data. Japan's GDP grew by 0.7% quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter, exceeding expectations. The favorable data points to a hawkish view for the Bank of Japan's monetary policy, with additional rate hikes expected later this year. Gold prices surged above $2,900 per ounce on Monday, indicating a likely technical rebound after its biggest one-day decline in two months. Traders are concerned about market disruptions caused by US President Donald Trump's tariff threats and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy outlook.
