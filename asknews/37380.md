**Fuel prices to drop to GH¢12 per litre in June - AOMCs predict**
According to Dr Riverson Oppong, the Chief Executive Officer of the Association of Oil Marketing Companies (AOMCs), fuel prices in Ghana are expected to drop significantly in June 2025, potentially selling at GH¢12 per litre. Dr Oppong attributed the expected decline to the continued appreciation of the Ghanaian cedi against the US dollar. He noted that if the cedi maintains its strength, consumers may enjoy further relief in the coming days. Dr Oppong emphasized that the strengthening of the cedi is playing a major role in reducing fuel prices, particularly in the conversion of international petroleum prices from dollars to cedis. As Dr Oppong said, 'Believe me, in the next window, we are even foreseeing petrol selling for GH¢12. The forecast will be by Thursday if the cedi continues with its stability.'

**Natural Gas Price Trend and Indexes Database 2025: Track Real-Time Pricing**
The natural gas price trend in Q1 2025 showed significant volatility across regions. In the US, prices reached 3.65 USD/MMBtu in March, driven by milder winter temperatures and brief cold snaps. In China, prices fluctuated between 2.87 USD/MMBtu in March and 2.65 USD/MMBtu in February, influenced by warmer weather and reduced heating demand. In Saudi Arabia, prices reached 2.88 USD/MMBtu in March, driven by strong industrial demand and a surge in electricity consumption. The natural gas price index is calculated by averaging spot prices from different trading hubs, and several key factors impact natural gas price forecasts, including supply levels, global demand, weather conditions, geopolitical events, and LNG trade flows. The expected outlook for natural gas prices in 2025 is a gradual rise, with some seasonal and regional fluctuations, with average prices expected to stay between $2.50-$4.00/MMBtu in the US.

**Natural Gas News: Market Bears Eye Break Below $3.181 as Supply Builds Today**
The natural gas market is facing downward pressure due to strong U.S. production and heavy storage builds. Last week's 120 Bcf storage injection, well above the five-year average, has reaffirmed oversupply concerns. Inventories now sit at 2,375 Bcf, 3.9% above the five-year norm. Dry gas production continues to run hot, averaging 107 Bcf/day in the Lower 48, up nearly 5% from a year ago. While electricity demand ticked up, much of the U.S. remains under mild temperatures, limiting gas-fired generation. The market is leaning bearish, backed by strong production, hefty storage builds, and mediocre demand. Unless early June heat materializes to boost power burn or production moderates, prices are likely to test support levels more aggressively.

**JAL Applies for New Fuel Surcharge for International Cargo Flights**
Japan Airlines (JAL) has applied to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism to implement a new fuel surcharge for international cargo flights starting June 1, 2025. Based on the average price of jet fuel in April 2025, which was $80.68 per barrel, the fuel indicator price will be set at '80.00 or more but less than 85.00', resulting in a fuel surcharge of ¥56 per kg for long-haul routes to the US and Europe, ¥34 per kg for long-haul routes to Asia, and ¥30 per kg for short-haul routes to Asia. JAL will adjust the fuel surcharge 12 times a year, using the average price of jet fuel in the preceding month as the fuel indicator price, as determined by the following table, which was introduced in April 2024.

**Gas prices hit 4-year low ahead of Memorial Day weekend**
Gas prices heading into the Memorial Day weekend have hit a four-year low, with the average US retail gasoline price averaging $3.17 per gallon, 11% lower than last year. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), this is largely due to falling crude oil prices. Despite typical price increases heading into the spring and summer months, prices are expected to remain low, with Lipow Oil Associates President Andy Lipow predicting prices to stay between $3.25 and $3.50 per gallon this summer. OPEC+ estimates global oil demand will grow by 1.3 million barrels per day in both 2025 and 2026, and may make another large output increase in June, causing oil prices to fall further. Phil Flynn, Futures Group senior analyst, said 'OPEC wants to keep President Trump happy' by raising production and taking away voluntary production cuts, which 'puts a negative spin on prices'.

**Record-Breaking Travel Expected for Memorial Day Weekend**
This year's Memorial Day weekend is expected to break the record for the most travelers in the past two decades, with over 45 million people in the US planning to travel at least 85 kilometers from their homes between May 22nd and May 26th. According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), the majority of travelers will choose to drive, which could establish a new record for national travel during this holiday. AAA spokesperson Aixa Díaz said, 'People still feel good about spending money on travel.' The AAA expects around 86% of travelers to drive to their destinations, with over 39 million people (1 million more than in 2024) planning to take road trips. 'Many families find it easier and cheaper to drive than to fly,' added Díaz. With gas prices expected to be lower in May and June, drivers may benefit from the lower costs. According to the Consumer Price Index, the average price of regular gasoline in the US is currently $3.18 per gallon, compared to $3.60 per gallon in May and June 2024. INRIX, a transportation data company, predicts that the worst traffic will occur in the afternoons and evenings, advising drivers to leave before 1pm on Thursday, May 22nd, and before 11am on Friday, May 23rd. On Memorial Day itself, May 26th, INRIX expects the busiest time on the roads to be between 2pm and 7pm, as 'air safety has been on people's minds, and many fear flying.'

**French Gas Bills to Decrease in June 2025**
French households may soon benefit from a temporary reduction in their gas bills. In May, the reference tariff for gas decreased by 6.4%, bringing the price to 14.27 centimes per kilowatt-hour. This is expected to be followed by another reduction in June, with a 5.3% decrease in the gas tariff. According to Selectra Capital, the average gas price will drop to 0.1100 euros per kWh, down from 0.1162 euros. For households using gas for heating, this translates to a yearly savings of 158 euros. However, not all households will benefit from this reduction, as those with contracts tied to market prices will not see a decrease in their gas bills until the end of their contract. 'This means that households with these contracts will not benefit from the price drop in June,' said Capital. 'They will need to wait until the end of their contract to take advantage of the lower prices.'

**Gas Prices to Decrease by 5.3% Starting June 1**
The price of gas is expected to decrease by 5.3% starting from June 1, 2025, according to the Commission de régulation de l'énergie (CRE). This reduction will bring the average price of gas from 0.1162 euros to 0.1100 euros per kWh, including taxes, for households that heat with gas. For a reference annual consumption of 11,200 kWh, the average gas bill for households will decrease from 1,579 euros in May to approximately 1,510 euros in early June, resulting in an annual savings of 69 euros. Taking into account the decrease in May, the average gas bill will decrease by 158 euros per year. However, only households with gas contracts that are indexed to the CRE's reference price will benefit from this reduction. These contracts automatically reflect the changes in the tariff. Currently, nearly two-thirds of commercialized contracts in France are fixed-rate contracts, which do not reflect price decreases during the contract period. To benefit from the price reduction, households can switch to an indexed contract.

**Oil prices are down over last 6 months: what does it mean for gas prices?**
Oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels since spring 2021, with a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude currently priced at $59. Despite this, gas prices have risen slightly since January, up approximately ten cents per gallon. However, they are still 50 cents lower than they were a year ago. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects gas prices to ease as the year goes on, with a forecasted average price of $3.10 per gallon for this summer, which would be the lowest inflation-adjusted summer average price since 2020. Several OPEC+ members are suggesting the group accelerates oil output hikes in June, which could further impact oil prices. According to the EIA, global oil inventories are expected to increase starting in mid-2025 as OPEC+ members unwind production cuts and oil demand growth slows.

**Gas prices: Decreases at the pumps across the country to end the week - Washington Examiner**
After two weeks of increases, gas prices have started to trend downward again, with the national average cost for a gallon of regular gas decreasing to $3.114 on Friday, according to AAA. This marks a decrease from last week's price of $3.162 and is also cheaper than a month ago when regular gas was $3.12 per gallon. The current price is also lower than on former President Joe Biden's last day in office when the cost was $3.125 per gallon. Lower gas prices are a welcome sight for the country, which has been plagued with high gas costs since Biden's first year in office. In comparison, gas prices hit over $3 per gallon in June 2021, less than six months after Biden's inauguration, and reached $4.929 in June 2022, the most expensive gas in the nation's history. Fuel costs vary nationwide, with some states much higher than others, ranging from $2.672 per gallon in Mississippi to $4.799 in California.

**Gas prices: Slight decrease at the pumps to end the week - Washington Examiner**
The national average price for regular gas decreased slightly to $3.162 per gallon on Friday, according to AAA. This marks a change from a week ago when gas cost $3.165 per gallon. Despite the current drop, gas prices are more expensive now than a month ago, when they were $3.126. However, prices are concurrently less expensive than the national average price for regular gas this time last year, when it cost $3.274 per gallon. Gas prices have fluctuated over the last year, with prices reaching their highest level in the country's history in June 2022 at $4.929. Prices have continued to fluctuate, with some states experiencing drops at the pumps while others have seen increases. For example, California's gas prices have soared over the last month, rising approximately 40 cents to $4.845 per gallon.

**Trump's Sanctions Drive Up Gas Prices in the US**
Gas prices in the US are rising significantly due to Trump's sanctions and refinery maintenance. According to a report by 'Newsweek', the West Coast is expected to see further price increases. The main reasons for the price surge are maintenance work at refineries and unexpected outages, which have led to a decline in production. Additionally, international factors are at play, including new sanctions imposed by the Trump administration on Russia and Iran, which have created uncertainty in oil imports and driven up prices. As a result, the oil price reached a two-week high on Tuesday, directly impacting gas prices. The national average gas price is currently $3.141 per gallon, slightly below last year's average of $3.189 per gallon. This could lead to a return to record-high gas prices, which reached $6 per gallon in California in June 2022. Many Americans are unhappy with the rising living costs, which contradicts President Trump's promise to lower these costs.

**Gas prices: Over a week straight of increases at the pumps - Washington Examiner**
The national average price for a gallon of regular gas has increased for over a week, reaching $3.16 on Thursday, according to AAA. This is more expensive than last week's average price of $3.138 and higher than a month ago's price of $3.065. However, it is still less expensive than a year ago, when the price was $3.225 per gallon. The recent increase coincides with President Trump's tariffs on Mexico and Canada, which were initially supposed to go into effect on February 1. Gas prices were a point of contention during former President Biden's term, with costs increasing significantly compared to Trump's first term. The national average price for a gallon of regular gas peaked at $4.929 in June 2022, the highest national average cost in the nation's history.

The national average price for a gallon of regular gas on Monday was $3.098, a decrease from last week's price of $3.12 per gallon. However, gas prices are still higher than a month ago, when the national average price was $3.067. The price of gas has fluctuated over the past few years, peaking at $4.929 in June 2022. Despite decreases in gas prices under former President Trump, prices vary across the country, ranging from $2.675 to $4.54 per gallon. Currently, Hawaii has the most expensive gas prices, while Mississippi has the lowest fuel costs. In the capital region, prices have started to drop recently, with Virginia's average gas price decreasing to $3.038 on Monday.
