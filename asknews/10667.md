**Musk: Chances of Starship Flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50**
Elon Musk said that the chances of Starship flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50. The spacecraft has already completed nine test flights, with the last one taking place on May 27. However, the mission ended in an emergency due to a fuel leak. The previous flights in January and March also ended in failure, with the spacecraft exploding within the first 10 minutes of flight. Despite this, Musk is optimistic about the progress made and believes that the data collected will help improve the spacecraft. The next version of Starship, Version 3, is expected to be 124.4 meters tall and will be capable of flying to Mars. The spacecraft will be reusable and will have a refueling system on orbit, which is necessary for long-distance space travel. The first flight of this version is planned for the end of this year, and if successful, Starship may fly to Mars as early as next year. SpaceX plans to send five Starship Version 3 spacecraft to Mars in 2026 to test the spacecraft and its technologies. However, Musk believes that it will be challenging to achieve this goal, citing the need to master the refueling of Starship in space as the main problem. He estimates the chances of success as 50/50. If successful, SpaceX plans to send around 20 spacecraft to Mars in 2028-2029, which may be crewed. However, Musk also suggests that two robotic landings may be conducted before sending humans. The final decision will be made later. In the third launch window (2030-2031), up to 100 Starship spacecraft may be sent to Mars, and in the next window (2033), up to 500. SpaceX is currently searching for a suitable location for a Martian city, which should be relatively far from the poles, have access to water ice, and have a flat surface for landings and takeoffs. The main candidate is the Arcadia Planitia region. The ultimate goal is to create a self-sufficient settlement on Mars with a population of over a million people, which will require transporting millions of tons of cargo. According to Musk, the construction and maintenance of such a city will be carried out using Starship, possibly its future 142-meter version. During periods of Earth-Mars alignment, thousands of upper stages of the spacecraft will be able to arrive and depart.

**Musk Expresses Disappointment with Recent Tax and Spending Bill**
Elon Musk expressed disappointment with the recent tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, which he believes will increase the budget deficit and weaken the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk stated, 'Frankly, I am disappointed to see this bill. Not only did it not reduce the budget deficit, but it increased the deficit and weakened the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).' The bill, which was strongly supported by President Trump, will extend corporate and individual tax cuts, increase defense spending, and provide more funds to combat illegal immigration, resulting in a projected $3.8 trillion deficit by 2034, according to the U.S. Congressional Budget Office. Musk also mentioned that his future work will focus more on 'those projects with the highest input-output ratio.'

**Elon Musk say it's '50/50' he'll land on Mars next year and he needs to 'get lucky' - Daily Star**
Elon Musk says there is a '50/50 chance' of landing a spaceship on Mars next year, and he needs to 'get lucky'. Despite recent test flight failures, Musk remains optimistic about progress towards establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars. He believes reusable rockets will enable more than a million people to live on Mars within 30 years. Musk hopes to send 20 ships to Mars between 2028 and 2029, with the goal of building a self-sufficient city that could survive even if cut off from Earth. He is scouting possible sites for a Mars city, with Arcadia Planitia being the leading candidate. Musk aims to fly 100 ships to Mars between 2030 and 2031 and 500 more in 2033. He said, 'This is, like, an incredible thing to have - this amazing city on Mars, the first city on another planet and a new world.'

**Elon Musk Denies Excessive Drug Use During 2024 US Presidential Election**
Elon Musk denied using drugs excessively during the 2024 American presidential election campaign. A report by The New York Times claimed that Musk used substances beyond occasional use, citing sources familiar with his activities. Musk responded on X, saying, 'To be clear, I am not using drugs! The New York Times was lying outrageously. I tried prescribed ketamine a few years ago and mentioned it on X, so that's not news. It helps get out of dark mental holes, but I haven't used it since then.' Musk also claimed that he took ecstasy and psilocybin mushrooms and carried a daily medication box containing around 20 pills, including Adderall, according to a photo of the box and people who saw it. Musk maintains good relations with Trump, but has expressed disappointment with the US government and frustration with the obstacles he faced in trying to eliminate federal bureaucracy, raising questions about the strength of the alliance between the president and the world's richest man. Musk was the largest known political donor in the 2024 elections and told Trump's advisors this year that he would donate $100 million to groups controlled by the president's team before the 2026 midterm elections. However, the money has not been received yet, according to sources familiar with the matter.

**Trump Withdraws Nomination of Isaacman as NASA Head, Deal Blow to Elon Musk**
A surprise turn of events has dealt a setback to Elon Musk. Trump had nominated a close friend of the tech billionaire, Isaacman, as the new head of NASA, but Trump has now withdrawn his nomination. Trump did not comment on the reasons for his decision, but it is believed that Isaacman's past donations to the Democratic Party and his close ties to Musk may have been factors. Musk is stepping down as a special envoy to the US government. This comes at a bad time for Musk, as the US government plans to cut NASA's budget by a quarter and reduce its staff by a third. The government also plans to redefine NASA's mission, with a focus on missions to the moon and Mars. This is important for SpaceX, which is developing the Starship rocket, capable of carrying up to 100 tons of cargo and potentially enabling a manned mission to Mars in a few years. Musk aims to send a million people to Mars by 2050. However, SpaceX has faced repeated setbacks in the development of the Starship, including a recent test flight that ended in a crash in the Indian Ocean. Musk remains undeterred, and has outlined an ambitious plan for a Mars mission, including a unmanned flight in 2026, a crewed flight in 2027, and the establishment of a Mars station in 2029, with the help of Optimus robots built by Tesla.

**Musk retains plan to fly Starship to Mars in 2026 despite setbacks**
Elon Musk has reaffirmed his plan to send Starship to Mars in 2026, despite recent setbacks in test flights. Musk stated that the success of this mission depends on Starship's ability to accomplish several challenging technical feats, including a post-launch refueling manoeuvre in earth orbit. He gave SpaceX a 50% chance of meeting the deadline. If not, the company will wait two years before trying again. Musk envisions launching 1,000 to 2,000 ships to Mars every two years to establish a self-sustaining human settlement. NASA plans to return humans to the moon aboard Starship in 2027, with the goal of launching astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. Musk has previously aimed to send an uncrewed vehicle to Mars by 2018 and a crewed mission by 2024, but has since pushed back the timeline.

**Elon Musk's Future in US Politics: 'I Will Make Much Less' of a Contribution**
Elon Musk has shaken up the Republican Party by announcing that he will 'make much less' of a financial contribution in the future. Musk stated, 'I don't see a reason to keep doing it.' This could potentially cost the Republican Party one of its most generous sources of funding, ahead of the 2026 legislative elections and a potential Trump presidency. Tesla is currently facing crisis and internal politics in the US government, with the company's visibility in politics reaching 13% in Georgia. Meanwhile, Javier Milei's 'scythe' (motosierra) has been seen as a symbolic representation of his opposition to Musk and his policies. It remains to be seen whether Musk's decision is a permanent retirement or a strategic pause.

**Elon Musk's Ambitious Plan to Colonize Mars: 5 to 500 Starships by 2033**
Elon Musk plans to send five Starships to Mars in 2026, followed by a drastic increase in the number of launches, with 20 in 2028, 100 in 2030, and 500 in 2033. According to Musk, this plan is a crucial step in colonizing Mars. As Musk said, 'This is a radical plan, but it's necessary to ensure the survival of humanity.' However, some experts question the feasibility of this ambitious plan, wondering if it's a point of inflection for humanity or simply a sign of Musk's mental detachment.

**Musk Comments on Potential Trump Reelection in 2032**
Elon Musk, the head of the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), commented on the hypothetical re-election of US President Donald Trump for a fourth term in 2032, urging 'think ahead'. 'Think ahead!' - Musk commented on a post in the X social network, which featured a picture of a baseball cap with the slogan 'Trump 2032'. Earlier, Trump's online store placed a baseball cap with the inscription 'Trump 2028' on its website, which may indicate the president's intention to run for a third term.

**Are we sure 2028 3rd term Trump, isn't just an excuse for a 2031 President Musk?**
The author suggests that the '2028 3rd term Trump' movement is not about Donald Trump running for a third term, but rather a ploy to pave the way for Elon Musk to become president. The author claims that Musk has been trying to become president since 2020, but was denied due to his non-American citizenship. The author believes that Musk is using his wealth to pay off Trump's debts in exchange for support in rewriting the constitution to allow non-Americans to run for president. This would allow Musk to run for office, despite not being born in the United States.

**Will an AI Candidate Run for President in 2032?**
Elon Musk has sparked debate by predicting the possibility of an AI candidate running for the U.S. presidency in 2032. He believes that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could emerge as early as 2026 and undermine democracy. Supporters argue that AI could remove emotional biases and corruption from politics, while critics worry about accountability and the potential for AI to malfunction or stray from its objectives. A 'hybrid' future, where human leaders are augmented by AI systems, is also being considered. Musk's comments highlight the need for caution and clear guidelines for AI use in governance and society. The debate encourages us to think critically about technology's role in democracy and whether removing emotions, flaws, and biases from leadership creates an even greater risk of losing what makes us human.

**Milei to Return to US to Strengthen Ties with Trump Administration**
Argentine President Javier Milei is set to return to the United States before the end of the month to attend a new summit of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and meet with Elon Musk, owner of Tesla and a member of the new Republican administration. According to sources from the Presidency, Milei's visit aims to strengthen ties between his government and the Trump administration, which shares similar ideological views. While it is not confirmed whether Trump and Milei will meet during the visit, it is expected that they will at least cross paths during the CPAC event. Milei has expressed his support for Trump, and the latter has shown gestures of goodwill towards the Argentine leader, including inviting him to a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago mansion after his election and to his inauguration ceremony. Potential joint initiatives between the two governments include a free trade agreement between the US and Argentina, which Milei has repeatedly mentioned as a priority. He has said, 'Imagine how much we would have grown in those two decades if we had traded with the world's first potential power.' Another possible measure is the creation of a Conservative Nations League to counter the 'woke' ideology and the Agenda 2030. Milei has proposed this idea to Trump, as well as to other conservative leaders such as Giorgia Meloni (Italy), Benjamin Netanyahu (Israel), and Nayib Bukele (El Salvador). Additionally, a new meeting with Musk is confirmed, with whom Milei has met several times since taking office. Musk was appointed by Trump to head the Department of Government Efficiency.
