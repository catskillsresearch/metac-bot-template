**EUA to Develop 'Artificial Sun' with Big Tech Support**
Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a startup from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has raised over $1 billion (R$ 5.7 billion) to build the world's first commercial-scale fusion power plant in the United States. The investment was led by an unnamed hyperscale developer, according to Axios Pro. Google and Microsoft, among other big tech companies, have already invested in the project. Microsoft is also the cloud services provider for CFS. The ARC plant, which aims to start operations in the early 2030s, will generate 400 megawatts of clean and carbon-free electricity, enough to power large industrial facilities or around 150,000 homes. The plant will be built in collaboration with Dominion Energy Virginia, which will provide development and technical expertise, as well as land rights. CFS will finance, build, own, and operate the plant independently. The project is seen as a cleaner alternative to nuclear fission, using less resources and generating no long-lasting radioactive waste. However, harnessing fusion energy has proven to be challenging, requiring high temperatures to create and maintain the fusion reaction. CFS is currently developing its SPARC machine, which is expected to produce its first plasma in 2026 and demonstrate a commercially relevant project that produces more energy than it consumes.

**Lee backs nuclear power - for now**
Presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being', but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables to supply industrial hubs and aims to phase out coal by 2040. He supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' In contrast, Lee's main rival, Kim Moon-soo, supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60% of the mix. South Korea's latest energy blueprint aims for nuclear to make up 35% of the power mix by 2038, with renewables at 29%. If elected, Lee is expected to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30% of the power mix by 2030.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**Solar Power Surpasses Nuclear Power Globally for the First Time**
According to Ember's research, solar power has surpassed nuclear power globally for the first time in April, generating 233 Terawatt-hours compared to the 213 Terawatt-hours produced by nuclear power. This milestone is the result of a long-standing competition between the two energy sources, although it is not yet definitive due to the fluctuations inherent in solar power. In the past five years, the global capacity of solar power has tripled, largely thanks to massive Chinese investments. Solar power is now competing with nuclear power for the fourth spot among energy sources, preceded by various hydrocarbons (coal remains the most used), hydroelectric, and wind power. Renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power, have generated 32% of the world's electricity consumption, according to Ember's data. However, the growth of renewable energy has not been accompanied by a corresponding reduction in other energy sources, leading to increased consumption and emissions. As a result, 2024 was also a record year for oil and coal consumption, as well as CO2 emissions. These findings raise further doubts about the opportunity to relaunch nuclear programs, such as those proposed by the Meloni government, considering the long time it takes to build new nuclear power plants, which would only provide the first watts in a couple of decades.

**US Announces Largest 'Deployment' in History: A Global Effort to Combat Fossil Fuels**
The US has announced its largest 'deployment' in history, but it's not a military operation. Instead, it's a global effort to combat fossil fuels, led by tech giants Meta, Amazon, and Google. The companies have joined forces to promote a clean energy future, as reported by The Pulse (translated by Charter97.org). At the CERAWeek conference in Houston, the World Nuclear Association (WNA) signed an agreement to triple the world's nuclear energy production by 2050. This goal has been supported not only by IT companies but also by representatives from the aviation, maritime, oil and gas, and financial sectors. This agreement complements the promise made at the 2023 UN Climate Conference, where over 30 countries and leading financial institutions, including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, agreed to also triple nuclear energy production. The document, titled 'Commitment of Large Energy Consumers,' is the first case where representatives from other industries, aside from nuclear, have officially supported a massive expansion of the nuclear sector. Nuclear energy is a clean and reliable source of power, and it's becoming a key element in the global energy transition. According to WNA data, there are currently 439 reactors in operation worldwide, with a total capacity of 371 gigawatts. However, nuclear energy accounts for only 9% of global electricity production. Expanding these capacities is necessary not only for the environment but also for energy security, especially for countries dependent on imported fossil fuels. 'As the global economy expands, reliable, clean, and sustainable energy supply becomes essential. Nuclear energy can provide a stable energy flow. We're happy to join the joint initiative to develop nuclear energy and confirm our commitment to this direction,' said Urvvi Parekh, Meta's global energy head. Amazon and Google have already announced investments in small modular nuclear reactors (SMR) in October 2024, a technology that could reduce the cost and construction time of new reactors. In December, Meta joined the project and began considering proposals from developers to build up to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity in the US. Tech giants see nuclear energy as a necessary foundation for sustainable development and a key tool for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

**Google's Demis Hassabis Predicts General Intelligence within 5-10 Years**
Google's Demis Hassabis believes that General Intelligence (AGI) could become a reality within the next five to ten years. According to an interview with the New York Times, Hassabis estimates that Google's AI, Gemini, is close to reaching this milestone. Hassabis and OpenAI's Sam Altman both predict that AGI will emerge within the next five years. AGI would be able to reason and adapt to any situation, formulating new conjectures like a mathematician, and would be a significant step up from current specialized AI. Two main technical challenges remain to be solved: generating new intellectual ideas and ensuring intellectual coherence. Google is making significant progress, with Gemini being showcased as the embryo of this future superintelligence. Hassabis believes that the impact of AGI will be immense, going beyond simple assistants and search engines, and could become a universal technological foundation, tackling complex challenges like nuclear fusion and medical breakthroughs. However, Hassabis also emphasizes the need for strong international regulation to mitigate the risks and promises of AGI.

**It’s Getting Serious: Taiwan’s Phasing Out of Nuclear Energy and Furthering its Transition to Green Energy**
Taiwan has shut down its last operational nuclear power plant, marking the end of nearly five decades of nuclear power generation on the island. The country's nuclear era began in 1978, and while nuclear energy once supplied 52% of Taiwan's electricity, this share had fallen to 4% by 2024. Renewables are expected to assume a growing portion of Taiwan's energy demands, but the country faces challenges in achieving scalability, resilience, and independence in a region characterized by geopolitical uncertainty. Dr. Josie-Marie Perkuhn, a researcher at Trier University, notes that Taiwan's experience demonstrates progress towards a green energy future, but also highlights the challenges that remain. The government has laid essential groundwork, and civil society continues to push for accountability and innovation, but the true test lies in achieving a successful energy transition.

**Harnessing the power of the atom**
A new report, 'Harnessing the Power of the Atom', commissioned by the Henry Jackson Society, warns that the West is losing the race for nuclear power to authoritarian regimes like Russia and China. The report argues that the West needs to forge an alliance to expand its influence on the nuclear stage and build more plants like Barakah in the UAE. The authors point out that just 9% of the world's electricity comes from nuclear power, compared to 36% from coal and 22% from natural gas. They also note that nuclear power is safer than oil and coal, and that the death toll from nuclear accidents is fewer than 100, compared to over 4,000 from oil and gas pipeline accidents. The report emphasizes that autocracies have an advantage in the development of nuclear energy, as they can more easily ignore public opinion and use the state to deliver long-term plans. To counter this, the report calls for a Western-led initiative, 'Atoms for Democracy', to secure the energy future and counter China and Russia's grip on the global nuclear market. The report recommends that the US should create an umbrella organisation dedicated to advancing nuclear energy, invite democratic nations and private sector companies to join, and secure credit lines from sovereign funds and big banks. The organisation should also develop a powerful narrative about nuclear energy and democracy, share it with the international media, and organise a yearly summit to court the Global South. By successfully building nuclear power plants, Atoms for Democracy will be able to regain a bigger share of the nuclear marketplace and move at a much faster pace than individual nations.

**Renewable and Nuclear Energy Contribute 41% of Global Electricity Generation**
According to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) 'Global Energy Review 2025' report, 41% of the world's electricity was generated from renewable and nuclear sources last year. The IEA's research associate, Aliaksei Patonia, stated, 'It is likely that the importance of nuclear energy will increase in the foreseeable future.' In 2024, a record $2.1 trillion was invested in clean energy worldwide. The increase in the share of low-carbon sources in electricity generation has transformed global electricity systems. Patonia noted that the widespread use of variable renewable energy sources, investment in grid flexibility, battery storage, and the digitalization of electricity systems to manage fluctuating production are also driving deeper systemic changes. He emphasized that nuclear energy, although not currently regionally balanced, has made a significant contribution to clean energy, and that most new projects are concentrated in China and Russia, while existing plants in the US, Europe, and Asia provide reliable and zero-carbon base load production. Patonia highlighted that nuclear energy can guarantee a fixed load, unlike variable renewable energy sources like solar and wind, and that this, along with other factors, makes it likely that the importance of nuclear energy will increase in the foreseeable future. He also noted that interest in extending the life of existing reactors and implementing new technologies such as small modular reactors (SMRs) is increasing in the US, UK, Canada, and some regions of Europe. He believes that further capacity increases will depend on overcoming challenges related to financing, regulatory frameworks, and public acceptance.

**China Aims to Light Up First 'Nuclear Fusion Lamp' by 2030**
Chinese scientist Li Jianjiang, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, predicts that China will have its first 'nuclear fusion lamp' lit by 2030. 'I believe that by 2030, we will definitely be able to light up the first 'nuclear fusion lamp' in China,' Li said at the 'Good Hope Science Salon' event in Shanghai on April 25. Li shared his vision for 'lighting up the fusion lamp' and his journey in researching controlled nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is a reaction where two lighter atomic nuclei combine at high temperatures and densities to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a vast amount of energy. 'Once fusion power generation is achieved, a cup of seawater can provide energy equivalent to 300 liters of gasoline,' Li said. He has been researching nuclear fusion for over 40 years, starting in 1982, and has led the team in building the world's first fully superconducting tokamak nuclear fusion experimental device, EAST, in Hefei, Anhui Province. The EAST device has broken multiple world records and achieved a record 1 billion degrees Celsius for 1066 seconds in January this year. A compact fusion energy experimental device, BEST, is currently under construction in Hefei. BEST will demonstrate fusion power generation for the first time and lead the research in burning plasma physics. Li predicts that BEST will be completed by 2027 and that the first 'nuclear fusion lamp' will be lit by 2030. 'I believe that humans' ultimate energy structure will be a small part of renewable energy and a large part of fusion energy,' Li said. He sees nuclear fusion as having three advantages: unlimited fuel, zero carbon emissions, and inherent safety. The fuel for fusion reactions is deuterium, which is extracted from seawater, and the reaction produces only helium and neutrons, with no risk of core meltdown. Therefore, fusion power generation can effectively achieve energy peak-shaving and ensure energy security.'
