**UK to Strengthen Nuclear Submarine Fleet in Response to Russian Threat**
The UK will strengthen its nuclear submarine fleet in response to the Russian threat, according to Labour leader Keir Starmer. He has committed to increasing defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with the goal of reaching 3% in the long term. This decision is part of a broader rearmament effort, driven by the current geostrategic situation following Russia's aggression in Ukraine and warnings from Trump that Europe must achieve defense autonomy. The UK, along with France, is one of the two European nuclear powers capable of countering the Russian threat. The new Dreadnought-class submarines will enhance the UK's naval presence, with the ability to launch 12 Trident II D5 missiles and four Spearfish torpedoes. The submarines will be equipped with a Rolls-Royce PWR3 nuclear reactor, offering improved safety and reduced maintenance needs. They are expected to enter service in the 2030s. Starmer attended the keel-laying ceremony for the first Dreadnought-class submarine at the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard, highlighting the importance of the UK's naval industry and announcing that the port of Barrow will be granted 'Royal' status in recognition of its contribution to national security. The cost of the first four submarines is estimated at £41 billion. Starmer also visited the HMS Vanguard after its 204-day patrol, the longest ever undertaken by a British submarine, and expressed his gratitude to the crew and their families for their sacrifice and dedication to the country. 'The UK's nuclear deterrent is the cornerstone of our national security,' he said. 'I am incredibly proud of all that our submariners do to keep us safe.'

The UK government will invest £15 billion in its warhead programme and build up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines as part of the Aukus partnership with the US and Australia. The submarines will replace the UK's seven Astute class submarines and will be in operation from the late 2030s. According to Defence Secretary John Healey, 'Our outstanding submariners patrol 24/7 to keep us and our allies safe but we know that threats are increasing and we must act decisively to face down Russian aggression.' The investment will support 30,000 highly skilled UK jobs and 30,000 apprenticeships. The new submarines will join the four Trident submarines that carry the nation's at-sea nuclear deterrent.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**Europe's Nuclear Renaissance: A Shift Towards Energy Sovereignty**
Most European countries are reevaluating their stance on nuclear energy in response to the climate crisis and increasing electricity demands. The energy source has seen a resurgence in interest, with countries like France, the UK, and Poland planning to expand their nuclear capabilities. France, with 57 reactors, remains the most nuclearized country per capita. The country has announced a new program to build 6 to 14 new reactors, with the first expected to come online in 2038. Other countries, such as Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands, are also considering a return to nuclear energy to reduce their dependence on imported fossil fuels and volatile energy prices. The European Union is expected to realign its energy policies to prioritize carbon neutrality, competitiveness, and sovereignty, without discriminating against low-carbon energy sources. The shift towards nuclear energy is driven by the need for energy sovereignty and decarbonization, as well as the desire to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels.

**US Announces Largest 'Deployment' in History: A Global Effort to Combat Fossil Fuels**
The US has announced its largest 'deployment' in history, but it's not a military operation. Instead, it's a global effort to combat fossil fuels, led by tech giants Meta, Amazon, and Google. The companies have joined forces to promote a clean energy future, as reported by The Pulse (translated by Charter97.org). At the CERAWeek conference in Houston, the World Nuclear Association (WNA) signed an agreement to triple the world's nuclear energy production by 2050. This goal has been supported not only by IT companies but also by representatives from the aviation, maritime, oil and gas, and financial sectors. This agreement complements the promise made at the 2023 UN Climate Conference, where over 30 countries and leading financial institutions, including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, agreed to also triple nuclear energy production. The document, titled 'Commitment of Large Energy Consumers,' is the first case where representatives from other industries, aside from nuclear, have officially supported a massive expansion of the nuclear sector. Nuclear energy is a clean and reliable source of power, and it's becoming a key element in the global energy transition. According to WNA data, there are currently 439 reactors in operation worldwide, with a total capacity of 371 gigawatts. However, nuclear energy accounts for only 9% of global electricity production. Expanding these capacities is necessary not only for the environment but also for energy security, especially for countries dependent on imported fossil fuels. 'As the global economy expands, reliable, clean, and sustainable energy supply becomes essential. Nuclear energy can provide a stable energy flow. We're happy to join the joint initiative to develop nuclear energy and confirm our commitment to this direction,' said Urvvi Parekh, Meta's global energy head. Amazon and Google have already announced investments in small modular nuclear reactors (SMR) in October 2024, a technology that could reduce the cost and construction time of new reactors. In December, Meta joined the project and began considering proposals from developers to build up to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity in the US. Tech giants see nuclear energy as a necessary foundation for sustainable development and a key tool for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

**Korea's presidential front runner Lee Jae-myung backs nuclear power  --  for now**
South Korea's presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being,' but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables, like offshore wind, to supply industrial hubs, and calls for phasing out coal by 2040 and curbing natural gas consumption. Lee supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants, but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues,' Lee said. 'Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' This stance could undermine the nation's atomic energy expansion plans at home and abroad. Lee's main rival, Mr Kim Moon-soo, currently supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60 per cent of the mix by 2038. However, Lee is expected to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30 per cent of the power mix by 2030.

**China and Russia Plan to Build Nuclear Reactor on the Moon by 2035**
China and Russia have announced a joint plan to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2035, which will serve as the energy hub for the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). The ILRS is a robotic outpost, and later a human settlement, near the lunar south pole. The project aims to rival the US-led Artemis program, which involves 55 countries and plans to build a lunar orbital station (the Gateway) and return astronauts to the lunar surface, potentially by December 2025. The Sino-Russian alliance is gaining momentum, with 17 countries already partnering with the ILRS, and plans to expand to 50 countries, 500 scientific institutions, and 5,000 researchers through the Chinese 'Project 555'. The choice of the lunar south pole is not random, as it has prolonged solar exposure and the possible presence of water ice in the permanent shadows of craters. According to Roscosmos, the station will be used for basic scientific research and to test technologies capable of operating without human presence for long periods. Yury Borisov, Roscosmos director general, confirmed that 'the technological steps are almost ready', suggesting that the infrastructure could soon enter the operational phase. The ILRS project foresees a first robotic phase with the Chinese mission Chang'e-8 in 2028, which will test automated construction with 3D-printed lunar soil. Between 2030 and 2035, five heavy-lift launches will transport the main modules to the Moon. The long-term goal, by 2050, is to establish an extensive network of bases powered by solar, radioisotopic, and nuclear sources, with rovers, lunar jumpers, and high-speed communications between Earth and the lunar far side.

**Trump Orders Creation of 10 New Nuclear Reactors by 2030**
US President Trump has issued an executive order to create 10 new nuclear reactors by 2030. According to the order, the Department of Energy must prioritize working with the nuclear industry to upgrade 5 gigawatts of power from existing nuclear reactors and obtain 10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030. The order also prioritizes activities to provide resources for the reactivation of closed nuclear power plants, increasing power production from operating nuclear power plants, completing the construction of halted nuclear reactors, building new advanced nuclear reactors, and improving all aspects related to the nuclear fuel supply chain. Trump has also signed four executive orders to lift restrictions and simplify rules to stimulate the nuclear industry in the US, including reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and speeding up the regulatory process related to nuclear reactor testing. One of the orders launches a pilot program aiming to operate three experimental nuclear reactors by July 2026.

**Trump Signs Executive Orders to 'Revive' Nuclear Energy in the US**
US President Donald Trump has signed four executive orders aimed at 'reviving' nuclear energy in the country, with the goal of quadrupling production over the next 25 years. Trump, who promised a 'fast and secure' process, wants the review of a request to build a new nuclear reactor to take no more than 18 months. He also aims to reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and increase uranium mining and processing. 'The time for nuclear reactors has come,' Trump said at a press conference in the Oval Office. Secretary of Homeland Security Doug Bergham, who was present at the signing of the orders, said that the risk is 'to produce enough electricity to win the duel of artificial intelligence with China.' 'We want to be able to test and deploy nuclear reactors during the current term,' meaning until January 2029, said a White House advisor in a previous interview with journalists. The United States is the world's largest nuclear power, with 94 operational reactors. However, their age is increasing, as they now average 42 years old. Due to the growing need for electricity, mainly from artificial intelligence, but also the goal of some countries to decarbonize their economies, nuclear energy is again attracting interest globally. France, with 57 reactors, announced in 2022 a new program to build 6-14 new ones. The first is expected to be ready in 2038. China also has 57 operational reactors and is already building 27 more. Russia is the 'largest exporter' of nuclear reactors, having built a total of 26 during this period, of which only 6 are located in Russian territory.

**Trump Aims to Launch 'Nuclear Renaissance' in the US**
US President Donald Trump has signed four executive orders aimed at launching a 'renaissance' of civil nuclear power in the US, with the goal of quadrupling nuclear energy production over the next 25 years. Trump has promised 'very fast and very safe' procedures, and wants to limit the review period for new nuclear reactor construction to 18 months. He also plans to reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and increase uranium extraction and enrichment. 'The time for nuclear power has come,' Trump said during a press conference in the Oval Office. The US remains the world's leading civil nuclear power, with 94 operational reactors, but their average age is increasing (42 years). As global demand for electricity grows, driven by the rise of artificial intelligence, and as some countries aim to decarbonize their economies, nuclear power is experiencing a resurgence in interest worldwide. France, with 57 reactors, is the most nuclearized country per capita, and has announced a new program for 6 to 14 new reactors, with the first expected in 2038. China, which has 57 reactors on its territory and 27 under construction, is also actively pursuing nuclear power. Russia remains the world's largest exporter of nuclear reactors, with 26 under construction, including 6 in its own country.

**Nuclear Energy Sees Resurgence of Interest Worldwide**
The nuclear energy sector is experiencing a resurgence of interest worldwide, driven by the urgent need to address climate change and increasing electricity demands. However, this ambition remains to be realized. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), nuclear energy generates less than 10% of the world's electricity in 31 countries. The sector has faced setbacks, including the Fukushima disaster in 2011, which led to Germany and Switzerland abandoning nuclear power, China slowing down its massive program, and Italy voting to exit the sector in 1987 after the Chernobyl disaster. The world has seen a decline in the number of operational reactors, from 440 in 2005 to 413 in 2023, according to the IEA. The production of nuclear energy is expected to reach a record high in 2025, but the future is uncertain due to the aging of the existing fleet and the slow pace of new construction projects. The US remains the world's leading civil nuclear power, with 94 operational reactors, but their average age is increasing (42 years). France, with 57 reactors, is the most nuclearized country per capita, but has announced a new program of 6 to 14 new reactors, with the first expected in 2038. Other countries, such as China, Russia, the UK, and Poland, are also actively pursuing nuclear energy, driven by the need for energy sovereignty and decarbonization. The sector aims to reach a dozen new countries, including Ghana, Kenya, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and the Philippines, but faces significant operational and financial challenges, including long construction times and high costs.

**New Wave of Smaller, Cheaper Nuclear Reactors Sends U.S. States Racing to Attract the Industry**
The US is racing to attract the nuclear industry as states compete to build and supply the next generation of reactors. Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal government's regulatory pipeline, touted as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants. Smaller, more flexible nuclear reactors are being developed, which could be factory-built from standard parts and are flexible enough to plunk down for a single customer. However, the devices face an uncertain future, with no modular reactors operating in the US and a project to build the first was terminated in 2023. The US Department of Energy estimates the US will need an additional 200 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity to keep pace with future power demands and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. More than 30 advanced nuclear projects are under consideration or planned to be in operation by the early 2030s, but those would supply just a fraction of the 200 gigawatt goal. The nuclear industry expects federal subsidies, loan guarantees, and tax credits to survive under President Donald Trump, whose administration it sees as a supporter. However, there are serious questions about industry claims that the smaller reactors are efficient, safe, and reliable, and the likelihood of them being deployable and instantly 100% reliable right out of the gate is not consistent with the history of nuclear power development.

**Queensland nuclear plan in question as Albo warns it would drag state's economy**
The Federal Government has released analysis claiming that the Liberal-National coalition's plan to build two nuclear reactors in Queensland would make the state's economy nearly $900 billion worse off by 2050. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated that the opposition's nuclear plan would take Australia backwards in terms of economic activity, saying, 'Under the Coalition [Dutton's] vision is for a smaller Australia, is for making less things, is for less economic activity, is for less jobs.' The analysis also found that the plan would affect Queensland's output by $61.1 billion in 2050-51 alone. The coalition's proposal includes building seven reactors across Australia, with two in Queensland, and aims to have them operational between 2035 and 2037. Labor has disputed the coalition's argument that their plan is more expensive, citing statements from the CSIRO that nuclear energy would be significantly more expensive for Australia.
