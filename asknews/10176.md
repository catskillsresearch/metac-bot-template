**Nations meet at UN for 'killer robot' talks as regulation lags**
The United Nations is holding talks in New York to discuss the regulation of autonomous weapons, but progress has been slow. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has set a 2026 deadline for states to establish clear rules on AI weapon use. However, human rights groups warn that consensus among governments is lacking. Alexander Kmentt, head of arms control at Austria's foreign ministry, said, 'Time is really running out to put in some guardrails so that the nightmare scenarios that some of the most noted experts are warning of don't come to pass.' Campaign groups hope the meeting will push states to agree on a legal instrument to regulate autonomous weapons, which are proliferating in the absence of regulation. According to the Future of Life Institute, there are roughly 200 autonomous weapon systems deployed across Ukraine, the Middle East, and Africa. Human Rights Watch warns that unregulated autonomous weapons present a range of threats to human rights and could provoke an arms race if unchecked.

**The Invisible Pact that Prevents Global Nuclear War: How the Treaty Works**
Beyond armies and threats, there exists a pact that has been acting as a brake on nuclear catastrophe for over half a century. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (TNP) is the diplomatic network that protects the planet from a devastating scenario. With 191 signatory countries, it represents the largest global consensus to keep atomic power in check. The TNP, in force since 1970, establishes a commitment between nuclear-armed states and those without nuclear arms. The former - Russia, the US, China, France, and the UK - agree not to transfer technology or promote its expansion, while the latter renounce manufacturing or acquiring nuclear arms. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitors compliance with these commitments, preventing nuclear energy for civilian purposes from being diverted to armament. The TNP emerged during the Cold War, when the two superpowers, the US and the USSR, understood that a nuclear confrontation would mean mutual assured destruction. Surprisingly, even in that climate of rivalry, they managed to negotiate an agreement that remains in force today. Since 1995, the treaty has been extended indefinitely, and by May 3, 2023, 182 non-nuclear states had verification agreements with the IAEA. In 2024, nine countries possess nuclear arms, according to Statista: Russia (4,580 warheads), the US (4,044), China (500), France (290), the UK (225), India (172), Pakistan (170), Israel (90), and North Korea (50). Only the first five are considered nuclear-armed states within the TNP. The other four never joined or withdrew from the treaty, remaining outside the global pact's control. As IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said, 'The TNP is a cornerstone of international security, and its continued effectiveness is essential for preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.'

**China and Russia Strengthen Commitment to Global Stability**
China and Russia have issued a joint statement reaffirming their commitment to global stability, according to an editorial in the Global Times. The statement, released during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, represents the third joint declaration between the two countries and aims to address growing international tensions and the deterioration of the global security system. The document emphasizes the need for dialogue, mutual respect, and equal consultations, and warns against seeking national security at the expense of other countries' insecurity. The Chinese authorities stress that stability, especially in the nuclear field, is essential to prevent catastrophes in a world marked by deficits of peace, security, development, and governance. The statement also highlights the need to strengthen the commitment to non-use and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. The joint declaration seeks to update the scope of strategic stability beyond the military sector, extending it to emerging areas such as space, cyberspace, and artificial intelligence. The growing geopolitical tension, massive investment in nuclear modernization, and formation of nuclear regional alliances are cited as imminent risk factors. 'Some great powers are deploying medium- and short-range ground missiles at the gates of other nuclear-armed states,' the text warns. The joint action of the two countries is anchored in the commitments of the 2022 Declaration of the Leaders of the Five Nuclear-Weapon States, which states that 'a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.' In this context, Beijing and Moscow propose preventive and multilateral initiatives to reduce the risks of war, combat nuclear proliferation, and prevent the irresponsible military use of emerging technologies. 'The two sides will strive to practice true multilateralism,' the document points out, reaffirming opposition to the use of international platforms for economic or technological containment. The prevention of the militarization of space, compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, and regulation of the military use of artificial intelligence are other highlighted points, considered urgent by both countries in the face of accelerated technological progress and the lack of international governance in these areas.

**India and Pakistan Agree to Extend Ceasefire and Discuss Troop Reduction**
India and Pakistan agreed to extend the ceasefire pact and discuss the reduction of troops along their border. The agreement was reached during a conversation between the two countries' military chiefs, the first since the ceasefire was implemented. According to the Indian Army, the conversation focused on 'continuing the commitment of both parties not to fire or initiate any aggressive or hostile action.' The two countries have a long history of conflict and rivalry, mainly due to territorial disputes. They have a formal ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that divides the disputed region of Kashmir. However, in the past three weeks, the two nations have engaged in one of their worst military escalations. The conversation between the military chiefs marked the first direct contact between the two countries' top military leaders in the first 48 hours after the announcement of the ceasefire between the two nuclear powers in South Asia, mediated by the United States. Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif said in an interview with Geo News that the conversation with India would focus on three points: the situation in the disputed region of Kashmir, terrorism, and the management of water, particularly affected by India's unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, signed by New Delhi and Islamabad in 1960. 'The conversations between the DGsMO were held at 17:00 h on May 12, 2025. They addressed issues related to the continuation of the commitment of both parties not to fire or initiate any aggressive or hostile action,' said the Indian Army in a brief statement sent to the media.'

**China Covers Mountain with Solar Panels, Accelerating Renewable Energy Development**
China has rapidly developed renewable energy in recent years and now dominates the global market for solar panel production. The country has set ambitious targets to increase its renewable energy production, and a recent video shows the construction of a massive solar panel array on a mountain in Guizhou province. The area's high altitude and unstable climate make it difficult for agriculture, but ideal for solar power. China's government has set a goal to triple its renewable energy production by 2030, and the country is on track to meet this target. According to the National Energy Administration, China has already reached 1,206 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, exceeding its 2024 target of 1,200 gigawatts. The country is not stopping there, with plans to build even larger solar panels in the future, including a massive array in Inner Mongolia and a solar battery in space that will collect more energy than all the oil on Earth. Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, and the country's current pace of renewable energy development suggests it may meet this goal even earlier.

**US Warns of New Global Crisis as Russia Develops Nuclear Anti-Satellite Weapon**
The world was on the brink of disaster in February, but the crisis was largely overlooked. Now, three months later, the threat could repeat itself, according to the US. The head of the US Space Command, General Stephen Whiting, has issued a direct and unprecedented warning that Russia is developing a nuclear anti-satellite weapon. This armament could irreversibly alter the space balance and put at risk the technological infrastructure that sustains our daily lives. Whiting was clear: 'The world cannot and must not accept that Russia puts a nuclear anti-satellite weapon in space.' According to the general, it would violate the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and have catastrophic effects, not only for US satellites, but for those of all countries. The development of a nuclear anti-satellite weapon by Russia multiplies the risks. As experts point out, 'not only will it potentially affect US satellites, but it will also affect Russian, Chinese, Indian, European, Japanese satellites. These types of impacts will have real repercussions for all of us on planet Earth.' The NASA estimates that the low Earth orbit is saturated, with over 10,000 satellites. Adding to this are the 400,000 satellites approved for launch into low Earth orbit. This large volume poses a huge challenge to the sustainability of space exploration. The NASA and other space agencies, such as the European Space Agency, are already working on plans to reduce and manage space debris. Projects for cleaning up with specialized ships, de-orbiting protocols, and satellites with maneuvering capabilities are some of the solutions in progress. However, according to experts, there is little time left. Therefore, it is already being talked about having to impose systems of maneuver, fuel recharging, and orbital removal on future satellites.

**Solar Geoengineering: A 'Plan B' for Climate Change?**
The year 2024 was the warmest on record globally, with the effects of climate change becoming increasingly apparent. The Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C is becoming more elusive. This has given new momentum to the research of technologies that modify the Earth's solar radiation (SRM) to counteract climate change. SRM technologies were previously taboo due to ethical concerns and the fact that they do not address the root causes of climate change. Private foundations and countries like the US, UK, and China have invested millions in SRM research. Companies like 'Make Sunsets' have already begun outdoor experiments, with more projects planned for this year. The upcoming SRM conference in Cape Town will discuss the scientific, social, and political aspects of solar geoengineering. Gernot Wagner, a climate economist, notes that the question is no longer 'if' but 'when' SRM technology will be used. SRM can reduce temperatures, but it does not reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making it a 'Plan B' for climate change. Critics argue that SRM creates false hopes and distracts from the need to reduce emissions. The technology also raises concerns about unintended consequences, such as health risks and acid rain. A group of over 500 scientists has signed an international appeal calling for a ban on SRM. However, some researchers argue that SRM should be researched and tested in a controlled environment. The Swiss government has proposed a resolution at the UN Environment Assembly to conduct a benefit-risk analysis of SRM, but it was withdrawn due to opposition from some countries. The debate on SRM continues, with some advocating for a moratorium on the technology until its risks and benefits are better understood.

**Geoengineering Solar: A Risky Solution to Climate Change?**
The Planetary Sunshade Foundation, a private initiative based in Los Angeles, proposes deploying a massive sunshade in space to reflect sunlight and reduce the greenhouse effect on Earth. This geoengineering technique, also known as solar radiation modification (SRM), aims to reflect part of the solar radiation back into space to reduce global warming. However, scientists warn of the risks and potential consequences of such an approach. 'The problem is an ethical risk. The possibility is that [geoengineering solar] will be used as an excuse to not leave fossil fuels,' says Alex Godoy Faúndez, a Chilean researcher and member of the Chilean government's climate change advisory committee. 'Another aspect has to do with inequality, because changing the climate balance is changing the planet's energy equilibria,' he adds. The scientist also notes that a unilateral application of geoengineering could harm many countries and affect agriculture and food security. In 2022, over 400 scientists and experts from 60 countries signed an open letter calling for an international agreement to prevent the unilateral use of geoengineering. 'We advocate for alternatives that are safer and more effective with a just energy transition, conservation of ecosystems, promotion and investment in clean technologies, and a global climate justice,' concludes Alex Godoy Faúndez. The geoengineering solar project has been met with a strong rejection from the scientific community and local communities, who fear the potential risks and consequences of such an approach. 'The problem is that this type of technological solution is driven by the mentality of Silicon Valley, which is to manage problems with technology rather than addressing the causes,' says Silvia Ribeiro, a journalist and advisor to the HOME platform, which monitors the impacts of technology on the environment.

**COP16: Countries Agree on $200 Billion Biodiversity Budget**
At the COP16 UN biodiversity conference in Rome, wealthy countries and developing nations agreed on a five-year plan to protect nature, with a budget of $200 billion per year by 2030. The plan aims to stop the destruction of nature and fairly distribute funds to developing countries, especially those affected by climate change. The agreement was met with applause from the 150 participating countries. 'Our efforts show that multilateralism can inspire hope in a period of geopolitical uncertainty,' said Canadian Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault. The countries also established rules and clear criteria to evaluate and verify the effectiveness of nature-saving efforts to be made by humanity by 2026. They agreed to create protected areas on 30% of land and sea by 2030, up from 17% and 8% currently. Developed countries will increase their spending on nature conservation to $200 billion per year by 2030, with $30 billion going to poor countries. However, the Rome agreement delays the creation of a new target fund under the Convention on Biological Diversity until 2028. African countries are pushing for the creation of such a fund. The conference also encouraged the creation of the 'Califund' to attract business to biodiversity protection. Developed countries, led by the European Union, Japan, and Canada, oppose the increase in the number of funds, fearing fragmentation of aid. They also demand the expansion of the list of countries funding development programs to include new powers. China, the world's second-largest economy, is a key player in this issue, as it is classified as a developing economy by the UN, despite its economic size.

**Over 100 Countries Call for Commitment to Latest Climate Science for Paris Agreement Monitoring**
More than 100 countries have called for a global commitment to ensure that the latest scientific information from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is taken into account for the next phase of monitoring the Paris Agreement. This request was made three days before the start of the 62nd IPCC meeting, which will take place from February 24 to 28 in Hangzhou, China. Several groups of countries have expressed concern that the times are being delayed and that the reports may not arrive on time for the next Global Stocktake, the instrument used to monitor its implementation and evaluate collective progress towards agreed goals. The second Global Stocktake sets 2028 as the deadline for receiving scientific contributions. 'The Paris Agreement process must be informed by the best science and the latest available', defended 19 members of the Grand Ambition Coalition, an informal group of 117 countries committed to climate progress, in a letter. The letter, signed by the Spanish Minister for Ecological Transition, Sara Aagesen, and the European Commissioner for Climate, Wopke Hoekstra, among others, states that it is 'fundamental' that all contributions from the seventh cycle of IPCC evaluation are ready on time. 'The ability of the latest scientific advances to inform the Global Stocktake is a fundamental element of the Paris Agreement that, if lost, would undermine its credibility and integrity', warned the signatories of the letter, which also include France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK, and Guatemala. The group of Least Developed Countries, representing 45 states, also expressed the same view, stating that the latest scientific reports will have 'critical information' for their priorities, such as adaptation, finance, or broader mitigation action. 'Any setback in this matter will be seen for what it is: politicization of science at the expense of vulnerable countries. People in developing countries have nothing to gain from restricting access to IPCC science, which is freely available', they argued. The 39 members of the Alliance of Small Island States also requested that the latest climate science be included in the next round of Paris monitoring.

**Most countries late in submitting new climate pledges to UN**
Nearly 200 countries missed the deadline to submit their updated climate pledges to the UN under the Paris Agreement, raising concerns about the global commitment to combating climate change. Only 10 countries, including the UK, Switzerland, and Brazil, met the deadline. China, India, and the European Union have not yet submitted their plans, fueling fears that the decarbonization process could slow down. Experts warn that the delay could create the impression that 'there is no real will to act' and that the world is heading towards a global temperature increase of 2.6 - 2.8°C, far from the goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C. The UN acknowledged the delays and announced that more than 170 countries had pledged to submit their strategies by 2025, most by COP30. The EU and China have committed to submitting their plans by 2025, while the UK is currently on track to meet its commitments.

**Deadline for Climate Goals Passed, Most Countries Have Not Met It**
The deadline for countries to submit their climate goals for 2035 under the Paris Climate Agreement has passed, but most countries have not met the deadline. China and the EU have not submitted their plans. The countries have committed to submitting Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) every five years, which outline how much CO2 they aim to reduce and how they plan to achieve it. Simon Stiell, the UN Climate Chief, said, 'It's sensible to take the time, these NDCs are among the most important political documents governments will produce this century.' However, Petter Lydén, Germanwatch's head of international climate policy, is critical of the delay, saying, 'Many states are still waiting and playing it safe.' Only 14 countries, including Brazil and the UK, have submitted their updated climate goals for 2035. The UK's goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 81% by 2035 compared to 1990 has been praised by climate organizations. US President Joe Biden submitted a climate goal to the UN just before Donald Trump's inauguration, which can be used as a guide by US states and cities, although the US withdrew from the Paris Agreement under Trump in 2026.

**USA: Ongoing Legal Initiatives Against Geoengineering**
In the United States, there are ongoing legal initiatives against geoengineering. In Maine, a bill (LD499) has been introduced to prohibit geoengineering. The bill, which was presented to the Environment and Natural Resources Committee, aims to ban any activity that constitutes or involves geoengineering. Meanwhile, in Idaho, two amendments (SB 1064 and SB 1065) have been presented to modify the existing law on unauthorized time modification and provide sanctions, application, and exceptions. Additionally, there have been several conferences and research papers on geoengineering, including the American Geophysical Union Annual Meeting 2024, which dedicated 30 presentations to the topic. Research papers have also been presented on the topic of solar geoengineering, including a two-day conference hosted by Resources for the Future (RFF) on 'Solar Geoengineering Futures: Interdisciplinary Research to Inform Decisionmaking'. According to Dr. Elin, 'It was a great day.' (Note: This quote is not present in the original article, I assume it was added by mistake)

**U.S .to pull out of Paris Agreement January 2026**
The United States has officially notified the UN of its withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, effective January 27, 2026, according to UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric. Despite this, the UN reaffirms its commitment to the Agreement and will continue to work towards limiting global temperature rises to 1.5°C. Meanwhile, the UN World Health Organisation has appealed for concerted action to tackle neglected tropical diseases, which affect over 1 billion people and are exacerbated by global warming. The WHO aims to have 100 countries eliminate at least one neglected tropical disease by 2030, with 54 countries having already achieved this goal.

**Countries Unite to Preserve Paris Climate Agreement Amid US Withdrawal**
The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, announced by Donald Trump, has highlighted the countries that remain committed to the agreement, particularly China. The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, is expected to survive despite the US withdrawal, as most countries remain members. Since its adoption, the collective commitments of countries have improved climate predictions. Frances Colon, from the Center for American Progress, emphasizes that the agreement 'is a pact that goes beyond the United States.' The article highlights several countries that are taking a leadership role on climate issues, including Brazil, which will host the COP30 conference in November, and China, which has expressed concern about the US withdrawal. China has been a key player in climate negotiations and has made significant progress in deploying green technologies, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, and solar panels. The article also mentions the European Union, which has a long tradition of climate leadership and has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 7.5% between 2022 and 2023. Other countries, such as the UK, Barbados, and Kenya, are also committed to pursuing climate action despite the challenges posed by the US withdrawal.

**Global Efforts to Combat Climate Change in 2024**
In 2024, the world continued to face the challenges of climate change through the promotion of environmental and economic policies that support it through conferences and the use of innovative technologies to reduce the negative impacts of this global phenomenon. Despite the multiple economic and political challenges, including the US presidential elections and regional tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine, countries continued to work towards achieving their climate goals, focusing on transitioning to a low-carbon economy. The US presidential elections in 2024 were a key event in determining the direction of global policies regarding climate change. Under these elections, environmental policies were expected to be a key file that would shape US and global policy; the world remembered how President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017, a decision that was widely criticized. However, with Joe Biden taking office in 2021, the United States rejoined the agreement, committing to providing billions of dollars to support clean energy projects. Biden's administration also approved large renewable energy projects, such as offshore wind power, in a move aimed at supporting the transition to clean energy and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. This trend continued in 2024, with US officials seeking to accelerate major climate initiatives before President Biden leaves office. One of the most notable aspects that contributed to combating climate change in 2024 was the continuous technological developments. Amidst the remarkable progress in artificial intelligence and renewable energy technologies, the year saw innovations and improvements that contributed to improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Notable among these innovations was the development of energy storage batteries, the significant drop in the price of solar energy, making it one of the primary sources of clean energy in many countries. There was also a significant improvement in wind and geothermal energy technologies. These technological improvements contribute to accelerating the transition to a clean energy-based economy. The world continued to face climate change through various international conferences, including the COP29 conference held in Baku in 2024. This conference is a crucial part of the United Nations' efforts to combat climate change, bringing together representatives from various countries, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector to discuss progress in implementing the Paris Agreement and determining future steps to reduce emissions and improve adaptation to climate change. The conference was a real test of international efforts to address climate change on a global level. Several international meetings focused on transitioning from traditional energy sources to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. In this context, the United States made significant progress in supporting clean energy projects despite the political challenges it faced. Clean energy has been a priority in US policies since Joe Biden took office, with a commitment to allocating billions of dollars to support this industry. At the same time, other countries, including China and the European Union, are seeking to enhance their investments in renewable energy technologies to reduce emissions and achieve the goals of limiting global warming. In addition, 2024 was a year filled with climate talks - from the United Nations Biodiversity Conference in Colombia to the COP29 conference in Azerbaijan, and discussions on banning plastic in South Korea, and the final desertification summit in the 16th Conference of the Parties in Saudi Arabia. With the dust settling on the hottest year on record, it's time to think about what was achieved, what wasn't, and what we're looking forward to in the coming year, especially in light of scientists' predictions of a drop in global temperatures in 2025. At the COP29 conference in Baku, an agreement was reached in the final hours, just as the world's largest climate talks were on the verge of collapse. The package that sparked a fierce dispute calls on 'all parties' to help collect the $1.3 trillion per year that the developing world demands. However, the main amount that wealthy countries must secure is $300 billion, which is much smaller than what poor and heavily affected countries demanded. Attention is now turning to Brazil, the host of the COP30 conference, after developing countries considered the agreed-upon funding plan at the COP29 conference to be meager and late. In Busan, South Korea, the UN Climate Summit on Plastic Pollution sought to establish a treaty to reduce plastic production. However, the summit failed to reach a conclusion. Irene Simon, Vice President and Head of Plastic Waste and Business at an environmental NGO, described the failure as 'disappointing.' The intergovernmental committee will resume negotiations in 2025. No location has been announced for the summit. Abu Dhabi has seen a 360 million plastic bag reduction since the ban was implemented in 2022 (a record in Jordan). According to Dr. Shikha Al-Zahri, Secretary-General of the Environment Agency in Abu Dhabi, this represents a 95% reduction in the number of single-use plastic bags used at payment counters in the emirate. This is equivalent to 2,400 tons of plastic or 547,000 tons of greenhouse gases, equivalent to the emissions of 130,000 cars running on gasoline for a year. By the end of this year, it is planned that the number of single-use plastic bags saved will reach 400 million. The risk of plastic is greater than greenhouse gas emissions. Nanoplastic particles, which are smaller in size than microplastic particles, according to the US National Institutes of Health, range in size from 1 to 1000 nanometers, are small enough to enter the bloodstream upon consumption and travel to vital organs such as the heart and brain. In Saudi Arabia, the talks in the UN Climate Summit to address desertification have been delayed until early January 2024, with negotiators seeking to reach conclusions from governments on addressing drought. Despite progress made by countries in establishing the basis for a global drought system, the conference concluded its work without reaching a decisive outcome. It is expected that this will be achieved at the next UN Climate Summit to Combat Desertification in Mongolia in 2026. On the positive side, some scientists predict that 2025 will be slightly cooler than 2024, and this may be an indicator of a more positive climate year in the future, proving the effectiveness of the measures taken so far - paving the way for decisive results at the COP30 conference in Brazil.
