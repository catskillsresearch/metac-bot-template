**Faster CPR Saves Lives: Delay Beyond 4 Minutes Reduces Survival in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest, Study Finds**
A recent study published in the Resuscitation Journal found that the time it takes to begin dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR) significantly affects survival outcomes following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The study, led by Dr. Haruka Takahashi, analyzed data from 3,861 adult patients who experienced witnessed, non-traumatic OHCA and received DA-CPR. The researchers found that delays in starting CPR, particularly beyond 4 minutes, reduce the chances of survival with favorable neurological outcomes at 30 days. The study emphasizes the importance of rapid intervention during medical emergencies and calls for emergency services to prioritize faster response mechanisms to ensure bystanders can act swiftly under dispatcher guidance. As Dr. Takahashi and her team noted, 'These findings highlight the urgent need to streamline dispatcher response systems and reduce the time it takes to initiate CPR instructions over the phone.'

**5-Year-Old Boy Successfully Resuscitated at Linzer Parkbad**
A 5-year-old boy was successfully resuscitated at the Linzer Parkbad after being submerged in the water for approximately 2 minutes. A 37-year-old woman noticed the accident and pulled the boy out of the water. Other bathers, led by a 41-year-old man, began CPR, and after a 1-minute resuscitation, the boy regained consciousness and started breathing on his own. He was taken to the children's hospital for further treatment. His parents, who were nearby with five other children and an adult, had lost sight of the situation due to the crowded pool area and initially did not notice the accident.

**The Rise of Cold Therapy: What Does Science Say?**
Cold therapy, also known as cryotherapy, has gained popularity worldwide as a method to alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, and improve overall well-being. Applied through ice baths, cold showers, or cryotherapy chambers, this ancient technique, documented since 3500 BC, is supported by recent scientific studies that confirm its effectiveness in various areas of health. Its use extends from elite athletes to individuals seeking to improve their quality of life. According to Dr. Andreas Michalsen, professor of Clinical Naturopathy at Charité in Berlin, 'Cold acts as a vascular training, improves circulation, and reduces inflammation.' He highlights that 'The therapy is especially useful for treating conditions such as rheumatism and arthritis,' as well as promoting weight loss when combined with a balanced diet. Studies have shown that controlled exposure to cold generates a positive stress stimulus, known as hormesis, which strengthens cellular and vascular resilience. A study published in Actiage (2021) found that immersion in cold water at 14°C for six weeks increased levels of T and B lymphocytes, activating the immune system. Additionally, cryotherapy stimulates the production of brown fat, which burns calories to generate heat, helping to prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes. The global market for cold therapy reached $8.01 billion in 2022, reflecting demand in sectors such as fitness and sports medicine. However, experts warn that cryotherapy should be applied with caution, as extreme temperatures (0-12°C) can cause pain or skin reactions, such as redness, if not properly controlled. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals before starting this practice, especially in cases of pre-existing conditions.

**Actress Clare McCann Seeks to Freeze Son's Body in Hopes of Revival**
Australian actress Clare McCann is seeking to freeze her 13-year-old son's body in the hopes of reviving him after his tragic death. Atreyu took his own life after months of bullying by schoolmates. McCann shared her grief on Instagram, saying, 'He was the brightest light in my world - friendly, creative, and infinitely loved. We are mourning a loss that words cannot describe. Please give us time and space to process this unimaginable pain.' She is now crowdfunding on GoFundMe to raise $300,000 AUD to cryogenically preserve her son's body within the next seven days, as the window for this procedure is extremely small. McCann claims that she had begged the school, education ministry, and youth office to intervene, but her pleas were ignored. She writes, 'I had the school, the education ministry, and the youth office beg for help. I have medical records, psychological evaluations, a formal PTSD diagnosis from his doctor, and emails that prove I repeatedly raised the alarm. But nothing was done. No one intervened. And now my beloved son is dead.'

**Scientists Predict Sea Level Rise and Irreversible Consequences Due to Glacier Melting**
A group of international scientists from Switzerland, the US, Belgium, and other countries have concluded that if current warming trends continue, three-quarters of the Earth's glacier mass will disappear by 2100, causing a 23 cm sea level rise and other irreversible consequences. The study, published in the journal Science, highlights the situation in Alaska, where up to 69% of the glaciers could disappear, despite the region having the third-largest glacier reserve in the world (16,246 gigatons). Even in the best-case scenario, Alaska would lose 41% of its ice, and global losses would be 47%. Unlike previous studies, which were limited to 2100, the new modeling considers the period until the glaciers reach a state of 'equilibrium' - in the case of Alaska, this would take 330 years. The study involved 21 scientists from 10 countries, using eight different climate models to analyze 200,000 glaciers. The scientists believe that even if warming stops, glaciers will continue to melt for hundreds of years due to 'climate inertia'. They consider the current decade critical for taking measures to preserve the Earth's cryosphere.

**Scientists in Panic: Planet Faces Catastrophic Consequences Due to Ice Loss**
A group of international scientists from Switzerland, the US, Belgium, and other countries have concluded that if the current rate of warming continues, three-quarters of the Earth's ice mass will disappear by 2100, resulting in a 23 cm rise in sea levels and other irreversible consequences. The study, published in the Science journal, notes that the situation in Alaska is particularly alarming, where up to 69% of the ice could disappear, despite the region having the third-largest ice reserve in the world (16,246 gigatons). Even under an optimal scenario, Alaska would lose 41% of its ice, with global losses reaching 47%. Unlike previous studies, which were limited to 2100, the new modeling considers a period of up to 330 years to reach 'equilibrium' for Alaska's ice. The study involved 21 scientists from 10 countries, using eight different climate models to analyze 200,000 ice formations. The researchers emphasize that even if warming stops, ice will continue to melt for hundreds of years due to 'climate inertia.' They stress that the current decade is critical for taking measures to preserve the Earth's cryosphere.

**Australian actor raising money to cryogenically preserve teen son**
Australian actress Clare McCann is raising $300,000 to cryogenically preserve her 13-year-old son, Atreyu, who died by suicide on May 23 after months of bullying at his school. McCann blames the school for not taking adequate action against the bullies, saying 'This was not his fault. He was let down by the schooling system as he suffered horrendous amounts of bullying.' Southern Cryonics has agreed to freeze Atreyu's body, but there are no guarantees that future medical technology can bring him back. As of Friday, the fundraiser had raised just under $16,000.

**The Evolution of Resuscitation Methods: From Tabacco Enemas to Modern Techniques**
The author was surprised to learn that 100 years ago, there was no modern method of providing first aid, and even 20 years ago, resuscitation was a strange ritual. Until the 20th century, resuscitation was understood as stimulating the body to mechanical action. Humanitarian communities often recommended warming the drowning person and attempting to perform artificial respiration. The most important thing was to make the body-machine work again. External stimulation - rubbing and massage. Internal stimulation usually consisted of introducing rum or some stimulating potion into the stomach. One of the most unusual methods was 'smoking tobacco smoke' into the rectum of the drowning person, which was also recommended by humanitarian communities. The English phrase 'blowing smoke up your arse' (blowing smoke into someone's anus) is a polite way of saying that one person is praising another, not very sincerely. This phrase is not just a coincidence. In the late 1700s, doctors literally filled the anus of their patients with smoke. This was a widely used medical procedure in standard resuscitation. Mostly for drowning victims. Although artificial respiration was first used in ancient Sumeria or ancient Egypt, by the 18th century, there were not very high hopes for such ventilation of the lungs. Humanity wanted progress. New incredible breakthroughs and achievements. Therefore, the idea of pulling a corpse out of the Thames and smoking it in the anus seemed very interesting. In London, the equipment needed for this procedure was widely available on the riverbanks (it was kindly provided by the Royal Humane Society). People who often rested near the water were required to know where the equipment was located and how to use it. For this, masterclasses were conducted with the participation of local residents, who were summoned by brave London police officers. The smoke was inhaled into the anus using a special tube connected to a fumigator and a syringe, which, when compressed, released smoke into the rectum. Sometimes, to get the smoke into the lungs faster, it was inhaled through the nose and mouth of the patient, but most doctors found the rectal method more elegant and effective. They believed that nicotine contained in tobacco made the heart beat stronger and faster, thus stimulating breathing. Also, doctors thought that smoke warmed the patient and dried out his internal organs, removing excess moisture. The practice of using 'tobacco enemas' for rescuing drowning people quickly became a popular method of treating many other diseases, including headaches, hernias, respiratory diseases, and stomach cramps. Tobacco enemas were even used to treat typhoid and cholera when patients were on the last stage of the disease. From the mid-19th century, the method of resuscitation using the lifting and spreading apart of the patient's hands became popular. Only in the 1940s in the US, research was conducted, showing zero effectiveness of this method. Modern application of the 'mouth-to-mouth' method of artificial respiration began only in the 1950s, during the polio epidemic in the US. Chest massage: In 1880, Neumann first performed direct chest massage on a human. In 1901, Igelsrud successfully performed resuscitation using indirect chest massage. In 1960, Jad, Koewendhoven, and Nikerboker again clinically justified the effectiveness of indirect chest massage. All this served as the basis for creating a clear scheme of resuscitation manipulations. The most clear scheme of resuscitation procedures was proposed by American anesthesiologist and resuscitologist Safar in 1966. This scheme entered the literature under the name 'Safar's alphabet'. The main principles introduced by him are still in effect today. Only the ratio of compressions on the chest and breaths has changed. In the early 21st century, it was 35:2. In recent years, it was 30:2, and according to the latest research, artificial respiration is not recommended as oxygenation is sufficient. In 1913, Professor F. A. Andreev published an article 'Experiments on restoring the activity of the heart, breathing, and nervous system function'. But it took 40 years to follow these methods. The author thought - what methods of assistance are now considered absolute heresy, but will become absolutely traditional in 40 years - in 2065.

**40% of glaciers "are doomed" even if we were to stop global warming and sea levels would rise by 10 centimeters**
Even if global warming were to stop, 39% of the world's glacier mass would still disappear, and sea levels would rise by over 10 centimeters, according to a study led by Harry Zekollari. The study, which simulated the effects of current climate policies, found that glaciers would continue to melt for centuries, even without additional warming. 'Most glacier studies stop at the year 2100, which is problematic when simulating the long-term impact of current climate policies, given the glaciers' long-term response over time,' explains Harry Zekollari. The study also found that saltwater can more easily penetrate freshwater aquifers, affecting the supply in coastal areas. 'The decisions we make today will resonate for centuries,' Zekollari notes. The study was conducted within the framework of the Glacier Model Intercomparison Project (GlacierMIP) and coordinated by the Climate and Cryosphere Project (CliC) of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP).

**Cryopreservation: A Second Chance at Life or a Futile Quest?**
The concept of cryopreservation, or freezing a body at -196 degrees Celsius, has sparked debate and curiosity. According to Ramón Risco, a scientist at the University of Sevilla, it is biologically possible to revive a cryopreserved body. However, there are significant ethical concerns. Currently, over 2,000 bodies are cryopreserved worldwide, with some individuals, like a 14-year-old British girl, leaving behind a letter requesting a second chance at life. The process involves cooling the body to -196 degrees Celsius, replacing blood with cryoprotectants, and storing it in a cryogenic tank. While some scientists, like Ramón Risco, believe it is only a matter of time before cryopreservation becomes a reality, others raise questions about the feasibility and ethics of reviving a person after centuries. The cost of cryopreservation is estimated to be around 200,000 euros, and there have been no successful revivals of cryopreserved bodies to date.

**Russian Woman Freezes Body in Hope of Becoming Cyborg**
A Russian woman has frozen her body in a Moscow cryonics center in the hope of becoming a cyborg in the future. According to her plan, advances in medicine and technology will allow her to regain consciousness and even receive new body parts printed on a 3D printer in the coming decades. Her body is one of over 100 stored in the cryonics center. The director of the organization explained that the cryopatients are stored in special dewars with nitrogen, which maintains a super-low temperature. She noted that the dewars are not transparent because it is currently technically impossible. 'Either they immediately fog up - nothing is visible, or they crack, so they are not transparent,' she explained. For those who have signed preliminary agreements and paid for the service, there is the option to equip a special mechanism that allows relatives to see the cryopatient: 'A person who comes to look can wear a warm suit with a special mask, for example, so as not to breathe in the nitrogen. Nitrogen is a neutral gas, but its amount should not be exaggerated.' The center plans to equip a special room with transparent glass so that relatives can see the frozen patient while being in a safe zone. 'We call the refrigerator a room. In general, 3-4 meters - like a real room. We want to separate a part that will be behind the glass, so that a person can enter and see their relative behind the glass. Because the client-patient must be in a low-temperature nitrogen atmosphere,' the director said. The process of cryonics in Russia is only possible after a doctor has officially declared the person dead. 'By law, we have the right to start our activities after a doctor's act of death. We don't have euthanasia - we can't freeze a person and then thaw them alive. Such technologies do not exist yet. So we start working as if the person is dead,' the director added. The cryonics center notes that more attention is being paid to freezing domestic animals. 'With animals, we're doing great. We can place them in a nitrogen atmosphere, give them anesthesia. They sleep, we lower the temperature, and the animal's anesthesia turns into cryopreservation. This is ideal. Because for animals, euthanasia is allowed,' she said. Among the cryo-clients are influential individuals who prefer to remain anonymous. The director acknowledged that there are very influential and well-known people: 'Yes, they are there, six people, for example. But they don't rush to tell their surroundings. We don't know what they might be afraid of.'

**The hidden flaw in cryonics that could ruin your shot at living forever | BBC Science Focus Magazine**
Cryonics, the process of freezing and storing human remains for potential revival in the future, has gained renewed interest. However, experts warn that the process is still plagued by significant hurdles, including irreversible cellular damage, especially to the brain, caused by freezing. The human body is a complex system sustained by delicate biochemical processes, and freezing can cause irreparable harm. Even with advanced technology, reviving a frozen body is not like 'flicking a switch' but rather like trying to unscramble an egg. The brain, in particular, is vulnerable to damage due to its intricate structure and high metabolic demands. Additionally, rebuilding neuronal connections and memories is a daunting task, akin to rewriting a burned book from ashes. Cryonics relies heavily on optimism, but experts caution that people should think twice before risking their lives on a very unlikely outcome. As one expert notes, 'it's a process with many significant hurdles to overcome before it could be said to 'work', in any meaningful way.'

**Man's Body Frozen in Hopes of Future Revival**
A 24-year-old man from England, who had been diagnosed with a condition known as 'cryonic', was transported 5,790 kilometers to Michigan, USA, where he was placed in a 'deep freezer' in the hopes of being revived in the future. The man had signed up for a 'long-term cryonic preservation' program in Michigan before his death, which involves freezing the body at extremely low temperatures in the hopes that future technology will be able to revive it. The process involves cooling the body to -196°C using liquid nitrogen, and the man's body was transported to the Cryonics Institute in Michigan, where it was placed in a cryostate. The institute's president, Dennis Kowalski, described the process as 'a journey to a future hospital' and said that the goal is to revive the person in the future using advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and nanotechnology. However, critics have described the process as 'pseudoscience' and 'a waste of money', and some have questioned the ethics of freezing the body of a person who has already died. Despite these criticisms, the Cryonics Institute has over 250 members, including people from all walks of life, and is one of the largest cryonic preservation facilities in the world.

**Brit has body frozen and flown to US in hope of waking up in future**
A British man, known as 'patient 268', has had his body frozen and flown to the US in the hope of being revived in the future. The 3,700-mile journey took 16 days, and the body was cooled to well below freezing over a 25-hour period before being stored indefinitely at the Cryonics Institute in Michigan. The UK has the largest number of Cryonics Institute members outside of the US, with 128 people signed up for various 'suspension' options. As CI president Dennis Kowalksi said, 'cryonics is a gamble that may result in an ambulance ride to a future hospital.' The institute has two sites in Michigan housing over 250 patients who have paid for the outside shot at a revival.

**Brit frozen in liquid nitrogen chamber for chance of reawakening in far future - The Mirror**
A British man, known as 'Patient 268', has been cryogenically frozen in a liquid nitrogen container in the US as part of an advanced programme by the Cryonics Institute (CI). He was transported from the UK to the US after signing up with the CI, a medical organisation based in Michigan. The process, carried out by Cryonics UK, involved cooling the body to a temperature of -196C using liquid nitrogen. The CI's spokesperson said, 'The patient was then transferred to the computer-controlled cooling chamber to cool to liquid nitrogen temperature. The human dry ice program was selected and the time needed to cool the patient to liquid nitrogen temperature was 25 hours.' The CI's facilities are the largest in the world, with over 250 patients across two sites, and offer various programmes for cryopreservation, including a 'lifetime' membership with 'human cryopreservation' costs of $28,000. The organisation's chief, Dennis Kowalski, believes that death is something to be 'defeated' and said, 'The grave is your only real alternative and that's complete oblivion. So we want to defeat man's greatest enemy - death itself.'
