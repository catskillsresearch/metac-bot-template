**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**A Theory Says We Can't Find Advanced Aliens Because They're Not Trying to Be Found**
A new study re-examines the 'Sustainability Solution' to the Fermi paradox, which suggests that advanced alien civilizations may not be trying to be found because they have adapted to their planet's limitations and created sustainable technologies that blend with nature. This idea, first proposed in 2009, suggests that technosignatures like Dyson Spheres or interstellar spacecraft may not be detectable. New York University researcher Lukáš Likavčan re-conceptualizes technology, history, and sustainability on a planetary scale, arguing that the technosphere is a transitory armature of the biosphere's evolution. Likavčan quotes Canadian sci-fi author Karl Schroeder, who wrote that 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from nature.' This could explain why we haven't found civilizations while looking for technosignatures alone. The study provides a valuable lens through which to value our own society, its future perils, and how we might survive long enough to one day solve the Fermi paradox.

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**Planet K2-18B: How a Hint of Alien Life Fizzled**
Astronomers detected a faint chemical signal from the exoplanet K2-18b, which sparked excitement about the possibility of alien life. Led by Nikku Madhusudhan from Cambridge University, the team used the James Webb Space Telescope to find what they believed could be dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the planet's atmosphere. DMS is primarily produced by ocean-dwelling microbes on Earth, and its presence on K2-18b could indicate life. However, the team was cautious, noting that the signal was not strong enough to be conclusive, with a 0.3% chance of being a statistical fluke. Despite this, the discovery reignited hope for finding life beyond Earth.

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**NASA's New Probes to Search for Alien Life**
The NASA project, called ORCAA (Oceanic World Recognition and Astrobiological Analog Characterization), aims to search for extraterrestrial life. In 2023, the team conducted a test mission at the Echo glacier in Alaska, using a hot water drill to collect samples from the glacier's bottom. They found traces of ATP and chlorophyll-a, key molecules for life. The team is now preparing for a second campaign in North Basin in 2025, where they will use a cryobot to simulate the conditions they will face on Jupiter's moon Europa. The goal is to test the autonomous operation of the cryobot, from drilling to sample analysis, to determine if these technologies can be used in a future real landing on Europa. The study aims to detect changes in the environment and find potential indicators of habitability, such as microorganisms or organic compounds. The research is advancing, with the Europa Clipper mission already en route to Jupiter's moon. This spacecraft will fly over Europa 49 times starting in 2030, searching for areas where the ice crust is thinner. This will help choose the most promising location for a future landing mission, such as the Europa Lander. While this mission will not penetrate the ice, it will test the first key instruments for that stage. Other oceanic worlds in the solar system where these probes could be used include Enceladus and Titan (Saturn), Triton (Neptune), Ganymede and Callisto (Jupiter), and even Ceres and Pluto. Enceladus, for example, has active geysers that eject water into space and have already been analyzed by the Cassini mission, which found water vapor, carbon dioxide, and organic compounds: basic ingredients for life.

**Do Aliens Know We're Here?**
A team of astronomers led by Sofia Sheikh of the SETI Institute has analyzed various methods of detecting technosignatures from Earth, assuming that aliens use similar technology. They found that radio signals can be detected from up to 12,000 light-years away, while other methods such as transits, atmospheric analysis, and laser signals have much shorter detection limits. The researchers estimate that nitrogen dioxide in our atmosphere could be detected from 5.7 light-years away, but other types of technosignatures fare worse. The study suggests that radio signals are the most likely method for aliens to detect us, but it also highlights the challenges of detecting technosignatures from a distance. As the authors note, 'The truth is out there, and turning our search for aliens inside out -- by looking from the outside in -- may best inform us on how to find it.'

**Could An Earth-like Alien Civilization Detect Us?**
A new study by a team of astronomers and researchers, including those from Penn State, has investigated the detectability of Earth's technosignatures, or signs of technology, from across the cosmos. The study, published in the Astronomical Journal, found that radio signals are the most detectable technosignatures, potentially visible from up to 12,000 light-years away. Atmospheric technosignatures, such as emissions from compounds like nitrogen dioxide, are the next most detectable sign of life, potentially visible from as far as 5.7 light-years away. The study suggests that an advanced civilization would detect more and more human-made signatures simultaneously, including city lights, lasers pulses, and satellites, offering a comprehensive view of our technological presence. The researchers hope that this study will help shape efforts in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and provide a multiwavelength framework for understanding the detectability of technology on other planets.

**If aliens could detect Earth from their planet, what would they see?**
A new study led by Dr. Sofia Sheikh of the SETI Institute has analyzed multiple types of technosignatures, or indicators of advanced technology, to determine what signals would be most visible to extraterrestrial civilizations. The results suggest that radio signals, particularly planetary radar emissions, would be the most detectable human-made signatures, potentially visible from as far as 12,000 light-years away. Other signals, such as atmospheric pollutants, could also be detected, though at significantly shorter distances. The study's findings have implications for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and highlight the importance of understanding Earth's own technosignatures to refine the search for life beyond our planet. As Dr. Macy Huston, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley's Department of Astronomy, noted, 'Our goal with this project was to bring SETI back 'down to Earth' for a moment and think about where we really are today with Earth's technosignatures and detection capabilities.'

**What would aliens see if they were watching Earth from afar? New study reveals thrilling details**
According to scientists from the SETI Institute, aliens could detect Earth through 'technosignatures' like planetary radar and atmospheric emissions. Researchers transmitted powerful beams of radio waves in space to analyze the echo, providing information about the object that reflected the signal. The study found that aliens could potentially pick up these signals from as far as 12,000 light-years away. They could detect traces of human existence in the atmosphere, including gases like nitrogen dioxide, and identify Earth as a habitable world. Additionally, extraterrestrial civilisations might perceive Earth's environmental footprints, including artificial structures and pollution.

**How Extraterrestrial Life Could Detect Humanity: A New Study on Technosignatures**
A new study by the SETI Institute analyzes how extraterrestrial life could detect humanity. The researchers focus on 'technosignatures', which are signs of technology that could be detected by an alien civilization. The study, led by Dr. Sofia Sheikh, examines which technosignatures could be perceived by a civilization with similar technology to ours. The researchers found that radio emissions from the Arecibo Observatory and the William-E.-Gordon Telescope could be detected up to 12,000 light-years away. They also analyzed a variety of technosignatures, including laser beams and atmospheric signs of industrial activity, such as nitrogen dioxide emissions. These signs could be detected by advanced telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope and the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Sheikh said, 'We should never assume that other life and technology are the same as ours, but determining what 'ours' means can help put the search for extraterrestrial intelligence in perspective.' The study suggests that extraterrestrial life could detect the lights of cities and other human-made technosignatures, and that the Earth could be seen as a 'cosmic mirror' reflecting human impact on the planet.

**Study Reveals How Aliens Could Find Earth**
A study published in the Astronomical Journal, led by researcher Sofia Sheikh from the Seti Institute, analyzed various types of terrestrial technosignatures together for the first time. The study found that radio signals, such as those from the old Arecibo Observatory's planetary radar, are the most detectable signs of Earth. They can be captured up to 12,000 light-years away. Atmospheric technosignatures, such as nitrogen dioxide emissions, have become more detectable due to technological advancements like the James Webb Space Telescope and the future Habitable Worlds Observatory. If extraterrestrial civilizations have the same equipment as us, they could detect these emissions up to 5.7 light-years away. As we get closer to Earth, we detect more human-made signatures, such as city lights, lasers, heat islands, and satellites. 'Our goal with this project was to bring Seti back 'to Earth' for a moment and think about where we are really today with terrestrial technosignatures and detection capabilities,' said Macy Huston, co-author of the study and researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. The study reveals how terrestrial technosignatures can shape our search for intelligent life beyond Earth. Future telescopes and receivers may increase our detection sensitivity or allow us to identify new types of cosmic marks, such as other atmospheric pollution signatures.

**Aliens could spot humans on Earth by clocking 12 signs – and top of the list exposes us to E.T 12,000 lightyears away**
Scientists at the SETI Institute have created a list of 12 signs that could reveal the presence of humans on Earth to aliens. Topping the list is a type of radio signal called planetary radar, which can be detected from as far as 12,000 lightyears away. This signal is created when powerful radio waves are sent out into space and reflected back to Earth. The SETI Institute's goal is to 'bring SETI back 'down to Earth' for a moment' and to help scientists understand what signs to look out for in their own hunt for alien life. Aliens might also be looking for atmospheric technosignatures, such as nitrogen dioxide emissions, which can be detected from around 5.7 lightyears away. The Habitable Worlds Observatory, a large space telescope, will be able to spot these signs and potentially identify 'at least 25 potentially habitable worlds' by May 2027.
