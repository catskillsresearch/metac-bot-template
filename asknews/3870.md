**Scientists Propose Terraforming Mars as Realistic Option**
A group of scientists has published a study in Nature Astronomy, suggesting that terraforming the Mars is now a realistic option. The study's authors, led by Erika DeBenedictis, CEO of Pioneer Labs, argue that new technologies such as SpaceX's Starship and synthetic biology make it possible to terraform the planet. 'Vor dreißig Jahren war es nicht nur schwierig, sondern unmöglich, den Mars zu terraformen', DeBenedictis said. 'Aber neue Technologien haben es jetzt zu einer realen Möglichkeit gemacht.' The scientists propose a three-phase approach to terraforming the Mars: first, warming the planet's surface; second, introducing oxygen-producing microorganisms; and third, building a complex biosphere. They also suggest that terraforming could be a key to saving Earth, as it could provide a testing ground for environmental changes. 'Wenn wir lernen wollen, wie wir unsere Umwelt hier auf der Erde verändern können, um sie so zu gestalten, dass sie für uns und andere Lebensformen geeignet ist, wäre es vielleicht besser, auf dem Mars zu experimentieren und zu sagen: 'Schaut, funktioniert das?'', said Astronomin Nina Lanza, Co-Author of the paper. The scientists propose concrete next steps, including basic research and technology tests on the Mars. 'Bevorstehende Marsoberflächenmissionen im Jahr 2028 oder 2031 sollten kleine Experimente beinhalten, um Terraforming-Strategien, wie etwa die Erwärmung lokaler Regionen, risikoärmer zu gestalten', said DeBenedictis.

**Ancient River Valleys Persist on the Slopes of a Martian Volcano**
According to a recent study published by the Planetary Science Institute (PSI), evidence of widespread precipitation on Mars has been found on the slopes of the volcano Alba Mons. The study, which involved detailed geological mapping of the region, documents the volcano's evolution and subsequent tectonic modification. 'The geological mapping also generated a comprehensive database of river valleys that has allowed us to analyze the erosion of Alba Mons' surface,' said Crown. The findings suggest that the valleys have been preserved for less than 3 billion years, indicating a relatively recent geological history.

**Turning the Red Planet green? It's time to take terraforming Mars seriously, scientists say**
Scientists are now taking the concept of terraforming Mars seriously, according to a new study. The study argues that new technologies like SpaceX's Starship and synthetic biology have made it a real possibility. The study's authors, including Erika DeBenedictis, CEO of Pioneer Labs, and Edwin Kite, an associate professor at the University of Chicago, propose a three-phase development plan to terraform Mars. The first phase would involve warming the planet's surface, the second phase would introduce extremophile microbes, and the third phase would focus on building a complex biosphere. However, the authors also acknowledge the risks and complexities of terraforming, including the potential destruction of potential evidence of ancient Martian life. 'If we decide to terraform Mars, then we will really change it in ways that may or may not be reversible,' said Nina Lanza, a planetary scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. 'Mars is its own planet and has its own history. When we terraform, then we effectively don't have the opportunity to study that anymore, and we may lose knowledge about how planets form and evolve.'

**Whispers from the Red Planet: The Mysterious Rock That Could Rewrite Humanity's Place in the Cosmos**
The Perseverance rover on Mars has discovered a rock with unusual markings that resemble leopard-like spots. While the markings could be evidence of past life on Mars, researchers are approaching the discovery with caution. They must first rule out non-biological causes of the patterns before attributing them to life. As one researcher noted, 'Two things can appear equal but it doesn't necessarily mean that they are constructed equal.' The team is taking a slow and methodical approach to determine the origin of the markings, which could have significant implications for our understanding of the possibility of life beyond Earth.

**Oxygen on Mars - Without Sunlight?**
New data suggests that oxygen may be forming in Martian soil, deep beneath the surface, without the help of sunlight or plants. According to a paper titled 'Dark Oxygen Production on Mars,' this possibility is explored by reinterpreting known Martian anomalies as electrochemical systems capable of splitting water and generating oxygen in total darkness. The author draws inspiration from Earth, where 'dark oxygen' was discovered being produced on the abyssal seafloor in 2024, generated by electrochemical reactions on mineral nodules. The paper offers a bold new frame for astrobiology, suggesting that life or its chemistry might persist wherever there's charge, not just sunlight.

**Mars' Red Color: A New Theory Reveals the Planet's Ancient History**
Recent studies have challenged the long-held theory that Mars' distinctive red color is due to the presence of hematite. Instead, scientists have found that the color is caused by hydrated iron oxides, such as ferrihydrite, mixed with volcanic basalt. This discovery, published in Nature Communications, suggests that the formation of these compounds dates back to a time when water flowed abundantly on Mars, billions of years ago. The red color is a result of chemical reactions between water and iron-rich rocks, which formed the hydrated iron oxides. The erosion of these formations and the redistribution of the resulting red dust by Martian winds explain why the color is observed across the entire planet. This new understanding of the origin of Mars' color provides insights into the planet's ancient hydrological history and raises hopes for discovering signs of ancient life in regions where these minerals are present.

**The Red Color of Mars: A New Explanation**
Mars' reddish hue has been associated with blood and war since ancient times, but its true cause has been a topic of debate. The color of Mars is actually a reflection of its soil composition, not temperature. Scientists have long suggested that iron oxide, or rust, could be the culprit, but the exact type of iron oxide responsible for the color was unclear. Some have proposed that hematite, a compound found on Mars, could be the source, but new analyses have shed new light on the issue. By comparing the spectral signature of Martian soil to laboratory-created compounds, researchers have found that the red color of Mars is likely the result of ancient water flowing on the planet, eroding hydrated rocks and releasing red dust that spread across the planet via winds. As Dr. [no specific doctor is mentioned in the article] noted, 'This changes the entire story of how Mars got its red color.'

**3.7 Billion-Year-Old Organic Molecules on Mars: A Step Towards a New Era of Life?**
NASA and private space companies are in a priority race, while organic molecules discovered on Mars have caused excitement in the scientific community. Andy Weir's 'The Martian' novel and film, which has become a reality, is a step-by-step process. What does this mean for humanity and our world? In recent years, Mars has become the biggest excitement for the scientific community and space enthusiasts. Mars, being a neighbor to Earth, has a potential for new life and exploration. Searching for life signs on Mars, solving the planet's past climate, and establishing permanent settlements, are considered important milestones for humanity's future in space. The Martian film, which was adapted to the big screen in 2015, detailed and realistically portrayed NASA's plans to send humans to Mars by 2035. The film tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, who is left behind on Mars after a storm and must survive with limited resources. NASA also makes a great effort to rescue him. The Martian has turned into a reality. In the US, there is a debate about whether Mars or the Moon should be prioritized. Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman thinks that Mars should be prioritized. However, Elon Musk's priority is also Mars, but he has been criticized for his approach. China's increasing activity on the Moon is also affecting the US's strategic decisions. Trump and Musk's priority on Mars can be interpreted as follows: 'Mars, although it seems like both of their priorities, has not been left out of the equation. Ultimately, Mars is a difficult road, and the Moon is an important station. It's a destination, as well as a stopover.' 'Of course, Mars is much more important and has a much greater return. Both scientifically and technologically, Mars travel requires significant investments. The work done will result in technologies that can be adapted to daily life on Earth, changing our lives in different forms.' 'Even if humans are not on Mars by 2031, they will be very close to it in the 2030s.' Elon Musk has announced that he will send an 'unmanned' spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026 and that humans can go to Mars by 2031. Do you think humanity is close to achieving this goal? 'Because this work has long exceeded the realm of imagination. This process can be described as 'a very ambitious goal.' The fact that large companies are investing so much in this indicates that they have significant commercial expectations. The timeline may be a bit behind schedule. Humans may not be on Mars by 2031, but they will be very close to it in the late 2030s.' 'The fact that Mars has signs of past life, which may indicate that the necessary conditions for life exist there, is a significant discovery.' Sabancı University Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Astrofysics Professor Ersin Göğüş recently discovered large organic molecules on Mars. This has raised questions about biological activity on Mars. The molecules found on Mars are similar to those produced by life on Earth and have remained intact for approximately 3.7 billion years without being affected by geological activity, moisture, or heat. This suggests that the molecules on Mars are as old as life on Earth. What does this mean? Can Mars give us clues about our world's past and future? 'Of course, it can.' 'We know that the first signs of life appeared on Mars and Earth around the same time, approximately 4 billion years ago. We also know that Mars lost its atmosphere due to extreme solar winds, which could have led to the end of life. Although this is not a risk for Earth, humanity's excessive use of the planet could have negative consequences.' 'The Mars mission is motivating the development of new technologies.' Some people criticize the billions of dollars spent on sending humans to Mars, saying that 'it's a luxury to invest in space while solving problems on Earth.' Do you think this criticism is justified?

**Evolution on Mars: A Misconception**
The idea that evolution stopped when humans were created is a misconception. Our species has been around for 200,000 years, and was fully formed when a mutation in a protein on red blood cells spread across Africa 40,000 years ago, increasing resistance to malaria. This mutation would have allowed only those who were resistant to malaria to pass on their genes to the next generation, even if they were cared for by others. Similarly, populations that have adapted to high altitudes, such as the Tibetans, Andeans, and Ethiopians, have done so through genetic mutations that were spread through the population by the process of natural selection. This process is destructive, as those without the mutation would live worse, reproduce less, or both, allowing only those with the mutation to pass on their genes. We have also acquired Neanderthal genes through this process. Other examples include the European populations that acquired genes that gave them pale skin, which is beneficial in low sunlight areas. However, this has led to high rates of skin cancer in populations that lack this adaptation, such as those in Australia. The spread of agriculture 10,000 years ago has also been associated with the spread of mutations related to the digestion of grains and dairy. So, yes, the inhabitants of Mars can evolve, and they will have plenty of time to do so while waiting for their spacecraft to return.

**Exact type of strange lifeform that could live on brutal Mars surface revealed**
Scientists have discovered that lichens, a type of symbiotic relationship between fungus and algae, could potentially survive on Mars. The researchers tested two species of lichen, Diploschistes muscorum and Cetraria aculeata, and found that the former was able to carry out metabolic processes and activate defense mechanisms effectively even in an environment resembling the surface of Mars. According to Kaja Skubała, the lead researcher, 'Our study is the first to demonstrate that the metabolism of the fungal partner in lichen symbiosis remained active while being in an environment resembling the surface of Mars.' This finding expands our understanding of biological processes under simulated Martian conditions and reveals how hydrated organisms respond to ionising radiation, one of the most critical challenges for survival and habitability on Mars. While this doesn't mean that lichen are already living on Mars, it suggests that an alien colony of lichen could potentially survive the harsh conditions on the red planet. Separately, astronomers have detected a molecule called DMS in the atmosphere of the exoplanet K2-18b, which is 120 lightyears away from Earth and is believed to be 'teeming with life'. The lead scientist, Professor Nikku Madhusudhan, said 'there is no mechanism in the literature that can explain what we are seeing without life'.

**Lichens Show Potential to Survive on Mars**
A recent study has shown that lichens, a symbiotic organism consisting of fungi and photosynthetic bacteria or algae, are capable of surviving on Mars. The researchers exposed two species of lichens, Diploschistes muscorum and Cetraria aculeata, to ionizing radiation in a simulated Martian environment. The results showed that both species were able to remain metabolically active for the duration of the experiment. 'These results expand our understanding of biological processes in conditions that mimic Martian ones and show how hydrated organisms react to ionizing radiation,' said Dr. Kaja Skubala, a researcher from the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. The study suggests that lichens are the most promising candidates for future Mars missions. However, it is unlikely that any organism will be able to survive on Mars without human supervision for an extended period, as there is no known liquid water on the surface. Dr. Skubala noted that new experiments show that lichens are the main candidates for future Mars missions, and other species, such as extremophiles and mosses, may also be able to survive on the Red Planet.

**Lichens Show Promise for Mars Colonization**
A recent study has shown that lichens, a type of symbiotic organism consisting of fungi and photosynthetic bacteria or algae, are able to withstand the harsh conditions on Mars. The researchers exposed two species of lichens, Diploschistes muscorum and Cetraria aculeata, to ionizing radiation in a simulated Martian environment and found that they were able to survive the equivalent of a year's worth of radiation in just 5 hours. 'These results expand our understanding of biological processes in conditions mimicking Martian ones and show how hydrated organisms react to ionizing radiation,' said researcher Kaja Skubala. The study suggests that lichens are the most promising candidates for future Mars missions, with some species showing greater resistance to radiation than others. However, it is unlikely that any organism could survive on Mars without protection for an extended period of time due to the lack of liquid water on the surface. Other potential candidates for Mars colonization include extremophilic organisms such as tardigrades, which are able to withstand extreme temperatures, pressures, and radiation, and mosses, which have similar properties to lichens.

**Lichens Show Potential for Survival on Mars, but Radiation Remains a Threat**
Fungi and algae, known as lichens, have been found to be 'true survival artists' with the ability to thrive in harsh environments. Researchers have been studying their potential to survive on Mars, with some positive results. A Polish research team has now demonstrated that lichens can not only withstand the harsh conditions on Mars, but also the intense radiation. According to Kaja Skubała, a biologist from Jagiellonen University in Krakau, the metabolic processes of the fungal partner in the lichen symbiosis remained active in a simulated Martian environment. The researchers exposed two lichen species, Diploschistes muscorum and Cetraria aculeata, to Martian-like conditions, including extreme temperature fluctuations and radiation. D. muscorum performed significantly better than C. aculeata, with Skubała stating that it 'was able to perform metabolic processes and activate defense mechanisms effectively.' This suggests that D. muscorum is well-suited for survival on Mars. However, the researchers also found that radiation remains a major threat to potential life on Mars. Skubała notes that her research highlights the potential of lichens for 'colonizing extraterrestrial environments.' Interestingly, lichens are often used as indicators of good air quality, but they are also extremely sensitive to air pollution, with over half of the 2,000 species found in Germany being listed as endangered.

**Lichens Show Resilience in Simulated Martian Environment**
Scientists have made a surprising discovery that some terrestrial organisms, such as lichens, may be more resilient than previously thought, and could potentially survive on the surface of Mars. Lichens are organisms that consist of a biological symbiosis between fungi, algae, and/or cyanobacteria (a type of bacteria that can perform photosynthesis). These organisms are known for their ability to thrive in harsh environments, including arid deserts. According to a new study published in the journal IMA Fungus, some types of lichens may be able to withstand conditions similar to those on Mars, including low air pressure and temperature fluctuations, while maintaining their biological activity. The researchers, led by Dr. Kaja Skóbcowa, tested two types of lichens, Diploschistes muscorum and Cetraria aculeata, in a simulated Martian environment for five hours. They also simulated the amount of cosmic radiation (X-rays) that Mars would be exposed to during a year of intense solar activity. The results showed that Diploschistes muscorum outperformed Cetraria aculeata, maintaining its metabolic processes throughout the experiment. Dr. Skóbcowa said, 'Our study is the first to show that the fungal partner in lichen symbiosis remained active in a Martian-like environment. We found that Diploschistes muscorum was able to execute metabolic processes and activate defense mechanisms efficiently.' The findings suggest that the lichen species Diploschistes muscorum may be able to survive on the surface of Mars, challenging the common assumption that ionizing radiation (such as X-rays and gamma rays) on the red planet is a major obstacle to life.

**Scientists Find One Lifeform That Could Survive Extreme Extraterrestrial Environments**
Scientists have identified a lifeform, Diploschistes muscorum, that could potentially survive the harsh conditions on Mars. This lichen, a hybrid colony of fungus and algae/cyanobacteria, has been found to be able to withstand extreme temperatures, radiation, and pressure, making it a promising candidate for future human colonization of the Red Planet. According to lead author Kaja Skubała, 'Our study is the first to demonstrate that the metabolism of the fungal partner in lichen symbiosis remained active while being in an environment resembling the surface of Mars.' While further study is needed to understand the effects of long-term exposure to Martian conditions, this research expands our understanding of biological processes under simulated Martian conditions and reveals the potential of lichens for colonizing extraterrestrial environments.

**Lichens Survive in 'Martian' Laboratory: A Step Towards a Green Mars?**
Scientists have shown that lichens, organisms formed by a symbiosis of fungi and algae, can survive in conditions similar to those on Mars. The experiment, which lasted less than a working day, challenges the stereotype of the Red Planet as a lifeless world and opens up new possibilities for space biology. Lichens are known as 'extremophiles' in nature, able to grow in arctic deserts and on rocks where other forms of life cannot survive. In the experiment, two species of lichens, Diploschistes muscorum and Cetraria aculeata, were placed in special chambers where the pressure, air composition, and temperature were changed to mimic Martian conditions. They were also exposed to doses of radiation comparable to the annual average on the planet. The main surprise was that the fungal part of the lichens remained active even in the dark, without the help of photosynthesis by the algae. Diploschistes muscorum not only maintained metabolic processes but also activated defense mechanisms. This is similar to how smart car systems redistribute energy during overloads - the organism switched to 'emergency mode', producing antioxidants and substances that strengthen cell membranes. 'We have seen for the first time that the fungus in the symbiosis works as an autonomous bioreactor,' explains Kaja Skubala, lead author of the study. 'This changes our understanding of radiation as an insurmountable barrier to life on Mars.' The results are particularly important for the development of closed life support systems in space: lichens could produce oxygen or useful compounds for colonists, like 'green factories' in miniature. On Earth, analogues of lichens are already used for air purification or creating bio-coatings - their space counterparts may help terraform Mars. However, scientists are cautious: the experiment lasted only five hours, and real changes in day and night on the planet, dust storms, and prolonged exposure to radiation may make a difference. The next step is long-term testing in conditions even closer to Martian ones. If lichens pass these tests, it will not only bring us closer to creating self-sustaining bases on Mars but also force us to reconsider the possibility of extraterrestrial life - even in the form of fungi hidden under rocks. 'We have seen for the first time that the fungus in the symbiosis works as an autonomous bioreactor,' said Kaja Skubala, lead author of the study. 'This changes our understanding of radiation as an insurmountable barrier to life on Mars.'
