**Tony Awards 2025: What to Expect**
The 2025 Tony Awards will be held on June 8, featuring a star-studded lineup of presenters, including Cynthia Erivo, Aaron Tveit, and Lin-Manuel Miranda. The awards will be broadcast on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ in the US. This year's nominees include 29 shows, with 'Buena Vista Social Club', 'Death Becomes Her', and 'Maybe Happy Ending' leading the pack with 10 nominations each. Audra McDonald, the most awarded actress in theater history, is a strong contender for her role in the revival of 'Gypsy'. Kara Young, the first black actress nominated for a Tony in four consecutive years, could become the first black person to win two consecutive Tonys for her role in 'Purpose'. Other potential firsts include Daniel Dae Kim, who could become the first Asian winner in the best actor category, and Marjan Neshat and Tala Ashe, who could become the first Iranian actresses to win a Tony. The health of Broadway, which was once in doubt during the pandemic, is now thriving, with a record-breaking $1.9 billion in ticket sales for the 2024-2025 season. However, high ticket prices have raised concerns about the financial accessibility of Broadway.
