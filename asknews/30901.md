**AI Predicts Champions League Final: PSG vs. Inter Milan**
The AI, ChatGPT, has made its prediction for the Champions League final between PSG and Inter Milan. According to the AI, the most likely outcomes are a 1-1 draw (24.80%), a 2-1 win for PSG (20.70%), a 2-1 win for Inter (15.51%), and a 1-0 win for PSG (14.08%). The AI concludes that it's difficult to favor one team, but PSG has a slight advantage due to its current form and team cohesion. However, the AI does not rule out Inter due to its solidity and tactics. 'The AI has it clear and confirms who will win the Champions League final,' it says.

**Generative AI's most prominent skeptic doubles down**
Gary Marcus, a prominent critic of generative AI, has expressed his skepticism about the technology's potential, despite its growing popularity. Marcus believes that large language models (LLMs) are inherently flawed and will never deliver on Silicon Valley's grand promises. He advocates for a fundamentally different approach to building AI, called neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to rebuild human logic artificially rather than simply training computer models on vast datasets. Marcus warns that generative AI's limitations will lead to a darker consequence: companies like OpenAI will inevitably monetize their most valuable asset, user data, and sell it as a consolation prize. He acknowledges that generative AI will find useful applications in areas where occasional errors don't matter much, such as coding assistance and text generation, but believes that these applications will be limited and expensive to run. 'I'm skeptical of AI as it is currently practiced,' Marcus said. 'I think AI could have tremendous value, but LLMs are not the way there. And I think the companies running it are not mostly the best people in the world.'

**Drivers weigh in on cars at end of Indy 500 lead lap: 'Get the F out of the way'**
At the 109th Indianapolis 500, Alex Palou won the race, but the finish was marred by controversy. The two cars at the end of the lead lap, driven by Devlin DeFrancesco and Louie Foster, were racing ahead of the leader and not yielding their position, per INDYCAR rules. This allowed Palou to draft behind them and save fuel, ultimately winning the race. Many drivers, including Will Power and David Malukas, believe that the spirit of the rules should have seen the two cars move over to let Palou and Marcus Ericsson pass. Palou's crew chief, Ricky Davis, said that the two cars 'didn't spoil it' for them, but may have spoiled it for Ericsson and Malukas. Palou's win gives him a 112-point lead in the 2025 NTT INDYCAR SERIES Championship.

**Sam Altman said AI would replace 95% of ad agency work. 3 top creative directors say AI has won them lucrative business.**
Contrary to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's prediction that AI will replace 95% of ad agency work, three top creative directors say AI is fueling a creative boom and expanding their services. Elena Knox, executive creative director at BBDO New York, uses AI to sell ambitious concepts to clients, creating quick GIFs and realistic voiceovers that convince clients to invest in big ideas. Alasdhair Macgregor Hastie, executive creative director at BETC, used AI to create a new brand character for Woolite, delivering the campaign in six weeks compared to the three to six months it would have taken for an in-person production. The creative directors agree that AI presents challenges to the ad agency business model, but also see opportunities for growth and adaptation.

**Gary Marcus on AI: 'We're Making the Same Mistakes We've Been Making for 30 Years'**
Gary Marcus, a leading expert in artificial intelligence, has expressed concerns about the current state of AI research and development. He argues that the focus on AI generative models and large language models (LLMs) is misguided and that the field is making the same mistakes it has been making for the past 30 years. Marcus believes that the hype surrounding AI is creating unrealistic expectations and that the field is not making progress towards creating a truly intelligent machine. He argues that the current approach to AI is based on statistical models that are not capable of understanding the world and that a more symbolic approach is needed. Marcus also criticizes the lack of transparency and accountability in AI research and development, and argues that the field needs to be more focused on addressing the negative consequences of AI, such as bias and discrimination. He proposes a set of recommendations for improving the field of AI, including the need for more transparency, accountability, and education about AI. Marcus also warns about the dangers of unchecked technological progress and the need for a more nuanced and critical approach to AI development.

**Is AI a bubble? It's complicated**
As the 25th anniversary of the dot-com bubble approaches, investors are questioning whether the current AI gold rush is a repeat of history or a new era. Goldman Sachs' Peter Oppenheimer believes that AI is driving unprecedented growth, but acknowledges some red flags, including the concentration of market power in a few tech giants. Others, such as Howard Marks and Paul Krugman, are more cautious, pointing to signs of a bubble, including high valuations and investors chasing returns with disregard for risk. Gary Marcus, an AI researcher, believes that we are in a bubble that will eventually burst, but that generative AI itself will not disappear. The real debate is about timing and who will survive to see the AI revolution.

**Are we on the cusp of AGI, as Musk suggests? There's reason for doubt**
Elon Musk believes that the world is on the cusp of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), but experts such as Yann LeCun, Fei-Fei Li, and Andrew Ng are skeptical, saying that AI is nowhere close to becoming sentient. They argue that AI's benefits, such as powering smartphones and providing flood forecasts, outweigh its perceived risks. However, experts like Musk and Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank, insist that the phenomenal growth of Generative AI (GenAI) models indicates that machines will soon think and act like humans with AGI. The fear is that if unregulated, AGI could lead to machines automatically evolving into Skynet-like machines that outsmart humans or wage war against them. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai has introduced Gemini 2.0, a model built for the 'new agentic era', and experts like Geoffery Hinton have increased their estimate of the likelihood of AI leading to human extinction within the next three decades to 10-20%. Some experts have even placed money bets on the advent of AGI, with Gary Marcus and Miles Brundage making a bet on whether AI systems can perform 8 of 10 tasks by the end of 2027. The fact remains that most companies are testing GenAI tools and AI agents before using them for full-scale production work due to inherent limitations such as hallucinations, biases, and poor data quality.

**Gary Marcus: The AI Industry is Exaggerating its Capabilities**
Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and entrepreneur, is critical of the current state of artificial intelligence (AI). He argues that the promises of AI are exaggerated and that the technology is not yet ready for widespread use. Marcus points to the limitations of current AI systems, such as their inability to understand context and their tendency to generate false information. He also criticizes the lack of transparency in AI decision-making and the lack of accountability for AI-related errors. Marcus believes that true AI, or 'general intelligence', is still a long way off and that the current focus on narrow AI applications is a distraction from the real challenges of developing truly intelligent machines. He suggests that a new approach is needed, one that combines the strengths of human and machine intelligence. Marcus is not alone in his skepticism, and his views are shared by some other experts in the field. However, his criticism of the AI industry and its leaders has made him a target of criticism and even personal attacks.

**The End of AI Supremacy: Gary Marcus on DeepSeek and the Future of AI**
Gary Marcus, a well-known expert in AI, believes that the 'supremacy of AI' has ended for now, and the US has not won. He focuses on the case of DeepSeek, a Chinese innovation that has surprised the world with its efficiency and effectiveness. DeepSeek was designed to be a commercial tool, not a language model, but it has achieved state-of-the-art results using only 1/50 of the costs of previous models. This has put it on par with the leading US companies, such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, in terms of performance and innovation. Marcus notes that the recent innovations in China, including a new model five times cheaper than DeepSeek and more than 200 times more efficient than OpenAI's o1, are a sign that the US is no longer ahead in the AI race. He believes that the US will continue to innovate, but the gap is closing rapidly, and other countries, including Europe, may soon catch up. Marcus also criticizes OpenAI's business model, saying that it is no longer clear that they represent the state of the art, and that their prices are no longer competitive. He notes that the relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft has deteriorated, and that Sam Altman's credibility has been eroded. Marcus predicts that OpenAI may become the 'WeWork of AI', and that Nvidia may suffer a serious setback due to the efficiency of DeepSeek. He also criticizes the US government's policy on AI, saying that it has pushed China to innovate and develop its own chips, and that the control of exports has not been effective in preventing China's progress.
