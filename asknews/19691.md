**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Anthropic CEO Predicts Technological Singularity in Six Months**
According to the CEO of Anthropic, the human race is only six months away from reaching technological singularity, a concept where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. This prediction contrasts with the most conservative scientific estimates, but reflects the unprecedented acceleration in the development of artificial intelligence since the emergence of models like ChatGPT. The study by AIMultiple, which examines 8,590 predictions from scientists, business leaders, and the tech community, reveals that expectations about the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and singularity have changed dramatically in recent years. While scientists predict AGI around 2040, business leaders are more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The study documents how predictions vary over a nearly 50-year spectrum, from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to estimates that extend several decades. However, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, with industry leaders consistently more optimistic in their predictions than the scientific community in general. The study examines different thresholds of AI, including AGI and superintelligence, providing a comprehensive view of expectations in the field. The research tracks changes in these predictions over time, especially after the emergence of large language models that have transformed the landscape. The analysis offers several perspectives on why many experts consider the arrival of AGI inevitable, including the lack of apparent limits to machine intelligence, the Law of Moore, and the potential of quantum computing to compensate for engineering barriers. Not all experts consider AGI a certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is more multifaceted than the current definition of AGI. Yann LeCun, a pioneer of deep learning, suggests that AGI should be rebranded as 'advanced machine intelligence' and argues that human intelligence is too specialized to be replicable. The report also notes that, although AI can be a valuable tool for making new discoveries, it cannot make these discoveries on its own. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, allowing for more discoveries per experiment,' the analysis details. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer,' the document obtained by AIMultiple states. While individual predictions from experts and scientists about AGI vary over a period of approximately half a century, the message is clear: human society will inevitably face incredible changes as a result of these algorithms. Whether these changes will be good or bad, according to the research, depends on us.

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**AI Will Double the Human Lifespan By 2030, Tech CEO Claims. Is This the Dawn of Immortality?**
Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, claims that artificial intelligence (AI) could double human lifespans by 2030, a prediction that has sparked debate. Amodei argues that AI can help find novel solutions to aging and death, citing examples of drugs that increase maximum lifespan in rats by 25-50% and some animals living up to 200 years. However, S. Jay Olshansky, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics, disputes this claim, stating that there is no evidence that AI can modulate the biological process of aging. Olshansky says that the burden of proof is on AI scientists to demonstrate that they can extend human lifespans, and that unsubstantiated promises are not enough. 'At the moment, AI is just a buzz term with no evidence that it will yield radical increases in human longevity,' Olshansky says. 'Either we're doing science or we're not -- unfortunately this field seems to draw its share of quacks.'

**Scientists Predict When We'll Find Extraterrestrial Life**
Scientists from the University of Berkeley believe that the search for extraterrestrial life may yield results in the next few decades. Some experts, such as Claire Webb from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, mentioned that Frank Drake, a pioneer in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, predicted that we may find evidence of life in 2024. Andrew Siemion, director of SETI research at Berkeley, predicted that we will find evidence of life on Mars in 2036. Others, such as Sara Seager, believe that the search for extraterrestrial life will be possible with the development of new space telescopes, which will take decades to design and launch. Despite the differences in predictions, the participants agree that the search for extraterrestrial life is a real scientific challenge that requires long-term investments and global coordination.

**Australian Researchers Unveil 50-Year-Old UAP Studies**
The Australian Institute for the Study of Non-Human Intelligence (NHIRI) has been established to investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) using modern technologies, independent expeditions, and open data. According to Ross Coulthart, head of scientific projects at NHIRI, the goal is to collect objective evidence, either confirming or refuting the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence. Coulthart notes that the topic of UAP has been stigmatized and ridiculed for decades, hindering research development. The institute has also begun digitizing archives of Australian UAP sighting cases, spanning over 50 years, including the famous 'flying saucer' incident in Tallangatta in 1966. According to Keith Basterfield, only about 5% of reported sightings cannot be explained logically. As interest in UAP grows, particularly after US Congressional hearings and a NASA report, NHIRI aims to restore legitimacy to a scientific approach to studying this phenomenon. The institute plans to support international research initiatives and create a platform for data exchange and open analytical models.

**SETI Scientists Claim 1700 Intelligent Civilizations in the Universe**
Scientists from the SETI Institute claim that there are at least 1700 intelligent civilizations in the universe, excluding humanity. Astronomers are optimistic that humanity may receive responses from extraterrestrials to signals sent from Earth in the near future. Dr. Seth Shostak, former chief astronomer of the SETI Institute, predicts that the first messages from extraterrestrials may arrive as early as 2036, thanks to continuous improvements in telescopes and computer equipment. In 2002, scientists sent signals to the Pioneer 10 spacecraft, which they now believe could have been detected by intelligent beings beyond our solar system. The impulses have already reached a star approximately 27 light-years from Earth. If there are planets around this star inhabited by intelligent beings, a response could arrive as early as 2029. Other scientists suggest that extraterrestrials may have used the transit method to detect Earth, when our planet passes behind the Sun, reducing its light. Thus, inhabitants of 1715 nearby systems could have detected Earth over the past 5000 years, and residents of 319 systems will be able to do so in the next 5000 years.

**AI Could Achieve Human-Like Intelligence By 2030 And 'Destroy Mankind', Google Predicts**
A new research paper by Google DeepMind predicts that human-level artificial intelligence (AI), also known as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), could arrive by 2030 and 'permanently destroy humanity'. The study highlights the potential risks of AGI, including misuse, misalignment, mistakes, and structural risks. While the paper does not specify how AGI might lead to extinction, it focuses on preventive measures that Google and other AI companies should take to reduce AGI's threat. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis advocates for a UN-like umbrella organisation to oversee AGI's development, saying 'I would advocate for a kind of CERN for AGI, and by that, I mean a kind of international research focused high-end collaboration on the frontiers of AGI development to try and make that as safe as possible.' AGI takes AI a step further by possessing intelligence that can be applied across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence.

**The Possibility of an Advanced Non-Human Civilization on Earth Millions of Years Ago**
The possibility of an advanced non-human civilization on Earth millions of years ago is a topic of interest. According to Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence, there are unidentified phenomena (FANI) whose nature is unclear, some of which can move through any medium, from air to water and vice versa. These FANI could be evidence of a civilization that preceded us on Earth 252 million years ago. The stability of satellites in orbit around the Earth depends on their propulsion method. Vehicles capable of moving through water and air, like those reported by US Navy pilots in 2004, could have been designed to refuel by collecting water and breaking its molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using solar-powered electrolysis. The Project Galileo, led by Avi Loeb, aims to clarify the nature of FANI through the collection of new scientific data. The project's first observatory at Harvard University is currently monitoring the entire sky in video and audio, and the data collected is being analyzed using artificial intelligence software. The team will report any FANI captured in their data openly, complementing the secret data collected by military and intelligence agencies working for national security. A proposed law, the FANI Disclosure Act of 2023, aims to increase transparency and encourage scientific research on FANI, as pursued by the Project Galileo. 'For decades, many Americans have been fascinated by mysterious and inexplicable objects, and it's time they get some answers,' said Chuck Schumer. 'The American public has the right to learn about technologies of unknown origin, non-human intelligence, and inexplicable phenomena.' The legislation has bipartisan support, with Senator Kristen Gillibrand stating, 'Understanding FANI is fundamental to our national security and maintaining control over all domains [land, air, and sea].'

**AI Experts Predict Machines Could Outthink Humans by 2040. But Some Are Betting on Even Sooner**
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the point at which machines can perform any intellectual task as well as humans, may be closer than we think. According to a survey of 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and AI researchers, there is a 50% chance that AGI could arrive by 2040. Some experts, like Elon Musk and OpenAI's Sam Altman, predict AGI could arrive as early as 2026 or 2035. The rapid rise of large language models like GPT-4 has accelerated expectations, but the road to AGI is paved with bold predictions and a fair share of over-optimism. Futurist Ray Kurzweil believes that we're just years away from human-level AI and predicts that AGI will be achieved by 2045, with humans able to increase their intelligence a millionfold through advanced brain interfaces. However, not everyone is convinced, with some researchers arguing that human intelligence is too complex to replicate and others pointing out that intelligence alone doesn't solve all problems.
