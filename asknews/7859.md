**Saadet Partisi Chairman Arıkan's Speech in Istanbul: 'We Are Against Corruption and Lawlessness'**
Saadet Partisi Genel Başkanı Mahmut Arıkan spoke at the party's Istanbul branch congress. He discussed the current issues and made statements about the ongoing investigation into the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. Arıkan said, 'We have reached the 6th wave in Istanbul. Why do these waves always hit the opposite shores? 24 municipalities are under administration, none of which are from the ruling party. The number of journalists and academics in prison is unknown, none of whom are from the ruling party. This is not justice, it's a double standard! We are against corruption, injustice, and lawlessness in all circumstances and for everyone!' He also stated, 'We are ready to do what is necessary to achieve a 'Terörsüz Türkiye' (a Turkey free from terror). We need a government that brings people together, listens, and gives confidence. We need a 'Yaşanabilir bir Türkiye' (a livable Turkey).' Arıkan also discussed the decline in birth rates in Turkey, saying, 'This is a very serious situation. If we don't take action, it will get worse in the 2030s. The solution is to restore ahlak and maneviyat (morality and spirituality). We can't solve this by making announcements in front of cameras or by making promises. We need to take concrete actions and implement the right policies.' He also criticized the government's new constitution plans, saying, 'I'm curious, what problem will the new constitution solve? Will it increase the minimum wage and pension? Will it stop inflation? Will it reduce interest rates? Will it reunite families?' Finally, he warned against allowing Palestinians from Gaza to enter Turkey, saying, 'Don't make the mistake of turning Turkey into a tool for the dehumanization of Gaza and Palestine. You will be held accountable for this!'

'The Islamic Emirate does not aim to restrict or suppress literary expression. On the contrary, we actively work to support poets and organize more effective poetry festivals.

**Race Against Time: Kabul's Groundwater May Run Dry by 2030**
According to a report by The Japan Times, Kabul's groundwater is at risk of running dry by 2030 due to population growth, climate change, and unregulated water extraction. Experts estimate that up to 80% of Kabul's groundwater is contaminated, and more than 100,000 unregulated wells extract water in the city, resulting in a 76-million-cubic-meter annual deficit. The Islamic Emirate's Ministry of Energy and Water has proposed a plan to transfer water from the Panjshir River, which would require a budget of $300 to $400 million. As The Japan Times notes, 'the situation in Kabul is clearly deteriorating' and urgent action is needed to address the water shortage.

The IEA also criticized the ICC for remaining silent on injustices. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) emphasized the importance of realistic engagement with Afghanistan, avoiding selective behavior. Pakistan announced it would expel Afghan refugees from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.

Iran underlined support to Afghan investors, saying they could obtain residency in the country's free trade zones. 'We deal with Afghanistan based on realities,' said Tariq Ali Bakhit, the special representative of the OIC for Afghanistan. 'Pressure tactics not only failed to facilitate engagement but also drove nations and countries further apart,' said Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the deputy prime minister for economic affairs.

**Turkey Hands Over Afghan Embassy in Ankara to Taliban-Appointed Diplomats**
The Afghan embassy in Ankara has handed over its operations to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, following the end of the term of all diplomats appointed by the previous Afghan government. This decision comes amid ongoing pressure from the Taliban to control Afghan diplomatic missions abroad. According to a statement from the embassy, all diplomats affiliated with the previous republican system have completed their tasks as of today. The statement emphasized that 'in the absence of a legitimate government based on the will of the people, the embassy has been handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey as of this afternoon.' It noted that the embassy had dealt with the Taliban on consular matters over the past three years, but 'has never recognized the Taliban's rule as a legitimate government representing the will of the Afghan people.' Since taking power in Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban has sought to control Afghan embassies and consulates around the world. Turkey had previously handed over the Afghan consulate in Istanbul to Taliban diplomats, reflecting Turkey's approach to dealing with the new political situation in Afghanistan. In the same context, the Taliban has exerted pressure on several European countries to hand over Afghan embassies on their territory to the hosting countries, which has already been done in some cases. On the other hand, some countries still refuse to recognize the Taliban's rule, leading to the closure of some Afghan embassies in Western countries, amidst the absence of any official recognition of the government led by the movement. A Taliban foreign ministry official commented on these developments, stressing that the Afghan embassy in Ankara will continue to operate as before. Zakir Jalali, head of the third political department at the Taliban's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, wrote on the 'X' platform: 'Citizens should be reassured that consular services and representation of the country are being carried out by diplomats of the Islamic Emirate (Taliban government) in the embassy with complete transparency and responsibility and commitment.' Jalali added that changes in diplomatic staff in embassies and diplomatic missions are a common practice in international relations. Despite the recent developments, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not issued any official statement on the matter so far. Observers see the handover of the embassy as part of Turkey's diplomatic balance in dealing with the Taliban government, in the absence of international official recognition. Currently, most Afghan embassies and diplomatic missions in regional countries, except for Tajikistan, are being managed by diplomats affiliated with the Taliban. While some countries are handling these changes with caution, many Afghan embassies in Western countries have been closed and handed over to the hosting governments.

**IEA slams Trump’s suggestion of turning Gaza into the ‘Riviera of the Middle East’**
The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) has condemned US President Donald Trump's suggestion of turning Gaza into the 'Riviera of the Middle East' and resettling its Palestinian residents, calling it a 'clear violation' of international law. The plan, which was met with widespread criticism, would involve forcibly transferring populations, a strictly prohibited act under international law. The IEA stated that such plans 'represent the sinister motives of the Zionist regime' and 'provoke widespread resentment among Muslims and escalate tensions in the region.' Turkey and France also rejected the proposal, with Turkey calling it 'unacceptable' and France saying it risks destabilising the Middle East. Countries such as Russia, China, Germany, Spain, Ireland, and the UK continue to support the two-state solution, which has been the basis of Washington's policy in the region for decades. Trump's proposal has sparked diplomatic shockwaves across the Middle East and around the globe, with China opposing the forced transfer of Palestinians and Hamas calling it 'ridiculous and absurd.'
