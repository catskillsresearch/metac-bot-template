**Badenoch urges Prime Minister to visit fishermen affected by EU...**
Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, has urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to visit fishermen in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, who fear that the UK's trade deal with the EU will 'kill' their businesses. According to Badenoch, the fishermen feel 'forgotten' by the Government and believe that Starmer does not understand their struggles. They are concerned that the 12-year extension of a post-Brexit agreement granting EU fleets access to British waters will harm their industry. Badenoch said, 'They said they woke up one day and just heard that fishing rights have been given to Europe for 12 years.' The Conservative leader also stated that some fishermen feel their children do not want to work in the industry due to lack of staff and poor working conditions. She added, 'They hate the fact that people think that they're just a small industry that can just be pushed to the side.' Ministers have insisted that the deal will provide fishermen with certainty for the future, but Badenoch believes that the Government should have pushed for yearly negotiations on European access.

**Huge victory for the survey for Nigel Farage while Kemi Badenoch hits the new bottom | Politics | News**
A recent Ipsos survey has shown a significant drop in Kemi Badenoch's popularity, with a net approval rating of -32, making her less popular than Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Only 17% of respondents have a favorable opinion of her, while 49% have an unfavorable opinion. On the other hand, Nigel Farage has seen a boost in his popularity, with 31% of respondents having a favorable opinion, surpassing former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's 26% approval rating. Gideon Skinner, principal director of British policy in Ipsos, said, 'Our favorite notes this month show a mixed bag for the main politicians of the United Kingdom. While the Labor Party has seen a slight bump of favorites, most people still think that the country is heading in the wrong direction and criticizing the Prime Minister and the Chancellor.' British bookmakers are currently pessimistic about Kemi Badenoch's chances of becoming the next Conservative leader, with Robert Jenrick being seen as the most likely candidate.

**BBC Breakfast host ties Tory leader Kemi Badenoch in knots in winter fuel payments grilling - The Mirror**
Tory leader Kemi Badenoch was grilled on BBC Breakfast about her stance on winter fuel payments, which have been means-tested by the government, affecting millions of pensioners. Badenoch refused to commit to reversing the policy, citing 'difficulties' in changing a policy once it's brought in. She indicated that she would keep means testing the payments to ensure millionaire pensioners do not access the Â£300 payments. When asked for a specific view on the winter fuel cuts, Badenoch said, 'Every time a government makes a change, you don't know whether you can go back to exactly where you were before.' Naga Munchetty pressed her for a constructive suggestion, but Badenoch instead criticized government borrowing figures and targeted the welfare budget, saying, 'The whole economy is topsy turvy.'

**Drop in work visas and students halved net migration, ONS figures show**
According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the number of work visas and students has significantly dropped, resulting in a halved net migration in the UK. The previous largest calendar year fall was during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. The drop in students bringing family members to the UK is a key objective of the changes introduced by James Cleverly, the last Tory home secretary. The end of global travel restrictions also contributed to the decrease in net migration. The Home Office released separate data showing a decrease in the number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels, but it is still higher than when Labour came to power last year. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp stated, 'The decisions taken by the last Conservative government have meant these net migration figures have fallen enormously... but let me be honest, those steps are not enough.' Tory leader Kemi Badenoch wrote on social media that 'numbers are still too high.' Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said, 'Not as high as the great Tory betrayal, but still disastrous.'

**Senior Tory Calls On Kemi Badenoch To Quit After Local Election Drubbing**
A senior Tory, Jason Smithers, has called for Kemi Badenoch to resign as Conservative Party leader following the party's loss of 674 seats and control of all 15 councils in the local elections. Smithers stated, 'I am on a call next week with the leader of the Conservative Party and I will be putting it to her that she should be resigning.' A former Tory cabinet minister believes Badenoch has 'got a year' to turn around the party's fortunes or face being ousted. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said, 'The party that I lead is expanding. As we march on, the Conservatives are in retreat. In my opinion, they will never recover.'

**Badenoch backs medical supervision over transgender self-identification**
Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for a medically supervised process for transitioning, rather than self-identification as transgender. She made the comments after clashing with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer on the issue, and accused Labour ministers of lying about support for female-only spaces. Badenoch stated, 'I've always seen the danger in self-identification, partly because I've had my own run-ins with predatory men.' She emphasized the need for a 'clear, medically supervised process' involving doctors to verify real gender dysphoria. Badenoch also repeated her call for the Prime Minister to apologize to Independent MP Rosie Duffield, who resigned from the Labour Party in September 2024 over trans rights.

**Kemi Badenoch has a year to save her job**
Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party, faces a challenging year to save her job. The party's structure, which has become more centralized and autocratic, makes it difficult for leaders to maintain loyalty among MPs. Badenoch's own tactics, which involve avoiding the limelight and making carefully chosen interventions, are not well-suited for opposition and have led to strategic difficulties. Her failure to commit to a diagnosis of what went wrong before the 2024 election has also meant that her supporters have not committed to any particular policy position. Meanwhile, Robert Jenrick, a potential challenger, is gaining support from donors and MPs, and is seen as a more energetic and media-savvy alternative to Badenoch. Badenoch is caught between moving to the right to appeal to her right-wing supporters, which would reduce the difference between herself and Jenrick, or tacking left, which could lead to her right-wing supporters jumping ship. Time will tell if she can show real progress by next year's local elections and save her job.

**Plotters share plans to oust Kemi Badenoch 'sharpish' after local elections**
Kemi Badenoch is expected to face a leadership challenge after the local elections, as plotters prepare to 'get her out sharpish' following the expected loss of hundreds of local councillors. The Conservatives are on course to lose significantly in the county council and mayor elections, with Labour's popularity expected to increase. A political operator involved in the plot to remove Ms Badenoch as Tory leader has drawn up a media 'grid' of attacks to 'make the Tory leader's life difficult after May', according to the Sunday Times. This will be a disaster for Ms Badenoch, who will struggle to spin the results positively. 'The Tories are on course to lose hundreds of local councillors, and it will be a significant blow to Kemi Badenoch's leadership,' said a source. 'She will be under pressure to resign or face a leadership challenge after the local elections.'

**Kemi Badenoch facing 'possible leadership challenge' in summer, reports claim**
Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservatives, may face a leadership challenge in the summer, according to reports. Senior party sources have expressed frustration with her 'meek impact' on the public and her approach to holding the Labour Government accountable. The Local Elections in May 2025 will be a major test for Badenoch, and if the Tories experience another disappointing campaign, more leadership chaos could ensue. One source said, 'I thought Kemi Badenoch would survive the Local Elections, but right now, I am not so sure that's the case.' Badenoch's approach to Prime Minister's Questions has also been criticized, with some reports suggesting that senior Labour figures are 'going easy' on her to keep her in position. A source urged Badenoch to change course on her chosen topics, saying it is 'time for a change'.

**Tory leader Kemi Badenoch could face a leadership challenge within months**
Tory leader Kemi Badenoch is facing a potential leadership challenge within months, according to senior Tories. Shadow Cabinet ministers have expressed concerns about her performance at PMQs, saying she is 'bombing' and being outshone by Nigel Farage's Reform Party. One senior Tory said, 'PMQs this week was woeful. She is getting worse and worse and Keir is getting better.' Another said, 'The problem is she doesn't listen to anyone. She needs to change course and quickly.' Kemi has until September to turn things around or serious questions will be asked of her leadership. The party is also struggling financially, with Tory Party coffers running dry and staff being laid off at HQ. Meanwhile, Reform Party Treasurer Nick Candy is 'hoovering up lots of donations from the City.' Some Labour MPs are 'going soft' on Kemi, not wanting her to be toppled too quickly in case the party gets a more effective leader.

**Tory regicide: Will Kemi make it to 2026?**
Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative Party, is facing significant challenges as she approaches her 100-day milestone. Despite her 'anti-woke' values and no-nonsense style, the party continues to lack clear policy direction and coherent vision for the future. A YouGov poll shows that only one in seven voters think Badenoch looks like a prime minister in waiting, and only a quarter believe she is doing a good job as leader of the opposition. The party's financial troubles have led to a sharp drop in staffing, and donations are instead going to rival party campaigns, most notably Reform. Some within the party are calling for a Reform/Tory pact, arguing that on current poll numbers, the two parties combined could rule in coalition. However, Badenoch has repeatedly vetoed such a move, claiming it would drive away voters. With key elections next year, including the locals, Senedd, and Holyrood elections, the results will be a crucial test for Badenoch's leadership. If her party fails to reverse the electoral disaster of last year, the Tories' appetite for ousting underperforming leaders will likely return with full force.
