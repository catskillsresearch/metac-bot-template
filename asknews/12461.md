**Environment | UK Regulatory Outlook May 2025**
The UK government has announced several initiatives to promote environmental protection and sustainability. The UK Woodland Carbon Code has published template agreements for the purchase and sale of carbon units from peatland and woodland projects. The government is also consulting on the implementation of principles for voluntary carbon and nature market integrity, and has proposed reforms to Landfill Tax in England and Northern Ireland. Additionally, the Environment Principles, Governance and Biodiversity Targets (Wales) Bill has been announced for introduction before the summer 2025 recess. The Climate Change Committee has published its 2025 progress report, highlighting the need for proactive adaptation to climate change. The government has also announced a rapid review of local authority enforcement of fly-tipping waste offences, and the Planning and Infrastructure Bill has moved to its committee stage in the House of Commons. Furthermore, the UN has released new standards for setting up a carbon market under the Paris Agreement, and the Council of Europe has unveiled its new Strategy on the Environment for 2025 to 2030, which includes the introduction of a new Convention on the Protection of the Environment through Criminal Law. 'The government will introduce these principles in a proportionate manner with the aim of aligning common processes across markets, while simultaneously acknowledging the varying maturity, scale and characteristics of different projects,' said the government. 'The convention's primary objective is to strengthen environmental protection by preventing and combating environmental crimes, fostering national and international cooperation, and establishing minimum legal standards for states' national legislation,' said the Council of Europe. 'The report concludes with recommendations that the government's NAP3 should be revised to address the most pressing risks, including increasing threats to food production by extreme weather, and an increasing number of properties at risk of flooding or overheating,' said the Climate Change Committee.

**Madeira Parliament Opposes Centralization of European Fund Management**
The Madeira Parliament has opposed the centralization of European fund management for the 2028-2034 period, arguing that the autonomous region should continue to manage the funds directly. The parliament approved a PSD project of resolution, which recommends that the Government of the Republic oppose the centralization of fund management in the Quadro Financeiro Plurianual (QFP) 2028-2034. The document states that 'a centralized management means that the Government of the Republic becomes the entity that defines national priorities, controlling the programming, approval, and monitoring of projects.' The PSD argues that this would be a serious risk to territorial cohesion, political and administrative autonomy, and the effectiveness of applying funds, especially for regions with autonomous, insular, and ultraperipheral status, such as the Autonomous Region of Madeira. The parliament recommends that the national executive, led by Luís Montenegro, 'reclaim the consecration of a multi-level governance model, capable of strengthening the autonomy of ultraperipheral regions in defining, executing, and evaluating policies financed by European funds.' The parliament also asks the Government of the Republic to 'defend the specificity and ultraperipherality of Madeira and the Azores in negotiations with European institutions, guaranteeing a fair and proportional distribution of resources and participation in decision-making processes.'

**Government fast-tracks new reservoirs to secure water supply**
The UK government has announced plans to speed up the planning process for two new reservoirs in Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire, which are expected to provide more resilience to future droughts. The reservoirs, which are currently pencilled for completion in 2036 and 2040 respectively, would help protect against the impacts of drought by collecting excess rainfall during wet periods. However, some experts warn that reservoirs are not a silver bullet and that managing how we use water needs to take greater precedence in a warming climate. Water Minister Emma Hardy said, 'This is really important because if we don't build the reservoirs, we're going to be running out of the drinking water that we need by the mid-2030s.' The government also plans to pass legislation to automatically make the other seven proposed reservoirs 'nationally significant', so the final decision would be taken by national government. 'It's absolutely critical that we build these reservoirs now,' said David Henderson, chief executive of Water UK. 'If we don't build them now, we wait another 10 years, it's going to cost even more, so we can't keep kicking the can down the road any longer.' However, some experts highlight that building reservoirs doesn't come cheaply, and that it could ultimately filter down to people's bills. 'We need a complete overhaul of the way we use water, to plug leaks, cut down on waste and store water where it falls as rain,' said Prof Hannah Cloke of the University of Reading.

**UK pension schemes told to merge into 'megafunds' by 2030**
The UK government has announced plans to require some smaller pension schemes to merge into 'megafunds' with at least 25 billion pounds of assets by 2030. The goal is to improve returns and invest more in clean energy. The government will also create a 'backstop' power to potentially force investment firms to meet set allocation targets for illiquid assets. Pensions Minister Torsten Bell said, 'Basically everybody agrees bigger is better. That's not true for everything in life, but it is true for pension funds.' However, some investment firms have criticized the plan, saying it risks worse outcomes for pension savers. Tom Selby, director of public policy at AJ Bell, said, 'The government says it will create a'sword of Damocles' power in legislation.... This essentially puts a gun to schemes' heads and will create those mandatory targets in all-but-name.' The government has stated that it is not directing specific investment strategies and the proposals reflect a consensus within the pensions industry.

**Artificial Intelligence | UK Regulatory Outlook May 2025**
The Data (Use and Access) Bill, which includes provisions on AI and copyright, has been debated in Parliament. The House of Commons removed provisions on AI transparency, but added requirements for the secretary of state to publish an economic impact assessment and a report on the use of copyright works in AI systems. The House of Lords has re-instated the AI/copyright transparency amendments, but the House of Commons has rejected them. The bill is now on hold until 2 June, when it will return to the Lords. The Children's Commissioner has called for a ban on apps that allow users to generate sexually explicit deepfakes of children using generative AI. The government has launched a formal qualifying process for AI Growth Zones, which will provide enhanced access to power and support for planning approvals to accelerate the build out of AI infrastructure in the UK. Impress, a press regulator, has released new guidance for journalists and publishers on the ethical use of AI. The European Commission has missed its deadline to finalise the general-purpose AI (GPAI) code of practice, which will come into effect on 2 August 2025. The EU Intellectual Property Office has published a report on the copyright issues relating to generative AI, noting that 'further reflections might also be needed on whether content generated by AI deserves protection through existing or new intellectual property rights.'

**Some UK pension funds told to merge into 'megafunds' by 2030**
The UK government plans to tell some British pension schemes to merge into 'megafunds' with at least 25 billion pounds of assets by 2030. This is part of its drive to channel more investment into the economy. The government will also create a 'backstop' power to force investment firms to meet set investment allocation targets if they fall short. Finance minister Rachel Reeves said, 'We're making pensions work for Britain. These reforms mean better returns for workers and billions more invested in clean energy and high-growth businesses.' However, some investment firms have criticized the plan, saying it risks worse outcomes for pension savers. Penalties will be applied to pension funds that don't meet the 25 billion pounds assets threshold by 2030, such as losing access to auto-enrollment contributions.

**EU-Parliament Approves Changes to Driving License by 2030**
The European Parliament has approved changes to the driving license, which will come into effect by 2030. The changes include a 15-year validity period for car and motorcycle licenses, with a 10-year validity period if the license is used as an ID card. Bus and truck licenses will remain valid for five years. EU countries can reduce the validity period for drivers over 65 years old. There are also calls for a mandatory health check for drivers over 70 years old, but a uniform regulation was rejected by the EU Parliament. Instead, a medical check will be required at the initial issuance of the license or a self-assessment screening. EU countries can decide whether to provide self-assessment forms. The Parliament also proposes a uniform two-year probationary period for new drivers, with stricter rules and penalties for offenses such as drunk driving or ignoring seatbelt regulations. Members of the Parliament also demand a zero-tolerance policy for alcohol and drugs. Additionally, fines imposed in other EU countries will be recognized and enforced in the country where the license was issued, and penalties such as license suspension or driving bans will be transferred to the country of license issuance.

**Some UK pension funds told to merge into 'megafunds' by 2030**
The UK government has announced plans to merge some smaller pension schemes into 'megafunds' with at least 25 billion pounds of assets by 2030. This move aims to emulate Australia and Canada's pension systems, which feature fewer, larger funds that can invest at scale. According to finance minister Rachel Reeves, 'We're making pensions work for Britain. These reforms mean better returns for workers and billions more invested in clean energy and high-growth businesses.' Penalties will be applied to pension funds that don't meet the 25 billion pounds assets threshold by 2030, while schemes worth over 10 billion pounds will be allowed to continue if they demonstrate a clear plan to reach the minimum size by 2035.

**Government intervenes over new reservoirs amid water supply fears**
The UK government has intervened in the planning of two major reservoir projects in East Anglia and Lincolnshire to address growing concerns over the country's water supply. Environment Secretary Steve Reed has designated the projects as 'nationally significant,' allowing central government to take control and expedite their construction. The reservoirs, which will provide water for over 750,000 homes, are expected to be completed by 2036 and 2040. Water Minister Emma Hardy said, 'We are intervening in the national interest and slashing red tape to make the planning process faster to unblock nine new reservoirs.' Without new reservoirs, population growth, aging infrastructure, and climate change could cause drinking water demand to exceed supply by the mid-2030s. Water companies across England have committed to bringing nine new reservoirs online by 2050, which will supply an additional 670 million litres of water per day.

**Waa'y Party Supports Proportional Representation in Parliamentary Elections**
Engineer Hossam Ali, the deputy chairman of the Waa'y Party, stated that the parliamentary law projects submitted by the Future of the Nation Party to the House of Representatives yesterday regarding the 2025 parliamentary elections align with the party's demands in the national dialogue sessions related to 50% individual and 50% closed list, absolute. He noted that the party's high committee referred the study of the law project to the political bureau for the study of the details of the amendments, constituencies, and the standard deviation used. Ali called for national cooperation between political forces and parties to create a relative representation within the closed lists that ensures the presence of parties and their representation with all their currents, in order to solve the crisis of the absence of the proportional list and to have a parliament that represents all currents, ensuring a continuous national dialogue for 5 years. He emphasized that the party is open to everyone to reach national lists in the upcoming electoral competition. This will reflect on parties through enabling the largest number of them during the next 5 years, ensuring a more just representation of constituencies, and contributing to the building and strengthening of parties and their cadres, making it a good preparation for the 2030 parliamentary elections and a beginning for a political system based on party life as stated in the constitution, and contributing to the preparation of an electoral system that applies the proportional list in future parliaments.

**Should the House of Commons be elected by proportional representation instead of first-past-the-post?**
A recent poll conducted by the St. Albert Gazette found that 56% of respondents (14 out of 25) believe the House of Commons should be elected by proportional representation instead of the current first-past-the-post system. The poll also showed that 16% of respondents were unsure, 24% disagreed, and 4% did not think it mattered. The poll's findings may not be representative of the general population, but rather a sampling of public opinion in St. Albert.

**When the next general election is expected to take place - Manchester Evening News**
The next general election is expected to take place within five years of the current government coming into Parliament. According to the House of Commons, the current Parliament met for the first time on 9 July 2024, after the general election took place on 4 July 2024. If the current prime minister, Keir Starmer, does not call an election before the end of his five-year term, then Parliament will be automatically dissolved on 9 July 2029. A general election will then be called 25 days after this date, starting with the dissolution of Parliament on day 0 and ending with polling day on day 25. This means that the next general election could take place as early as 3 August 2029, or as late as 27 August 2029, depending on the exact date of dissolution and polling day.

**Awareness Party's Vision for the Optimal System for Parliamentary Elections**
Dr. Bassel Adel, the president of the Awareness Party, revealed the party's vision for the optimal system for parliamentary elections. According to Adel, the optimal system for legislative elections is the proportional list system, which gives all parties the opportunity to represent themselves under the parliament's umbrella and to express diverse opinions on all laws discussed in the parliament. However, Adel noted that the proportional list system is not suitable for the current stage due to the current situation of the parties, and that the absolute list system is more suitable for the upcoming elections. He emphasized that the parties should prepare for the 2030 elections using the proportional list system and consider the next stage as a period of preparing programs and cadres that will revitalize the political life. Adel also stressed the importance of applying all parliamentary standards by parties when selecting candidates to ensure strong representation in the legislative bodies that achieve the party's goals and aspirations.

**Legal changes for new homebuilding projects and domestic building works**
Two new Bills are making their way through the House of Commons, which will impact the building of new homes and domestic building works. The New Homes (Solar Generation) Bill 2024-2025 proposes to require the installation of solar photovoltaic generation equipment on new homes, with minimum standards for compliance. This aligns with the UK's Future Homes Standard, which aims to encourage energy-efficiency and carbon-reduction practices. The Domestic Building Works (Consumer Protection) Bill 2024-2025 introduces a licensing scheme for builders undertaking domestic building works in England, with the aim of protecting consumers and promoting fair competition. The construction industry is seeing a raft of changes, driven by environmental concerns and technological advancements, but there is concern that change is advancing at a pace that is ambitious for a sector struggling in a difficult economic environment. 'The Government is seeking to produce at least 95% of Great Britain's electricity by 2030,' said the Government's Clean Power 2030 Action Plan. 'The Plan also states that there is the potential for an additional 9-10 GW if rooftop solar can be deployed by 2030, encouraging builders and homeowners to install solar energy on properties.'

**UK will be at war by next election, says ex-Army Lib Dem MP – and will need conscription**
Mike Martin, a former British Army officer and Liberal Democrat MP for Tunbridge Wells, predicts that the UK will be at war by the next election. He believes there's a more than 50% chance of involvement in a war before 2030. Martin, who has served multiple tours of Afghanistan and authored books on war studies, thinks that if the UK were to get into a big war, conscription would be necessary. He argues that drones are not yet a replacement for human soldiers, and that people are still needed to occupy villages and hold ground. Martin also warns that the government's neglect of defence spending, which he estimates could require an extra £19.9 billion, could have significant impacts on the country.

**Half of Brits support introducing Proportional Representation voting system, latest poll finds**
A recent YouGov poll has found that half of Britons (49%) support introducing a proportional representation voting system, while only 26% favor retaining the current First Past the Post system. The poll also found that support for PR is highest among Green Party voters (72%), Reform UK (67%), and Lib Dem voters (61%). A majority of Labour Party voters (53%) also support moving to a PR system. Additionally, the public believes that it is more important for seats to be allocated proportionally between parties (46%) than for the largest party to win a majority of seats in the House of Commons (27%). 'It is more important for seats to be allocated proportionally between parties,' said the public. The public also favors having a greater number of smaller parties (44%) than a system with two larger main parties (27%).
