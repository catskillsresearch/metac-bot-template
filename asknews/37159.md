**Forecasters predict above-average hurricane season again**
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict an above-average number of storms for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, with 13 to 19 storms expected to form between June 1 and November 30. This is slightly higher than the average of 14 storms that usually occur over the course of a hurricane season. Ken Graham, the director of the National Weather Service, said, 'Everything's in place for an above-average season.' The majority of the storms are expected to be weaker tropical storms, but 6 are forecast to be full-blown hurricanes, with 3 to 5 of those being major hurricanes. Climate change is a major factor in the increased number of storms, with abnormally warm ocean temperatures and a warmer atmosphere contributing to the forecast. FEMA was not present at the annual hurricane forecast announcement, which has raised concerns about the agency's preparedness for the upcoming season.

**NOAA Warns of ‘Above Normal’ 2025 Hurricane Season: ‘Be Prepared’**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has warned that the 2025 hurricane season will be 'above normal', with a 60% probability of increased activity. The season begins on June 1 and ends on November 30. According to Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service, 'Be prepared', as there is a high chance of 6 to 10 storms evolving into hurricanes, with 3 to 5 of them being major hurricanes. The factors contributing to the increased activity include El Niño, warmer ocean temperatures, weak wind shear, and increased monsoon activity in West Africa. The average number of named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes is expected to be 13 to 19, 6 to 10, and 3 to 5, respectively. NOAA is urging people to prepare for the season by having emergency plans, basic supplies, and staying informed about weather updates.

**US Air Force Pilot Describes Close Encounter with UFO at Mach 2**
A US Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with an unidentified flying object (UFO) while on a secret mission in California in September 2024. The pilot, identified as Troy 21, described the object as traveling at Mach 2, a speed that eliminates the possibility of it being a simple drone. The incident was reported to the National UFO Reporting Center, a recognized organization by the Federal Aviation Administration for reporting unexplained aerial phenomena. The implications of this incident on air safety are alarming, as collisions with unidentified objects pose a real danger to aircraft. The lack of prior notification on the object's presence in the controlled airspace is also concerning. This incident has sparked speculation about what the government might be hiding, and potential transparency could change our understanding of the UFO phenomenon.

**NOAA Predicts More Active 2025 Atlantic Hurricane Season**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted that the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season will be more active than normal, with between 13 and 19 named storms and 6 to 10 hurricanes. According to Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service (NWS), there is a 60% chance that the season will be above normal. Graham attributed the increased activity to sustained ocean temperature increases, which are linked to patterns of increased cyclonic activity. The 2025 hurricane season is expected to run from June 1 to November 30. The predicted names for the storms this year include Andres, Barry, Chantal, Dexter, Erin, Fernand, Gabrielle, Humberto, Imelda, Jerry, Karen, Lorenzo, Melissa, Nestor, Olga, Pablo, Rebeka, Sebastien, Tanya, Van, and Wendy. The 2024 season had already exceeded the historical average, with 18 storms and 11 hurricanes, five of which affected U.S. territory. The announcement coincided with the approval of the federal budget by the House of Representatives, which includes a 30% cut to NOAA's funding and $646 million less for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm stated that the cuts do not compromise the operational capacity of the National Hurricane Center (NHC): 'Our top priority is climate prediction and protecting human lives. The hurricane center has a full staff and we are ready for the season.' The forecast was announced in Louisiana, in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which caused 1,392 deaths and remains one of the deadliest storms in U.S. history, as said by Laura Grimm, 'It's a reminder of the importance of our work and the need for continued investment in our nation's weather and climate services.'

**NOAA Warns of 'Above Normal' 2025 Hurricane Season**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has warned that the 2025 hurricane season will be 'above normal', with a 60% chance of increased activity. The season begins on June 1 and ends on November 30. According to the forecast, there is a 60% chance of 13-19 named tropical storms, with 6-10 potentially becoming hurricanes, and at least 3-5 reaching major hurricane status with sustained winds over 178 km/h. NOAA Director Ken Graham said, 'Be prepared.' The increased activity is attributed to various factors, including climate change, which is intensifying the strength of cyclones. Recent studies have shown that the warming of the waters favors more destructive storms. NOAA also announced an improvement in its Hurricane Forecasting and Analysis System (HAFS), which is expected to increase the accuracy of storm tracking by up to 5%.

**US Scientists Report 757 Documented UFO Sightings, Cartels Suspected of Using Drones for Espionage and Drug Trafficking**
US scientists have reported 757 documented cases of UFO sightings. According to Ron Vitello, a US Customs and Border Protection advisor, cartels have 'unlimited funding' that allows them to implement new technologies, including drones, to smuggle drugs into the US. In 2023, a US military F-16 Viper fighter jet was damaged by a UFO while flying over Arizona, forcing it to be temporarily taken out of service. The incident was confirmed by official documents from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA has confirmed that it is investigating all reports of UFO sightings, especially those that are confirmed by radar data. The US government has documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of them occurring in airspace. Only 49 cases have been officially closed. Many of the sightings occurred in areas where military exercises were taking place in Arizona and surrounding states. Some officials, including Vitello, believe that these objects may be drones used by cartels for espionage or drug trafficking. According to NewsNation, cartels have already used similar devices to transport up to 10 kg of cargo at a time. Vitello stated, 'They have unlimited funding, which allows them to implement new technologies that the US has not seen before.' This, he believes, is part of the business model of criminal organizations that continuously improve their methods of delivering prohibited substances into the US.

**US Government Reports 757 UFO Sightings, Including One That Damaged an F-16 Fighter Jet**
In 2023, a unidentified flying object (UFO) was reported in the US, colliding with an F-16 fighter jet during a training mission over Arizona, causing damage to the aircraft. According to The New York Post, these unidentified objects have been seen in groups of up to eight and have been classified as drones on occasion. 'Pentagon investigators and the Federal Aviation Administration have confirmed that these sightings have been documented every time a pilot has reported them to the corresponding air traffic control facility', says the medium. The incident is just one of a number of mysterious objects that have been spotted over the US Air Force's training fields in Arizona, according to multiple reports by The New York Post. Three more encounters with these objects were detected the following day. 'There has been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things from Arizona, particularly at the border' with Mexico, said former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo to the medium. The US government has presented 757 reports of this type between May 2023 and June 2024, of which 708 occurred in the air, and only 49 were marked as 'Case closed' in the latest report issued by the Office of Anomaly Resolution. The US government has dismissed, for now, the security threat posed by these sightings, but some officials, including Ron Vitiello, principal advisor to the US Customs and Border Protection Office, suggest that the mysterious objects could be drones used by foreign cartels to spy or smuggle drugs. Vitiello stated that the 'unlimited funding' of the cartels could explain the advanced technology never seen before. 'Perhaps they have technology that we are not used to seeing in the drone sector', said Vitiello.

**UFO crashes into US Air Force fighter jet over Arizona**
A US Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet was hit by an unidentified flying object, believed to be a drone, while flying over Arizona on January 19, 2023. The collision cracked the canopy protecting the pilot, but no injuries were reported. The incident is one of 22 reported UFO sightings by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), there have been hundreds of UFO reports made in recent years, with Arizona becoming a hotspot for sightings. The FAA has investigated 757 UAP sightings worldwide between May 2023 and June 2024, with only 49 cases solved. Many of these sightings have taken place over restricted military airspace, and some have been attributed to high-tech drones launched by Mexican cartels. 'A lot of people reporting a lot of things out of Arizona, particularly on the border,' said Luis Elizondo, a former government intelligence officer. 'I've seen orbs that were off in the distance. I've seen crafts that were cigar-shaped, I've seen triangles,' said Bob Thompson, a former US Customs and Border Protection agent.

**Unidentified Flying Objects: A Mysterious Phenomenon in Arizona**
The US Air Force has reported multiple incidents of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in Arizona, with some incidents involving collisions with military aircraft. According to the New York Post, a report by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that a mysterious object collided with an F-16 fighter jet worth $63 million in January 2023, causing damage and temporarily grounding the aircraft. The FAA documents also mentioned three other encounters with drones in the same day. Former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo told NewsNation that there was a lot of activity and many reports of strange phenomena in Arizona, particularly along the US-Mexico border. The FAA stated that it investigates reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) whenever a pilot reports them to the Air Traffic Control Center. If the information is confirmed, the FAA shares the report with the US Department of Defense's Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, which is responsible for investigating UAPs that pose a threat to national security or safety. Between May 2023 and June 2024, the US government received 757 reports of UAPs, with 708 of them being investigated in the air and 49 cases being closed. The small, unidentified objects have been spotted in groups of up to eight and are sometimes classified as drones. Some US officials, including Ron Vitello, the US Customs and Border Protection's chief of operations, believe that the mysterious objects could be drones used by foreign cartels for espionage or drug trafficking.

**Alleged KGB report detailing encounter between Soviet soldiers ans a UFO**
A report claiming that Soviet soldiers were 'petrified' by extraterrestrial beings in Ukraine has been refuted by experts as a fake. The report, presented as a declassified CIA file, describes a UFO encounter where 23 soldiers turned into stone after opening fire on aliens. However, former CIA agent Tracy Walder said, 'This is not a document that the CIA originated,' and explained that the report actually came from an open-source service called the Foreign Broadcast Information Service. Walder reassured the public that the report wasn't written by the CIA. The report has sparked interest in UFOs, now officially termed UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena), which surged in recent years. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense formed a UAP Task Force to track, analyze, and catalog unusual aerial sightings. According to The Economic Times, last year alone, the Pentagon received 757 UAP reports from the public between May 2023 and June 2024.

**A Quick Guide to Reporting UFO Sightings: Tips and Precautions**
According to a report by the Pentagon, there were 757 UFO sighting reports between May 2023 and June 2024. If you think you've seen something unusual in the sky, follow these five steps to ensure your report is taken seriously: remain calm, observe carefully, take note of details such as shape, color, and movement, record evidence like photos and videos, and report to experts. The credibility of a sighting increases when multiple people report similar observations. However, be cautious when sharing your experience on social media, as it can quickly turn into a conspiracy theory. As Psychic World suggests, 'it's essential to maintain a level head and gather as much information as possible to ensure a thorough investigation.'

**Five UFO Sightings in Saarland in 2024: Most Explained by Natural Causes**
In 2024, five UFO sightings were reported in the Saarland, but none were found to be of extraterrestrial origin. The Central Research Network for Extraordinary Sky Phenomena (CENAP) received five requests for unknown flying objects from the Saarland. This is a significant decrease compared to other federal states, with Baden-Württemberg reporting a new record number of sightings. The national average was around 14 sightings per million inhabitants, while the Saarland had only five. Hansjürgen Köhler, co-founder of CENAP, explained, 'We don't just collect cases, we research them.' Most of the sightings can be explained by natural causes such as stars, constellations, or man-made objects like satellites or drones. Köhler added, 'If we have the date, time, and direction of the event, an identification is almost always possible.' The CENAP aims to solve cases within 24 hours. In recent years, more and more images and videos have been sent in, which have made identification easier.
