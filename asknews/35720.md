**The Boomerang Effect of a Weakening Dollar: Risks and Uncertainties**
The depreciation of the US dollar has been a recurring trend under Republican presidents since the introduction of a floating exchange rate system in 1971. Under Donald Trump, the dollar has lost over 10% of its value since January 2025, with a current exchange rate of 1.14 dollars per euro. Analysts predict a further decline to 1.17 dollars per euro by June 2026. The weakening dollar is a natural consequence of the current US policy, which aims to boost the economy by making imports more expensive and exports cheaper. However, this policy may have counterproductive effects, such as increasing inflation and reducing export revenues. The US economy relies heavily on foreign funding, and a loss of confidence in the dollar could lead to a loss of attractiveness for foreign investors. This could result in a decrease in investment in the US, a decrease in the value of the dollar, and a potential recession. The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates high may exacerbate the situation, making it more difficult for the US to attract foreign capital. The current economic situation is precarious, with a 50% probability of a global recession, according to the IMF. The depreciation of the dollar is a symptom of a deeper problem, and it is unclear whether the current policy will achieve its intended goals.

**Lebanon's Economy Stabilizes Amid Ongoing Challenges**
The price of the US dollar against the Lebanese pound has stabilized on Thursday, May 29, 2025, according to the exchange rate and parallel market bulletin. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) estimated that Lebanon's real GDP will contract by 5.7% in 2024, due to the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah, which has led to a large-scale displacement of people, significant damage to infrastructure and physical capital, and a need for reconstruction financing of around $11 billion. The report reduced its economic growth expectations for Lebanon to 1.9% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026, compared to previous expectations of 2% and 3% for the same years. The report considered the formation of the new government to have reduced political obstacles to implementing essential economic reforms, and noted that the appointment of a new governor of the Central Bank of Lebanon and the renewed interest in reaching an agreement with the International Monetary Fund are positive developments in the economic recovery process. The report emphasized that progress in files such as the restructuring of the banking sector remains crucial for reaching a final agreement with the IMF, restoring international market confidence, and enabling foreign financing and investment opportunities. According to the report, the economic growth rate in the South and East Mediterranean region is expected to be 3.6% in 2024 and 3.9% in 2025, while the growth rates in the bank's member countries are expected to be 3% in 2025 and 3.4% in 2026. The report also noted that the local indicators continue to show a decline in inflation rates with a stable exchange rate, with an annual rate of 15.6% in February 2025. The report warned of risks threatening the economic scene, including the possibility of the resumption of military operations in the Middle East, the delay in the launch of the reconstruction process, and the potential return of political deadlock. The exchange rate of the Lebanese pound against the dollar in the black market remained stable at levels between 89,600 and 89,700 pounds per dollar, supported by a continuous increase in the Central Bank of Lebanon's foreign exchange reserves, which reached around $40.4 billion in mid-May, compared to $34.2 billion at the end of 2024. The increase in gold reserves, valued at $5.2 billion since the beginning of the year, due to the rise in global gold prices, is the main reason for this increase. The dollar was stable at 89,500 Lebanese pounds on the exchange platform, according to the Central Bank of Lebanon's website. 'The formation of the new government has reduced political obstacles to implementing essential economic reforms,' said the report. 'The appointment of a new governor of the Central Bank of Lebanon and the renewed interest in reaching an agreement with the International Monetary Fund are positive developments in the economic recovery process.'

**Analysts Predict US Interest Rates to Remain Stable, ECB to Lower Rates to 1.75%**
Analysts from BNP Paribas predict that US interest rates will remain stable at 4.5% until the end of 2025, while the European Central Bank is expected to lower its interest rates to 1.75% by the end of 2025. The analysts estimate a 50-point base increase in US interest rates in 2026. They also predict a new increase in interest rates in the Eurozone in the second half of 2026. The analysts attribute their predictions to the US fiscal policy and its trajectory. They estimate that the global GDP will be reduced by 0.6% by the end of 2026 compared to a scenario without tariffs. According to the analysts, the US will be more affected by this situation than most other countries. The analysts also believe that the dollar has not regained its confidence and that the attractiveness of US dollar assets has not been restored. They expect other countries, particularly in Europe, not to change their position of reducing their dependence on the US. However, the possibility of a recession in the US is now reduced to 60% from 70%. The analysts maintain their view that the Federal Reserve should keep interest rates stable this year, with cuts only in 2026. They note that 'the risks are balanced: lower tariffs may lead to faster cuts, while robust growth and persistent inflation may delay them and even trigger discussions about possible increases'.

**Standard Chartered Bank Warns of Potential Significant Decline in US Dollar by 2026**
Standard Chartered Bank has warned of a potential significant decline in the value of the US dollar by 2026 due to the failure of Trump's policies to boost growth and rising debt, putting the dollar under increasing pressure. The bank's research note, led by Steve Englander, suggests that unregulated trade and tax policies may lead to a loss of confidence in US assets, with the addition of a new trillion-dollar tax law to the debt. Morgan Stanley has also predicted a continued decline in the dollar, citing the impact of future interest rate cuts on the bond market and corporate profits. The bank warns that the dollar may face a major decline if Trump's policies fail to boost growth, and the US debt continues to rise, with a potential loss of confidence among foreign investors. Englander notes that the increasing external and internal debt of the US, combined with a decline in national savings and an increase in foreign capital dependence, puts the dollar and Treasury bonds under increasing pressure. He adds that if the economy or financial markets falter, the risks of a dollar decline will be greater as US external commitments rise. The research note suggests that the dollar may face a sharp movement in its exchange rate if trade and tax policies continue to be 'unregulated', with foreign investors becoming more sensitive to US financial sustainability indicators. Englander notes that Trump's trade and tax policies have failed to convince investors of their value, leading to a relative loss of confidence in US assets, amidst growing concerns that the new tax law will add to the debt without generating real returns. The note warns that the impact of the large tax law may be short-lived, as its benefits may begin to fade by mid-2026 or 2027, opening the door to renewed concerns about declining growth and rising public and private financing costs. According to the note, the continued expansionary fiscal policy without tangible results may lead to what Englander calls 'effective bankruptcy through inflation', where the US government, even if it does not default on its debt, may be forced to reduce the real value of its debt through rising prices, increasing the 'risk premium' on US bonds and reducing the dollar's attractiveness as a global reserve currency. The note suggests that the dollar may face a major test in the coming years, especially if the US administration fails to implement meaningful fiscal and structural reforms to curb the debt and regain the confidence of foreign investors. Last week, Morgan Stanley predicted a continued decline in the dollar, citing the decline in US economic superiority over other regions, such as China and Europe, driving investors to avoid the greenback and raising the bank's recommendation on US stocks and Treasury bonds. The bank expects the dollar to remain under pressure, with a potential decline in its value, as the Federal Reserve's future interest rate cuts are expected to support the bond market and boost corporate profits, while the dollar is expected to remain under pressure. The experts predict that US Treasury bond yields will remain within a narrow range until the fourth quarter of this year, before investors begin to price in the expected future interest rate cuts in 2026. It is likely that the yield on 10-year bonds will fall to 3.45% by the second quarter of next year, according to the note issued on May 20.

**Could a Shift Away from U.S. Equities Hasten De-Dollarization?**
The recent sale of U.S. equities could signal the beginning of a long-term trend that speeds up global de-dollarization. Financial Times has trimmed their U.S. positions due to concerns over erratic policymaking and the fallout from the trade war. This shift away from U.S. assets could lead to a decline in the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency. Last year, total holdings of dollar-denominated securities by foreign central banks fell by $59 billion, and as of the end of last year, dollars made up 57.8 percent of global reserves, the lowest level since 1994. Analysts say this suggests investors are seeking non-dollar safe-haven assets, and the dollar has declined by around 7 percent this year. Wellington Management analyst John Butler asked, 'How far and how fast does it go?' Financial Times. The U.S. government's weaponization of the dollar and trade could lead to a backlash, and the U.S. could be playing with fire. If the dollar's status erodes, it could create significant problems for the U.S. economy, including a dollar glut, further depreciation of the dollar, and more price inflation at home. To shield oneself from the impacts of de-dollarization, it is recommended to minimize exposure to the dollar and buy gold and silver instead.

**Japan Maintains U.S. Treasury Holdings Amid Lack of Alternatives**
Japan is unlikely to sell its U.S. Treasury holdings due to the lack of alternative investment options, according to former Bank of Japan policy maker Sayuri Shirai. Shirai emphasized that the U.S. dollar's status as the global reserve currency remains unchallenged, citing the depth of U.S. capital markets and technological competitiveness. She also expressed skepticism about the euro becoming a viable alternative, citing Europe's political fragmentation and shallow capital markets. However, Shirai noted that the Chinese yuan could emerge as a potential competitor in Asia, driven by increased yuan-denominated trade. Despite the dollar's declining share in international reserves, it still holds a significant lead at 58%, compared to the euro's 20% and the yuan's 2%, according to the International Monetary Fund. Shirai stated, 'the dominance of the dollar as a reserve currency remains unchallenged,' and 'the euro becoming a viable alternative is unlikely due to Europe's political fragmentation and shallow capital markets.'

The report also noted that the local indicators continue to show a decline in inflation rates with a stable exchange rate, with an annual rate of 15.6% in February 2025. The report warned of risks threatening the economic scene, including the possibility of the resumption of military operations in the Middle East, the delay in the launch of the reconstruction process, and the potential return of political deadlock. The exchange rate of the Lebanese pound against the dollar in the black market remained stable at levels between 89,600 and 89,700 pounds per dollar, supported by a continuous increase in the Central Bank of Lebanon's foreign exchange reserves, which reached around $40.4 billion in mid-May, compared to $34.2 billion at the end of 2024. The increase in gold reserves, valued at $5.2 billion since the beginning of the year, due to the rise in global gold prices, is the main reason for this increase. The dollar was stable at 89,500 Lebanese pounds on the exchange platform, according to the Central Bank of Lebanon's website. 'The formation of the new government has reduced political obstacles to implementing essential economic reforms,' said the report. 'The appointment of a new governor of the Central Bank of Lebanon and the renewed interest in reaching an agreement with the International Monetary Fund are positive developments in the economic recovery process.'

**European Markets Open Cautiously Amid Expectation of Economic Data**
European markets opened cautiously on Wednesday, with the Stoxx 600 index remaining near its previous day's level. Investors were preparing for a significant influx of economic data from across the continent. The British pound and the euro both fell against the US dollar on the foreign exchange markets, while global attention focused on the upcoming Federal Reserve protocol and Nvidia's earnings. The Stoxx 600 index remained unchanged shortly after the opening bell, reflecting a general lack of strong directional predictions among investors. National markets showed slight fluctuations: the London FTSE 100 and the French CAC 40 rose slightly, indicating some resilience. The German DAX, which had reached a remarkable record high on Tuesday, was traded with a gain of around 0.1%, suggesting it maintained its recent strong gains. This cautious market sentiment is due to the expectation of a series of economic indicators to be released throughout the day. Key data points include German import prices, final French GDP figures, French and German employment data, and an update on Turkey's economic climate. These publications will provide further insights into the health and development of the European economy. Currency overview: Pound and euro fall against the dollar. The British pound fell 0.2% against the US dollar on Wednesday morning, marking its second consecutive day of losses against the dollar. Despite this recent decline, the pound has still gained a significant 7.7% against the dollar in the year-to-date. The euro also fell 0.2% against the dollar, potentially extending its losses for the second day in a row. However, the euro has still gained over 9% against the dollar since the start of the year. Global focus: Fed protocol and Nvidia earnings awaited. Global investors are eagerly awaiting the publication of the Federal Reserve's protocol from the May meeting, expected later on Wednesday. These protocols will be scrutinized for new hints on the central bank's considerations regarding inflation, interest rates, and the overall economic outlook. Although no significant corporate earnings were expected from Europe on Wednesday, market participants on both sides of the Atlantic are closely following Nvidia's upcoming earnings report. The company's results, expected after the US market close on Wall Street, are widely seen as an important indicator for the technology sector and overall market sentiment. Asian-Pacific and US market signals. The trading environment in the Asian-Pacific region was mixed on Wednesday. The Japanese Nikkei 225 rose 0.3%, while the South Korean Kospi gained a significantly higher 1.8%. However, the Australian S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.2% after the country reported a higher-than-expected increase in inflation. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index also fell 0.4%. US stock futures remained unchanged ahead of the market's opening on Wednesday, following broad gains on Tuesday as investors reacted positively to US President Donald Trump's decision to suspend the introduction of 50% tariffs on imports from the European Union, a development that the markets had digested after the Memorial Day holiday. German import prices show unexpected reversal. In addition to the economic reporting of the day, new data from Germany revealed an unexpected development in import prices. Figures from the Federal Statistical Office showed that German import prices fell by 0.4% in April compared to the previous year. This was a surprise, as analysts, who were polled by LSEG, had expected a 0.2% annual increase. In the previous month, March, import prices in Germany rose by 2.1%, making the April decline particularly notable.

**Lagarde Sees Opportunity for Euro to Rise Amid US Dollar Turmoil**
European Central Bank President Lagarde believes that the current turmoil in the US dollar's position provides an opportunity for the euro to strengthen its international status. She stated, 'The changes happening now are opening the door to a 'global euro' moment, which is a great opportunity for Europe to take control of its own destiny. However, we must also seize this opportunity.' Lagarde emphasized that the current uncertainty in the dollar-based international monetary system requires European reform from multiple angles to reduce its impact. She noted that the dollar's share in global foreign exchange reserves has fallen to 58%, its lowest level in over 30 years, while the euro's share remains at 20%. Lagarde believes that this turning point is a crisis of opportunity, and that the euro has the potential to play a greater role on the international stage if Europe takes the right policies to address it.

**‘Will the dominance of the dollar come to an end?’**
The dominance of the US dollar in the global economy has been a topic of debate for decades. While the dollar's supremacy has helped the US limit financing costs and control budget deficits, some argue that its dominance is coming to an end due to growing pushback and countermeasures from countries around the world. Discussion is growing about alternative payment systems, increased central bank purchasing of gold, and trade agreements bypassing the dollar. However, whether this is enough to collapse the world's financial architecture is another matter. Emerging currencies face challenges in replacing the dollar, and discussion of de-dollarisation is rooted in politics rather than real economic dynamics. According to the IMF, the dollar still dominates foreign exchange reserves, but its share has declined from 65.1% in 2014 to 57.8% in 2024. The euro remains stable as the second reserve currency, followed by the Japanese yen, British pound sterling, and a basket of non-traditional currencies. Central banks have also been accumulating gold as a reserve asset since 2005, with China and Russia being among the largest holders. Despite predictions of the end of the dollar, its replacement as the world's reserve currency will not happen for years to come.

**The Dollar at a Crossroads: Can it Survive the New Commercial Order?**
The US dollar is facing unprecedented pressure in a global economy that is increasingly fragmented. The Trump administration's tariffs have triggered a series of trade tensions that threaten to redefine the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency. The dollar has depreciated significantly in recent weeks, losing 10% of its value against the euro, a decline attributed to the imposition of unilateral tariffs by the Trump administration, which has generated a global crisis in financial markets. To put this into perspective, the loss of capitalization in the global stock market since the tariffs were imposed has reached up to 10 trillion dollars in the past five trading days. The foreign exchange market (forex) is notably more active than other traditional financial markets, such as stock exchanges and public debt markets. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the average daily trading volume in the forex market in 2022 reached 7.5 trillion dollars. In contrast, the global stock market traded approximately 244 billion dollars per day in 2019, according to the World Bank. This indicates that the forex market trades approximately 30 times more than the stock market per day. The devaluation of the dollar has had significant consequences for global economies. In Europe, for example, the depreciation has reduced the value in euros of investments in the US, affecting profit expectations. Additionally, the fiscal cuts and possible debt restructuring in the US have increased nervousness among investors, making bonds more expensive and accentuating the risk premium. These dynamics reinforce the trend towards dollarization and the search for alternatives to the dollar as the global reserve currency. According to the World Trade Organization, global merchandise trade is expected to increase by 2.7% in 2024 and 3.0% in 2025. However, these projections could be significantly affected by growing trade tensions and protectionist policies. Despite this, the dollar will remain the primary reserve currency. In 2024, it represented 58.2% of central banks' foreign exchange reserves, a decline from 66% in 2015. The euro remains stable at around 19.6%, while the Chinese renminbi represents only 2.1%. China, as one of the main dollar holders that may be responsible for much of the dollar's decline in recent days, has approximately 3.2 trillion dollars in international reserves. However, it has been showing interest in diversifying its reserves and reducing its dependence on the dollar, promoting the use of the renminbi in international trade. The BRICS bloc (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) has intensified its efforts to reduce its dependence on the dollar, exploring alternatives such as the use of local currencies in bilateral trade and the development of independent payment systems, initiatives that could challenge the dollar's hegemony in the future. Today, it is impossible to think that this could be immediate, given that Western economies are still subject to the tyranny of the greenback and the lack of progress of potential threats.

**Percent of global FX reserves in dollars ticks up, amounts fall, IMF data shows**
According to the IMF's Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) data, the amount of U.S. dollars held as reserve currency globally slipped in the last quarter of 2024, but the percentage of actual dollars held as reserve ticked up to 57.8%. The dollar-equivalent amounts dropped among holdings in euro, pound sterling, yuan, yen, Swiss franc, and Australian and Canadian dollars, with only the latter showing a tick up in the percentage of holdings. The value of the greenback rose 7.7% in the last quarter of 2024 against a basket of peers, lowering the dollar value of reserves kept in other currencies. Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies, said, 'I don't expect drastic changes from one COFER report to the other because, why would you? The U.S. remains the most liquid and deep market in the world.'

**Will the World Keep Buying US Treasuries? | by Paola Subacchi & Paul van den Noord - Project Syndicate**
The United States has enjoyed a unique advantage in global finance due to the dollar's status as the world's leading reserve currency. Countries have accumulated large dollar reserves, which they have invested in US Treasuries, enabling the US to finance persistent federal budget deficits, such as the 6.4% of GDP in 2024, without concern from international investors. However, it remains to be seen whether this trend will continue.

**FED keeps interest rates unchanged, but uncertainty remains**
The Federal Reserve (FED) has decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25% and 4.50%. The decision was expected, as the FED had already stated in January that it would maintain the Fed Funds rate. However, the Dot Plot, which contains the FED's predictions for future interest rates, suggests that there may be two further rate cuts by the end of the year, as well as two rate cuts in 2026 and one in 2027. The FED's President, Jerome Powell, stated that the economy is strong, but there is high uncertainty. He added that it will be difficult to assess the impact of the new tariffs on inflation, but the FED will work to understand it better. Powell also stated that the risk of recession is low and that the situation seems stable and under control. The FED's decision has had an impact on the markets, with the dollar rising and Wall Street closing with major stocks in the green. However, analysts are skeptical about the recovery of the US stock market and some are considering moving their investments to other global markets, such as those in Asia. The FED's policy will also have consequences for the bond market and foreign exchange. According to analysts, the dollar may experience a rebound after its recent depreciation, especially if there are changes in the forward guidance. However, this is a rare and unlikely scenario. To see a recovery of the US economy, there need to be confirmations from the next macroeconomic data. If these data are not encouraging, the fear of recession may become more concrete and the dollar may be penalized compared to other currencies.

**Desdolarización: The Ongoing Process of Reducing the World's Dependence on the US Dollar**
The process of reducing the world's dependence on the US dollar, known as desdolarización, is ongoing. According to the International Monetary Fund (FMI), the dollar's share of global reserves has decreased from 65.4% in 2016 to 57.4% in 2024, while the euro's share has remained stable at around 20%. China's renminbi has also seen a decline, from a peak of 2.8% in 2022 to 2.2% currently. However, China's accumulation of reserves is a notable exception, with around 3.4 trillion dollars, approximately a quarter of the world's total. The FMI's data shows that China is the country with the most US dollar-denominated financial liabilities, surpassing Japan. The BRICS nations, led by China, are driving the desdolarización process, but it appears to be progressing slowly. The initiative to create a common alternative currency is stalled, and the dollar is appreciating in the foreign exchange market. US President Trump has threatened to impose 100% tariffs on any country that boycotts the dollar as the global reserve currency. However, the desdolarización trend continues, with the dollar's share of global reserves expected to decline further. The space left by the dollar is not being filled by the BRICS or other major currencies, but rather by a process of fragmentation, where non-traditional currencies are gaining prominence. Additionally, China's ability to provoke international financial tensions by using its dollar reserves as leverage is a significant factor. Trump's threat to any attempt to dethrone the dollar is motivated by the same reasons that drive the BRICS to pursue desdolarización: the benefits of being able to print money at will and the potential for a new world order that would favor the BRICS over the US.
