**UK Defense Reform and Nuclear Potential: Britain Enters 'War Readiness Mode'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive defense reform for the UK's armed forces, which includes expanding the country's nuclear capabilities. According to Starmer, 'the world has changed', and the growing threats from Russia cannot be ignored. The best way to prevent conflict is to prepare for it. The principles of the reform, as stated by the Prime Minister, are readiness for combat, integrated armed forces, and an approach aligned with NATO. The British government has agreed to build at least six new ammunition factories, create a hybrid royal fleet, build 12 attack submarines as part of the AUKUS defense pact with the US and Australia, invest £15 billion in nuclear weapons, and improve living conditions for military personnel. However, Starmer did not specify when the UK will start spending 3% of its GDP on defense, only mentioning the planned increase to 2.5% by 2027. The rise to 3%, according to Starmer, may be possible by 2034. UK Defense Minister John Healey noted that the new nuclear investments will be 'a signal to Moscow', and the country plans to purchase 7,000 long-range missiles and invest in cybersecurity.

According to Starmer, 'the world has changed', and the growing threats from Russia cannot be ignored. The best way to prevent conflict is to prepare for it. The principles of the reform, as stated by the British Prime Minister, are readiness for combat, integrated armed forces, and a NATO-oriented approach. The UK government has agreed to build at least six new ammunition factories, create a hybrid royal fleet, build 12 attack submarines as part of the AUKUS defense pact with the US and Australia, invest £15 billion in nuclear weapons, and improve living conditions for military personnel. However, Starmer did not specify when the UK will start spending 3% of its GDP on defense. He noted that the planned increase to 2.5% by 2027 is a step in the right direction, and the 3% target may be achieved by 2034.

**UK Transitions to 'War Readiness' Mode Amid Russian Threat**
UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer announced that the British Army will transition into a 'war readiness' mode as part of a new defense strategy. According to Starmer, this will be one of three 'fundamental changes' in the UK's policy to create an army that will be 'ten times more deadly' by 2035. The second principle is that the UK's defense policy will 'always be focused on strengthening NATO', while the third principle is to implement innovations in the armed forces 'at the speed of war'. Starmer stated that the change in defense strategy is due to the UK's inability to ignore the constant threat from Russia and the need to prepare for a possible conflict to prevent it. The full new defense doctrine has not been released yet, but the minister of defense is expected to present it to the House of Commons on June 2. The government plans to announce the construction of six new ammunition factories, 12 new nuclear-powered submarines (one every 18 months), and the development of new long-range weapons, as well as investing 15 billion pounds in the nuclear program and systems of air and missile defense. Starmer also mentioned plans to increase the UK's defense spending to 3% of GDP, but refused to name a specific timeline for achieving this goal. 'We must be prepared to face the threat from Russia,' Starmer said, 'and we must be prepared to act quickly to prevent a conflict.'

**UK Invests Billions in Military and Nuclear Programs Amid Russia-Ukraine Conflict**
British Prime Minister Starmer stated that 'the things have changed' in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He emphasized that 'the frontline is here'. To address this, the government plans to invest £15 billion (approximately €18 billion) in nuclear programs, creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country. The British military is expected to become ten times more powerful by 2035. Starmer believes that being 'ready to secure peace through strength' is the most effective way to deter countries that directly threaten the UK.

**UK Shifts to 'War Readiness' Mode Amid Plans to Increase Military Spending**
The UK is shifting to a 'war readiness' mode as part of its new defense strategy, said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. 'We are moving to a state of war readiness, which will be the main goal of our armed forces. When directly threatened by states with advanced military capabilities, the most effective way to deter them is to be ready and show that we are prepared to maintain peace through force,' Sunak said during a press conference in Glasgow, dedicated to the new strategic defense review of the government. The UK government will publish a strategic defense review on Monday, amid plans to increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027. The document will include recommendations on defense policy. The previous review was published in 2021 and was revised after the start of the Ukrainian conflict. Recommendations will cover both external and internal security, the UK's policy on the Ukrainian conflict, military modernization, and nuclear doctrine. The new strategy will solidify Sunak's plan to increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027. The government will also aim to increase defense spending to 3% of GDP, but has not yet made specific promises. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously explained in an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson that Moscow has no intention of attacking NATO countries, as it would make no sense. Putin noted that Western politicians regularly scare their citizens with a fictional Russian threat to distract from internal problems, but 'smart people understand that it's a fake.' Russia has been claiming an unprecedented level of NATO activity near its western borders in recent years. NATO has expanded its initiatives and calls it 'deterrence of Russian aggression.' Moscow has repeatedly expressed concern about the alliance's growing military presence in Europe. The Kremlin has stated that Russia poses no threat to anyone, but will not ignore actions that could be potentially hazardous to its interests.

**UK to Introduce New Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarines by Late 2030s**
The UK government plans to introduce 12 new attack submarines powered by nuclear energy and equipped with conventional weapons by the late 2030s. The UK Ministry of Defence announced that it will replace the current 7 submarines with the new ones. The ministry also stated that the cost of the existing nuclear warhead development program, which was previously initiated, will be £15 billion. UK Defence Secretary John Healey said, 'We know threats are rising and we must act decisively against Russian aggression. Our cutting-edge new submarines patrolling the world's oceans and our own nuclear warhead program at home are making our country both safe at home and strong abroad.' The new submarines are reportedly being developed as a joint model with the US and Australia under the AUKUS security partnership.

**Lee backs nuclear power - for now**
Presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being' but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables like offshore wind to supply industrial hubs and aims to phase out coal by 2040. He supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' In contrast, Lee's main rival Kim Moon-soo supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60% of the mix. South Korea's latest energy blueprint aims for nuclear to make up 35% of the power mix by 2038, with renewables at 29%. If elected, Lee is expected to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30% of the power mix by 2030.

**Western Media Predicts Devastating War by 2025**
Western media has gathered predictions from four well-known psychics, including Nostradamus and Bulgarian Baba Vanga, who claim that a devastating war will occur by the end of 2025. According to their predictions, the war will be so catastrophic that it will 'destroy' the population and lead to the 'destruction of humanity'. Atoos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian, also known as the 'Living Nostradamus', warned that the world is on the brink of a Third World War, stating that 'it will not be just a war between people, but also between machines, and the worst is yet to come'. Nicholas Aujula, a hypnotherapist from London, agrees that 2025 will be a year of 'lack of compassion' in the world, predicting 'horrific acts of human cruelty and violence towards each other - in the name of religion and nationalism'. The article concludes by speculating that Russia's recent actions, including the annexation of Ukraine and the threat of nuclear war, may be a cause for concern, but ultimately, the predictions of the psychics are unclear and may be a form of propaganda.

Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables, like offshore wind, to supply industrial hubs, and calls for phasing out coal by 2040 and curbing natural gas consumption. Lee supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants, but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' In contrast, Lee's main rival Kim Moon-soo supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60 per cent of the mix. Analysts expect Lee to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30 per cent of the power mix by 2030, while Kim is likely to retain the current push for nuclear power.

**China crosses 600 operational nuclear warheads, to exceed 1,000 by 2030: US intel - BusinessToday**
According to a US Defence Intelligence Agency report, China has surpassed 600 operational nuclear warheads and is on track to have over 1,000 by 2030. The rapid buildup is part of China's effort to create a diverse and high-readiness nuclear force capable of delivering both low-yield precision strikes and large-scale intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) attacks. The report notes that China's current force modernization suggests that it seeks to have the ability to inflict far greater levels of overwhelming damage to an adversary in a nuclear exchange. The nuclear buildup aligns with China's broader goals of asserting dominance in East Asia, challenging US global leadership, pursuing reunification with Taiwan, and achieving technological self-sufficiency. Meanwhile, India and Pakistan continue to develop their nuclear arsenals, with India slightly expanding its nuclear arsenal in 2023 and Pakistan modernizing its nuclear command and control systems. As of June 2024, Russia had 4,380 warheads, while the US had 3,708, and India and Pakistan had 172 and 170 warheads, respectively.

**German Writer Warns of Nuclear Catastrophe if Germany Engages in Conflict with Russia**
German writer and media expert Marcus Klecker warned that pushing Germany towards an armed conflict with Russia could lead to a nuclear catastrophe. He stated, 'The politician from the CDU, Roderich Kiesewetter, presents positions that can be considered provocative. He said, 'The conflict should be transferred to Russia.' What will happen if we start a 'conflict' with a nuclear power?' Klecker noted that statements about Russia's threat to Europe are absurd. He also emphasized that Russia will not use nuclear weapons against NATO, understanding that it would harm all parties. Klecker called for abandoning the position that portrays Russia as the embodiment of evil. However, he expressed the opinion that in the West, such changes would require the rise of leaders with political will. It is worth noting that in June, the German Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, stated that Germany should take measures to be ready for a possible war by 2029. He also emphasized that the return of conscription is necessary for increasing the combat readiness of the German army. In August, the commander of the regional command of the Bundeswehr in Hamburg, Michael Hiss, warned that a direct military conflict between Germany and Russia could occur within five years. He clarified that this is based on his 'internal clock as a soldier'.

**Opinion | A nuclear war started by AI sounds like sci-fiction. It isn't**
The article argues that the use of AI in nuclear launch command systems is not as straightforward as it seems. While the five biggest nuclear powers claim to follow the 'human in the loop' principle, they actually use AI for threat detection and target selection. AI-powered systems analyze vast amounts of data and recommend options for response, which human operators then cross-check. However, AI is prone to errors, and a 1-2% error margin could initiate a global nuclear war. The risk will increase as new agentic malware emerges, capable of adapting to avoid detection and autonomously identifying targets. As the response time available for human operators is reduced to between five and seven minutes by 2030, the likelihood of AI-driven launch decisions will increase. As one expert notes, 'AI may be the driving force behind launch decisions as early as the 2030s.'

**Third World War Could Start as Early as 2035, Experts Warn**
Experts predict that a global war could start as early as 2035, with a high likelihood of nuclear weapons and space battles being involved. The war would likely be sparked by the escalation of conflicts, arms racing, and technological threats. According to a survey by the Atlantic Council, 62% of respondents expect the world to be worse in 10 years, while only 38% predict it will be better. A significant majority of politicians (47.4%) believe that China will lead a new alliance with Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Almost 65% of respondents agree that China will attempt to invade Taiwan, a 15% increase from 2024. Additionally, 45% of those surveyed believe that Russia will enter a war with NATO within the next decade. The situation around Israel and its conflicts in the region is also complex. While the exact scenario of a third world war is unclear, three out of ten respondents named climate change as the second-largest threat to the world in 2035. Only 1.7% of respondents believed that a new pandemic would be the most pressing crisis affecting the planet. 'The world is on the brink of a new global confrontation,' said a team from the Atlantic Council. '62% of respondents expect the world to be worse in 10 years, and only 38% predict it will be better,' they added.

**Experts Predict a New World War in the Next Decade, Involving Nuclear Weapons and Space**
A study published by the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security reveals that over 350 global strategists and professionals expect a new world war to break out in the next decade, involving nuclear weapons and space. According to the survey, the US and China will face off in a devastating global conflict. The predictions are based on current geopolitics, particularly the lack of favorable outcomes for Ukraine and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. By 2035, the world will be 'more multipolar without solid multilateral institutions.' A recession will lead to a democratic depression. Philip Zelikow, a historian and former US diplomat, estimates the possibility of a global war at 20-30%. He warns of a 'period of maximum danger' in the next one to three years. The study found that 40% of respondents believe a new world war will occur, with 48% expecting nuclear weapons to be used. Iran is expected to become a new nuclear power, with 88% of respondents predicting this. The war could spread to space, with 45% of respondents believing this will happen. The conflict will have a devastating impact on the global economy, making it the greatest threat to global prosperity. Over a third of respondents believe Israel will engage in a direct conflict with Iran by 2035. Additionally, 65% of respondents expect China to attempt to reclaim Taiwan by force, while 69% anticipate a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.

**Catalan Nationalist Parties Express Distrust in Nuclear-Free Future**
Junts per Catalunya (JxCat) and ERC, two Catalan nationalist parties, expressed distrust in their ability to function without nuclear power after they abstained from a vote on extending the life of nuclear plants in Spain. The proposal, put forward by the PP, was ultimately passed with the support of Vox and Unión del Pueblo Navarro, but it is non-binding. While there are currently no indications that the parties will revolt against the government or the nuclear shutdown schedule, their abstention is a clear sign that the closure of the three reactors in Tarragona in 2029, 2030, and 2035 will be accompanied by a strong political debate. 'It is a clear signal that the closure of the nuclear reactors will be accompanied by a strong political debate,' said a source.

The Keidanren (Japan Federation of Economic Organizations) has published a proposal called 'Future Design 2040', which discusses tax and social security reform, as well as the use of nuclear power, among other topics. The proposal emphasizes the need to consider the 'social perspective' and strive for a 'whole system optimum' when implementing policies. According to Keidanren Chairman, Jun'kura Masayuki (Chairman of Sumitomo Chemical), 'the issues and policies are intertwined in a complex 'nested structure'. We need to stand from the social perspective and advance policies from a whole system optimum point of view.'
