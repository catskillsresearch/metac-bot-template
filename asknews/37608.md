**Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi Doubles Net Worth After Inheriting Property and Declaring Separation of Assets**
Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi has doubled his net worth to 12 million Uruguayan pesos (approximately USD 300,000) since inheriting a property and declaring separation of assets from his wife, Laura Alonsopérez. According to his declaration to the Transparency and Ethics Public Board (Jutep), his only income is the presidential salary, which is 547,000 Uruguayan pesos per month (approximately USD 13,000). He owns a 'residential house' and two cars, a Nissan (2022 model) and a Hyundai (2025 model), worth over USD 100,000. He also has USD 15,000 in a dollar account and USD 830,000 in a peso account. The increase in his wealth is due to the sale of 'inheritance rights' over a family property, which was not previously disclosed. The couple's separation of assets was initiated in 2022 and finalized in April 2023, and is now reflected in the declaration. Alonsopérez, who does not have a formal title, declared a residential house worth USD 78,000. The couple's combined wealth increased from USD 142,308 in October 2024 to USD 372,824, according to the current dollar exchange rate.

**Uruguay's President Orsi Vows to Support Citrus Sector**
Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi stated that the government must support the citrus sector, which exports around 80,000 tons annually and is expected to increase to 130,000 tons in three years. Orsi made this statement during the inauguration of the citrus harvest in the Salto department, where he met with entrepreneurs who presented some of the sector's needs, including opening more markets and improving rural roads and pest control. Orsi also received a request from workers regarding the payment of a unemployment insurance during months with no work. 'The production of citrus fruits is an area that needs special attention (...) It's a very promising future that we need to support,' Orsi said. The Minister of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, Alfredo Fratti, highlighted the investment in the sector and emphasized that 80% of the planted area is irrigated using a system that could be replicated in other areas. 'I'm delighted with the development of the sector,' Fratti said, adding that the Ministry will seek to support it to continue advancing.' According to the Presidency, the sector exports around 80,000 tons of citrus fruits per year, with an expected increase to 130,000 tons by 2028. The main production is mandarins without seeds, while oranges are also sold for juice production.

**Modi likely to attend BRICS summit in Brazil next month; meet closely watched by U.S. govt**
The upcoming BRICS summit in Brazil is expected to be closely watched by the US government, particularly due to discussions on the use of alternate or national currencies for trade. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned that India's participation in BRICS had 'rubbed the US the wrong way', saying that BRICS countries are trying to move away from dollar hegemony. However, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar clarified that India has no policy of replacing the dollar and there is no unified BRICS position on the issue. The summit will also discuss reforming institutions like the IMF and WTO, increasing representation of developing countries, and reflecting the contributions of the Global South to the world economy. India is expected to attend the Quad Foreign Ministers' meeting in Washington before the BRICS summit and announce the first part of the bilateral trade agreement with the US before July 9.

**Uruguay Prohibits Vape Devices and Restricts Cigarette Packaging**
Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi and Health Minister Cristina Lustemberg announced new measures to control tobacco consumption, including the prohibition of the importation and sale of vape devices and restrictions on the packaging of cigarette boxes. These measures reverse two decrees taken by the previous administration of Luis Lacalle Pou. According to the Ministry of Public Health, 18 people die every day in Uruguay due to tobacco consumption. Lustemberg stated that the goal is to 'blind' the normative framework, treating all electronic devices equally, and to eliminate any strategies that make packaging more attractive or induce consumers to think that one product is less harmful than another. The new regulations also prohibit the use of colors, logos, or designs inside cigarette boxes and the use of various materials. Lustemberg emphasized that tobacco is the leading cause of preventable death in the country and the world, and that half of smokers will die from a tobacco-related cause and 80% will have some related disease. She also highlighted the policies against tobacco implemented during the governments of the Frente Amplio and particularly during the first term of Tabaré Vázquez, who prohibited smoking in enclosed spaces and declared Uruguay the first smoke-free country in the Americas. 'We have the challenge of advancing in two directions: in the control of tobacco consumption measures and in the strengthening of the cultural change that cares for the health of Uruguayans,' said Lustemberg.

**Uruguay's President to Attend UN Conference on Sustainable Development Financing**
Uruguay's President, Yamandú Orsi, will travel to Seville, Spain, at the end of June to participate in the Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Development Financing, convened by the United Nations. The conference aims to 'promote concrete solutions to finance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda' and is expected to result in a document of commitments 'to mobilize public and private resources, as well as new forms of cooperation and investment in sustainable development.' Orsi participated in a virtual meeting convened by UN Secretary-General António Guterres prior to the conference. 'Uruguay is determined and convinced that the Seville meeting will allow us to strengthen the path marked by the 2030 Agenda, which would be impossible to strengthen without international cooperation and financing mechanisms,' Orsi said. He emphasized Uruguay's commitment to multilateralism and sustainable development as the axis of international policy. 'Count on Uruguay, count on the Uruguayan people, count on the Uruguayan government to be there in Seville, but also to strengthen and commit ourselves more and more to the objectives we have set,' Orsi concluded.

**Uruguay Repeals Decrees on Electronic Tobacco Products and Flexible Packaging**
The Uruguayan government, led by Yamandú Orsi, has announced the repeal of two decrees signed by former President Luis Lacalle Pou: decree 87/021, which regulated electronic tobacco products, and decree 282/022, which allowed for flexible packaging of cigarettes. The Ministry of Public Health (MSP) explained that the repeal aims to 'blind' the normative framework, treating all electronic devices equally, and to prevent the use of strategies that make packaging more attractive or misleading. The MSP also announced plans to activate educational campaigns, reinforce tobacco control, and provide virtual assistance to help users quit smoking. According to official data, the prevalence of tobacco consumption among people over 15 years old decreased from 24.8% in 2006 to 19.7% in 2019, and has remained stable since then. The MSP also highlighted the importance of addressing the low perception of risk among young people regarding e-cigarettes, which is linked to their colorful design, technology, and strong marketing on social media.

**Orsi's First Three Months in Office: Resignations, Challenges, and Approval Ratings**
It has been three months since Yamandú Orsi took office as President of the Republic on March 1st. This is a good time to evaluate Orsi's performance in his first few weeks, which many consider a honeymoon period. Orsi won the presidential election in the second round of November 2024 against the Coalición Republicana's Álvaro Delgado - Valeria Ripoll. Three political scientists, Camila Zeballos, Antonio Cardarello, and Adolfo Garcé, analyzed Orsi's nearly 100 days in office, his approval ratings, the resignations that hindered the start, the Executive's communication problems, and the challenges he faces in the future. According to the experts, it is time to put the President in his place and assess his performance.

**Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi Embarks on First International Tour to Panama and Honduras**
Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi will embark on his first international tour to Panama and Honduras from April 7 to 9. During the visit, he will meet with his Panamanian counterpart José Raúl Mulino and hold business meetings with Panamanian entrepreneurs, accompanied by a Uruguayan business delegation. The Uruguayan authorities aim to explore new commercial opportunities, particularly in the context of ongoing bilateral negotiations, as explained by Foreign Minister Mario Lubetkin. 'The President Orsi is receiving too many invitations, which we pointed out from the first day. I believe there is a connection between all the participations from March 1 at the level of presidents, ministers, and countries,' Lubetkin stated in a press conference. Orsi will also attend the CELAC Summit in Honduras, where he will meet with the presidents of Honduras and Colombia. The tour aims to strengthen Uruguay's position of opening up to new markets and diversifying its economy beyond traditional agreements like Mercosur. Orsi has expressed optimism about future trade negotiations with the United States, particularly after the recent tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. He remains confident that Mercosur, of which Uruguay is a member, will not be one of the most affected blocks by the tariffs. 'We know or at least have the expectation of having good negotiations, because when we talk to US diplomats, they always present the same thing. We need to sit down and talk, negotiate, and understand that it's a world that requires us to be very attentive,' the president said.

**Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi Announces First Official Trip Abroad**
Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi has announced his first official trip abroad to Panama and Honduras, where he will participate in the next CELAC summit. The trip comes after a meeting with lawmakers from the Frente Amplio coalition, where 63 priority measures for the next five years were discussed. The measures include economic growth, security, social cohesion, housing, and infrastructure. The government has also presented a document outlining 63 concrete actions for the quinquenio, including increasing the real salary of public and private workers, installing mobile police stations, and expanding police personnel. Additionally, the government aims to implement a national literacy campaign in prisons, create 2,000 new police jobs, and extend video surveillance to 20,000 locations. 'This is the immediate response of the government to open the way with one of the main Central American countries,' said Foreign Minister Mario Lubetkin. 'We hope that from this first meeting between the two presidents, a decision will be made in common agreement to initiate potential future agreements in the commercial area,' he added. The government also plans to implement a plan to address the 'problematic use of drugs' in people who have recently been released from prison, and to 'exhaust all instances to search for the truth of the disappeared detainees.'

**Yamandú Orsi's Government Faces Complex Challenges in Uruguay**
Uruguay's new president, Yamandú Orsi, faces complex challenges in his administration, including a high debt of $56.3 billion, inflation contained between 2-6%, and a unemployment rate of 8.1%. The minimum wage is $420 per month for non-agricultural workers and $380 for agricultural workers. The government has called for dialogue and unity among different sectors, but the opposition is expected to be strong. The president has negotiated with various parties to form a coalition government, but the country's economic situation is precarious. The government will need to break with the liberal concept that salaries are the variable for inflation adjustment, which has led to a superavit fiscal without affecting speculators. The new government has also been invited to participate in the BRICS meeting in Rio de Janeiro, which requires a strong national state to overcome economic asymmetries. The president's speech, 'caminando por el medio de la calle', suggests that the government will need to choose between moving to the left or right, but ultimately, the people are on the streets, not in the institutional bureaucracy.

**Sheinbaum Responds to Invitation to BRICS 2025 Summit for Mexico**
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo was invited by Brazilian President Lula da Silva to participate in the BRICS 2025 summit, representing Mexico. Sheinbaum stated that they are still analyzing the possibility of attending, but would send a representative from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to listen if they cannot attend. Sheinbaum said, 'If someone goes, it would be someone from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who could go as an invited guest to listen.' Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi expressed interest in participating in BRICS and hopes that Mexico and Colombia will also join, as he believes it will 'consolidate multilateralism and free trade.' Orsi stated, 'If there is no freedom of trade, there is no multilateralism, no democracy.' BRICS is a group of emerging countries, including Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, which aims to promote economic, political, and cultural cooperation among its members.

**Yamandú Orsi Assumes Presidency of Uruguay, Faces Challenges Ahead**
Yamandú Orsi will assume the presidency of Uruguay on Saturday, succeeding Luis Lacalle Pou. Orsi, a 57-year-old history professor, won the election with a promise to benefit the most disadvantaged with 'a safe change that will not be radical'. He has a 44% approval rating, according to a survey by Opción Consultores. Orsi will face challenges, including a divided parliament and internal conflicts within his party. He must also address social demands without increasing the deficit, which reached 4.1% of GDP in 2024. Additionally, he will have to tackle high crime rates and a lack of rainfall that threatens economic growth. Delegations from over 60 countries, including the King of Spain and the presidents of Germany, Armenia, and Brazil, will attend the inauguration. Orsi has already held several bilateral meetings, including an asado with the presidents of Brazil, Chile, and Colombia. His mentor, José 'Pepe' Mujica, will also attend the inauguration, despite being ill with cancer. 'We will fulfill our promises!' Orsi said after winning the election. 'I hope that finally justice will be done,' said Claudia, a 59-year-old nurse who preferred not to give her last name. Orsi's presidency will be the eighth since 1985, when a 13-year military dictatorship ended. 'He will dedicate more time and energy to managing his most ardent supporters than to dealing with his political opponents,' wrote economist Arturo Porzecanski in the Americas Quarterly, warning of tensions with the powerful Pit-CNT union. 'Orsi inherits an economy and a country with very solid fundamentals,' Porzecanski added. Lacalle Pou, who leaves office with 54% popularity, highlighted his government's care for public resources, humanism, and efforts to reach all corners of the country. 'I would live it again, correcting errors,' he said, emotional and surrounded by a crowd of supporters. 'We need him!' exclaimed Cecilia Antía, a 60-year-old travel agent, lamenting that Uruguay does not allow consecutive presidential re-elections.

**Yamandú Orsi's Inauguration: A Global Event with 185 Representatives from 65 Countries**
Uruguay is expecting 185 representatives from 65 countries to attend the inauguration of Yamandú Orsi as the new president of Uruguay. Several world leaders have confirmed their participation, including the presidents of Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, and the Dominican Republic. The king of Spain, Felipe VI, and the prime minister of Peru, Gustavo Adrianzén, are also expected to attend. However, the presidents of Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba have been excluded from the invitation due to their authoritarian governments. The inauguration ceremony will take place on March 1st at the Palacio Legislativo, and will be followed by a procession to the Plaza Independencia, where Orsi will take the oath of office. As announced by the future secretary of Government, Alejandro Sanchez, there will also be representatives from those excluded countries. 'There will be representatives from those countries,' Sanchez said. 'We want to show that we are open to dialogue and cooperation.'
