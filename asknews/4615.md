**S&P 500 Bulls Ride Wave Down To Close Best Month Since 2023**
The S&P 500 (SPX) closed the month of May 2025 at 5,911.69, a 0.8% decline from the previous week. Despite this decline, May 2025 was the best month for the index since November 2023. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tool projection of real GDP growth in the U.S. during the current quarter of 2025-Q2 increased to +3.3%, up from the previous projection of +2.4%.

**What is the real risk to stocks from elevated bond yields**
Goldman Sachs believes that despite elevated bond yields, the S&P 500 has a 10% return forecast over the next 12 months, targeting 6,500. The firm notes that the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is at 4.4%, with expectations of it reaching 4.5% by 2025 and 4.55% in 2026. Goldman emphasizes that the cause and pace of rising yields are more critical to equities than the absolute level. However, large, rapid moves in yields, such as more than 60 basis points in a month, have historically weighed on equities. Goldman believes that elevated yields alone are unlikely to derail earnings for the S&P 500, but may constrain valuation expansion. The firm advises avoiding weak balance sheet stocks in the current high-rate environment.

**'Sell in May and Go Away': Is this Investment Strategy Still Relevant?**
The 'Sell in May and go away' investment strategy, which suggests selling in May and staying out of the market until October, is based on historical data showing lower returns in the summer months. However, this seasonal pattern has weakened in recent years. Between 1950 and 2022, the S&P 500 index had a median return of 6% between November and April, compared to 1.56% between May and October. However, in the last 10-15 years, summers have not been synonymous with low returns. Today, markets are more influenced by macroeconomic factors, monetary policies, and global events than by seasonal patterns. As a result, it is recommended to base investment decisions on a comprehensive analysis and a diversified long-term strategy, rather than relying on a calendar-based approach that may be less reliable.

**RBC sees S&P 500 likely falling from current levels by year-end**
RBC Capital has revised its year-end 2025 S&P 500 target to 5,730, up from 5,550, but warns that the index is likely to decline from current levels. RBC analysts expect a 'choppy' path for stocks through year-end, citing a wide range of possible outcomes and growing downside risks. Despite the target upgrade, RBC's sentiment model is signaling 'less robust forward returns' and warns of a potential pullback. RBC sees a broad range of possible outcomes by year-end, from 6,400 to 4,200-4,500, due to factors such as inflation, Federal Reserve cuts, and real GDP growth. However, the firm warns that rising 10-year yields or disappointing economic data could shift sentiment rapidly. RBC also notes that weakening interest from non-U.S. investors and policy uncertainty could drive a correction before year-end. As RBC described its stance as 'rather neutral,' emphasizing that 'current pricing in the S&P 500 already reflects the step-up improvement in macro fundamentals.'

**1 Top Dividend Growth Stock to Buy Right Now**
Realty Income is a top dividend growth stock to consider due to its high yield and potential for long-term dividend increases. With a current yield of 5.7%, investors can generate $57,000 in cash per year from a $1 million investment. Realty Income has a compound annual total return of 13.6% since its listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994, outperforming the S&P 500 index by 4x. The company's focus on consumer-facing real estate provides a strong economic moat, making it a more stable investment option. As one expert might say, 'Slow and steady wins the race' in the world of REITs, and Realty Income is a prime example of this strategy.

**Here's the Average Stock Market Return Over the Last 10 Years | The Motley Fool**
The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite indexes have moved sideways in 2025, with the S&P 500 advancing less than 1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declining less than 1%, and the Nasdaq Composite declining about 1% year to date. Over the last 10 years, the S&P 500 returned 235%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned 193%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 314%. This translates to an average annual return of 12.8% for the S&P 500, 11.3% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and 15.2% for the Nasdaq Composite. For example, investing $150 weekly in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF would be worth $142,200 in 10 years, while investing in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust would be worth $132,300, and investing in the Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF would be worth $159,900.

**Why Many Millionaires Choose to Rent, Not Buy**
Many millionaires are choosing to rent luxury apartments instead of buying homes. According to Freddie Mac, the average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage in May 2025 is 6.76%, which is higher than the pre-pandemic level. As a result, the monthly mortgage payment for new homes has increased by 11% compared to last year. In contrast, the rent for luxury apartments has decreased by 0.3% compared to last year. Despite being able to afford higher housing prices, many wealthy individuals are choosing not to buy homes. Instead, they are opting for luxury apartment rentals, which offer a high-quality lifestyle choice before interest rates stabilize. Many high-net-worth individuals are reevaluating their wealth and how to use it, and are no longer investing large sums in primary residences. They are instead choosing to invest in commercial real estate and purchasing multiple properties in different markets to diversify their investments. Investing in real estate can provide stable cash flow and benefits from asset appreciation. The stock market is another area where former homeowners are allocating their funds, offering higher and faster returns than owning a property. For example, the S&P 500 index has averaged a 9.4% annual return over the past 25 years, but in 2023 and 2024, it returned 26.29% and 25.02%, respectively. Renting luxury apartments also offers flexibility, as tenants can move without having to sell their property. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, selling a house can take up to 66 days, and completing a transaction can take an additional 42 days. This makes renting more attractive, especially for those who travel frequently or have multiple properties. Developers are responding to the demand for luxury apartments by building high-end properties that can command higher rents. However, this may be a case of 'building castles in the air,' as the number of high-net-worth renters is limited. According to the World Economic Forum, the notion that millionaires are a large group is a common misconception. In reality, the percentage of Americans with incomes of $100,000 or more is less than 0.5%. Despite the overall housing shortage in the US, developers are trying to capitalize on the trend by building luxury apartments for a niche market. For example, a report by CRE Daily estimates that the US will face a shortage of 150 million to 700 million housing units in 2025, but only 6,700 affordable housing units are under construction, while 500,000 luxury apartments are being built. In conclusion, for many wealthy individuals, buying a home is not a financial decision they want to make. Instead, they are investing their funds in a way that they believe will bring higher returns than waiting for their property to appreciate in value. Of course, there are other reasons, such as experiencing the luxury lifestyle or seeking the flexibility that renting can provide.

**Can AMD Stock Turn a $25,000 Investment Into $1 Million by the Time You Retire?**
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has had a sluggish start to 2025, but its long-term prospects in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market are promising. Analysts at Allied Market Research forecast the AI chip market to reach $383.7 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate of 38.2% since 2023. AMD has recently announced a $10 billion collaboration with Humain to build the world's most open, scalable, resilient, and cost-efficient AI infrastructure. The company's quarterly earnings report showed a 36% increase in sales, and its new Instinct MI325X chips have been doing well. To reach a $1 million value from a $25,000 investment, AMD would need to rise to 40 times its original value, requiring an average annual return of 12.6% to 15.4% depending on the number of years until retirement.

**U.S. Money Supply Is Making History on Both Ends -- Including a First Since the Great Depression -- and It Portends a Wild Ride for Stocks**
The U.S. money supply has made history by experiencing a decline of 4.76% between April 2022 and October 2023, the first time since the Great Depression that M2 has declined by at least 2% on a year-over-year basis. However, the M2 money supply has since rebounded to an all-time record high of $21.863 trillion in April 2025. This whipsaw effect in M2 over the last three years suggests that stocks may be extra volatile in the quarters and years to come. Despite this, patient investors should not be alarmed, as the U.S. economy has a strong track record of recovering from downturns. According to Crestmont Research, every rolling 20-year period of total return data from the S&P 500 has produced a positive annualized rate of return since 1900. This suggests that holding a long-term perspective and maintaining patience can lead to wealth growth, regardless of market conditions.

**The Future of Investment: A Shift Towards Digitalization and Thematic Investing**
The global investment landscape is shifting, with real estate leading the way. According to recent data, real estate accounts for 48.7% of global investments, followed by bonds (17%) and stocks (15.9%). Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies, despite their recent surge, make up only 0.5% of global investments. However, cryptocurrencies have delivered the highest returns in recent years, with a 1196% increase in value since December 2018. In contrast, real estate has grown by 22.5% between 2019-2022, while bonds and stocks have grown by 29.4% and 66%, respectively, between 2018-2025. Gold has delivered the highest returns among traditional assets, with a 167% increase in value between 2018-2025. The future of investment is uncertain, with economic and geopolitical changes, technological advancements, and demographic shifts expected to impact investment preferences. As a result, traditional investment instruments such as real estate, bonds, stocks, and gold are undergoing significant changes. For example, real estate is becoming increasingly digitalized, with the use of blockchain technology allowing for the tokenization of properties, making it easier for investors to purchase small shares of properties. This could lead to increased liquidity and appeal to younger investors. However, the demand for housing may decline in aging countries, while it may remain strong in younger countries with high birth rates and urbanization. According to a report by HardMan&Well, the global real estate market is expected to grow by 10.1% annually until 2030. The report also suggests that the demand for bonds may decline in the future due to increasing government debt and credit rating downgrades. The stock market, on the other hand, remains attractive to long-term investors, with the S&P 500 index delivering an average annual return of 10.33% since 1957. The report also highlights the potential for thematic investments, such as artificial intelligence and electric vehicles, to deliver high returns in the future. Finally, the report notes that the global population's increasing interest in cryptocurrencies, with over 560 million people using them worldwide, could lead to a significant increase in their market value, from 3.6 trillion dollars to 12 trillion dollars by 2030 and 50 trillion dollars by 2050.

**The S&P 500 Has Returned an Average of 12.2% Annually Over the Past 10 Years. Here Is What History Says May Happen Over the Next Decade | The Motley Fool**
The S&P 500 has returned an average of 12.2% annually over the past decade, but history suggests that it may perform worse in the next decade due to its high valuation. The market's CAPE ratio is near its highest point since the dot-com bubble in 2000, indicating that it may decline or plateau. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) could create enough growth to justify higher valuations. Research from PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that AI will boost North America's economy by 14.5% by 2030, and AI could bring new industries online by 2035. As exciting as the future could be, it's wise to remain optimistic but take a measured approach, and to follow core investing principles such as diversifying your portfolio, investing for the long term, and holding through volatility.

**Prediction: This Magnificent Vanguard Index Fund Will Beat the S&P 500 Again in 2025**
The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 15.4% since its establishment in 2010, outpacing the S&P 500's average annual gain of 12.8%. Despite being down 4.3% in 2025, the ETF's diversified portfolio, which includes tech giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, as well as payment giants Visa and Mastercard, positions it for a potential recovery. According to PwC, AI could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and the ETF's top holdings are well-positioned to benefit from this trend. The author believes that the ETF will continue to outperform the S&P 500 in 2025 due to the pause of 'reciprocal tariffs' by President Trump, the exemption of semiconductors from tariffs, and the strong earnings results from the ETF's top holdings. Even in the event of an economic slowdown or recession, the ETF's tech giants are likely to hold up better than the rest of the market. As a result, the author thinks there is a high chance the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF will recover to beat the S&P 500 yet again in 2025.

**Could This Vanguard ETF Be Your Ticket to Becoming a Millionaire by 2035?**
A hypothetical investor could build a $1 million portfolio using the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) by considering two key aspects: the S&P 500's steady returns over the decades and a conservative estimate of its future growth. The S&P 500 has generated a 12.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last 10 years, and an 11% CAGR over 30 years. Assuming an 11% CAGR over the next 10 years, an investor could potentially reach a portfolio value of $1 million by 2035.

**S&P 500 at 71% gain, but inflation looms**
The S&P 500 has gained 71% since the bull market began in October 2022, driven by strong consumer spending and business investments. However, inflation has accelerated for four months in a row, and bearish sentiment reached its highest level since November 2023. Analysts have varying views on the market's future, with Ed Yardeni predicting it will continue through the decade and Tom Lee forecasting the index could hit 15,000 by 2030. However, Andrew Simmon and Gene Munster express concerns about the market nearing its late stages and a potential bubble burst in the next two years. The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.2 is well above its 10-year average of 18.3, and high valuations could deter investors and direct them towards alternatives like fixed income. Investors should be cautious and scrutinize valuations before buying stocks, and accumulate cash to capitalize on the next market drawdown.

**Expert Predicts 'Golden Age' of Investing: S&P 500 to Reach 13,000 by 2030**
Analyst Mary Ann Bartels from Sanctuary Wealth predicts a 'golden age' of investing, with the S&P 500 index reaching 13,000 points by 2030, a 113% increase from its current level of around 6,000 points. Bartels believes that we are still in the early stages of a market boom that will peak by 2029 or 2030. The expected gains are attributed to productivity gains from artificial intelligence and a strong US economy, driven by low corporate taxes and low interest rates. However, the realism of this prolonged rally is uncertain. Historically, the average bull market lasts 4.4 years, and if we assume the bull market started in 2022, it would end around 2027. A rally to 2030 would be three years longer than the average, but still possible. Nevertheless, the 'golden age' scenario is optimistic, given the unpredictable nature of technological progress and geopolitical risks. As always, patience is key for investors.

**Economists Predict Bumpy Road in 2025 With Hope for Stability**
Economists predict a bumpy road in 2025, with some factors bringing significant changes or making the market stronger, while others may keep it lagging. The main challenges remain the same as in previous years: inflation, interest rates, labor productivity, profit margins, and persistent labor shortages. According to Jeff Krumpelman, chief investment strategist and stock manager at Mariner Wealth Advisors, the S&P 500 index is expected to reach 6,600 points by the end of 2025, with a possible optimistic scenario of 7,000 points. However, the journey may not be smooth. The biggest factor contributing to labor shortages is the aging population, with the baby boomer generation retiring and not being replaced by younger workers. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the number of workers aged 55 and above will increase by 2.7 million from 2022 to 2032, a 7.1% increase. In contrast, the population of workers aged 25-54 is expected to grow by only 5.2% during the same period. This means that older workers will become an increasingly important part of the labor force. Despite this, many industries in the US are currently facing recruitment challenges. Joseph Von Nessen, a research economist at the University of South Carolina's Darla Moore School of Business, notes that the state's unemployment rate has risen from 3% in 2024 to 4.8%, but the average unemployment rate during previous economic expansions was 6%. 'This is good news for workers, but it also means that businesses may continue to face recruitment challenges in 2025, which could limit their expansion capacity and, in turn, limit the potential for economic growth in South Carolina and the US as a whole.'

**S&P 500 Expected to See Significant Growth, Analysts Optimistic**
Goldman Sachs estimates that the S&P 500 index will have an annual average return of three percent between 2024 and 2034, but after adjusting for inflation, the real return is expected to be around one percent. This could lead to a massive influx of money from Wall Street to the bond market. For example, long-term US government bonds currently offer a risk-free return of around four and a half percent before inflation. Pål Ringholm, a soon-to-be investment director at Formue, notes that US government bonds can continue to rise. He also suggests that Donald Trump's promises of new tax cuts and continued budget deficits could further increase US inflation and bond yields. Barclays' stock market forecast for 2025 is based on historical data from a single month and lacks fundamental time series analysis. However, the optimistic outlook is supported by a group of positive analysts. Financial Times recently reported that analyst optimism is rare, citing that it has not been this high since 2022. Analysts expect companies listed on the S&P 500 index to have a net result that is 11.4 percent higher this quarter than in the first quarter of 2024. The growth is expected to be widespread across various sectors.
