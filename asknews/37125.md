**Azerbaijani President Signs Decree on Mandatory Military Service**
Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has signed a decree calling up citizens for mandatory military service from July 1 to July 30, 2025, and discharging soldiers from mandatory military service. According to Report, the document signed by the head of state states that citizens of the Republic of Azerbaijan born in 2007 and reaching the age of 18 by the day of call-up (inclusive), as well as those born between 1995 and 2006, up to the age of 30, who have not completed mandatory military service in the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan, do not have the right to defer their call-up for mandatory military service, or have not been exempt from call-up for mandatory military service, will be called up for mandatory military service from July 1 to July 30, 2025. Additionally, in accordance with the Decree, soldiers who have completed their term of service, as provided for in Article 38.1.1 of the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan 'On Military Obligation and Military Service', will be discharged from service from July 1 to July 30, 2025. 'This is a significant step towards strengthening the country's defense capabilities,' said the President. 'We are committed to ensuring the security and stability of our nation.'

**Cyberattack on SPW: Deadline for PAC 2025 declaration extended to June 13**
Following a cyberattack on the Service public de Wallonie, the agriculture portal and PAC-on-web were temporarily disabled, preventing farmers from submitting their land declaration for the PAC 2025 campaign. The portals have since been restored, but to ensure a smooth access for all Belgian farmers, the Minister of Agriculture has decided to extend the deadline for submitting the unique request, now set to June 13, 2025. 'The time needed to introduce the declarations and to guarantee a serene access to all Walloon farmers' is the reason behind this decision, according to the Minister.

**Swiss Army's Non-Binary Survey Ends in Controversy**
The Swiss army conducted an online survey from July to October 2024 to understand the experiences of non-binary individuals in the military. However, the army was unable to present an analysis of the results due to the low number of serious responses. According to the NZZaS, more than a third of participants did not answer the questions correctly, instead using the available fields to express frustration and anger towards the army's queer orientation. One participant asked, 'Have you lost your mind?' Another person stated that the survey was 'ridiculous' and that the army should focus on more pressing issues. A third participant wrote 'There are only two sexes!' eight times in a row. The survey was criticized by the National Councilor Mauro Tuena (UDC/ZH), who stated that the survey was 'completely useless' and that the army has more pressing issues to address. In contrast, the National Councilor Priska Seiler Graf (PS/ZH) praised the army for its initiative, stating that non-binary individuals should be able to serve in the military and that specific questions, such as where they would sleep and shower, needed to be addressed. The army stated that they had hoped the survey would encourage more non-binary individuals to participate, but were not prepared for the negative reactions from 'actors with different interests'.

**Swiss Army's Non-Binary Survey Yields Disappointing Results**
The Swiss army conducted an online survey on the topic of non-binary identity, but the results were not positive. Last year, a study found that 4 out of 100 military members identified as neither male nor female. The army's leadership wanted to delve deeper into the issue, so they conducted an online survey from July to October 2024, open to anyone interested. The goal was to understand how non-binary individuals fare in the military: do they face discrimination, and have they come out to their superiors?

**Swiss Army's Non-Binary Survey Marred by Frustration and Anger**
The Swiss Army conducted an online survey to understand the experiences of non-binary individuals in the military, but due to a lack of 'serious answers', they cannot present a reliable evaluation. The survey, which was conducted from July to October 2024, received 81 responses, but over a third of the participants did not take the survey seriously and instead expressed their frustration and anger towards the army's focus on queer issues. One participant asked, 'Have you lost your mind?' and another person said the survey was 'laughable'. A third of the participants identified as non-binary and provided serious answers, with some expressing gratitude for the survey and others complaining about lack of withdrawal options, separate restrooms, and being taken seriously by their superiors. One person wrote 'There are only two genders!' eight times in a row.

**Low start for general security water**
The NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water has released its outlook for the 2025-26 irrigation season, predicting a very low opening allocation for general security water users. According to the department, maximum allocation can be expected for towns, domestic and stock access licences, and sub-category high security entitlements. However, general security water users can expect a very low opening allocation, with potential allocations ranging from 5% to 17% by September 1, depending on inflows into storages. The department notes that individual balances may vary, and allocations will be subject to inflow and losses to June 30 and any forfeiture of allocated water on July 1. As stated by the department, 'Potential improvements in general security allocations are dependent on inflows into storages.'

**Nizhnevartovsk Authorities to Create Map of Burials with Contractor**
The authorities in Nizhnevartovsk plan to create a map of burials by hiring a contractor to photograph and aerially photograph burial sites. The contractor will be required to photograph graves on five cemeteries for almost 12.5 million rubles. The contractor will also need to collect information about the deceased, including military personnel from journals of burial sites, make aerial photography, create an electronic map of burials in a coordinate system linked to photographs, and identify unclaimed graves. The work must be completed by August and the data will be entered into the 'Unified Environment' system to provide more quality and 'one window' rite services. However, information about military burials will remain closed. This is part of a larger project to inventory cemeteries in the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, which is expected to be completed in October 2025 and will result in the creation of a cemetery register and the organization of burials through a single window on the 'Government Services' portal.

**A Trillion Dollars for Wasteful Pentagon and No Money for Social Goods We Need and Want | Common Dreams**
President Trump has requested a record-high $1.01 trillion 'defense' budget for FY 2026, while cutting funding for social services that keep the country safe, such as clean air and water protection, Medicaid, and education. The U.S. already spends more on the military than the next nine countries combined, and the Pentagon has never passed a federal audit. The budget will be handed over to corporations and lobbyists who profit from producing weapons that drive war and climate collapse. In contrast, a trillion-dollar investment in public services could achieve solutions to the greatest challenges facing American families and communities, such as improving education and healthcare, reducing poverty, and increasing security. Polls show that Americans prefer their tax dollars to be spent on public services rather than the military, and most voters disapprove of the proposed 'Department of Government Efficiency' cuts to federal agencies and programs. There is still time to fight back, as Congress has the final say in deciding how federal money is allocated.

**New Waste Regulations: Time to Change Habits**
The new, stricter climate regulations, which will come into effect on July 1, 2025, will change the way we build. The choice of materials will be different in the future. According to Kristian Fribo, 'We will see a development of the traditional building materials, which many are already optimizing. The producers are doing everything they can to reduce the CO2 load during production. Therefore, it is not certain that we will see completely new and unknown materials taking over the market, rather traditional materials in improved versions.' The new regulations will put more emphasis on renovation, rebuilding, and maintenance, as these activities have a significant impact on the climate. Fribo expects that there will be more reuse of materials on building sites. 'It will require new knowledge to understand the climate impact of the materials used. The craftsmen will have to get used to working with different products and solutions to get the climate account to work. We will use more recycled materials and see new types of materials within insulation, plasterboards, windows, mortar, bricks, etc.' The amount of waste will also be reduced, and the standard goals will be challenged. According to Fribo, 'I can imagine that plaster in several sizes other than standard sizes will become more popular. By having more sizes to choose from, you can reduce waste and thereby reduce the amount of waste significantly. And that's actually important, because waste fills a surprising amount in the climate account,' said Fribo.

**Climate Change Weekly # 541 — Earth Is Greening: Thank Climate Change**
A recent study has found that the Earth's 'greenness' has reached its highest levels since the early 2000s, with vegetation coverage and mass increasing due to continuous growth in boreal and temperate vegetation, as well as a transient tropical vegetation boost due to increased rainfall. This is not the first time that an acceleration in global greening has been observed, with a previous study finding that about 55% of global land mass had shown an 'accelerated rate' of vegetation growth. The study's results suggest a 'robust resilience and adaptability of global vegetation in the face of changing environmental conditions.' Meanwhile, the US Defense Department has scrapped its unjustified climate programs, recognizing that efforts to fight climate change do not threaten military readiness or effectiveness, but rather undermine it. The Navy has officially announced the scrapping of the Biden-era 'climate action plan,' and the Air Force has put its 'Sustainable Aviation Fuel' program in doubt. The Army's plan to electrify tactical vehicles by 2027 has also been deemed impractical. The new management at the DOD is prioritizing efficient and effective operational capabilities in defense of the nation, and is redirecting funds to strengthen the US military. 'While adaptation measures such as building sea walls and erecting flood barriers are sensible for building resilience to weather events, they are not tied to measurable climate change mitigation,' writes Tohi. 'These efforts are pragmatic but do not align with the broader, often ideological, climate change agenda.'

**Navy Scraps Biden-Era 'Climate Action' Plan**
The U.S. Navy has officially scrapped the Biden-era 'Climate Action 2030' plan, which aimed to tackle the 'urgency of the climate crisis' and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Navy Secretary John Phelan announced the decision, stating, 'Today, I'm focusing on the warfighters first, and I'm rescinding the Biden administration's climate action program. Our focus needs to be on lethality and our warfighters.' The plan, released in May 2022, contained goals such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and acquiring 100% zero-emission vehicles by 2035. The Biden administration's efforts to integrate climate change into military operations have been met with criticism, with some viewing it as a leftists' climate alarmist agenda.

**The US military has cared about climate change since the dawn of the Cold War - for good reason**
The US military has been concerned about climate change since the Cold War era, as evident from the 1957 movie 'The Deadly Mantis,' which depicted a monster released from melting Arctic ice. In reality, the military built research centers to study the effects of climate change on national security. The Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment was created to study glacier runways, ice behavior, and snow physics. The military recognized climate change as a threat multiplier, exacerbating instability and mass migration in fragile regions. Climate change can fuel storms, wildfires, and rising seas, threatening military bases and personnel. The military understands that climate resilience is force resilience, as Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said. The Navy is adapting to climate change by incorporating scientists' projections of sea level rise and increasing hurricane strength into facility design. The military's approach to problem-solving and threat reduction provides a model for civil society to address climate change by reducing carbon emissions and adapting to climate change impacts.

**Dii Portal Restores Booking Service for Military Personnel**
The 'Dii' portal in Ukraine has restored the booking service for military personnel earlier than planned. The service was initially set to be unavailable from 9:00 to 18:00 on March 11, but was restored around 17:15. According to the official Telegram channel of Dii, 'The service of booking on the Dii portal has been restored.' The reason for the suspension was technical work on the portal, which only affected the booking service. Dii reported that after the technical work, they 'improved interaction with the Unified Register of State Authorities, Enterprises, Institutions, and Organizations.' Now, representatives of enterprises can book employees in a few clicks. It is worth noting that the government has extended the deadline for rebooking workers of critical enterprises to March 31, 2025. Rebooking allows critical enterprises to update their status according to new conditions, as the Cabinet of Ministers changed the rules. For example, if the decree on criticality was issued in October 2024, it will remain in effect until March 31, 2025. If the status is not updated in time, employees of the enterprise will lose their booking. After updating the criticality status, the enterprise must rebook employees who received booking by February 28, 2025. 'We have improved interaction with the Unified Register of State Authorities, Enterprises, Institutions, and Organizations,' said Dii. 'Now, representatives of enterprises can book employees in a few clicks.' As reported by OBOZ.UA, changes to mobilization legislation also came into effect in March 2025. Now, representatives of some professions can receive a deferment from mobilization if they work in an important industry for the country's economy. At the same time, some other workers may lose their booking.

**California Ends Remote Work: All State Employees Must Return to Offices by July 1, 2025**
California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed an executive order requiring all state employees to return to their offices and work in person, starting from July 1, 2025. This decision aims to strengthen the state's response to emergencies and disasters, where California needs to be prepared to act quickly and effectively. According to Newsom, 'in-person work makes us stronger, period.' The new policy requires at least four days of in-person work per week, with exceptions for employees with special circumstances or needs. This change may be difficult for those who have grown accustomed to remote work, but it is intended to prioritize the collective well-being and prepare the state for critical situations such as wildfires, climate emergencies, and other natural disasters. The state will also focus on filling vacancies in critical areas such as wildfire suppression, extreme weather forecasting, and climate resilience.

**Among the Trump Administration's first Pentagon cuts: Programs that respond to climate change**
The US military is set to cut its budget by 8% over the next five years, with climate change programs being an early target. However, national security experts argue that the Pentagon's climate change efforts are actually focused on warfare and not purely environmental purposes. Tom Ellison of the Center for Climate and Security notes that climate change will impact the military's ability to operate, including extreme heat and pollution affecting troop health, changes in ocean chemistry affecting submarine sonar, and changes in humidity affecting aircraft lift capacity. The military is also building resilience into its infrastructure planning, with some installations expected to be abandoned due to rising sea levels. Despite bipartisan support for the military's climate change efforts, the Defense Department has taken down its official climate resilience portal and has not responded to questions about which climate-related programs will be eliminated.

**Sec. Hegseth: DOD Climate Programs Ripe For Cuts, Military Should Focus On War-Fighting**
Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has suggested cutting Department of Defense (DOD) climate change programs to reduce spending, stating, 'The Defense Department is not in the business of climate change, solving the global thermostat. We’re in the business of deterring and winning wars.' Hegseth believes the Biden administration 'underinvested' in the military, but wants to increase the defense budget. However, the Biden administration has framed climate change as a military priority, with efforts including net-zero installations and leveraging renewable energy technologies. The 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan outlines the military's mitigation goals, including enhancing resilience through renewable energy and microgrids. The proposed defense budget for 2023 included $3.7 billion for 'installation resiliency and adaptation' and $1.5 billion for research and development, operational energy, and contingency preparedness.

**Paris Climate Goals in Jeopardy: A Decade After the Agreement**
The Paris climate goals are in jeopardy, according to a recent report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). The report warned of the need for massive measures to achieve the goals. The Paris Agreement was signed 10 years ago, on December 12, 2015, by 197 countries, aiming to limit global warming to below 2°C and ideally 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. However, the current trend suggests that the goals may be unachievable. Mojib Latif, a renowned German climate researcher, was quoted as saying, 'It's almost laughable that the world politics still holds on to the 1.5°C goal.' A study published in 'Nature Climate Change' in February 2025 found that the 1.5°C threshold may have been exceeded, with a probability of over 99%. The study was conducted by an Austrian-German expert team. The year 2025 has seen a series of record-breaking temperatures, despite the onset of the La Niña cooling phenomenon. The science has reported a never-before-seen acceleration of sea temperature rise from April 2023 to July 2024. Another research group reported that the cracks in the Greenland ice sheet are also increasing. The US has withdrawn from the climate agreement, with a one-year notice period, which is not surprising. According to the Climate Action Tracker, this would add an additional 0.04°C to the 2.7°C that the world is currently heading towards, even if all countries implement their climate protection plans. The UN deadline for submitting new climate goals has expired, and most countries have missed it. However, there is still hope that the new climate protection plans will be a step in the right direction and that the 10-year anniversary of the Paris Climate Agreement will be a reason to celebrate.

**Medicaid portal freeze sparks nationwide confusion with users in all 50 states locked out of accounts**
The Medicaid benefits portal went dark nationwide, leaving recipients confused and without access to their accounts. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt assured that no payments have been affected and that the portal will be back online shortly. Leavitt defended President Trump's plan to audit spending and cut progressive programs, saying the administration wants to be 'good stewards' of taxpayer money. Trump has also promised to release classified documents related to the assassinations of President John F Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy, and Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King. Additionally, he has vowed to reinstate a ban on transgender military service and ban transgender women from competing in women's sports. Trump has also promised to overturn President Biden's climate policies and visit Los Angeles in the wake of recent devastating wildfires.
