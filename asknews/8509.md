He added that Meta's plan is to continue developing the AI assistant before creating a company around it and upgrading the assistant over time. Zuckerberg also mentioned that there will be opportunities for 'paid recommendations' or the launch of a 'subscription service that allows users to pay for more computing power.'

**Meta AI Hits One Billion Users, Doubling Its User Base From 500 Million Monthly Active Users in 2024 - Tekedia**
Meta AI, the company's AI-powered chatbot, has reached one billion active users across its suite of apps, doubling its user base from 500 million monthly active users reported in September 2024. According to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the next phase will focus on deepening user experience through enhanced personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment. Meta AI remains free across Meta's ecosystem, including WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, but the company is eyeing a larger share of the generative AI market led by Google and OpenAI. Meta AI is powered by Llama 4, the company's most advanced large language model to date, offering enhanced reasoning, multilingual support, and improved efficiency. The assistant is designed to remember user-specific details and can pull context from linked Facebook and Instagram accounts to personalize interactions further.

**Meta AI Reaches 1 Billion Active Users, Zuckerberg Announces Plans for Paid Subscription Service**
Meta AI has reached 1 billion active users monthly across all Meta platforms, announced Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, during the annual meeting of shareholders on Wednesday. Zuckerberg emphasized that Meta's focus this year is on deepening the user experience and making Meta AI the leading personal assistant in the market, with a focus on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment. Meta has launched a standalone app for Meta AI in April, as part of the company's efforts to expand the use of its AI assistant. Zuckerberg stated that the company is not currently seeking direct profits from the assistant, but rather focuses on developing and expanding its reach. However, he added, 'As Meta AI evolves over time, there will be opportunities to introduce paid recommendations or offer a paid subscription service that allows users to access higher computing powers.' The company has been exploring the idea of launching a standalone app for Meta AI, with reports suggesting that it would be tested in the second quarter of 2025, similar to competing AI chatbots like ChatGPT from OpenAI. Zuckerberg joked during the meeting, 'It may seem strange that 1 billion monthly users is not a large number for us, but this is the point we have reached so far.' The meeting saw shareholders vote on 14 proposals related to the company's business, including 9 proposals submitted by investors addressing issues such as child protection, carbon emissions, and a proposal regarding Bitcoin's treasury for the company. It's worth noting that the 1 billion active users is double the number of active users in September 2024, which is a significant growth in a short period. One of the proposals submitted by JLens, an investment advisor affiliated with the Anti-Defamation League, calls for an annual report to be prepared explaining how Meta handles content that includes hate speech or anti-Semitism, following changes made by the company in January that relaxed content moderation rules. The preliminary results show that proposals not supported by the company's management are unlikely to pass, including a proposal to end the dual-class share structure, which gives Zuckerberg significant voting power. On the other hand, proposals supported by the management, such as voting on director nominations and stock incentive plans, are expected to pass. The company has announced that the final results of the voting will be published within 4 working days on its website and with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

**Mark Zuckerberg: Over 1 Billion Users Rely on Meta AI**
Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that over 1 billion users rely on Meta AI at least once a month. This was stated by Zuckerberg in a Facebook post in April, where he mentioned that Meta AI is used by around 1 billion active users monthly across various Meta apps. Zuckerberg repeated this statement at Meta's annual meeting for social media networks, shortly after competing companies, including Google, announced the number of users of their AI-based tools. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai stated last week that Google's AI-powered answer service, 'AI Overviews', has more than 1.5 billion users. Pichai added that this means Google is making AI-generated content accessible to more people than any other product in the world. Following the success of Open AI's AI-powered assistant 'Chat GPT', tech giants have invested tens of billions of dollars to provide competing tools. Meta has integrated AI into its various services in an effort to attract the largest number of users to its AI-powered assistant tools. In December 2024, Meta's daily active users reached 3.5 billion across the world. Meta AI is easily accessible in 'WhatsApp' and 'Instagram' through a simple search, without the need to search for it specifically. Meta also launched 'Meta AI' as a separate app last month. Google's AI assistant, 'Gemini', has 400 million active users monthly, while Open AI's 'Chat GPT' has 400 million active users weekly.

**Zuckerberg says Meta AI now has 1 billion monthly users across facebook, whatsApp, and more**
Meta's AI assistant has reached 1 billion monthly active users across its ecosystem of apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. According to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, this milestone is a step toward building Meta AI into a leading 'personal AI.' The assistant is integrated into various Meta platforms, including Ray-Ban smart glasses and Quest headsets, and is growing most rapidly on WhatsApp, where users can directly chat with Meta AI and generate images. While the company stopped short of clarifying what portion of the billion-user figure reflects consistent engagement or deliberate use, Zuckerberg reiterated Meta's longer-term goals for the assistant, including introducing ads and product recommendations within AI responses, and possibly launching a paid tier that offers increased computing power or exclusive features.

**Meta Breaks the Billion Barrier... Zuckerberg Announces Historic Leap Using 'Artificial Intelligence'**
Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and founder of Meta, announced that Meta AI has reached 1 billion active users per month, who use the tool at least once a month. This was announced during Meta's annual meeting in late May 2025. Zuckerberg previously stated on Facebook in April that Meta AI has around 1 billion active users per month across various Meta platforms. This comes in the context of a fierce competition between tech giants to provide advanced artificial intelligence tools, following the great success of OpenAI's ChatGPT since its launch in late 2022. In contrast, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, stated that his service, AI Overviews, which uses artificial intelligence to provide written answers to search queries, has more than 1.5 billion active users per month. Pichai added that Google's AI-powered tool, Gemini, has 400 million active users per month, while OpenAI's tool has 400 million active users per week in February. Meta aims to integrate artificial intelligence into its various services, such as WhatsApp and Instagram, where the AI assistant appears easily and without the need for direct search, in addition to launching a standalone Meta AI app last month. In December 2024, the number of daily users of at least one of Meta's platforms exceeded 3.5 billion users worldwide, reflecting the spread and impact of the company's wide range of services. This expansion in the adoption of artificial intelligence technologies reflects the intense competition between major tech companies to acquire the largest user base and enhance their position in the field of generative artificial intelligence.

**Google Reveals Gemini's 350 Million Active Users Worldwide**
Google has revealed for the first time that its new AI assistant, Gemini, has reached 350 million active users worldwide. This number was leaked for the first time through a report by The Information, showing an astonishing growth rate. In October 2024, Gemini had only 9 million daily users, but just a few months later, the number jumped to 35 million daily active users, making it one of the fastest-growing rates among AI platforms. Google's strategy of integrating Gemini directly into its most popular services, such as Samsung phones, Google Workspace, and the Chrome browser, has made it easier for users to access the assistant daily without needing to download a separate app. Despite the significant growth, Gemini still lags behind the top spot in the chatbot market, with Google revealing during the same court hearing that ChatGPT had around 600 million active users in March, while Mark Zuckerberg revealed in September that Meta AI had 500 million users. Experts in the industry predict that the reliance on AI robots will continue to expand in 2025 and beyond, with estimates suggesting that the global market for this technology reached $7.76 billion in 2024, with a 23.3% annual growth rate between 2025 and 2030. The value of the AI market as a whole is expected to exceed $190 billion next year, further solidifying the presence of Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI in our daily lives, not just in conversation, but also in work, education, creativity, and personal assistance.

**Meta Tests New Feature For Threads That Lets Users Follow the Same Creators as Their X Account**
Meta is testing a new feature on Threads that allows users to follow the same creators they follow on X. This feature aims to help users connect with creators on Threads and access the same people and chats that matter to them. The company is currently experimenting with the feature, which was first spotted by Jane Manchun Wong, a former Meta worker. According to Wong, the feature allows users to import their following list from X to Threads. While it's unclear how Meta will match creators from X to profiles on Threads, the company is optimistic that it will work well, especially for popular creators. This feature is part of Meta's efforts to make Threads a rival to X, which has seen steady growth, with over 320 million monthly active users, up from 300 million in December 2024.
