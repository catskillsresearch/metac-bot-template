**Nearly 40% of the world's glaciers are doomed to disappear, scientists warn**
Scientists warn that nearly 40% of the world's glaciers are doomed to disappear, even if global temperatures stop rising immediately. According to a new study, glaciers will eventually lose 39% of their mass compared to 2020, a trend that is irreversible and will likely contribute to a 113mm rise in global sea levels. The loss increases to 76% if the world continues with its current climate policies, which are unlikely to keep global warming below 1.5°C. 'The difference between being able to adapt to the loss of the glacier and not is the 39% versus the 76%,' said James Kirkham, a glaciologist at the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative. Although the study offers a bleak prognosis for the world's glaciers, its authors are trying to 'give a message of hope,' said Lilian Schuster, a researcher at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, who co-directed the study. 'With the study, we want to show that with every tenth of a degree less of global warming, we can preserve the ice of the glaciers,' she said. The study used eight existing glacier models and made simulations that extended over centuries, predicting how each glacier would evolve over time. The use of multiple models produced a wide range of results, but all showed the same trend: as global warming increases, more glacier mass is lost.

**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**2.8 Billion People Worldwide Lack Access to Suitable Housing, UN Report Finds**
According to the United Nations' Habitat Programme annual report for 2024, approximately 2.8 billion people worldwide lack access to suitable housing. Of these, 1.1 billion people live in poor or informal settlements, which is 'the main challenge for sustainable urban development', as stated in the report. Around 90% of the population of these poor settlements live in Africa and Asia, where there is a shortage of housing units of around 170 million. Anna Claudia Robisch, Executive Director of the United Nations' Habitat Programme, said in the report that 'climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters continue to force millions of people to leave their homes in search of safety, stability, and better living conditions.' The report estimates that 318 million people are homeless, equivalent to the population of the United States. Globally, 'one in four people lives in conditions that harm their health, safety, and well-being', according to the United Nations' Habitat Programme report. Only 14% of urban residents and 40% of rural residents have access to clean water, and two in five people do not have access to sanitation services. The report states that 'safe and managed sanitation is a fundamental element of human development and is often used as a measure of progress in reducing poverty, diseases, and premature deaths.' Anna Claudia Robisch called for 'rethinking urban policies, land use, laws, and financing to prioritize housing and basic services as key drivers of climate action and sustainable development.' By 2040, it is expected that 2 billion urban residents will be exposed to significant temperature increases. The United Nations' Habitat Programme member states adopted the programme's strategic plan for 2026-2029, which focuses on access to housing, land, and basic services, such as clean water and sanitation.

**220,000 new Omani jobs required by 2030 to meet growth targets: IMF**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected that the Omani economy will need to generate over 220,000 new jobs for its national workforce by 2032 to meet the country's growth demands. The report, 'Labour Market Dynamics in Oman,' highlights the need for a shift away from relying on the public sector for employment, as it is no longer feasible amidst efforts to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability. According to the report, the private sector remains dominated by expatriates, with 86% of the workforce, and wages significantly lower on average, particularly in low- and medium-skilled jobs. The IMF notes that Oman's education system is not aligned with the needs of a diversifying economy, causing a discrepancy in the skills required by the private sector and those available in the labour market. The report also highlights the low female labour participation rate, which stands at 32%, and limited mobility for expatriate workers as key restraints to the labour market. The IMF has hailed the new Social Protection and Labour Laws as a step in the right direction, while recommending complementary policies to address the longstanding challenges in the Omani labour market, including strengthening active labor market programmes, adopting dual-education systems, and accelerating efforts to increase the participation of women in the workforce.

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**Scientists Predict Sea Level Rise and Irreversible Consequences Due to Glacier Melting**
A group of international scientists from Switzerland, the US, Belgium, and other countries have concluded that if current warming trends continue, three-quarters of the Earth's glacier mass will disappear by 2100, causing a 23 cm sea level rise and other irreversible consequences. The study, published in the journal Science, highlights the situation in Alaska, where up to 69% of the glaciers could disappear, despite the region having the third-largest glacier reserve in the world (16,246 gigatons). Even in the best-case scenario, Alaska would lose 41% of its ice, and global losses would be 47%. Unlike previous studies, which were limited to 2100, the new modeling considers the period until the glaciers reach a state of 'equilibrium' - in the case of Alaska, this would take 330 years. The study involved 21 scientists from 10 countries, using eight different climate models to analyze 200,000 glaciers. The scientists believe that even if warming stops, glaciers will continue to melt for hundreds of years due to 'climate inertia'. They consider the current decade critical for taking measures to preserve the Earth's cryosphere.

**Scientists in Panic: Planet Faces Catastrophic Consequences Due to Ice Loss**
A group of international scientists from Switzerland, the US, Belgium, and other countries have concluded that if the current rate of warming continues, three-quarters of the Earth's ice mass will disappear by 2100, resulting in a 23 cm rise in sea levels and other irreversible consequences. The study, published in the Science journal, notes that the situation in Alaska is particularly alarming, where up to 69% of the ice could disappear, despite the region having the third-largest ice reserve in the world (16,246 gigatons). Even under an optimal scenario, Alaska would lose 41% of its ice, with global losses reaching 47%. Unlike previous studies, which were limited to 2100, the new modeling considers a period of up to 330 years to reach 'equilibrium' for Alaska's ice. The study involved 21 scientists from 10 countries, using eight different climate models to analyze 200,000 ice formations. The researchers emphasize that even if warming stops, ice will continue to melt for hundreds of years due to 'climate inertia.' They stress that the current decade is critical for taking measures to preserve the Earth's cryosphere.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**40% of glaciers "are doomed" even if we were to stop global warming and sea levels would rise by 10 centimeters**
Even if global warming were to stop, 39% of the world's glacier mass would still disappear, and sea levels would rise by over 10 centimeters, according to a study led by Harry Zekollari. The study, which simulated the effects of current climate policies, found that glaciers would continue to melt for centuries, even without additional warming. 'Most glacier studies stop at the year 2100, which is problematic when simulating the long-term impact of current climate policies, given the glaciers' long-term response over time,' explains Harry Zekollari. The study also found that saltwater can more easily penetrate freshwater aquifers, affecting the supply in coastal areas. 'The decisions we make today will resonate for centuries,' Zekollari notes. The study was conducted within the framework of the Glacier Model Intercomparison Project (GlacierMIP) and coordinated by the Climate and Cryosphere Project (CliC) of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP).

**Not just science fiction: Tomorrow.Bio has preserved 20 people and 10 pets for future revival**
Tomorrow.Bio, a company founded by Dr Emil Kendziorra and engineer Fernando Azevedo Pinheiro in 2020, has preserved 20 people and 10 pets for future revival through long-term cryopreservation. The company's goal is to revive individuals when medical technologies have advanced. Cryopreservation involves exposing the body to extremely low temperatures to halt biological processes. Tomorrow.Bio operates a fleet of cryo-ambulances that retrieve the deceased and initiate the cooling process. The company has recently completed a €5 million equity round to scale its operations and has announced plans to open a second storage location. Dr Kendziorra stated, 'We're on track to reach 1,000 signed-up individuals across the US and Europe -- a milestone we're proud of, but still small in context.' The company has made significant developments in cryogenic research, including consistently achieving ice-free preservation and publishing a roadmap with leading researchers. Kendziorra emphasized, 'The next frontier is proving that our method preserves these synaptic structures, aligning with modern neuroscience standards.'

**Cryopreservation: A Second Chance at Life?**
The concept of cryopreservation, or freezing a body at -196 degrees Celsius, has sparked debate about the possibility of reviving the dead. According to Ramón Risco, a scientist from the University of Seville, 'it is only a matter of time' before cryopreservation becomes a reality. Currently, there are over 2,000 bodies cryopreserved worldwide, including a 14-year-old British girl who wrote a letter to a judge in 2015 requesting a second chance at life. Risco believes that it is possible to revive cryopreserved bodies, citing an experiment where worms were successfully revived after being cryopreserved. However, there are many questions and uncertainties surrounding the process, including the potential effects on the revived bodies and the ethics of reviving a person in a world that may be vastly different from the one they left behind. The cost of cryopreservation is also a significant factor, with prices ranging from 200,000 to 300,000 euros. As Adolfo Arjona notes, 'it is only a matter of time' before cryopreservation becomes a reality, but there are many challenges to overcome before it can be achieved.

**Cryopreservation: The Quest for Immortality**
Scientists are working on a way to bring people back to life through a process called cryopreservation. This involves freezing a body in a tank filled with liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees Celsius, with the goal of reviving it in the future. Several companies around the world are working on this technology, including the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona, USA. According to the article, there are currently 200 people who have undergone cryopreservation, including a 14-year-old British girl who died of cancer in 2015 and had her body cryopreserved. Ramón Risco, a scientist at the University of Seville, has successfully revived a microscopical worm that had been cryopreserved and believes that this technology could be applied to humans in the future. However, the article also raises concerns about the ethics of cryopreservation and the potential consequences of reviving a person after a long period of time. 'It's only a matter of time' before this technology becomes a reality, says Risco, but 'we need to control how the cooling and mass transfer process is carried out to avoid the formation of ice, which is our greatest enemy when it comes to cryopreserving a body.'

**The hidden flaw in cryonics that could ruin your shot at living forever | BBC Science Focus Magazine**
Cryonics, the process of freezing and storing human remains for potential revival in the future, has gained renewed interest. However, experts warn that the process is still plagued by significant hurdles, including irreversible cellular damage, especially to the brain, caused by freezing. The human body is a complex system sustained by delicate biochemical processes, and freezing can cause irreparable harm. Even with advanced technology, reviving a frozen body is not like 'flicking a switch' but rather like trying to unscramble an egg. The brain, in particular, is vulnerable to damage due to its intricate structure and high metabolic demands. Additionally, rebuilding neuronal connections and memories is a daunting task, akin to rewriting a burned book from ashes. Cryonics relies heavily on optimism, but experts caution that people should think twice before risking their lives on a very unlikely outcome. As one expert notes, 'it's a process with many significant hurdles to overcome before it could be said to 'work', in any meaningful way.'

**Man's Body Frozen in Hopes of Future Revival**
A 24-year-old man from England, who had been diagnosed with a condition known as 'cryonic', was transported 5,790 kilometers to Michigan, USA, where he was placed in a 'deep freezer' in the hopes of being revived in the future. The man had signed up for a 'long-term cryonic preservation' program in Michigan before his death, which involves freezing the body at extremely low temperatures in the hopes that future technology will be able to revive it. The process involves cooling the body to -196°C using liquid nitrogen, and the man's body was transported to the Cryonics Institute in Michigan, where it was placed in a cryostate. The institute's president, Dennis Kowalski, described the process as 'a journey to a future hospital' and said that the goal is to revive the person in the future using advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and nanotechnology. However, critics have described the process as 'pseudoscience' and 'a waste of money', and some have questioned the ethics of freezing the body of a person who has already died. Despite these criticisms, the Cryonics Institute has over 250 members, including people from all walks of life, and is one of the largest cryonic preservation facilities in the world.

A British man, known as 'patient 268', has had his body frozen and flown to the US in the hope of being revived in the future. The 3,700-mile journey took 16 days, and the body was cooled to well below freezing over a 25-hour period before being stored indefinitely at the Cryonics Institute in Michigan. The UK has the largest number of Cryonics Institute members outside of the US, with 128 people signed up for various 'suspension' options. As CI president Dennis Kowalksi said, 'cryonics is a gamble that may result in an ambulance ride to a future hospital.' The institute has two sites in Michigan housing over 250 patients who have paid for the outside shot at a revival.

**Simple Trick to Prevent Myopia: Expert Shares 20/20/20 Rule**
According to the World Health Organization, approximately 2.6 billion people suffer from myopia, and it is estimated that by 2050, half of the world's population will be myopic. A recent study found that 20.3% of children between 5 and 7 years old are myopic, a percentage that is expected to reach 30% by 2030. Dr. Cristina Álvarez Peregrino, a researcher and expert in vision science, recommends the '20/20/20' rule to prevent myopia progression. This involves taking breaks every 20 minutes of near vision work, looking away for 20 seconds at a distance of approximately 6 meters. Dr. Álvarez also suggests using screens at a distance of at least the length of the forearm to reduce eye strain. However, the best way to reduce the risk of myopia is to limit screen time and engage in outdoor activities.

**One-Third of Young People Worldwide May Be Overweight or Obese by 2050**
According to a study, if current trends continue, approximately one-third of children and young adults worldwide will be overweight or obese by 2050. The highest percentage of obese individuals among 5- to 24-year-olds is expected in the Arab region (North Africa and the Middle East), with 20-23% of young people in Germany potentially being affected. This will lead to more heart, breathing, and fertility problems, diabetes, cancer, and mental health issues, warns the team. The study's authors attribute the development to changes in media usage and the shift to Western diets. Without corresponding political measures and reforms, it is expected that there will be approximately 3.8 billion adults and 746 million children and adolescents with overweight or obesity by 2050. Jessica Kerr, lead author of the study, warns of 'monumental societal failures and a lack of coordinated global measures.' Some countries have already taken action, such as banning sugary drinks in schools and changing school meals and physical education. 'The extent of the epidemic is so great that solutions in the form of public health measures must be found,' says Thorkild Sørensen of the University of Copenhagen. It is still unclear which measures will be both feasible and effective.

**Global breast cancer cases to surge by almost 40 percent by 2050, warns WHO**
According to a new study published in Nature Medicine, the number of breast cancer cases and deaths worldwide is expected to surge by 38% and 68%, respectively, by 2050. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) estimates that 3.2 million new cases and 1.1 million deaths will occur annually if current trends continue. Dr. Joanne Kim, an IARC scientist, warns that 'every minute, four women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide and one woman dies from the disease, and these statistics are worsening.' The study suggests that countries with low Human Development Indexes (HDI) will carry a disproportionate burden of the disease. Factors contributing to the rise in breast cancer cases include changes in reproductive patterns, urbanization, and population expansion. The study's authors emphasize that approximately 25% of breast cancer cases can be avoided through lifestyle changes, such as reducing alcohol consumption, maintaining a healthy weight, and increasing physical activity.

**German Start-Up Offers to Freeze People for a Second Chance at Life**
A German start-up, Tomorrow.Bio, is offering to freeze people for a second chance at life for $200,000. The process involves cooling the body to -196°C and storing it in a cryogenic facility in Rafz, Switzerland. The company's founder, Emil Kendziorra, a former cancer researcher, believes that the idea of reviving the dead is realistic, saying, 'Many things that don't work today simply haven't been researched enough.' However, many scientists are skeptical, including Clive Coen, a professor of neuroscience at King's College London, who says that the method is unrealistic because cell decay begins immediately after death. Despite this, the company is optimistic, citing research on worms and rats that have been successfully revived after cryopreservation. Kendziorra sees cryonics as a breakthrough on par with organ transplantation, which was once considered impossible. However, there are also ethical questions, such as who is responsible for long-term storage and revival, and how to secure the preservation of the body over decades or centuries. The company plans to expand its services to the US this year and aims to develop reversible cryopreservation by 2028.
