**UN chief says Gaza entering 'cruellest phase' of war as Palestinians starve**
The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that Gaza is entering the 'cruellest phase' of the conflict, with Palestinians facing the risk of famine due to Israel's escalating military campaign and prolonged blockade. Guterres stated that the aid allowed into Gaza is a mere 'teaspoon' of what is needed, and that the entire population is facing the risk of famine. He also condemned the scale of human suffering and the Israeli campaign's 'atrocious levels of death and destruction.' The UN chief emphasized that without rapid, reliable, safe, and sustained aid access, more people will die, and the long-term consequences on the population will be profound. Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud reported from Gaza City, stating that Palestinians are struggling to find food and drinking water, and that the aid allowed in the past two days is not enough to address the deepening humanitarian crisis. Meanwhile, Israeli attacks have killed at least 76 Palestinians across Gaza since Friday, and at least 53,822 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 7, 2023.

**India and Pakistan on the Brink of War: Diplomacy Is the Only Way Out**
India and Pakistan are on the brink of war after a series of airstrikes and military operations in Kashmir, resulting in at least 31 deaths and dozens injured. The crisis has triggered a humanitarian emergency, with families fleeing their homes, schools and hospitals shut down, and a critical shortage of medicine, food, and clean water. Humanitarian organizations are calling for immediate action, including the establishment of humanitarian corridors and the delivery of aid. The India-Pakistan crisis is unfolding against a backdrop of global instability, with 59 armed conflicts recorded worldwide in 2023, resulting in over 170,000 deaths. The international community must act decisively to support a lasting ceasefire through diplomatic engagement, rather than escalation. As one aid worker with the Red Crescent said, 'We need humanitarian corridors now, not next week.'

**Putin Remains Committed to Victory in Ukraine, US Intelligence Says**
According to the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Russian President Vladimir Putin remains committed to achieving a decisive victory in Ukraine and is willing to use military force at least until 2025. The DIA's annual report, 'Global Threat Assessment - 2025', states that Putin views the war in Ukraine as an existential struggle against the West, which will determine Russia's place in the world, his own power, and his historical legacy. The report also notes that Russia is 'almost certain' to avoid direct conflict with NATO, as it believes it cannot win a conventional war against the alliance. However, Moscow remains capable of using asymmetric tactics, including cyber and information campaigns, and its strategic nuclear forces pose an existential threat to the US. The report predicts that the war in Ukraine will continue to favor Russia, with the country likely to make significant gains on the battlefield by 2025, unless there is a negotiated settlement or significant Western aid. The DIA estimates that Russia has suffered significant losses, including over 10,000 ground vehicles, 3,000 tanks, and 250 aircraft and helicopters, as well as over 170,000 casualties. The report also notes that Russia plans to spend at least $150 billion on defense and security in 2025, a 19% increase from 2024, and that it is developing its electronic warfare capabilities to counter Western technology. Additionally, the use of drones in the conflict has increased significantly, as they have proven to be an effective tool for identifying enemy movements, providing artillery support, and conducting strikes at close and long range.

**Gaza Faces Worst Humanitarian Crisis as Israeli Aggression Continues**
Gaza is experiencing one of the most intense phases of the Israeli aggression since the start of the war on October 7, 2023, with escalating airstrikes and ground incursions, and continued targeting of homes and infrastructure across the strip. The military operations have been accompanied by Israeli assertions of their intention to 'continue fighting until achieving their goals', despite international warnings of an impending humanitarian catastrophe. According to Palestinian Health Minister Maged Abu Ramadan, 29 children have died from starvation over the past two days, with thousands more at risk. He commented on UN estimates of 14,000 infant deaths, saying the number 'is very realistic, and possibly lower than the reality'. This comes as the blockade and ban on aid continue, with only one truck of medicine entering the strip in exchange for 90 trucks of food over two days. In contrast to the humanitarian crisis, 80 countries issued a joint statement to the UN, warning that Gaza is experiencing 'its worst humanitarian crisis', and emphasizing that 'protecting civilians in conflicts is not a choice, but a legal and moral obligation'. The Gaza government's media office reported that the number of deaths due to starvation and lack of medicine has reached 300 cases, including 58 deaths from malnutrition, 26 kidney patients, and 300 cases of miscarriage over 80 days of the blockade. Israeli reports also indicate that the Israeli military's plan after five days of launching Operation 'Arabats Jeddon' represents a new phase of the war of extermination on the Gaza Strip, targeting control of 75% of the strip's area and continuing to cut it off, and turning it into 'small Gaza'.

**What war hysteria hides: deaths, destruction, disinformation**
The recent military escalation between India and Pakistan has been accompanied by a surge in misinformation and disinformation. Data shows that citizens, particularly from border areas, have intensely searched for war-related news. However, many online searches led to events that never actually happened, such as the 'destruction of Karachi port' and an Indian drone striking an area near a mosque in Islamabad. Fact-checkers have debunked these fake narratives, revealing the extent and nature of fake news in circulation. The human cost of conflict is also being obscured, with over 13,140 defence personnel killed and 26,500 wounded in past wars and operations. India has consistently been among the world's top arms importers, with a significant financial cost. War also places a heavy burden on a country's economy, with sanctions often triggering a financial downturn. For example, Russia's GDP fell to -2.1% in 2022 following its war with Ukraine, while Ukraine's GDP plummeted to -28.8% in the same year. 'The harshest reality of war is its toll on human lives,' said a fact-checker. 'We need to focus on the facts and not get caught up in hyper-nationalistic claims that often call for war.'

**2025 India-Pakistan War: Nuclear Tensions, Drone Strikes & Global Concerns**
The 2025 India-Pakistan War has escalated into a full-blown conflict, with both nations exchanging fire and causing significant civilian casualties. India has launched airstrikes and missile attacks on Pakistan, claiming to target terror camps, but independent sources and on-ground reports reveal that the targets were often civilian areas. Pakistan has retaliated with precision strikes on Indian army bunkers and deep into Indian territory. The conflict has resulted in a devastating humanitarian crisis, with over 120,000 civilians displaced in Pakistan and thousands living in army-run shelters in India. The international community has been criticized for its limited involvement, with the United Nations issuing appeals for restraint and China and Russia taking neutral stances. The war has also raised concerns about the targeting of religious sites, with at least seven mosques destroyed or severely damaged by Indian missile strikes. Both governments are under domestic pressure, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi facing criticism for endangering national security and suppressing dissent in India, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif rallying public support but dealing with economic instability and logistical strain in Pakistan. A path to peace is yet untraveled, but analysts argue that international accountability and verifiable transparency are key to de-escalation and a potential ceasefire.

**Children Suffer Most in Wars Across the Globe**
Children are suffering the most in wars across the globe, from Gaza to Kiev and Kashmir. Every day, dozens of children are killed, injured, or orphaned by bombs. Recent photos from various agencies show the devastating impact of these conflicts. The world is watching the escalating tensions between nuclear powers India and Pakistan. India has been accused of having a 'terrorist infrastructure' in Pakistan, and in response, Pakistan has been bombed, resulting in the deaths of 31 civilians, including 5 residents and 2 mosques. Pakistan has also been accused of shooting down 5 Indian planes and taking some soldiers hostage. The Indian attack has raised the risk of a full-scale war, with the Foreign Ministry condemning the move as 'provocative' and 'targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure.' The UN Security Council reports that over 2,500 children have been killed in Ukraine since February 2022. In Gaza, Israel's 'genocide' has targeted all age groups, from unborn fetuses to 18-year-olds, resulting in the deaths of over 17,000 children since October 7, 2023. Similar scenes have been repeated in conflicts between India and Pakistan, with photos of injured children in the affected areas drawing attention. A Palestinian journalist, Yahya Subeyh, was killed in an Israeli attack on Gaza, leaving behind a newborn baby. Photos of the journalist's lifeless body, dressed in the same clothes as in a photo with his baby, have gone viral on social media.

**56 Active Armed Conflicts Around the World: A Global Crisis**
There are currently 56 active armed conflicts around the world, the highest number since World War II, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace. The new military escalation between India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed countries that have never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, has raised the risk of a global-scale conflict. Cecilia Degl'Innocenti, in an analysis on the program 'Desde el canil', noted that the conflicts involve more than 90 countries, a number not seen since World War II. The Pope Francis, in an interview, observed that the world is 'in the third world war in pieces'. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has deepened concerns, altered the global economy, and marked the return of large-scale land combat in Europe, something unprecedented since 1945. 'Putin broke with the international order that has been maintained since World War II', said Degl'Innocenti. The conflict has left millions of displaced people and opened the door to new geopolitical demands, such as the cession of mineral resources to the United States in exchange for military support, evidence that the NATO's multilateral umbrella could 'weaken before political changes', argued Degl'Innocenti, referring to Donald Trump and his repeated attempts to distance himself from the bloc. The Middle East is burning with the siege of Gaza. The Israeli offensive after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, has caused over 60,000 deaths. '70% are women and children', specified the journalist. In parallel, Iran has deployed its regional influence through groups in Yemen and Lebanon. 'The war for resources and the weight of religion have turned the Middle East into the most unstable geopolitical heart of the 21st century', mentioned. In the same line, Syria faces a period of political instability after 13 years of civil war. In Africa, the case of Sudan represents the current humanitarian disaster. 'Twenty-five million people suffer from hunger', said. In Asia, the tension between India and Pakistan has revived the nuclear fear and put the dilemma of 'Mutual Assured Destruction' to the test. Argentina and Ecuador, the two economies that will grow in 2025 in Latin America according to the IMF.

**India and Pakistan on Brink of Nuclear War: A Growing Concern**
The conflict between India and Pakistan has raised concerns of a potential nuclear war. Both countries possess approximately 150 nuclear warheads. The situation has drawn attention from the media, which previously focused on the war in Ukraine. The late Vladimir Zhirinovsky predicted a war between India and Pakistan, resulting in the deaths of 200 million people and a billion refugees. However, not all of his predictions came true. Interestingly, Zhirinovsky was not the only one to predict the start of this war. In 2019, Princeton University forecasted that a large-scale war would begin in 2025 with an attack on Indian government officials. This prediction came true on April 22, when a terrorist attack occurred, resulting in the deaths of dozens of people. India claimed that the attack was orchestrated by Pakistan. According to Andrey Dobrov, 'it is a serious concern for the world that the conflict between India and Pakistan is escalating.'

**Zhirinovsky's 20-Year-Old Prediction of War Between India and Pakistan**
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a Russian politician, made several predictions about future events, including a massive war between India and Pakistan that could result in 200 million deaths. He warned that climate change would lead to mass migration, conflicts, and a large number of casualties. According to Zhirinovsky, global instability could claim up to 200 million lives. He also predicted that due to climate change, some regions would become uninhabitable, leading to people leaving their homes, borders being under pressure, and states facing new challenges. These processes, he said, would inevitably lead to armed conflicts. He believed that Israel and Palestine would be among the first to clash, followed by India and Pakistan, which is currently experiencing an escalation. He predicted a massive war in the Middle East, with millions of Palestinians, Syrians, Lebanese, and others being affected. He also warned of a possible nuclear escalation between nuclear powers, including India and Pakistan, resulting in catastrophic losses. He directly stated that the world is on the brink of a third world war. His predictions have resurfaced after a recent terrorist attack in Kashmir, which killed 28 people, and has further strained relations between India and Pakistan.

**Conflict Escalation: Israel and Hamas on Brink of New Round of Violence**
A new round of high-intensity conflict is expected between Israeli and Palestinian civilians. The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which has been in place since January 19, 2025, appears to be coming to an end. The conflict has already resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians in the previous round of attacks. Hamas has been using civilians as human shields and taking Israeli and Western hostages as a strategic tool for negotiations. The group has not yet resorted to executing hostages, unlike other terrorist organizations in the Middle East. Israel has stated that the military campaign will continue until all hostages are released and Hamas is significantly weakened. Hamas has accused Israel of breaking the ceasefire and putting the remaining hostages at risk. The conflict has been ongoing for over 15 months, sparked by Hamas' terrorist attack on October 7, 2023. The Norwegian politician Mahmoud Farahmand notes that Hamas has used civilians as a means to gain international attention and sympathy, and that the group's strategy of using human shields has complicated Israel's military operations and maximized civilian casualties. Farahmand suggests that Hamas' goal is to create division within Israel and undermine its willingness to wage war. The conflict is expected to continue, with the humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian civilian population likely to worsen.

**20,000 Nigerians Killed In 4 Years – Report**
A new report by Nextier, a non-governmental organisation, has revealed that over 20,000 people were killed or injured in violent incidents across Nigeria between 2020 and 2024. The report, titled 'Mutations of Terror and Conflict,' highlighted several external factors that could shape Nigeria's security landscape in 2025, including the war in Sudan, the expansion of terrorist groups across the Sahel, and Russia's growing influence in Africa. The report also warned that illegal mining in the North West region was fueling armed banditry and highlighted a surge in kidnappings, with 11,002 abductions recorded between June 2020 and December 2024. Dr Ndubuisi Nwokolo, Nextier Managing Partner, said, 'The findings were based on data from the organisation’s Violent Conflicts Database.' The report urged the Nigerian government to strengthen both military and non-military approaches to tackling terrorism and banditry, and warned that a newly emerging terrorist group, Lakurawa, could further escalate violence in 2025.

**Niger: Escalating Violence and Humanitarian Crisis**
The military government in Niger, led by General Abdourahamane Tchiani, has failed to contain the escalating violence in the country, despite promising to restore security and stability in 2023. The situation has worsened, with a significant increase in terrorist attacks and a deterioration in humanitarian conditions. According to data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, the number of civilian casualties has increased dramatically, with approximately 1,600 civilians killed by ISIS-affiliated extremists compared to 770 civilians killed before 2023. The Islamic Emirate of the Niger, affiliated with al-Qaeda, has also escalated its activities in the Tilitabiri region, near the borders with Burkina Faso and Mali. As a result, its activities have spread to new areas, including the city of Dosso in southern Niger, threatening the country's borders with Benin and Nigeria. The terrorists have adopted unconventional tactics, targeting commercial and military convoys using motorcycles, making it difficult for the military to pursue them. The targeting of food convoys has also hindered the delivery of essential supplies, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. In December 2024, terrorists killed 21 people in the village of Liberi and 18 people in the village of Kokoro, amidst looting and burning of homes, further exacerbating the internal displacement crisis. The escalating violence has had a devastating impact on the humanitarian situation, with thousands of people forced to flee their homes in search of safety, putting pressure on relatively safe areas. The targeting of food and commercial convoys threatens the delivery of essential supplies, putting the country at risk of a humanitarian catastrophe. The population lives in a state of daily fear due to the lack of effective protection by the army, affecting their mental and social stability.

**Syria's Escalating Security Situation: A Threat to Political Transition**
Concerns are growing about the impact of the deteriorating security situation in Syria on efforts to find a political solution, as Damascus has become a focal point of regional and international attention. Diplomatic delegations have flooded the city in an attempt to explore the new administration's views on Syria's future and present proposals, including lifting sanctions. The Syrian Civil Defense announced that 14 women and one man were killed, and 15 women were injured, some seriously, in the initial toll of a car bomb explosion in Manbij. The explosion occurred near a car carrying farm workers on a main road in the outskirts of the city, which is located east of Aleppo. This is the sixth such attack in areas controlled by 'National Army' factions, raising questions about how the administration will handle these events and whether the solution will be purely military. The city of Manbij witnessed a car bomb explosion on February 1, 2025, which killed 9 people, including 'National Army' members, and injured 15 others, including civilians and children. Syria experienced a significant security escalation in January 2025, with various incidents including airstrikes, armed clashes, arrests, bombings, and military incursions. These events have been concentrated mainly in the northern and eastern parts of the country, while some other areas have experienced scattered disturbances related to military activity and clashes between different factions. This reflects a complex security reality, with ongoing conflict between competing parties, and a lack of serious political solutions to end the chaos. The transitional phase is threatened by several dangers on the security, political, and social levels. The possibility of the resurgence of ISIS activity in Syria has been mentioned again. Analysts emphasize that the future of the new Syria remains unclear, but it holds the possibility of ending the conflict if challenges are handled wisely. They note that the transitional phase requires a genuine will for national reconciliation. Observers believe that a national Syrian project will not be formulated without consensus among the Syrian community on the terms of coexistence. Various components of the Syrian community have called for holding a national dialogue conference to determine the roadmap for the Syrian state, following the fall of President Bashar al-Assad's regime, and this conference is a commitment announced by the new administration in Syria. The UN Special Envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, has warned of 'mistakes' that could hinder the transition process in Syria after the fall of Bashar al-Assad. Pedersen said in a meeting with the UN Security Council: 'The decisions taken today will determine the long-term future.' He added: 'There are real opportunities and risks,' calling on Syria and the international community to 'succeed in the next phase.'
