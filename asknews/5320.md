**China Warns US Not to 'Play with Fire' Over Taiwan**
China warned the US not to 'play with fire' over Taiwan, in response to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's accusations that Beijing is preparing an 'imminent' invasion of the island and seeking to alter the regional balance in Asia. 'The Taiwan issue is purely internal to China. No foreign country has the right to interfere,' said the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson in a statement issued after midnight. Beijing expressed its 'firm opposition' and 'deep discontent' with what it considered a 'provocative and inciting' speech by Hegseth, who on Saturday at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore warned that the Chinese military 'practices daily' a possible invasion of Taiwan and hinted at the supposed intention to do so before 2027. 'Let me be clear: any attempt by the Communist Party (Chinese) to conquer Taiwan by force will result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world (...) The Chinese threat is real. And it could be imminent,' emphasized the Pentagon chief. China also accused the US of fomenting confrontation between blocs, deploying offensive weapons in the South China Sea, and 'turning the region into a powder keg.' The spokesperson warned the US not to 'harbor illusions' about using the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China, and announced a formal protest had been lodged with Washington. 'China manages its differences through dialogue and in accordance with the law,' the spokesperson said.

**China Criticizes US Defense Minister Hegseth Over Taiwan Comments**
China has criticized US Defense Minister Pete Hegseth for his comments on the situation in the Indo-Pacific region. Hegseth had previously described China as a threat in the region and warned of a possible military intervention in Taiwan. The Chinese government accused the US of undermining peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region. China also warned the US against interfering in the Taiwan issue, calling it an 'internal affair'. Hegseth stated that 'China's army is training for the worst-case scenario' and that the threat from China is real and could happen at any moment. Chinese President Xi Jinping has allegedly ordered his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. Hegseth's comments were his strongest since taking office in January. Chinese Admiral Hu Gangfeng, leader of the Chinese delegation at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, called Hegseth's accusations 'unfounded' and aimed at provoking conflicts and destabilizing the Asian-Pacific region. Hegseth had also urged Asian allies to increase their defense spending in the face of the 'threat from communist China'. China wants to become the dominant power in Asia and control the entire region, he said. The US does not seek a conflict with China, but will not be pushed out of the region and will not allow its allies and partners to be subordinated.

**China Warns US Against 'Playing with Fire' Over Taiwan**
China has warned the United States against 'playing with fire' over Taiwan, after US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's comments at a security forum in Singapore. China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement: 'The US should not try to use the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China, and should not play with fire.' The statement added that China had made 'official protests' to the US over Austin's comments. Austin had warned on Saturday that China's military is 'training for the real mission' while preparing for a potential invasion of Taiwan. He said: 'It is well known that the People's Liberation Army has been ordered to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027. The PLA is building its military forces to do so and is training every day for the real mission.' Austin urged US allies in Asia to increase their military spending quickly in the face of the Chinese threat. He warned that China is 'clearly and confidently preparing to use military force to change the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region.' Austin said at the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore: 'The threat posed by China is real and potentially imminent.' He added that China 'aspires to dominance and control' in Asia. Austin emphasized that the US has 'returned' to the Indo-Pacific region, and that it will 'stay' there. He said: 'The US is proud to have returned to the Indo-Pacific region, and we are here to stay.' The region is 'our top priority' for the US, he added. China considers Taiwan a part of its territory and has vowed to reunify with the island by force if necessary. It has increased its military and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan to assert its claims, including by conducting more frequent and intense military exercises around the island. Taiwan's government rejects China's claims of sovereignty, insisting that only the Taiwanese people have the right to decide their own future.

**US and China Engage in Confrontational Rhetoric Over Taiwan**
The rhetoric has become sharper and the tone more confrontational between Washington and Beijing in Singapore, as they accuse each other of destabilizing the Indo-Pacific region. At the center of the dispute is Taiwan and the question of how long peace will last. The Chinese government has strongly criticized US Defense Minister Pete Hegseth's comments on the situation in the Indo-Pacific region, accusing the US of undermining 'peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region' and turning it into a 'powder keg'. Beijing also warned the US government against interfering in the Taiwan issue. Hegseth had warned of a possible Chinese military intervention in Taiwan at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore, saying 'China's army is training for the worst-case scenario.' 'We will not sugarcoat it - the threat from China is real, and it could happen at any moment,' he added. Chinese Admiral Hu Gangfeng countered that Hegseth's accusations were 'unfounded' and aimed at 'provoking conflicts' and destabilizing the Asian-Pacific region. Hegseth also called on Asian allies to increase their defense spending in the face of the 'threat from communist China', saying that 'deterrence has its price.' China aims to become the dominant power in Asia and control the entire region, he said. 'But we will not start a conflict with China. However, we will not let ourselves be pushed out of this critical region. And we will not allow our allies and partners to be subordinated.' China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory, despite the island having had an independent and democratically elected government for decades. The People's Republic has threatened to use military force to annex Taiwan if it does not do so peacefully.

**US Defense Secretary Warns of China's 'Pressing Threat' to Taiwan**
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that China poses a 'pressing threat' to Taiwan and urged Asian countries to increase defense spending and cooperate with the US to prevent war. Hegseth said that China is trying to become a 'hegemonic power' and 'dominate and control many regions in Asia.' He also mentioned that China's President Xi Jinping has set a deadline of 2027 for the Chinese military to be capable of attacking Taiwan. Hegseth stated that 'Communist China's any attempt to conquer Taiwan by force will bring catastrophic consequences to the Indo-Pacific region and the world.' He emphasized that the US is not seeking to dominate or suppress China, but will not be excluded from Asia and will not allow its allies to be intimidated. China responded by accusing the US of being the 'biggest troublemaker' in the region and of 'hyping up' the 'China threat.' Hegseth also warned Asian countries not to rely too heavily on economic ties with China, saying that Beijing will use this as a 'lever' to deepen its 'malevolent influence' and make US defense decisions more complicated. He also promoted US military equipment and mentioned a new 'Indo-Pacific Defense Industry Resilience Partnership' plan, which includes establishing a radar maintenance center in Australia and assisting in the production of drones in the region.

**China's National Security White Paper Exposes Regime's Fears and Instability**
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has released a national security white paper, which has sparked international concern about China's future direction. Experts believe that the document not only highlights Beijing's efforts to maintain control and stability, but also reflects its deep-seated concerns about its legitimacy and security. The white paper emphasizes the importance of maintaining the 'core interests' of the CCP, including the 'lifeblood' of the regime, and warns against the spread of Western democratic values and 'color revolutions'. The document also reiterates the CCP's stance on Taiwan, rejecting the idea of 'Taiwan independence' and reaffirming its commitment to the 'one China' principle. Experts point out that the white paper is a strategic response to the complex and rapidly changing international and domestic environment, and is intended to demonstrate the CCP's determination to maintain its grip on power. However, the document's emphasis on 'struggle' and external threats may exacerbate tensions with neighboring countries and the West. The white paper also reveals the CCP's deep-seated fears about its legitimacy and security, including its concerns about the spread of Western democratic values and the potential for 'color revolutions'. The document's emphasis on 'national security' and 'stability' is seen as a reflection of the CCP's efforts to maintain control and suppress dissent. Experts warn that the white paper's emphasis on 'struggle' and external threats may lead to a further escalation of tensions with the West and neighboring countries.

**US Warns Allies of China's Growing Threat: 'Invading Taiwan in 2027'**
US Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, has warned allies not to 'look away' from the 'imminent risk' posed by China, which is investing in high-level nuclear arms and armament technology to 'invade Taiwan in 2027'. Hegseth has reiterated that China's attempts to conquer Taiwan 'by force' would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. China has warned the US that military aid to Taiwan increases the 'risk of conflict'. Hegseth has called for increased defense spending 'to prevent war, make the cost too high, and peace the only option'. Analysts interpret this as a signal from Washington to increase arms sales in Asia. Hegseth has also highlighted the 'risk' of economic dependence on China, which 'deepens its malign influence' globally. This comes as tensions rise, with China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, not attending the Singapore meeting, and instead sending a delegation from the National Defense University.

**China's Ambiguous Policy Towards Taiwan: A Path to Peace or War?**
The Chinese government has been discussing the future of Taiwan, with President Xi Jinping stating that the island wants peace and dialogue with Beijing, but must continue to strengthen its defenses. Xi said, 'I am committed to peace, because peace is priceless, and there is no winner in war, but when it comes to seeking peace, we cannot follow dreams or illusions.' He added that Taiwan will continue to strengthen its defenses, as preparing for war is the best way to avoid it. A Chinese military magazine has suggested that the collapse of Taiwan's systems could lead to the island's destruction without a fight, citing the 'butterfly effect' where a small event can have a significant impact. The magazine suggested that China could destroy Taiwan's critical infrastructure, leading to a collapse of its systems. A Chinese researcher has also suggested that China could restart the war on Taiwan to regain control of the island by force. However, other experts believe that China is following a policy of ambiguity towards Taiwan, aiming to create a fait accompli that would make it easier to control the island through a surprise attack. China has also suggested that Taiwan could follow the 'one country, two systems' model, similar to Hong Kong, which would allow Taiwan to maintain its autonomy and democracy. However, Taiwan's leaders have rejected this proposal, and the US has also opposed any changes to the status quo, pledging to defend the island.

**Taiwan's Nuclear Power Plant Shutdown Leaves it Vulnerable to China**
Taiwan has shut down its last nuclear power plant, making it more vulnerable to China, according to critics. China could use a long-term naval blockade to weaken Taiwan. Taiwan's energy supply is dependent on China-friendly countries. Analyst Sheu Jyh-Shyang said, 'It is crucial that Taiwan further diversifies its energy supply, that is important for the resilience of the country.' Taiwan has been increasing its oil imports from the US, with a 31% increase in imports between 2022 and 2023. However, China could cut off this supply route. Taiwan's gas reserves would last only 11 days, while its coal reserves would last 39 days, according to the Taiwanese Energy Bureau. Taiwan is learning from the Ukraine war that even nuclear power plants are vulnerable to attack. The country aims to be carbon neutral by 2050, but its current renewable energy share is only 12%.

**Chen Chong: China Will Not Attack Taiwan Before 2028, Unless Provoked**
Former Taiwanese Premier Chen Chong said in an interview that the Chinese mainland will not attack Taiwan before 2028, unless it is provoked by a face-saving issue. Chen also expressed concerns about Taiwan's participation in the first batch of trade talks with the US, saying that it is a high-risk move. He pointed out that the US government's debt has reached 36 trillion dollars, and that the US Federal Reserve has already bought a large amount of US government bonds. Chen warned that the US may follow the debt forgiveness plan used by some third-world countries. He also emphasized the importance of diversifying Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, which are currently heavily invested in US Treasury bonds. Chen suggested that Taiwan should consider buying gold as a way to diversify its reserves and reduce its reliance on the US dollar. He also analyzed the current trade war between the US and China, comparing it to the ancient Chinese strategy of '合縱連橫' (alliance and encirclement). Chen pointed out that the US has underestimated the EU's ability to retaliate with 25% tariffs, and that the EU's move has forced the US to propose a 90-day exemption. Chen also discussed the concept of '金融武器化' (financial weaponization), which he believes is not limited to finance, but also includes the use of food and other resources as weapons. He suggested that Taiwan should diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on the US market. Chen also emphasized that the idea of '脫中入北' (ditching China and joining the North) is not a solution to Taiwan's economic problems, and that Taiwan should focus on developing its own economy and reducing its reliance on the US.

**Taiwan 'Exhausted Resources' in Battle with China: AI, Naval Invasions, and Balloons**
According to a report by Taiwan's National Security Agency, China is using artificial intelligence (AI) in its disinformation campaign aimed at dividing the Taiwanese society. The report, presented to the parliament on April 8, states that 'as AI becomes more widespread and advanced, the Communist Party of China (CPC) is also using this tool to create and disseminate controversial content.' In 2024, over half a million 'controversial messages' were detected, mainly on social media platforms such as Facebook and TikTok. The report highlights that Beijing has been paying attention to President Tsai Ing-wen's March speech, in which she called China 'an external hostile force', as well as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) $100 billion investment. 'These efforts represent a cognitive war and aim to divide our society,' the report says. Additionally, China has intensified its 'gray zone' tactics, including increased naval incursions into Taiwanese waters and the appearance of Chinese balloons in Taiwanese airspace. Taiwan has had to mobilize its own forces to respond, 'exhausting its resources,' according to the report. In February, Taiwan banned government agencies and key infrastructure units from using the Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek. Since 2019, Taiwanese government officials have been prohibited from using information and communication technologies deemed a threat to internal information security. President Tsai Ing-wen stated that even stricter measures are being taken to prevent the spread of Chinese influence in the media and civil society. China considers Taiwan, which has had its own government since 1949, as a province that broke away from the mainland during the civil war and has never ruled out the use of force to take control of the island.

**Will China Follow Russia's Example in Ukraine and Invade Taiwan in 2025?**
Taiwan's fate may be decided in Ukraine, as President Tsai Ing-Wen said in 2023. Despite China's military maneuvers around the island, she urged the US to focus more on Ukraine to prevent Russia from winning. Analysts believe that if a similar scenario were to occur in Taiwan, China would 'take action' to 'recover' the island. In 2022, President Joe Biden stated that the US would defend Taiwan if China were to invade. This firm response was 'taken into account' by the Chinese regime. China has more legitimacy to invade Taiwan than Russia did in Ukraine. Taiwan was part of China before the nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek established a republic on the island in 1949. Until 1970, the two Chinas coexisted at the UN, with Taiwan recognized by most nations, including African countries, as the 'official' China. However, in 1971, the People's Republic of China (PRC) won the battle to be recognized as the sole representative of the Chinese people, leading to Taiwan's isolation. Today, the PRC's economic and demographic weight is so great that few countries dare to defy it and maintain official relations with Taiwan, including European countries. Only 12 countries recognize Taiwan, with most being small, unimportant countries or islands. Taiwan has a cutting-edge industry, being one of the world's top producers of semi-conductors and microprocessors. As a member of the WTO and the largest foreign investor in China, Taiwan is a key player in the region.

**Taiwan's military exercises to focus on invasion preparation**
Taiwan's military is conducting exercises focused on preparing for a potential invasion by China in 2027, a deadline previously mentioned by security experts and military officials. Former US Navy admiral Philip Davidson warned that China could attempt to invade Taiwan by 2027, while Chinese President Xi Jinping has reportedly instructed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to be prepared for an invasion by then. However, Su Tzu-yun, a fellow at the Institute for National Defence and Security Research, noted that there is no clear indication a formal decision has been made to resort to force by then. Security analysts worldwide have urged their governments to prepare for a possible conflict, and the Han Kuang exercises' focus on 2027 is a logical response to these concerns, according to Su. 'It could create a perfect storm,' he said, 'if Xi seeks a fourth term, he may take military risks to justify his leadership.' The defence ministry's 'immediate response drills' were specifically designed to deter China from 'turning exercises into war,' Su added. 'The principle of risk control was followed,' he said. 'It is normal to use timelines as a reference for defence strategy,' Su noted. 'The US military must be prepared for contingencies before then,' said former US Indo-Pacific commander John Aquilino. 'China is accelerating its military expansion, particularly in dual-use shipyards and nuclear weapons launch platforms,' said US Air Force Strategic Commander General Anthony Cotton. 'These developments align with preparations to have the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027,' he added. 'The US should expedite its own military production in response,' Cotton said. 'It is a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and his ambition,' said former CIA director William Burns, describing Xi's directive to the PLA. 'China is accelerating its military expansion,' Burns added. 'It will continue efforts to weaken US influence in the Indo-Pacific,' said Davidson. 'Whether or not China launches an invasion in 2027, it will continue efforts to weaken US influence in the Indo-Pacific,' he added. 'Alternative deadlines have been proposed, including 2035 and 2049, both of which mark major PLA anniversaries,' Su noted. 'However, if Xi seeks a fourth term, he may take military risks to justify his leadership,' he warned.

**China's Aggressive Pursuit of Taiwan: A Threat to Democracy**
Tensions between China and Taiwan have escalated. China has announced that it will 'make every effort' to bring the island under its control. The Taiwanese government plans to take countermeasures. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te accused China of forcing the annexation of the democratically governed island. His government will propose various measures to counter China's efforts, he said. China is trying to infiltrate Taiwan, explore secrets, lure members of the military, and influence public opinion by undermining trust in the military, Lai said during a press conference. Therefore, it is necessary to 'strengthen our legal protection measures to prevent and expose such incidents.' Lai referred to a series of incidents in which China was involved in recent times, which fell into the gray area of psychological warfare, which does not represent an open armed conflict. For example, the Taiwanese authorities recently deported the Chinese wife of a Taiwanese citizen after she repeatedly posted clips in Chinese social media claiming that China could conquer Taiwan within half an hour, which is prohibited in Taiwan. Retired Taiwanese military personnel have also passed on information about the island's weapons systems to Chinese agents and tried to recruit military personnel as spies. China has exploited Taiwan's democracy to instrumentalize various areas of society, including parts of organized crime, media personalities, military personnel, and police officers. China sees Taiwan as a rebellious province. Tensions around the island and in the heavily trafficked Taiwan Strait have increased significantly. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that it would make every effort to achieve a 'peaceful reunification' with Taiwan. 'At the same time, China will take all necessary measures to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity and resolutely oppose Taiwan's independence and external interference,' a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said. China regularly sends ships and aircraft into the airspace and waters near the island to intimidate the 23 million inhabitants and weaken the military and morale of the country. Lai's Democratic Progressive Party supports the continuation of de facto independence from Beijing. Since the election of Lai's predecessor Tsai Ing-wen eight years ago, China has almost refused to have any official contact with the party.

**2025 China's Taiwan Policy: A 'Soft and Hard' Dual Strategy**
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) held a meeting on Taiwan affairs in 2025, with Wang Huning, the chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, delivering a speech. The speech highlighted Beijing's anxiety and the use of a 'soft and hard' dual strategy towards Taiwan. The CCP is concerned about Taiwan's expansion of international space under US support, and therefore emphasizes the need to strengthen control over Taiwan in terms of discourse. The speech also mentioned the need to 'resolutely oppose and suppress' external interference, indicating that Beijing believes the US (especially the Trump administration) may intervene more directly in Taiwan affairs. The CCP will take a more hardline approach, including military intimidation, economic pressure, and diplomatic isolation, to counter US-Taiwan deepening cooperation. On the other hand, Beijing will also use economic incentives and youth exchanges to attract Taiwanese youth and businesses, promoting a 'soft' approach to unification. However, the effectiveness of this dual strategy remains to be seen, given the increasing uncertainty and challenges in the international environment.

However, Taiwan's government continues to reject China's claims of sovereignty, maintaining its stance against Beijing's control. According to Wang, China must 'take the lead and persistently work toward'reunification' with Taiwan, but Taiwan remains firm in its opposition to China's assertions.
