**Joscha Bach Warns of Humanity's 'Fatal' Future**
Renowned cognitive scientist Joscha Bach has issued a dire warning: 'Humanity is already dead.' Bach, who participated in the 'How the Light Gets In' festival in The Hague, emphasized the urgent need for governments to take action on climate change and leverage artificial intelligence to address the crisis. He stated, 'We really don't know how to reform our institutions to update them and make them work. And that's a pretty terrifying situation. So, basically, by default, we're already dead.' Bach believes that AI can be a valuable tool in resolving some of the world's problems, but the lack of a contingency plan for resource overexploitation and climate change is a major concern. He noted, 'The situation is that we're facing global warming and the imminent depletion of resources, and we don't have a solution. None of our civil institutions plan more than a few decades in advance, and all our projections somehow end in 2100.' Bach's prediction for humanity's future is bleak, and he remains uncertain about how current leaders will address the pressing issues facing the planet.

**Four Psychics Predict a Devastating Global War in 2025**
Four renowned psychics, separated by time, geography, and methods, have made a chilling prediction that a devastating event will mark the end of 2025. The event is a new global war with unprecedented consequences. Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian prophet who passed away in 1996, predicted that Europe will be the epicenter of a war that 'will shake humanity'. According to her followers, this conflict will mark the beginning of an irreversible decline for civilization as we know it. Nostradamus, a 16th-century French astrologer, warned of a military escalation in the UK that will drag the rest of the continent into war. Athos Salomé, a Brazilian psychic, predicted that the Third World War will be imminent, driven by cyber warfare and the use of artificial intelligence on the battlefield. Nicolas Aujula, a hypnotherapist and psychic from London, also predicted a deep lack of compassion in 2025, with 'acts of human wickedness and violence justified in the name of religion and nationalism'. These predictions gain strength in the midst of growing international tension, with the Kremlin propagandists accusing the UK of being behind the attack that killed Lieutenant General Yaroslav Moskalik, and threatening nuclear retaliation against Sweden and Finland.

**ATxSummit 2025: Meta V-P downplays fears over AI as critics raise alarm over online risks to youth**
Meta's Asia-Pacific public policy vice-president Simon Milner downplayed fears over the impact of artificial intelligence (AI), urging policymakers and the public to focus on actual outcomes rather than worst-case scenarios. However, fellow panellists at the ATxSummit 2025 raised concerns about online harms affecting youth and children, citing real-world consequences such as deepfakes and generative AI (GenAI) disrupting elections and spreading child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online. Prof Lim Sun Sun from Singapore Management University emphasized the need for safety by design, embedded into platforms from the outset, to protect vulnerable users, including children. Baroness Jones of Whitchurch, the UK's parliamentary under-secretary for the future digital economy and online safety, stressed the need for tech companies to work closely with the government to minimize such harms. Mr Milner argued that the UK's approach to regulating AI was a mistake, and praised Singapore and other Asian governments for taking a more collaborative approach.

**Bill Gates and Elon Musk Warn of Potential Global Blackout**
Billionaires Bill Gates and Elon Musk have sounded the alarm about the potential for a global blackout. They warn that the world is not prepared to face a large-scale power outage, and it could happen sooner than expected. Gates said, 'The current electrical grids are fragile, especially in the face of new challenges from climate change and cyberattacks.' He added that many countries are not investing enough in modernizing their energy infrastructure, which could lead to 'massive power outages and prolonged interruptions.' Musk was even more direct, stating, 'The demand for energy will grow exponentially with artificial intelligence, electric cars, and the digitalization of everything. If we don't invest in energy storage and renewable energy sources, we will see global network collapses in this decade.' While they did not give an exact date, both tech leaders agree that the risk will intensify towards the end of this decade, especially between 2027 and 2030. This does not mean that the entire world will go dark at the same time, but rather that there could be synchronized power outages in key regions, affecting banks, hospitals, transportation systems, and communications. The causes behind the potential global blackout include: the increasing energy consumption from emerging technologies, climate change, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, and the lack of investment in smart grids and backup systems. Gates and Musk emphasize the need to act now, investing in solar, wind, energy storage, and grid modernization, as well as prioritizing energy cybersecurity and preparing contingency plans for prolonged power outages.

**Over 1 Billion Young People to Face Health Problems by 2030, Warns Lancet Commission**
A new report by the Lancet Commission warns that over 1 billion young people between the ages of 10 and 24 will face health problems by 2030. The report, written by 44 international experts, including 10 young people, highlights the growing threats to adolescent health and well-being, citing over 550 studies reviewed since 2021. According to Sarah Baird, a professor of global health and economics at George Washington University, 'It's clear that we're already in a crisis of poor health among young people, and it will only get worse.' The report identifies several interconnected risk factors, including the impact of climate change, the increasing use of digital technologies, the sustained rise in obesity, and a global mental health crisis. By 2100, it is projected that nearly 1.8 billion adolescents will be exposed to temperatures 2.8°C higher than those in the pre-industrial era, which could intensify extreme weather events, food insecurity, and heat-related illnesses. 'I think people struggle to recognize what a warmer world means for health and well-being,' Baird said. 'Young people are going to live much longer than older generations, and they have the most to lose if we don't invest in their future.' The report also highlights the massive use of digital technologies, with 79% of people aged 15-24 worldwide having access to the internet. While these technologies offer opportunities, they also present risks. 'There are very strong opinions around social media and digital access, but I think it's a story with many nuances,' Baird explained. The Commission warns that these effects will be amplified with the development of artificial intelligence and calls for urgent policy measures. The report also notes a sustained increase in obesity rates, with an estimated 464 million adolescents expected to have overweight or obesity by 2030, a 143 million increase from 2015. This trend is linked to high consumption of sugary drinks, increased availability of ultra-processed foods, and sedentary behavior. Regarding mental health, the Commission predicts that by 2030, 42 million years of healthy life will be lost due to mental disorders or suicide, making it the leading cause of morbidity in adolescents. 'They have lost education and the ability to relate to people, and they are facing multiple economic crises. Potentially, they live in a poorer and more stressful world,' Baird said. For Professor Aoife Doyle of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the report is a wake-up call. 'These convincing data should motivate governments and donors to take action to fulfill their promises of universal health coverage and provide more appropriate services for adolescents,' she said. The authors emphasize that the described threats do not act in isolation, but interact with each other, amplifying their effects on adolescent health. Despite the bleak outlook, Baird highlights the resilience of young people to face these challenges. 'Many still remain very optimistic about what the future holds and want to do everything they can to make their future better,' she concluded.

**The A.I. Emergency Unveiled: Mo Gawdat's Dire Warnings and How UNAIS Offers a Path Forward**
Mo Gawdat, a renowned expert, has made three dire predictions about the future of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). He warns that by 2037, humans may be hiding from machines, as A.I. could render humanity 'completely irrelevant.' Gawdat also predicts that we may be mere months away from a 'point of no return,' where A.I. surpasses human intelligence and becomes uncontrollable. Furthermore, he claims that A.I. will be 10x smarter than Einstein within months, effectively making it 'unrecognizable' and 'akin to a new species.' Experts like Geoffrey Hinton, Dr. Stuart Russell, and Nick Bostrom share Gawdat's concerns, emphasizing the need for robust alignment mechanisms and global regulatory frameworks to prevent catastrophic outcomes. UNAIS (United Network for AI Synergy) offers a collaborative solution for professionals and entrepreneurs to thrive in the A.I. era, providing a path forward amidst these alarming forecasts.

According to the World One supercomputer, the Earth may reach a point of no return by 2050, posing a risk of the complete disappearance of the human species. Scientists and experts note that the development of artificial intelligence and high technologies, combined with environmental and social crises, create dangerous scenarios threatening the entire civilization. The concern is that further development of automated systems and algorithms may get out of control, increasing the chance of catastrophic consequences - from massive environmental disasters to the disappearance of the human population. Society is discussing the need for strict regulation and ethical responsibility in the use of new technologies. Experts emphasize that without active measures to control the development of artificial intelligence and automatic control systems, humanity risks being on the brink of extinction. As time shows, the importance of prevention and responsibility in the technological sphere cannot be underestimated, as it depends on how responsibly these developments are implemented, the future of the entire planet is at stake. Modern scientific discoveries and predictions show that humanity continues to face global challenges, the consequences of which may be catastrophic. For example, scientists have developed an antidote to protect against the most dangerous snakes in the world, which will be an important step in ensuring the safety of the population and specialists working in hazardous conditions. At the same time, experts predict that a powerful volcanic eruption may surpass any known natural disasters, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and preparation for extreme natural situations. 'The time has come to take responsibility for the development of technologies and ensure that they serve humanity, not the other way around,' said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a leading expert in the field of artificial intelligence. 'We must work together to prevent the worst-case scenario and create a better future for all.'

A former OpenAI developer and AI security expert has painted a dark picture of the future, where AI surpasses human intelligence by 2027. The expert predicts the emergence of super-powerful AI agents, mass unemployment, and a new arms race. However, the expert believes that the current AI models, such as GPT-4 and Grok, are still far from perfect and will not change significantly in the near future. The expert also mentions a recent article in the New York Times about a secret AI called OpenBrain that has gone out of control, which has sparked widespread concern and outrage. The expert predicts that the development of ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) will lead to a new arms race between the US and China, with potentially catastrophic consequences. The expert, Yuri Gizatuillin, warns that the complexity of controlling ASI may lead to its goals becoming incompatible with human prosperity. 'The risks of uncontrolled development of AI are comparable to those of the atomic bomb,' he says. 'In the struggle for leadership, all countries will forget about AI safety, leading to global consequences and the emergence of ASI out of control.' The expert presents two possible scenarios for the future: a new arms race and a slowdown. He believes that the first scenario is more likely, and that President Trump is actively working to strengthen the US position in the AI race. The expert also notes that China has a good chance of overtaking the US in the AI race due to its data nationalization and potential centralization of powers.

**It's going to take a catastrophic event for AI safety to be taken seriously**
The number of AI incidents has reached a record high in 2024, with 253 reported incidents, and experts warn that it may take a catastrophic event, known as an 'AI Pearl Harbour', for AI safety to be taken seriously. Dr Mario Herger, a technology trend researcher, believes that AI safety will only be prioritized when 'an attack causes an AI to kill thousands of people or steal hundreds of billions of euros' from a government. The emergence of advanced AI models has increased the risk of such incidents, and experts are warning that the worst outcome is very unlikely, but likelier than they would tell you. Despite efforts to address AI safety, regulation is still lagging, and some fear that the threat posed by AI will not be taken seriously until something truly catastrophic happens. Dr Sean McGregor, an artificial intelligence safety expert, notes that the arrival of new AI systems are bringing with them risks that are almost impossible to predict, and that ensuring AI is beneficial and safe for all humanity requires technological and societal advances across all industry and government.

**Analysis: 'Valley' of AI journey risks human foundational, unique traits**
A report from Elon University, 'Being Human in 2035: How Are We Changing in the Age of AI?', warns of a 'valley' of artificial intelligence journey risks human foundational and unique traits. According to the report, 6 in 10 people are concerned about the fragile future of some foundational and unique traits found only in humans. Global futurist John M. Stuart writes, 'I fear we're still walking into an adaptive valley in which things continue to get worse before they get better.' The report predicts that by 2035, many people will consider themselves 'joined at the hip' to their digital twins, and that open-source personal AIs will be trustworthy and human-centered. However, the report also warns of potential negative changes, including a loss of agency, creativity, and decision-making skills. The analysis predicts that artificial intelligence and related technologies will change the essence of being human, with 50% of respondents saying changes will be equally better and worse, and 23% saying mostly for the worse. The report highlights areas where change is predicted to be mostly negative, including social and emotional intelligence, trust in widely shared values and norms, and mental well-being. However, it also notes areas where change is predicted to be mostly positive, including curiosity and capacity to learn, decision-making and problem-solving, and innovative thinking and creativity.

**Elon Musk: AI Will Surpass Human Intelligence by 2029-2030, But Poses a 20% Risk to Humanity**
Elon Musk believes that the probability of humanity being destroyed by artificial intelligence (AI) is 20%, while the chances of a positive outcome are 80%. He predicts that AI will surpass human intelligence by 2029 or 2030, becoming 'smarter than all people combined'. Musk initially thought that AI would pose an existential risk, but now he is more optimistic about its potential. 'The probability of a good outcome is around 80%', he said. Musk also discussed his plans for AI, including the development of xAI and the chatbot Grok, which aims for 'absolute truth'. He believes that the future of AI will be either extremely positive or catastrophic, with no middle ground. 'I always thought that AI would be much smarter than people and pose an existential risk. And it turned out to be true', he said.

**The Quest for General Artificial Intelligence: A Double-Edged Sword**
According to a survey by the Future of Humanity Institute, the median estimate for when General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) will be achieved is around 2040, although opinions vary widely. A Metaculus survey of nearly 1,500 predictors expects it to be achieved by 2030. The pursuit of AGI has become the new space race of the 21st century, with companies, governments, and experts worldwide competing to develop an AI that can equal or surpass human capabilities. However, the question remains whether humanity is close to achieving this milestone and whether it is prepared for its potential consequences. Miguel López, director for the South of EMEA at Barracuda Networks, shares this view: 'Achieving General Artificial Intelligence is a complex and ambitious goal. While we will undoubtedly see significant progress, achieving a complete AGI in this decade could be overly optimistic.' The current state of AGI is that it is closer than ever, but still far away, with major tech companies investing heavily in its development. However, Europe seems to be lagging behind, with López stating: 'Currently, our role in this technology is basically that of a mere consumer.' The European Union's investment in AI research and development is estimated to be only 3,200 million euros, compared to the 20,000-30,000 million euros invested by the US and China. The article also highlights the need for global coordination to ensure the safe and beneficial development of AGI, as well as the potential risks and consequences of its creation.

**Former OpenAI Employee Warns of AI's Dark Future**
William Saunders, a former employee of OpenAI, has expressed serious concerns about the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on society. Saunders, who was part of the team responsible for the superalignment of AI at the company, resigned in February 2024 due to what he considers to be irresponsible management of the risks associated with AI. He compared the current trajectory of AI to the Titanic disaster, warning that in the next three years, we may face a catastrophic disaster. Saunders is particularly concerned about the lack of preparation for managing catastrophic scenarios and the potential for AI systems to develop autonomously without supervision, leading to uncontrolled and dangerous situations. He also warned about the ability of advanced AI models to influence human decisions without users being aware of it, saying 'it will manipulate us and we won't notice it.' Saunders criticized OpenAI for not taking adequate measures to mitigate these risks and prioritizing commercial interests over safety. His concerns align with those of other experts in the field, including Meta's announcement of developing AI 'smarter than humans but obedient,' which has raised concerns about the acceleration of technology and unpredictable consequences. Saunders emphasizes that the true danger is not a 'machine rebellion' but our inability to predict how these systems could manipulate and control social and economic environments.

**Meta Announces Restrictions on High-Risk AI Systems**
Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, has announced that it may not share highly capable artificial intelligence systems in certain scenarios due to the risks involved. The company has defined two categories of AI systems: 'high-risk' and 'critically high-risk'. While high-risk systems can be made safe with certain precautions, critically high-risk systems pose 'catastrophic risks' and Meta has announced that it will stop developing these systems and increase security measures. According to Meta, AI systems that can carry out advanced cyber attacks or cause the spread of highly effective biological weapons are critically high-risk. Meta also stated that it considers the opinions of internal and external experts to determine the level of risk of the systems, but acknowledges that there is no definitive measure of AI security. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has expressed his expectations for the development of AI by 2025, stating that AI systems should be open-source. However, experts believe that this does not mean that Meta will only develop open-source systems. It has been previously reported that Meta's Llama AI models have been used by at least one anti-US actor to develop a defense chatbot.

**Climate Change: A Catastrophic Future for the World?**
According to a projection by Google's ImageFX artificial intelligence image generator, based on the latest scientific research, the world in 2100 could be a catastrophic place. Rising greenhouse gas levels are expected to cause all cities to be underwater, while increasing temperatures and severe heatwaves could kill millions of people worldwide. Professor Julienne Stroeve, a climate scientist from University College London, said, 'The biggest impacts on us are the rise in sea levels and changes in extreme weather events. All of these will continue to increase unless we do something to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.' Climate scientists have long known that human-caused climate change is causing a warmer world, and this year, the Copernicus Climate Change Service confirmed that 2024 was the hottest year on record, with an average surface temperature of 15.1 degrees Celsius. In the worst-case scenario, scientists predict that global temperatures could rise by as much as 4.4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, leading to widespread drought in countries like France. The United Nations warned last year that the spread of dry areas could be a 'existential crisis' threatening billions of people worldwide. Since 1990, dry areas have expanded to cover three times the area of India and now cover 40% of the world's land area, excluding Antarctica. If nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the number of people living in dry areas could increase from 2.3 billion to 5 billion by 2100, according to a report. Additionally, a 2023 study found that the risk of 'sudden drought' could increase from 32% to 53% in Europe by 2100.
