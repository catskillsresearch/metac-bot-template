**UK to Increase Military Personnel to 76,000 by 2034**
The UK plans to increase the number of its military personnel from approximately 72,500 to 76,000 by the next parliament, according to UK Defense Minister John Healey. 'We intend to increase the British army to at least 76,000 regular soldiers by the next parliament. For the first time in a generation, it is our government that wants to increase the size of the regular army,' he said. The current government, led by the Labour Party, aims to achieve this goal by 2034. The current number of British military personnel is around 72,500, the lowest since the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century. According to The Times, the number of military personnel may drop below 70,000 in 2025 due to low recruitment rates and high rates of personnel leaving the service due to dissatisfaction with working conditions.

**Álava's Aging Population: A Need for More Care Services**
The 'baby boom' generation in Álava is aging, and many are starting to rely on social services. According to the Fundación Eguía-Careaga report, the number of people over 65 will increase by 17.2% by 2030, and those over 80 will increase by 26.8%. The report suggests that the current number of care home places is 'sufficient', but there is a need to strengthen other types of services, such as home care. The report also calculates that there will be a need for 160 more places in day centers. Additionally, the report notes that there will be a need for 1,300 family members to care for their relatives who are unable to perform daily activities without support. The study does not attempt to predict the future of disability in 2030, but notes that the number of people with recognized disabilities in Álava has increased by 80% since the COVID-19 pandemic. As Gorka Urtaran, the deputy for Social Policies, has previously stated, there will be a need for 1,000 more professionals to care for dependent people in their homes by 2030. 'We need to adapt the system to these changes,' said Urtaran. 'The people want to stay at home and live their last years there, or until they have no other choice but to go to a residence.'

**Lula warns of right-wing 'overwhelming' the Supreme Court in 2026 Senate elections**
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated that in the 2026 elections, it is necessary to elect a majority in the Senate to prevent the right from 'overwhelming' the Supreme Court (STF). Lula made this statement on Sunday (1st), during the closing speech of the national congress of the PSB in Brasília. According to Lula, 'We often have to elect the best candidates, elect senators, elect federal deputies, elect senators, because we need to win the majority in the Senate, because otherwise, those guys [from the right] will overwhelm the Supreme Court.' Lula also emphasized that the Supreme Court is not a 'sweet apple', but it is necessary to 'preserve the institutions that guarantee the exercise of democracy in this country.' In 2026, there will be an election for ⅔ of the Senate seats - 54 out of 81. The right has already declared that it seeks a majority in the Upper House of Congress, as it is the instance that can initiate impeachment proceedings against STF ministers. The right sees this possibility, with Senator Flávio Bolsonaro stating in February that 'we have almost 40 senators in favor of impeaching Minister Alexandre de Moraes.' Senator Davi Alcolumbre, the president of the Upper House, also stated in February that he would not prioritize impeachment proceedings against STF ministers and that the Senate 'is not a correction body of the STF.'

**Proposal to Increase Deputies to 531 Faces Resistance in Senate**
A proposal to increase the number of deputies in the Chamber of Deputies from 513 to 531, approved by the Chamber on May 6, is stalled in the Senate. The topic enters a decisive month, as Congress has until June 30 to reevaluate the size of the Chamber's delegations based on the 2022 Census. Senate President Davi Alcolumbre has not made any statements on the project. Despite this, leaders of the Chamber point out that the topic will have to be addressed in the next week after the 11th Parliamentary Forum of the BRICS, between June 3 and 5, due to the deadline given by the Supreme Court. The discussion about seats in the Chamber arose after a determination by the Supreme Court for the Chamber to revise, by June 30, the number of parliamentarians from each state, based on the last demographic census, made by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in 2022. If the Chamber followed the determination to the letter, some states would lose deputies due to population decline. The proposal to increase the number of deputies has faced resistance in the Senate, with senators from the PT to the opposition rejecting it. The division among different parties is due to regional issues, with states more favorable to changes and others opposed, depending on the impact. Some arguments used by senators are that 'it's not the right time' for the topic, that the burden against the political class should increase with the approval, and that it would be 'incoherent' to demand cuts in government expenses and approve a measure to increase expenses.

**Trump's Cuts to USAID Will Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under the age of five. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.'

**Trump Aims For 400 GW Of Nuclear By 2050, 10 Large Reactors Under Construction By 2030**
US President Trump has announced plans to increase nuclear power production to 400 GW by 2050, with 10 large reactors expected to be under construction by 2030. However, the article does not provide further information on this topic, instead listing a series of unrelated questions about various business and market-related issues, including Google's appeal of an antitrust search ruling, Palantir's stock surge, and the impact of Trump's steel tariff increase on markets. The article also mentions Tesla's rising stock despite slumping business and recent volatility in the stock market, as well as AI layoffs affecting tech companies and talent loss in Meta's AI team.

**More than half of young people will face health problems by 2030**
A new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, more than 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity and overweight have increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The document also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. In 2016, fewer than 1,000 adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, but by 2021, the number had already exceeded 1.1 billion. Another concerning aspect is the role that climate change and technology will play. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with an average annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. According to UN estimates, by 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24. This generation faces a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.

**Time to Revive Census Reform**
According to Pew research, excluding unauthorized immigrants from the apportionment count would result in California losing two congressional seats, Florida gaining one, and Texas gaining two. Other states that would be affected include Alabama, Minnesota, and Ohio, which would each hold onto a seat they would have lost. Democrats, who are threatened by the citizenship question, previously sued to block it. The Supreme Court ruled that the government has the right to ask a citizenship question, but must properly justify changing the Census Bureau's long-standing practice. The Trump administration complied with the ruling, but emphasized the importance of having accurate data on citizens and aliens to inform immigration policy. Now that Trump is back in office, efforts are underway to revive census reform for the 2030 Census, which aims to stop counting illegal aliens to gain political power through congressional seats.

**Increase in Chamber Seats to Impact State Assemblies**
A proposal to increase the number of seats in the Chamber of Deputies from 513 to 531 has been approved by the Chamber and will impact the state Assemblies. The Constitution requires the number of state deputies to be three times the number of federal deputies, with a cap of 36. This means that if the proposal is approved, the Assemblies will need to increase their number of seats. For example, in Minas Gerais, the federal delegation has 53 deputies, and if the proposal is approved, a new seat will be created, passing to 54. In this scenario, the Assembly will need to have 78 seats (one more than the current 77), with 36 representing the triple of 12 federal deputies and 42 indicating the difference from the total federal delegation. Other states, such as Amazonas, Mato Grosso, and Rio Grande do Norte, will gain six new seats, while Pará and Santa Catarina will gain four new seats each. The change was determined by the Supreme Court to adjust the parliamentary representation to the last Demographic Census of 2022, which increased the country's population to 203.1 million inhabitants. The current delegations have not been updated since 1993, when the count was 146.9 million inhabitants. The deadline for the change to be made by the National Congress was June 30. If not, the alteration in the delegations will be made by the Electoral Superior Court (TSE).

**Democrats need to get to grips with 2030 census reality**
The 2030 census is expected to give the GOP an easier path to control Congress, as Southern states are gaining seats while blue states are losing them. This could make it harder for Democrats to win the 270 electoral votes needed to win presidential elections. The Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin is cautioning party members to be 'caught flat-footed' during future elections and is urging them to invest time, energy, and money in building infrastructure and having conversations with voters. Martin also announced a new state plan, 'Organize Everywhere, Win Anywhere', which will allot $17,500 to state officials in blue states and $22,500 to state parties in red states. William Frey, a demographer, cautioned that the population growth in the South may slow down in the second half of the decade, and that voters moving to the South may not vote the same way as existing residents. Democrats have made some inroads in North Carolina, but still face challenges in other Southern states, including Texas and Florida. The party is refocusing on an economic message to counter Trump's appeal and is urging its members to organize in rural communities and give voters a sense of what they would do to improve their lives.

**Reflections on the Agenda 2030**
The author, Leopoldo Abadía, reflects on the Agenda 2030, a set of 17 urgent goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 to be achieved by 2030. The author was initially skeptical, thinking it was just a declaration of intentions, but after learning more, he believes it's about changing people's lives to create a more sustainable world. The author lists the 17 goals and notes that they are urgent, but thinks that the real goal is to establish a different way of acting. In Spain, the Ministry of Social Rights, Consumer Affairs and Agenda 2030 has concretized the following objectives. The author also mentions the priorities of the Generalitat of Catalonia. He concludes by emphasizing the importance of common sense and suggests that the principles of the Catholic Church's social doctrine should be applied to the Agenda 2030. 'It is fundamental that all of the above be imbued with common sense,' he writes. 'I've learned that the organization For women Scotland is happy because the UK Supreme Court has ruled that there are two sexes: man and woman. I already knew that, because in 91 years and a half I've only seen men and women. If they had called me, they would have saved themselves the trouble.'

**New SCJN System and Potential Candidates for President**
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) will have nine new justices, with five women and four men, and will operate with a new system where all decisions will be made in public sessions. The justices will serve for 12 years, but the president of the court will be chosen through a unique system. The candidate who receives the most votes will serve for two years, and then be replaced by the second-place candidate. This rotation will continue. The President of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, is interested in the first four justices to be elected, as she wants to have direct contact with them and potentially influence the 2030 federal election and her own exit from office. Three current justices, Lenia Batres, Yasmín Esquivel, and Loretta Ortiz, are direct candidates. Many believe that they will lead the SCJN for the first six years. However, other candidates, such as Jazmín Bonilla, who has the support of all three branches of government, and Paula María García Villegas Sánchez Cordero, the daughter of a former minister, are also contenders. The article notes that Arturo Zaldívar, a key operator of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will have significant influence over the selection process.

**Halfway to the 2030 census, the Supreme Court is still dealing with...**
The United States is halfway to the next once-a-decade census, but the Supreme Court is still dealing with lawsuits that grew out of the last one. The court is taking up a challenge to Louisiana's congressional map, which was drawn to have two majority Black districts for the first time. The justices will decide whether race was the predominant factor driving the new map, with some lawmakers arguing that politics, not race, helped set the boundaries. The decision could have significant implications for redistricting and the role of federal courts in deciding racial gerrymandering cases. A decision is expected by late June.

**Halfway to the 2030 census, the Supreme Court is still dealing with lawsuits over the last one - WTOP News**
The US Supreme Court is set to hear a case about Louisiana's congressional map, which was drawn to include two majority Black districts for the first time. The court previously ruled that Alabama's congressional map discriminated against Black voters, leading to a new map in Louisiana. The state's Republican-led government and civil rights groups have formed an unlikely alliance to challenge the map, with the state arguing that politics, not race, drove the new boundaries. The court's decision is expected by late June, and a ruling invalidating the map could leave little time to draw a new one before the 2026 elections. 'Drawing political districts is a task for politicians, not federal judges,' wrote Justice Clarence Thomas in a previous opinion. 'The decision reflects the imminent reality that Louisiana would be projected to lose one of five Republican congressional seats' when a court or the legislature adopted a second majority Black district, wrote state Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill.

**You'll Love How the Map Is Changing to Boost the GOP**
According to The American Redistricting Project (ARP), the 2020 census undercounts in Florida and Texas will be corrected in the 2030 census, resulting in a gain of four seats each for these states. Florida will gain one-third more representation, while Texas will gain more than half a million people. Arizona is the only swing state to gain a seat. Illinois, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin will lose one seat each, while New York is projected to lose two seats. California is expected to lose three seats, with the ARP estimating that the state's progressive governance is causing population loss. The author notes that the Democrats' lack of registration efforts in Florida and Texas, combined with low morale and a tanking approval rating, may hinder their chances in the 2032 election.

**64 Candidates to Compete for Supreme Court Seats in Mexico**
The Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE) has announced that there will be 64 candidates for the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, with 33 women and 31 men. The candidates were selected by the three branches of government: the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial. The INE has also determined that there will be 15 candidates for the two available positions in the Sala Superior of the Tribunal Electoral del Poder Judicial de la Federación. Among the candidates are three current ministers of the Supreme Court: Lenia Batres Guadarrama, Yasmín Esquivel Mossa, and Loretta Ortiz Ahlf. The INE has also approved the designs for the over 600 million ballots that will be used in the judicial elections on June 1, 2025. The ballots will feature the names of the candidates, as well as instructions for voting. Citizens will be able to write the numbers of their preferred candidates in the blank boxes at the top of the ballots. Carla Astrid Humphrey Jordán, a member of the INE, explained that the Talleres Gráficos de la Nación will begin printing the ballots on February 21, 2025. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our team that we are able to provide accurate and reliable information to the public,' she said. 'We are committed to ensuring that the electoral process is transparent and fair.'

**55% of Federal Judges to Automatically Participate in 2025 Election**
According to the Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE), 55% of federal judges and magistrates whose positions were drawn for the 2025 election will automatically be on the ballot to defend their positions. This includes 182 magistrates of Circuit and 212 judges of District, who did not explicitly decline to participate in the election. The INE has published an updated list, which for the first time, shows the number of judges in office who will compete against nominated candidates from the Executive and Legislative powers, as well as those who were initially proposed by the Federal Judicial Power (PJF), but were rejected by the Supreme Court of Justice. 'It is more difficult for judges to retire, as most do not meet the requirements of age or seniority,' said an unnamed source. Those who simply leave their positions will be entitled to a three-month salary payment plus twenty days per year worked. The Supreme Court of Justice has confirmed that only the Ministers aligned with the Government will participate in the election, including Yasmín Esquivel, Loretta Ortiz, and Lenia Batres, who will remain in office until 2034, 2037, and 2040, respectively.
