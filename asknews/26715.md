**COVID-19 Aid Becomes Nightmare: Thousands Must Repay Thousands of Euros**
Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic, disputes continue over which payments were rightfully made and which were not. According to the Ministry of Economics, final reports with the closing numbers from the countries will be available by the end of this year. So far, it is clear that in over 400,000 cases, those affected are required to return the funds in full or in part, or have already done so. However, over 5,000 people are contesting this, as revealed by a survey conducted by WDR, NDR, and 'Süddeutscher Zeitung' among all 16 state governments last year. The number of claimants is likely to have increased since then, as many funding agencies are currently reviewing old COVID-19 aid and sending out demands for repayment, as reported by the digital law firm tes from Frankfurt, which specializes in consumer protection.

**Victims' Associations Demand Justice and Reparations for Care Home Tragedy**
A protest in Madrid's Plaza Juan Goytisolo, organized by the associations 7.291 Verdad y Justicia and Pladigmare, brought together 700 demonstrators, including 200 representing the victims of the Valencia DANA. The protesters demanded 'truth, justice, and reparations for the victims', which have not been achieved five years after the tragedy. The main representatives, Carmen Ruiz Mesa and María Jesús Valero, called for 'justice and reparations' that have been sought for five years, as well as a tribute to the 7,291 people who died 'in an inhumane and cruel way' due to 'protocols and a political decision that led directly to their death'. Politicians from the PSOE and Más Madrid, including Óscar López and Mónica García, attended the event and demanded that the justice system provide 'truth' to the families of the victims and acknowledged the 'protocols of shame', referring to the procedures carried out by the Madrid government during the pandemic in care homes, which resulted in 7,291 victims. López stated that they will 'go to the end' and that the Ayuso government will 'go forward', while Bergerot emphasized that Ayuso is 'completely surrounded by scandals and cases of corruption' and that she and former Health Minister Enrique Ruiz Escudero are responsible for the deaths in care homes during the coronavirus. Bergerot demanded that the families know 'everything about this and about the people who live in care homes today' and asked if the ideologues of the 'protocols of shame' will assume their responsibilities or give in to the pressure from Ayuso's environment. Maestre expressed her hope that the ideologues of the care homes will assume penal responsibilities and thanked the families for their struggle over the past five years to 'open the way for the truth'.

**USAID Cuts to Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under five years old. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.' Bill Gates has announced that he will increase his donations to global health programs to $10 billion annually and maintain the investment for 20 years.

**Trump cuts will reverse progress on AIDS**
The global AIDS epidemic is at risk of spiraling out of control due to the Trump administration's cuts to foreign assistance and recommitment to funding global health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of new HIV infections in 2023 was still more than three times the 2025 target of 370,000 or fewer new infections. If this trend continues, the target of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 will not be reached. UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima warned that the Trump funding freeze 'means that overnight one in every three dollars for fighting disease, preventing pandemics, has halted.' This has led to real-world consequences, including clinics shutting down and HIV, TB, and malaria efforts grinding to a halt. Byanyima estimated that 5,800 people are now being infected every day, up from 3,500, and that if the U.S. global health funding cuts become permanent, there will be an additional 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths globally by 2029. 'All the progress made over the last 25 years would be gone,' Byanyima warned. 'It would be a disaster for those countries with the highest HIV burden in Africa. But it would also be an unmitigated crisis for global health with devastating consequences too for rich countries.'

**Over 1 Billion Young People to Face Adverse Health Conditions by 2030**
A new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, over 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity has increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The report also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. By 2021, over 1.1 billion adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, up from less than 1 billion in 2016. The study also warns that climate change and technology will play a significant role in the health of this generation. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with a mean annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. By 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24, facing a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.

**India strengthens defence integration, technology and recruitment**
India's defence strategy is focusing on strengthening jointness and integration of the armed forces, developing a shared understanding of operational needs, and enhancing technological capabilities. The defence budget is $81 billion, allowing continuous modernisation and upgrades. The country aims to showcase strong and diversified strength by 2025, placing India among the world's top military powers. The Agniveer recruitment scheme, introduced by the Modi government, involves short-term service in the Indian Armed Forces, where recruits serve for four years. Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi has called the Agnipath recruitment scheme a 'big success,' stating that the Agniveers have shown a keen desire to learn and are performing effectively. However, only 25% of Agniveers are retained for long-term service, a figure considered low by military experts.

**COVID-19's Long-term Consequences Continue to Worry a Third of the Population**
Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic, a third of the population remains concerned about the long-term consequences of the virus. According to the National Health Survey, despite improvements in lifestyle habits such as healthier eating, increased physical activity, and reduced smoking, 35% of people over 55 years old recognize suffering from depressive symptoms, compared to 24.4% of men. Additionally, 16.8% of people over 55 years old have difficulties performing basic activities. The survey also found that while 74% of Spaniards report having good or very good health, the prevalence of chronic diseases remains high, with 52.4% of the adult population using prescription medications and 14.8% using medications without a prescription. Furthermore, 25% of citizens had to visit emergency services in the last year, and 82.4% of citizens visited a doctor in the last year.

**Five Years of COVID-19: A Balance of Provisional Conclusions**
It has been five years since the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a standstill. The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, spread rapidly and infected millions of people worldwide, claiming over seven million lives. The pandemic had a profound impact on society, causing widespread fear, economic disruption, and a significant loss of life. However, the development and distribution of vaccines brought hope, and many countries began to see a decline in severe cases and deaths. Despite this, the pandemic has left a lasting legacy, including a significant increase in mental health issues, economic disruption, and a reevaluation of what constitutes essential work. The pandemic has also highlighted the need for global cooperation and a more equitable distribution of resources. As the world moves forward, it is clear that the pandemic has transformed many aspects of our lives, and we must learn from its lessons to build a more resilient future. 'The pandemic was a brutal teacher, but its lessons (on health, inequality, and cooperation) are things we cannot afford to ignore,' the article concludes.

**Five years post-Covid: Reflecting on accounting’s 'new normal'**
The accounting industry has undergone significant changes over the last five years, accelerated by the global pandemic. According to Josh Zweig and Chad Davis, Co-Founders of LiveCA, a Canadian remote accounting firm, technology is advancing rapidly, and baby boomers are retiring, leading to a new generation of accountants taking over. The pandemic forced traditional firms to adapt their practices, and technology and client advisory are now key components of modern accounting practices. As a result, accountants are no longer just number-crunchers, but trusted advisors, technology integrators, and virtual CFOs. To succeed, firms must invest in digital tools, high-quality data, and meaningful client advisory services. As Ben Richmond, Managing Director, North America at Xero, notes, 'the last five years taught us that the future of accounting is being determined by early adopters, those who adapt to meet clients where they are.'

**Five Years After the Pandemic: Lessons Learned and the Road Ahead**
Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic, experts reflect on the lessons learned from the confinement measures implemented in Spain. The pandemic caused widespread disruption, with 14 million people infected and 122,000 deaths. The confinement, which lasted for 99 days, was a radical measure that saved lives but also had a significant emotional and economic impact. The experts agree that the confinement was necessary, but also acknowledge that it was not perfect and that there were lessons to be learned. They highlight the importance of coordination and communication between scientists, politicians, and the public. The article also mentions the development of new tools and strategies to combat future pandemics, such as the 'Enfermedad X' project, which aims to have a vaccine available in 100 days. However, the experts also warn of the dangers of misinformation and the rise of anti-vaccine movements, citing the example of Donald Trump and his secretary of Health, Robert F. Kennedy. 'Tener a un negacionista de la pandemia y a un antivacunas al frente de la principal potencia del mundo y en contra de la OMS y de la comunidad científica puede hacernos perder el camino que hemos andado en estos años', warns Bengoa. 'Having a pandemic denier and an anti-vaxxer at the head of the world's leading power and against the WHO and the scientific community can make us lose the path we have walked in these years', warns Bengoa.

**Five Years of COVID-19: Positive Lessons Learned**
Five years have passed since the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020. According to the WHO, over 777 million people worldwide have been infected with the virus, with 7 million directly dying from it, and a staggering 15 million total deaths related to the virus. The pandemic has had devastating consequences, but some analysts point to positive lessons learned from this dark period. Dr. Elke Van Hoof, a stress and trauma expert, calls the lockdowns 'the largest psychological experiment in history.' Four positive aspects of the pandemic's legacy are highlighted: 1) The rapid development of effective vaccines, thanks to the mRNA technology, which has revolutionized vaccine development worldwide. 2) The pandemic has accelerated the development of remote and hybrid work, with many governments implementing progressive legislation on remote work, such as the 'right to disconnect.' 3) The pandemic has increased awareness of the importance of mental health, with people learning to prioritize their well-being and recognize the interconnectedness of their physical and emotional health. 4) The pandemic has led to a reevaluation of education, with a shift towards more flexible and hybrid learning models. Dr. Margaret Harris, a WHO expert on public health, says, 'We've seen an incredibly rapid development of technologies.' Dr. Devi Sridhar, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, says that the pandemic has taught us to identify and respond to new virus outbreaks more effectively. 'Our scientific potential has increased, our platforms have become more advanced,' she says. 'If at the beginning of the pandemic we were wondering if there would be a vaccine, now we're wondering how quickly we can produce it.'

**Five Years of COVID-19: Positive Results from the 'Largest Psychological Experiment in History'**
It has been five years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which can be considered the 'largest psychological experiment in history'. Governments took unprecedented measures, imposing lockdowns and essentially forcing people into prolonged quarantines, lasting several months. In total, lockdowns affected 2.6 billion people. According to experts, the pandemic has had a profound impact on people's mental health, with many experiencing anxiety, depression, and other psychological issues. As Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, 'The pandemic has been a game-changer in terms of our understanding of the impact of isolation and confinement on mental health.'

**Five years after the pandemic, the world is poorly prepared for another one**
Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is poorly prepared for another one. Between 500 and 1,000 people are dying every week from COVID, and healthcare systems are struggling to cope with a combination of flu, RSV, and COVID. Experts warn that we are not controlling the diseases we can control, such as polio and measles, and that the next pandemic could be a virus we have yet to meet. However, there are grounds for hope. The COVID-19 vaccines were a remarkable outcome of the pandemic, and innovative studies like Recover and React have shown a way forward for future pandemics. To prepare for the next pandemic, we need to strengthen global public health, maintain research capacity, and have politicians who will lead by example and give clear messages about vaccines and public health measures. As the author notes, 'if I have an infectious disease, that puts you and your family or country at risk. The virus does not care where you were born, what you believe in, or your political views.'

**5 years on from Covid - what did we learn and what was the true cost?**
A recent report has reignited the debate over the origins of Covid-19, with some scientists suggesting that the virus may have been engineered in a lab. Jason Bannan, a former senior scientist at the FBI, claims that the agency found evidence of a lab leak but was not allowed to brief the president. The FBI's findings were in contrast to other US intelligence agencies, which concluded that a natural origin was more likely. However, a Vanity Fair investigation has uncovered evidence that the EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit organization funded by the US government, was involved in risky virus research in Wuhan, China. The report suggests that the organization's research may have contributed to the outbreak of Covid-19. Despite the controversy, the true cost of the pandemic remains unclear, with estimates suggesting that 20 million people may have died globally, rather than the officially reported 7 million. The article concludes that 5 years after the pandemic, we still have few answers and less solutions, and that the next pandemic is brewing in America, with potentially devastating consequences.
