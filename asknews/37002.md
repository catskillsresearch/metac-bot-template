**Elon Musk Offers Free Internet: Starlink to Connect Smartphones Without Cost Until July 2025**
Elon Musk announced that some smartphone models will be able to connect to the Starlink satellite internet network for free until July 2025. This initiative aims to eliminate barriers to internet access in rural, remote, or areas with poor infrastructure, allowing more people to connect without relying on traditional mobile phone networks. Starlink, developed by SpaceX, has been recognized for its ability to provide connectivity in areas where terrestrial networks do not reach. The new feature will allow users in remote areas without access to traditional mobile networks to send text messages, share their location, and even contact emergency services without the need for a nearby mobile phone tower. This improvement will make a significant difference in rural areas and other remote regions where internet connections are limited or non-existent. However, not all devices will have access to this free service, and it will depend on the device model and software update installed. 'T-Mobile SpaceX' will appear on the screen when the phone connects to the Starlink satellite network. It is essential to note that devices must have the latest software version installed to access this network. Initially, this connectivity will only allow text messaging, location sharing, and emergency service contact. In a second phase, the functionality is expected to expand to include voice calls and internet navigation, increasing the utility of the Starlink network.

**Starlink Waiting Lists in Argentina: What's Happening with Elon Musk's Satellite Internet**
The demand for Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet service, has exceeded the available capacity in areas such as the AMBA and Córdoba, resulting in a waiting list for new users. Even those who have already purchased the installation kit cannot activate their connection immediately. This is because the satellite network is saturated in these regions, and Starlink blocks new activations to maintain the quality of service for existing customers. The waiting list system allows users to register for access when space becomes available, either due to expanded coverage or users leaving the service. According to Starlink's official availability map, the following areas have waiting lists in May 2025: The company offers two main alternatives for users: mobile or maritime plans, which have different technical conditions and higher prices. Existing customers are not affected. There is no confirmed date for the end of the waiting lists in saturated areas, as it depends on factors such as the launch rate of new satellites, the expansion of terrestrial infrastructure, and the evolution of demand in each region. Starlink has applied similar restrictions in other parts of the world, such as the US, Canada, and Europe, and has restored availability in some cases by reinforcing the satellite network. However, in high-concentration areas like the AMBA, the situation may persist if more technical resources are not added. In areas where Starlink is not available, users may consider other technologies with different characteristics.

**Safaricom Considers Satellite Partnerships to Defend Market Share in Kenya's High-Speed Internet**
Safaricom, a leading telecommunications company in Kenya, is considering partnerships with satellite internet providers to expand high-speed internet access to underserved areas, according to CEO Peter Ndegwa. This move comes as global players like Starlink gain ground in the rural internet market in Kenya, where fixed infrastructure is limited. 'We focus on providing fixed broadband solutions through fiber, fixed wireless, satellite, and other evolving technologies,' Ndegwa said. 'We are also studying the possibility of partnering with satellite to offer more options and access to our customers.' Safaricom holds 36.1% of the Kenyan broadband market, but faces increasing competition. The internet penetration rate in Kenya is only 40%, leaving room for growth, particularly in rural areas where traditional infrastructure is harder to deploy. Starlink, owned by SpaceX, has rapidly expanded its presence in Kenya since its entry in 2023, reaching over 19,000 users and becoming the seventh internet service provider in the country by the end of 2024. Its satellite model has proven effective in reaching remote areas, a segment where traditional ISPs struggle to compete. The regional agreement between Starlink and Airtel Africa, covering nine countries including Kenya, has increased pressure on Safaricom. In response, regulatory authorities are considering increasing satellite licensing fees and introducing a revenue-based tax, partly in response to complaints from local ISPs, including Safaricom, about market distortions caused by Starlink's pricing strategy. While Safaricom has not yet confirmed a satellite partner, a collaboration with Starlink remains possible, despite regulatory and competition issues. The operator's plans for broadband expansion, including satellite, are crucial to maintaining its market lead and supporting growth beyond mobile services. The next phase of competition in Kenya's internet sector may depend on the ability to serve hard-to-reach customers at scale.

**Tchad: Starlink Authorized, Bringing Internet to Remote Areas**
The Tchadian government has officially announced that Starlink, a satellite internet provider owned by Elon Musk's SpaceX, is now authorized to operate in the country. According to Michel Boukar, the Minister of Telecommunications, Digital Economy, and Digitalization of Administration, Starlink will provide a reliable and fast internet connection, even in the most remote areas of the country. Currently, the deployment of fiber optic infrastructure only covers 6,000 km of the country's territory, leaving many areas without internet access. Boukar estimates that Starlink will 'provoke a revolution in telecommunications in Chad' and enable remote learning, connect universities and healthcare centers, and provide solutions to the population. However, some are concerned about the price of access to Starlink, with Jean Bosco Manga, a member of the Internet without Borders platform, warning that if the market is taken over by groups, it will not benefit ordinary citizens. Boukar has assured that negotiations have been held to ensure affordable prices for all income levels.
