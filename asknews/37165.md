Yuri Kuznetsov, the founder of 'Sutochno.ru', a leading online service for booking short-term rentals, has announced plans to go public with an IPO in 2025. The company has seen significant growth in recent years, with revenue increasing by 1.8 times to 3.12 billion rubles in 2023, and net profit growing fivefold to 464.4 million rubles. Kuznetsov attributes the company's success to its focus on providing a high-quality service, with a strong emphasis on customer support and a user-friendly platform.

The company has also seen an increase in the number of listings, with over 320,000 properties available on the platform.

He also notes that the company's focus on providing a high-quality service has helped to build trust with customers and increase loyalty. The company's plans for the future include expanding its presence in the market and increasing its revenue through the IPO.

**Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon**
Discord, a popular communications platform, is planning an initial public offering (IPO) this year, according to a report by Bloomberg.

**Discord and other tech firms are eying IPOs, despite stock market chaos - San Francisco Business Times**
Despite the stock market chaos, tech firms like Discord are planning to go public through IPOs in 2025. However, the plunging Nasdaq has raised concerns about the feasibility of these plans. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen 8.7% in the past month due to uncertainty over President Trump's trade policies. Some tech leaders, including Chamath Palihapitiya, are attempting to spin the decline in capital markets as a positive, suggesting that it may make it easier for people to buy stocks at lower prices. Palihapitiya wrote on X, 'Don’t presume that the stock market going up is a useful barometer anymore, in fact, it going down may be a better signal for his popularity.'

**Brace yourself for Discord to get worse: Reports swirl that the company is in talks with bankers about opening itself up to shareholders**
Discord may be planning an initial public offering (IPO) as soon as this year, according to reports from the New York Times. The company's valuation was around $15 billion in 2021, and an IPO could bring in significant profits for the company. However, the author of the article is skeptical about the potential consequences of an IPO, citing the risk of 'enshittification' - prioritizing shareholder demands over user experience and degrading the quality of the service. The author notes that this has happened to other companies in the past and is preparing to move on to a new service if Discord's quality declines. A Discord spokesperson declined to comment on the possibility of an IPO, and the talks with investment bankers are still exploratory.

**Discord and Klarna suddenly set to go public - these companies could be next**
Discord and Klarna are in talks with investment banks over possible IPO moves in 2025. Discord, a communications platform widely used by gamers, could be the next big company to IPO in the States, four years after their initial plans to do so. Klarna, a payments business, is aiming for a $15bn valuation in a New York listing and could file as soon as next week. According to a spokesperson for Discord, 'We understand there is a lot of interest around Discord's future plans, but we do not comment on rumours or speculation.' The IPO market has been relatively underwhelming in the UK and the US, though analysts had forecast a rebound in 2025. Several companies, including Ebury, Shawbrook, and Waterstones, are also considering IPOs this year. The battle for listings between the LSE and NYSE has seen several depart for America chasing higher valuations.

**Discord Considers IPO Amid Market Shifts**
Discord is reportedly in preliminary talks with investment banks about a potential initial public offering (IPO), according to The New York Times and Financial Times. The platform had previously considered an IPO in 2021, but put plans on hold due to market volatility. With interest rates decreasing and a more favorable policy towards tech companies, Discord may now be considering an IPO in 2025. The company's valuation in 2021 was around $15 billion, and it has over 200 million active users per month, primarily gamers. However, Discord has faced issues in Russia, where it was blocked in October 2024 for failing to remove prohibited content and violating Russian laws. Other tech companies, such as Klarna and CoreWeave, are also preparing for IPOs in the US.
