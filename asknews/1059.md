**Bricks Fall from Chelyabinsk Building, Damaging Cars and Raising Safety Concerns**
In Chelyabinsk, bricks fell from a 17-story building and damaged parked cars in the courtyard, according to the Chuvashia prosecutor's office. The bricks fell from the technical, non-residential floor of the building, which was constructed in 2019. The prosecutor's office is conducting an investigation and plans to invite experts to inspect other structures. This incident comes after a similar incident in St. Petersburg in April, where a child was hospitalized with severe injuries after a section of the roof's facade fell on their head. The prosecutor's office has launched a criminal case under Article 238 of the Criminal Code, which carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison. Five days later, another similar incident occurred in St. Petersburg, where a 21-year-old woman was hospitalized with severe head injuries after a metal window fragment fell on her. 'The safety of citizens is a top priority,' said the prosecutor's office, 'and we will take all necessary measures to prevent such incidents in the future.'

**Asteroid 2024 YR4 Collision with Moon Could Cause Regional Catastrophe**
Astronom Leonid Elenin stated that the potential collision of asteroid 2024 YR4 with the Moon would release an energy equivalent to 20 Chelyabinsk meteorites. 'The explosion of asteroid 2024 YR4 is estimated to be 7-8 megatons in TNT equivalent, which is approximately 20 times more powerful than the Chelyabinsk meteorite explosion', Elenin said. However, if the asteroid were to collide with Earth, it would not lead to the extinction of humanity, but rather a 'regional catastrophe'. If it were to collide with the Moon, a meteor shower of debris could potentially hit Earth. According to scientists, the asteroid is expected to approach Earth's orbit on December 22, 2032.

**Asteroid 2024 YR4: A Potential Disaster Looms**
A newly discovered asteroid, 2024 YR4, is on a collision course with Earth and could potentially cause catastrophic damage. The asteroid, estimated to be up to 90 meters in size, is traveling at 38,000 km/h and could create an explosion that would devastate entire cities. While the current probability of impact is 2%, experts warn that the danger could increase as more data becomes available. The asteroid's trajectory is still not precisely determined, and scientists are working to gather more information using the James Webb Telescope. If the asteroid were to collide with a populated area, it could lead to a disaster of historic proportions, according to meteorologist Dominik Jung. The asteroid's potential impact could also trigger a tsunami if it were to enter an ocean, or a fireball and shockwaves if it were to land on land. A similar event occurred in 2013 when a 20-meter asteroid exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk, causing significant damage to over 7,000 buildings.

**Chelyabinsk Meteor: A Day of Destruction in 2013**
On February 15, 2013, a meteor exploded over the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia, causing widespread damage and injuring nearly 1,500 people. According to 'space', the Chelyabinsk meteor was the most powerful meteor to hit the Earth in over 100 years, releasing an energy equivalent to 500,000 tons of TNT. The explosion was so bright that it exceeded the brightness of the sun for a short period, and no one saw the massive asteroid coming. The meteor, which was 60 feet in diameter, caused a shockwave that shattered windows over an area of 517 square kilometers. The meteor entered the Earth's atmosphere at a speed of over 60 times the speed of sound and exploded into countless fragments, with the largest pieces later found in Lake Chebarkul. 'It was a great day of destruction,' said the article, 'but fortunately, no one was killed.'

**The Chelyabinsk Meteor: A Cosmic Event that Shook a City**
On February 15, 2013, a meteor exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, injuring over 1,000 people and causing significant damage. The meteor, estimated to be 18 meters in diameter and weighing 11,000 tons, was a 4 billion-year-old piece of space debris that entered Earth's atmosphere. The explosion shattered windows and damaged buildings, but miraculously, no one was killed. The meteor's fragments were scattered across the region, with some being collected by locals and sold to collectors, scientists, and museums. The largest fragment, weighing over 500 kg, was recovered from the bottom of Lake Chebarkul in the fall of 2013. The meteor was later named 'Chelyabinsk' after the city where it fell. The incident raised questions about the lack of warning systems for such events, with some speculating that the meteor was too small to be detected by telescopes. The governor of Chelyabinsk Oblast, Mikhail Yurevich, declared February 15 a 'second birthday' for the region, despite the devastating impact of the meteor. The incident highlighted the importance of scientific progress and the need for better detection systems to prevent similar disasters in the future.

**The Chelyabinsk Event: A Meteor Shower that Injured 1,491 People**
It has been twelve years since the Chelyabinsk event, where a meteor shower fell on the Russian city. On February 15, 2013, at 9:20 local time, a sudden explosion was heard, followed by a series of explosions in the air. A meteor had broken apart in the sky, and its fragments had fallen to the ground, producing intense shockwaves throughout the territory. The Chelyabinsk event, the most intense since the Tunguska event in 1908, did not cause any deaths, but nearly 1,500 people were injured. According to the astronomers, the meteor was visible between 95 and 12 kilometers of altitude for a total of 17 seconds. It was generated by a small asteroid of about 19 meters in diameter and 12,000 tons in mass, which, upon entering the atmosphere, slowed down, lost energy, and fragmented into multiple pieces. The shockwaves generated by the explosions of the fragments caused the most problems. The consequences of the event were 1,491 injured, 112 hospitalized, and 2 in critical condition. No one was directly hit by the asteroid, but the shockwave from the impact caused the explosion of many windows, which shattered and injured people inside the buildings. Additionally, 180 people reported eye pain due to the intense light, and about 70 had difficulty seeing, although only temporarily. 20 people reported burns due to UV radiation, as if they had been at the beach for many hours. After the explosion, phone lines were saturated with people calling for help or to check on their loved ones.

**The Chelyabinsk Asteroid: A Wake-Up Call for Near-Earth Object Monitoring**
On February 15, 2013, the residents of Chelyabinsk, Russia, experienced an extraordinary and frightening event: an asteroid exploded in the sky above the city, generating a massive shockwave that caused widespread damage and injured over 1,600 people. This event reminded the world of the importance of monitoring near-Earth objects. The asteroid, about the size of a house, entered the Earth's atmosphere at a speed of approximately 18 km per second. At an altitude of about 23 km above the ground, the immense pressure and heat generated by its speed caused its explosion, releasing an estimated 440,000 tons of TNT energy. The resulting shockwave damaged buildings in an area of over 500 square kilometers and shattered the windows of thousands of homes, causing most of the injuries due to broken glass. The Chelyabinsk event was the largest recorded atmospheric impact since the Tunguska event in 1908. Although the explosion's power was immense, fortunately, there were no direct fatalities. However, it highlighted the vulnerability of our planet to asteroid impacts and the need to develop strategies for detecting and deflecting potential future threats. Following this incident, the scientific community has intensified efforts to identify and monitor potentially hazardous asteroids. The NASA and other space agencies have implemented programs like the Near-Earth Object Program, dedicated to cataloging these celestial bodies. Additionally, techniques for deflecting asteroids on a collision course with Earth, such as kinetic impact missions and gravitational deflection systems, are being studied. The Chelyabinsk asteroid has shown that cosmic impacts are not just science fiction scenarios, but real events that can have significant consequences.

**The Chelyabinsk Meteor: A Powerful Explosion that Injured Over 1,000 People**
On February 15, 2013, a meteor exploded over the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia, injuring over 1,000 people. The meteor, estimated to be 15 meters in diameter and weighing 10,000 tons, exploded at an altitude of 30-50 km, releasing an energy equivalent to 30 times the atomic bomb of Nagasaki. The explosion was so powerful that it shattered windows and caused widespread damage. Fortunately, the majority of the energy was absorbed by the atmosphere. The event was captured on dashcam videos, which helped astronomers determine the origin of the meteor: the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. This event led to the development of modern asteroid detection and defense systems, such as NASA's DART mission, which successfully deflected the orbit of a small asteroid. Events like this occur every 60 years, with the last similar event being the Tunguska event in 1908. 'The energy released by the shockwave was equivalent to 30 times the atomic bomb of Nagasaki,' said an astronomer. 'If the impact had occurred at a lower altitude, or if the asteroid had hit the ground, we would be talking about a catastrophic event without precedent in human history.'
