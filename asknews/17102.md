**The AI Edge in the 2025 Trade Reset: How Small Businesses Can Adapt and Lead**
The 2025 tariffs have created a new era of trade policy, with small businesses facing both challenges and opportunities. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key tool for small businesses to adapt and lead in this new landscape. AI can analyze supplier networks, simulate tariff impacts, and identify lower-cost or local alternatives, reducing risk and increasing resilience. For example, a Texas-based home goods distributor used AI software to identify new North American suppliers after tariff changes increased costs from overseas partners. AI-driven insights also help small exporters identify new markets and buyer trends, empowering businesses to proactively pivot. A 2024 study from Nature Communications showed that AI-assisted exporters expanded into new markets 22% faster than peers without such tools. Small businesses are central to the U.S. economy, representing nearly 44% of GDP and creating two-thirds of new jobs. With AI as a backbone, small businesses can be smarter, faster, and more secure than ever before, leading the way in this new global order.

**White House to Continue Restrictions on Exporting AI Chips to China Amid Calls for Relaxation**
Sriram Krishnan, a senior policy advisor for artificial intelligence at the White House, stated that the US will continue to prevent advanced AI technology from falling into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, despite calls from Wei-Da CEO Huang Renxun to relax restrictions on exporting AI chips to China. Krishnan said, 'We clearly have a great deal of respect for Huang Renxun.' However, he also expressed concerns that if these GPU chips were to enter China, 'something bad could happen.' Despite the Trump administration's concerns about the security risks of relaxing restrictions, Krishnan also agreed with Huang's view that the restrictions on other US trade partners need to be re-examined. The Trump administration is revoking the AI diffusion rules established by the Biden administration and plans to introduce new regulations. On May 13, the US Department of Commerce announced the formal revocation of the 'AI Diffusion Rule' and simultaneously introduced several measures to strengthen export controls on global semiconductors, particularly AI chips. Krishnan stated, 'For other regions in the world, we hope that US AI technology stack can be consistent from GPU to models to all top-level components.' He added, 'On this point, Huang Renxun and I are in agreement.' Huang Renxun had urged the US to lower its barriers to selling AI chips to China at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, saying that the current export restrictions are a failure. He warned that the competition in China is becoming increasingly fierce and that the company's revenue from China has fallen to half of what it was before the export restrictions were implemented.

**Nvidia CEO Huang says US AI chip export controls a 'failure' | Macau Business**
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that US export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China have been a 'failure', as local companies have developed cutting-edge technology. Huang said that Nvidia's share of China's AI chip market has fallen to 50% from nearly 95% at the beginning of the Biden administration. He attributed the success of local companies to the export control, which gave them government support and accelerated their development. Huang noted that companies would use alternative options if they couldn't get Nvidia's chips. He also praised China-based DeepSeek, saying it has increased the amount of computing needed by 'maybe 100 to 1000 times', leading to GPUs melting down worldwide. Huang estimated that China's AI market will be worth $50 billion in 2026 and expressed regret that Nvidia cannot participate in this opportunity.

**China Warns of Legal Consequences for Complying with US Ban on Huawei AI Chips**
The Chinese government has warned that it will hold companies and individuals accountable if they comply with the US government's ban on the use of Huawei's artificial intelligence (AI) chips. The US Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced on May 13 that using Huawei's AI chip, Ascend, anywhere in the world would be a violation of US export controls. This move has sparked concerns about the intensification of the US-China AI competition. Malaysia, which had planned to introduce 3,000 Huawei AI servers by 2026, has already withdrawn its plan just a day after announcing it. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that the US move is 'a typical protectionist practice' and 'a serious infringement on the global semiconductor industry's supply chain stability and the rights of other countries to develop advanced computing and AI technologies.' They also emphasized that 'any organization or individual that implements or supports this measure will be subject to investigation and prosecution under China's Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law.'

**US Will Retain China Chip Restrictions Despite AI Policy Shift: Adviser**
The United States will maintain export controls on China despite a shift in AI policy, according to Sriram Krishnan, a senior White House policy adviser on artificial intelligence. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has called for easing restrictions, citing a $15 billion estimated loss due to the restrictions. Huang stated that export controls have reduced Nvidia's market share in China from 95% to 50% and estimated the Chinese market to be $50 billion next year. However, Krishnan emphasized that the administration is concerned about the potential risks of American AI technology being used in China, saying 'most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.' Huang agreed that the limited diffusion approach had to change, but emphasized the importance of American companies developing and using AI technology in China.

**White House Dismisses Nvidia CEO's Call to Relax Chip Export Restrictions**
A senior White House official stated that the Trump administration will continue to prevent advanced AI technology from falling into Chinese hands. The official dismissed Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's call to relax restrictions on chip exports to China. White House AI policy advisor Sriram Krishnan said, 'We certainly respect Jensen Huang, but as for China, I think there are still widespread concerns across the board that these GPUs could pose a risk if they enter China.' The Trump administration still believes that exporting AI chips to China poses a security risk, but Krishnan said that the administration agrees with Huang's view that restrictions on other US trade partners need to be reviewed. The Trump administration is revoking and plans to replace the AI export rules implemented during the Biden administration, which Krishnan said created 'countries with GPUs and countries without GPUs.' Krishnan noted, 'In terms of the rest of the world, we want the US AI stack, from GPUs to models to the top, to be the same, and on that point, Jensen Huang and I are in complete agreement.' This comment came hours after Huang publicly criticized the US's chip export restrictions to China. Huang said at a press conference in Taipei that the export restrictions have forced Nvidia to lose its dominance in the Chinese market, and that Chinese companies like Huawei have filled the gap. He said, 'In the end, export controls are a failure.' Huang predicted that China will occupy a $50 billion market opportunity by 2026. He said, 'China has 50% of the world's AI developers, and what's important is that when they develop architectures, they will use Nvidia or at least US technology.' Krishnan mentioned the US companies' announcements of multiple projects in Saudi Arabia and the UAE during Trump's visit to the Middle East as new measures to make it easier for US allies to access AI technology. He emphasized that these agreements will still include security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.

**Full-Stack AI Infrastructure Not A Government Initiative, Says MITI**
The Ministry of Investment, Trade, and Industry (MITI) has clarified that the Strategic Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure, announced earlier this week, was not a government initiative. The project, involving Skyvast Corporation and Huawei Technologies, was not developed, endorsed, or coordinated by the government. MITI stated that while the government aims to build AI-based infrastructure, significant projects require proper legal, operational, and reputational processes. The ministry also emphasized Malaysia's commitment to complying with export control laws and national security directives. Deputy Comms Minister Teo Nie Ching's previous claims about Huawei's Ascend GPU-powered AI servers and 3,000 units to be deployed by 2026 have been retracted, and a Huawei representative denied selling Ascend chips to the Malaysian government. The project's future is uncertain, with the US government's attention drawn to the initiative due to concerns about China's influence in foreign AI markets.

**How the US 2025 Export Controls on Advanced AI and Semiconductor Technologies Reshape Global...**
The US 2025 export controls on advanced AI and semiconductor technologies are restricting access and altering international collaboration dynamics. A tiered licensing system categorises countries based on their alignment with US interests, affecting who can import advanced AI chips and under what conditions. This has ripple effects on international partnerships, research collaboration, and economic growth in the AI sector. As one researcher notes, 'These controls influence not just trade but the very pace and direction of AI innovation worldwide.' The regulations were introduced by the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in January 2025 to prevent sensitive AI chips and model weights from falling into the wrong hands.

**Anthropic firm urges more aggressive export controls before advanced AI emerges**
Anthropic, an artificial intelligence safety company, is urging the U.S. to impose stronger export controls on advanced semiconductors to prevent China from achieving advanced artificial intelligence first. Anthropic believes that breakthrough AI technology will emerge in the next few years and that export controls are necessary to slow China's progress. According to Anthropic, the U.S. currently leads in advanced semiconductor technology, and export controls can capitalize on the trend of computing power doubling every two years, slowing China's progress. Anthropic estimates that powerful artificial intelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence or AGI, is poised to emerge as soon as the end of next year and likely before the end of 2027. 'A useful conceptual framework is to envision powerful AI as equivalent to 'a country of geniuses in a datacenter' -- a concentration of intellectual capability that fundamentally transforms our understanding of what is possible,' Anthropic said. Anthropic believes that any pause or weakening of export controls would give China an opportunity to stockpile advanced semiconductors and accelerate its efforts to close the gap just as transformative AI is expected to emerge.

**Nvidia, the chip giant caught between the US and China**
US restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new, as the Joe Biden administration imposed export controls on advanced semiconductors in 2022. Nvidia designed the H20 chip to comply with these restrictions. However, the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has raised concerns that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs. Chinese technology companies like Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance have outstanding orders for the H20 chips, but Nvidia expects to lose $5.5bn due to the new curbs. According to Chim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, alternative AI chips are being developed in China, and the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips. Lee said, 'It will introduce challenges to China's AI scene, but it won't massively slow down China's AI development and deployment.'

**In AI chip trade war with China, there’s one big mistake US can’t make – CNBC**
The success of Chinese generative AI app DeepSeek has raised concerns about the effectiveness of US export controls on advanced AI chips. Despite the US government's efforts to limit the sale of chips to China, DeepSeek was able to create a rival AI model using a combination of clever software and hardware engineering. Experts warn that the US strategy of trying to control innovation through export controls may not be effective and could even backfire, leading to the development of a global AI ecosystem outside the US. The US government's AI diffusion rules, which aim to regulate the global diffusion of AI chips and models, have been criticized by tech companies and policy experts as seeking to create a 'centrally planned global computing economy.' Vice President JD Vance has stated that the US will safeguard its AI and chips, and block efforts to 'weaponize' them, but experts warn that a focus on stopping the competition may not be enough to keep pace with innovation. The debate is ongoing over how far the US government should go in blocking access to US chip technology.

**After DeepSeek, the AI version of a global trade war is one the U.S. won’t win easily**
The U.S. government's attempt to limit AI development in China through chip export controls has been shown to be ineffective by the success of DeepSeek's generative AI app. The app rivals the best AI offerings from U.S. companies, despite the export controls. Brookings analysis argues that the AI diffusion rules seek to create a 'centrally planned global computing economy.' Experts warn that restricting exports may not work and could even backfire, potentially spurring the development of a global AI ecosystem outside the U.S. and pushing more nations into building stronger technology ties with China. 'A decade from now, we will look back and recognize how quixotic it was for the U.S. government of the mid-2020s to attempt to limit the ability of people in 150 countries to perform fast multiplications,' wrote John Villasenor. Martin Chorzempa said, 'I worry that we will have a knee-jerk response to ratchet up controls heavily, before we fully think through the trade-offs.' The AI diffusion rules have a 120-day comment period that ends on May 15, unless Trump reverses or revises the rule before then. Vice President JD Vance said, 'This administration will block such efforts, full stop,' to 'weaponize' AI and chips. Trump's executive order suggests he could take a hard line on chip restrictions to China.

**How do Chinese AI bots stack up against ChatGPT? We put them to the test**
Chinese AI companies are rapidly advancing, with DeepSeek's innovative approach to cost-effective generative AI changing the tech-geopolitics landscape. According to Chen, Chinese AI focuses on 'cost benefit,' with lower training and inference costs. This could lead to more Chinese AI models tackling advanced reasoning tasks by 2025. However, analysts note that access to high-end hardware, particularly Nvidia's advanced AI chips, remains a key hurdle for Chinese developers. Dr Marina Zhang stated, 'US export controls limit the ability of Chinese tech companies, forcing many to rely on older or lower-performance alternatives.' Despite this, companies like DeepSeek have found creative ways to optimize hardware and train large AI models efficiently.

**The United States, artificial intelligence and export controls**
The United States has imposed new export control restrictions on artificial intelligence (AI) technology, aiming to ensure that AI development 'runs on American rails'. The restrictions, outlined in the 'Interim Final Rule on Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion', establish a tiered licensing framework for the export of advanced AI chips from the US. The framework divides the world into three 'tiers' of countries, with Australia classified as a 'Tier One' partner. The new rule is effective from January 13, 2025, but has a grace period until May 15, 2025. The US aims to encourage economic development of these technologies within the US and/or its close partners. However, the new controls have drawn criticism from organisations such as NVIDIA, who warn that the restrictions will 'derail innovation and economic growth worldwide'. The European Union has also criticised the Interim Final Rule, citing concerns that excluded countries will instead deal with the US' rivals. China has expressed its opposition to the new rules, suggesting that the US has extended its 'extraterritorial jurisdiction' and creating obstacles for third parties engaged in 'normal trade' with China.

Key changes include: (1) new controls on the most advanced AI model weights, (2) updated controls on advanced computing integrated circuits (ACICs), and (3) updated security requirements for storing and building ACICs and covered AI model weights outside the United States. BIS will enforce the rule starting May 15, 2025, except for certain security requirements, which kick in on January 15, 2026. The public is invited to submit comments to BIS.
