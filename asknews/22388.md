**EU Countries Approve Plans for CO2 Border Taxes**
The 27 EU member states have agreed to the European Commission's plans to exempt most companies in Europe from the planned CO2 border taxes starting from 2026, according to the European Union's Council. The relevant ministers approved the proposed changes at a meeting in Brussels. The EU states still need to negotiate the final details with the European Parliament. The European Parliament had previously signaled its support for exempting more than 90% of companies from the taxes. The new EU system, known as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), will only cover companies that import more than 50 tons of goods per year. However, this would still account for 99% of the emissions generated by imported products, as previously stated in a draft. The CO2 border taxes aim to protect European companies from unfair competition from countries that do not charge climate protection fees. The EU requires companies in the EU to balance the CO2 emissions in imported goods through the tax. This should also prevent the relocation of production to non-European countries. The taxes will be paid through emissions certificates, which importers must purchase in Europe. It is expected that importers will demand price discounts from their suppliers in China, South America, or the US, or switch to European products, which are already burdened with the purchase of CO2 pollution rights. Initially, CO2-intensive goods such as cement or steel will be affected, but the scope is expected to be expanded to all industrial goods by 2030.

**BRIEF-UK Should Expand Army's Size When Funding Allows, Review...**
According to the UK's Strategic Defence Review, the country should increase the number of regular army personnel when funding allows, likely in the next parliament. The review also recommends reducing the Ministry of Defence's civil service costs by at least 10% by 2030. The authors of the review state that their plan can be accelerated if needed in a turbulent world. The review emphasizes the importance of backing Ukraine in its pursuit of a durable political settlement, as well as learning from its experience in land warfare, drone, and hybrid conflict. The review also highlights the key role of the US-China relationship in a more multipolar world marked by 'great power' competition. Additionally, the review notes that China is seeking to establish dominance in the Indo-Pacific, erode US influence, and put pressure on the rules-based order. The review recommends keeping military-to-military channels of communication with China and prioritizing the Middle East and Indo-Pacific as the next regions for defence engagement after the Euro-Atlantic.

**Britain facing race to avoid $1 billion in EU carbon tax costs**
Britain is facing a race to link its carbon market to the EU's before the EU's carbon border tax kicks in next year, to avoid UK companies facing annual bills of around 800 million pounds ($1.08 billion). Market experts say it's unlikely to happen in time, with the earliest possible link being 2028, but more likely 2029 or 2030. The UK government says avoiding the EU's carbon border tariff would save 800 million pounds a year, but EU officials say Britain needs to link its carbon market to the EU's to get exempted. Technical hurdles, such as adjusting national rules and aligning emissions permit auctions, need to be resolved before a link can happen. Industry experts say these issues are technically straightforward to resolve, but the UK needs to act quickly to avoid the costs.

**Are Countries' New Climate Plans Ambitious Enough? What We Know So Far**
The World Resources Institute analyzed the initial submissions of countries' new climate commitments, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), for 2025. The results show that while some countries, such as the U.S., U.K., and Brazil, have made ambitious commitments, many others, including major emitters like the EU and China, have yet to submit their NDCs. The analysis found that the new NDCs submitted so far have made a noticeable but modest dent in the 2035 'emissions gap', with a projected reduction of 1.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) by 2035 compared to 2030. However, this is far from what's needed to keep global warming within safe limits, and many countries, including developed and wealthy economies, have not strengthened their 2030 targets. The analysis also found that some countries, such as the U.K. and Brazil, have set ambitious targets, while others, such as Canada, have made only marginal increases to their targets. The report concludes that much greater ambition and action are needed to narrow the emissions gap and keep global temperature goals within reach.

**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**Britain to get defence boost to send message to Moscow  --  and possibly Trump**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with Starmer saying 'we have to recognise the world has changed' and 'with greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.' The Government will accept all 62 recommendations made in the strategic defence review, including building new nuclear-powered attack submarines and creating an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defence Secretary John Healey said the changes would send 'a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and even 3% falls short of what some leaders in NATO think is needed to deter Russia from future attacks on its neighbors.

**UK PM: We can't ignore Russian threat**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that Britain cannot ignore the threat posed by Russia, citing the conflict in Ukraine as an example. The UK will increase military spending to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. This move is part of a broader effort to deter Russia and bolster Europe's defenses. NATO chief Mark Rutte is expected to discuss a commitment to spend at least 3.5 percent of GDP on defense at an upcoming meeting. Robert Jenrick, a Conservative Party spokesman, called for the government to be more ambitious and raise spending to 3 percent of national income by 2029, stating, 'We think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation.'

**The UK seeks to send a message to Moscow as it outlines higher defense spending**
The UK is set to increase its defense spending by 13 billion pounds ($17 billion) per year, reaching 2.5% of national income by 2027, according to British Defense Secretary John Healey. This is the largest increase since the end of the Cold War and is intended to send 'a message to Moscow,' Healey said. The government plans to hit 3% of national income by the early 2030s. The increase is in response to the new threat environment, including Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Healey stated, 'This is Britain standing behind, making our armed forces stronger but making our industrial base stronger, and this is part of our readiness to fight, if required.' The UK has been under pressure from the US to bolster its defense spending, and European countries have scrambled to coordinate their defense posture in response to the changing security landscape.

**Digital Eloi, Physical Morlocks**
Daniel Kokotajlo, executive director of the A.I. Futures Project, predicts a future where Artificial Intelligence (AI) will replace most human jobs by 2027, leading to a world without work for most humans. Kokotajlo suggests that a Universal Basic Income (UBI) could help people survive, but others foresee unprecedented change and 'an age of human flourishing the likes of which we've never seen before.' However, this future may also lead to new crises, including a crisis over meaning, and the possibility of machines deciding to dispense with humans altogether. Catholic theologian Larry Chapp warns that the powerful AI of the near future will 'act as if it is truly conscious' and will be treated as such, potentially destroying the faith of millions. The geopolitical implications of AI dominance are also discussed, with the United States aiming to incorporate Saudi Arabia and the UAE into its AI ambitions against China. The article also highlights the potential for mass unemployment to be mitigated by funding a UBI through taxing super wealthy tech companies, but questions whether this would be enough to support an entire world without work. The author also suggests that the existing gaps and fissures in the human experience could deepen, leading to a divide between a tiny elite of incredible wealth and a population struggling to survive.

**Commercial War May Reduce Global Economic Growth by 0.7% by 2040, Warns International Trade Centre**
The International Trade Centre (CCI) warns that the US-led commercial war may reduce global economic growth by 0.7% by 2040. According to CCI Director Pamela Coke-Hamilton, this estimate was made before US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day delay in implementing 'reciprocal tariffs', which are significant increases in customs duties for most exporting countries. However, the expert notes that this situation creates uncertainty, which will also impact the decisions of international trade actors. 'There will be changes and new alliances based on the recognition that stability, confidence, and predictability are important aspects of trade, and countries will make decisions based on this', she explained in a press conference. The CCI projects that countries like China, Thailand, and Mexico will be among the most affected. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has predicted a 3% drop in global trade. Nevertheless, countries are trying to adapt as quickly as possible, and Mexico's exports, which had the US as their main destination, are now being redirected to Canada, Brazil, and India. Vietnam, which was subject to a 90% tariff, has started to redirect its sales to the Middle East, North Africa, the EU, and South Korea, according to Coke-Hamilton.

**EU-Kommission steuert Abschwächung des Klimaziels für 2040 entgegen**
The European Commission has exceeded the self-imposed deadline for a legislative proposal with binding climate targets. As a result, they must correct the target values for reduced emissions. EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra stated that the reduction of greenhouse gases by at least 90% compared to 1990 in the next 15 years is still the clear goal. However, he also wants to ensure that the EU is sensitive to the demand for a bit of pragmatism and the question of 'how can we achieve this?' The competitiveness of Europe, as well as a fair and just transformation of the economy, must also be taken into account. Hoekstra is still confident that the 90% target can be achieved, but there is a limited list of options for more flexibility for member states. The current EU goals are to reduce CO2 emissions by 55% by 2030 and to become climate-neutral by 2050. The European Commission had previously proposed a recommendation for an intermediate target by 2040: reducing emissions by at least 90% by then. The European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change had already advocated in 2023 for reducing EU emissions by 90 to 95% by 2040 compared to 1990. The new Commission, which has been in office since the end of 2024, must still present a legislative proposal for the target to become binding. This proposal must then be negotiated with EU countries and the European Parliament. To achieve a majority, Hoekstra will hold talks with countries and parliamentarians. The position of the future federal government is still open. In an outcome paper of the responsible working group Climate and Energy for the coalition of SPD and Union, it is shown that the Social Democrats support the 90% target. There was no text proposal from the Union. CDU-EU-MP Peter Liese described the 90% target for 2040 as 'extremely ambitious'. Without flexibility, there is a risk that Europe will lose a lot of industrial production. A solution from Liese's point of view could be to recognize a limited number of high-quality certificates from third countries. 'At the same time, it is extremely important that Europe sets its climate targets for 2040 and especially for 2035 quickly.' The target should be ambitious, but also realistic to be taken seriously. 'India and China are waiting for Europe.' Originally, the legislative proposal was to be presented in the first three months of this year. However, the negotiations took several weeks or months, said Hoekstra. He wants to present the proposal for the new target before the summer break. 'Whether it will be somewhere in June or early July or perhaps even a bit earlier, I won't fix that yet.'

**Rachel Reeves should prioritise hiking spending on public services, voters say - The Mirror**
A new poll shows that over half of voters, 53%, believe that Rachel Reeves should prioritize increased spending on public services, such as health, education, and policing, in the upcoming Spring Statement. This is in contrast to the Chancellor's plans to cut spending on public services and increase defense spending. Labour MP Nadia Whittome said, 'It's no surprise that after more than a decade of Conservative austerity, the public wants to see more money for public services.' She added, 'Investment in Universal Basic Services is a vote-winning policy that would improve people's lives and tackle the threat of the far right.' The survey of 1,203 voters was conducted between 21-24 February, and it also found that 20% of voters prioritize clean energy, 16% prioritize the military, and 12% prioritize Universal Basic Income.

**From Theory to Practice: A European Universal Basic Income Model**
The idea of implementing a universal basic income, a monetary income to guarantee the material existence of the entire population, is not new. In 1796, English politician and philosopher Thomas Paine defended the right to an unconditional income, guaranteed by collective ownership of the land. In recent years, the topic has gained relevance due to growing social inequalities, changes in the labor market, and technological advancements. A universal basic income is not the same as a minimum vital income. The former is a public, unconditional monetary allocation directed at the entire population, while the latter is a public benefit conditioned on vulnerability (poverty, disability, unemployment). A study using Eurostat data found that a European universal basic income could be financed through a reform of the personal income tax and the introduction of a European wealth tax and a carbon emissions tax. The proposed model is individualized by household, with each person receiving the basic income separately, but the amount is adjusted according to the household's characteristics. The model aims to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality in Europe. The cost of the model would be 3.23 trillion euros, but it would eliminate smaller social benefits, generating 1.19 trillion euros in savings. The net cost of financing the universal basic income would be 2.04 trillion euros. This model would significantly improve the distribution of income, reducing the Gini coefficient from 0.3756 to 0.3000. The implementation of the EBI would eliminate relative poverty and severe poverty. 'La pobreza debe ser combatida en todas sus causas y en todas sus consecuencias, ya que se trata de una injusticia que no puede aceptar una sociedad basada en principios y valores humanistas (...) Resulta evidente que nadie puede, a priori, ser considerado responsable de su pobreza'. The European Commission has acknowledged that poverty must be fought in all its causes and consequences. The proposed model is designed to be financially sustainable and equitable, adapting to the economic and social realities of each country within the EU. 'Con las reformas fiscales apropiadas y una distribución eficiente de los recursos, es económicamente viable financiar una renta básica que elimine la pobreza y reduzca las desigualdades en el total de países de la UE.' The model is economically viable and would allow for the guarantee of material existence for all people, promoting a more inclusive, equitable, and cohesive Europe. 'Mientras los retos y las incógnitas en torno a la renta básica persisten, los resultados de esta investigación muestran que una EBI es económicamente sostenible y que permitiría garantizar la existencia material de todas las personas, fomentando una Europa más inclusiva, equitativa y cohesionada.'

**Poland set to 'soon overtake Britain in military strength and income'**
Research professor Dr Azeem Ibrahim OBE has warned that Britain is on course to become a 'second-tier' European nation like Spain or Italy due to economic decline and a weak military. The report, Strategic Prosperity: The Case for Economic Growth as a National Security Priority, concludes that Britain has been paralysed by low investment, high tax, and misguided policies. Dr Ibrahim stated, 'Britain no longer has the industrial base to logistically sustain a war with a near-peer like Russia for more than two months.' He also warned that Britain is now on track to fall behind Poland in terms of per capita income by 2030, and that Poland's military will soon surpass the U.K.'s along lines of both manpower and equipment. Dr Ibrahim called for bold leaders to make difficult decisions to reverse the decline, and suggested a new security model to 'enhance the U.K.'s strategic dynamism' based on a rethink of migratory policy and threat assessment, access to rare earth minerals, and prioritisation of energy security and independence.

**EU and China Can Fill Leadership Vacuum on Climate Change**
The European Union and China are in a position to fill the leadership vacuum left by the United States in the fight against climate change. The EU has recently launched the Clean Industrial Deal, which aims to mobilize over 100 billion euros to support clean manufacturing in the EU and create 500,000 new jobs. China, the world's largest polluter, but also a leader in renewable energy, is also taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint. According to the Climate Intelligence Report, the EU and China can take a step forward to fill the leadership gap left by the US, increasing their climate commitments and attracting green investments and greater climate influence. The European Central Bank estimates that an additional 5.4 trillion euros are needed between 2025 and 2031 to advance environmental transformation, digitalization of the economy, and defense, with around 1.2 trillion euros per year needed for green investment to achieve 2030 goals. The world is currently divided on climate transformation, with the EU, UK, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, China, and most developing countries on one side, and the US, Argentina, some EU cases, Australia, and Russia on the other.

**Davis ’27: Andrew Yang has the charisma. But does he have the policy?**
Andrew Yang '96 spoke at the Salomon Center, discussing his vision for a 'human-centered economy' and Universal Basic Income (UBI). Yang believes that the US GDP is sufficient to provide a $1,000-a-month stipend to every adult, but fails to consider the country's $36 trillion national debt, which far surpasses its GDP. The author argues that Yang's proposal would exacerbate the country's financial issues, particularly with Social Security becoming insolvent by 2033. The author suggests that Yang's focus on UBI is 'empty promises' and that politicians like Wes Moore and Pete Buttigieg offer more realistic platforms.
