**Ismailia Governorate Exceeds Local Wheat Supply Target by 105%**
The Ismailia Governorate has exceeded its target for local wheat supply by 105%, with a total of 42,673.886 tons delivered as of April 15, 2025, compared to a target of 40,594 tons. This achievement is a result of the coordination between the executive, agricultural, and supply authorities, according to Governor Akram Mohamed Jallal. He emphasized his daily monitoring of the delivery operations and his efforts to facilitate procedures for farmers to encourage them to deliver their crops on time. He also thanked farmers for their positive interaction with the system. Shaima Omar, the Supply Ministry's deputy in Ismailia, explained that the wheat reception operations are being supervised by a central operations room that communicates with the delivery centers to resolve any obstacles. The main reception points include the grain silos in Qantara East, Abu Sweir, and East Delta Mills, as well as collection centers in Al-Qassasin, Abusultan, and Al-Yaqin Farm, and quantities delivered outside the governorate. Dr. Mohamed Shata, the Agriculture Ministry's deputy, noted that the cultivated area this year reached 33,829 feddans, with 33,499 feddans harvested so far. He also mentioned that 26 advisory fields were supported with free seeds of approved varieties, including 'Egypt 4', 'Sedas 14', 'Sedas 15', and 'G 171', with the governorate receiving 40 ardeb of seeds from the Central Seed Production Administration. The governor emphasized the need to continue monitoring the local wheat trade and dealing firmly with any violations, while adhering to the controls adopted by the Supply Ministry to ensure the stability of the food security system. He also instructed the heads of centers, cities, and committees to regularly visit the reception centers and ensure compliance with technical requirements and facilitate procedures for suppliers.

**US Corn Exports at Risk of 'Boomerang Effect' Amid Record Production**
The US tariffs imposed on other countries are risking becoming a 'boomerang effect' for the US agricultural sector. According to the International Grains Council (IGC), the US export of corn is expected to decline, while corn stockpiles are expected to reach a record high of 31% in the 2025-26 campaign. The US is on track to produce a record 397.4 million tons of corn, a 5.2% increase from the previous year. However, this record production is accompanied by a commercial crisis that is likely to burden American farmers' warehouses. The paradox is evident: while global demand for corn remains solid, many importing countries are avoiding US origin in retaliation for Washington's protectionist measures. As a result, trade flows are being diverted to alternative suppliers, primarily Brazil and Ukraine, which are gaining ground in the global competition. The US is expected to lose around 6 percentage points of market share globally, with exports falling to 65.2 million tons, exacerbating the difficulty for American operators in placing their surplus production abroad. Despite the high demand for corn for animal feed - with a forecast of 749.3 million tons for 'feed use' in 2025-26, up 2.4% - US silos remain full, and the possibilities of alleviating stockpiles through exports are increasingly limited. Meanwhile, the main international competitors are strengthening their presence on the market. Brazil, favored by an expansion of cultivated areas and increasingly high yields, is consolidating a double-digit growth in the 2024-25 campaign. For the 2025-26 campaign, a further 2.7% increase is forecast, with production reaching 131 million tons.

**DRV lowers forecast for 2025 rapeseed and grain harvest**
The German Raiffeisen Association (DRV) has adjusted its forecast for the 2025 rapeseed and grain harvest downwards due to weather conditions. However, the revised estimates are still higher than the very weak results of the previous year. The DRV expects a total grain harvest of 40.71 million tons this summer, which is 4.2% more than last year. The association attributes the correction to yield losses due to late frosts, which partially froze the rapeseed and grain ears. Lack of rain is developing into a persistent problem, despite recent rainfall providing some relief. The predicted growth in grain production compared to the previous year is due to an expansion of cultivated land by 3.1% to 5.9 million hectares and an increase in yield per hectare to 69.0 decitons, which is about 1.0% higher than in 2024. Wheat is the main driver of the expected production increase, with the DRV forecasting a harvest of 21.02 million tons, which is 13.6% more than in 2024. The production of rye and oats is also expected to increase, by 1.1% to 2.61 million tons and by 10.5% to 768,800 tons, respectively. In contrast, the DRV expects a decline in barley production of 5.7% to 10 million tons and a decline in maize production of 6.2% to 4.60 million tons. Guido Seedler, the DRV's grain market expert, emphasized the importance of exports, saying, 'We must sustainably produce more agricultural raw materials.' He believes that the increasing global population poses a risk of wars over water and food, and that exports can provide additional income for agriculture and contribute to global food security.

**Sell in May and Go Away: A Warning for 2026**
The author believes that the stock market will decline and that the economy will experience a recession in 2026. They predict a 0.1-0.2% growth rate for this year, but a 0.7% growth rate is expected by the government. The author notes that the economy will face significant challenges, including a decline in car sales, a stagnant airline industry, and a crisis in the steel industry. They also predict that the unemployment rate will rise to 8% by the end of the year and 9-10% in 2026. The author is concerned about the increasing public deficit and the impact of trade tariffs on the global economy. They believe that the economy is heading for a 'crash' and that banks will become more selective in lending and will liquidate their 'bad assets.' The author concludes that they have never been more worried about the economy in 2026, with no room for maneuver. 'Effort budgétaire de 20 milliards cette année ça va encore mais 40 à 50 milliards sur 2026 et là on va le sentir passer' ('A budget effort of 20 billion this year will still be manageable, but 40-50 billion in 2026 will be felt').

**In India, Cultivated Seafood Could Soon Become A Reality**
Mumbai-based food tech startup Biokraft Foods has developed cultured seafood prototypes, including trout, in collaboration with the Indian government. The company plans to apply for regulatory approval for cultivated chicken this summer. According to founder and CEO Kamalnayan Tibrewal, 'The current cell biomass stands at 3% due to the slow doubling rate of cells, but we want to boost it up to 10% if unit economics allows.' The startup aims to address challenges in trout farming, such as limited availability and resource-intensive production. Biokraft's tech platform uses 3D bioprinting to replicate the texture, taste, and structure of conventional meat, and the resulting product is said to be 'structurally and nutritionally on par with conventional trout.' The company plans to achieve a commercial rollout of both its meat and seafood products by 2026. A 2024 survey found that over 60% of Indians are willing to buy cultivated meat, with 59% identifying it as an alternative to conventional meat that promotes nutritional security.

**Osaka Expo to Showcase 3D-Printed Cultivated Meat with Adjustable Fat and Muscle Ratios**
A new technology that uses 3D printing to cultivate meat is being showcased at the upcoming 2025 Osaka Expo's 'Healthcare Pavilion'. The technology, developed by Osaka University and several companies, aims to solve the protein shortage problem caused by population growth. Through cultivation, the risk of environmental problems is reduced, and meat products that meet health standards can be manufactured according to consumer needs. The cultivated meat on display is made from beef cells and uses advanced 3D biological printing technology. The meat blocks are composed of muscle, fat, and blood vessel cells, which are precisely assembled to resemble meat structures. The technology's greatest feature is its ability to freely adjust the fat and muscle ratios, allowing for the production of evenly distributed fat meat or grid-shaped meat blocks. Even personalized patterns, such as text or images, can be added in the future. However, the technology is still in the experimental stage and requires about half a year to produce a meat block from cell proliferation to assembly. Researchers hope to make the production process more convenient for consumers to produce their preferred meat at home. A planned 'meat-making machine' will allow users to adjust the type and nutritional content of the meat according to their needs, achieving personalized health customization. Although the technology faces some challenges, such as a slightly weak texture and flavor, researchers are working to improve these shortcomings and aim to provide a more realistic taste experience in the future. Although the cultivated meat cannot be provided to the public due to food safety regulations, the commercialization target is set for 2031. An 'BBQ Cultivated Meat Fragrance Experience' event will be held on July 8 at the Osaka Expo, allowing visitors to experience the charm of this future food.

**Let carnivores decide whether to eat lab-grown meat | Bloomberg News**
Lab-grown meat, also known as cultivated meat, is a cleaner alternative to traditional livestock farming. Made from biopsied animal cells in regulated manufacturing sites, it has the potential to reduce land use for beef production by 10-fold and carbon emissions 12-fold. Despite the benefits, the industry faces hurdles, including winning over a skeptical public and wary politicians. Conservative forecasts suggest the sector can meet just half a percentage point of global demand by 2030. However, some states have banned lab-grown meat, and the industry needs to overcome economic and regulatory challenges to reach parity with conventional meat. Policymakers should remove arbitrary barriers and let American consumers decide the fate of lab-grown meat, which could have a profound impact on the planet.
