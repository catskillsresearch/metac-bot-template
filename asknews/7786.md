**Pakistan and India Close to Reducing Troop Levels Along Border**
Pakistan and India are close to reducing troop levels along their border to pre-conflict levels, according to a high-ranking Pakistani military official. The official, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, said that the two sides have started the process of reducing troop levels, and that they are 'almost back to the situation before April 22... we are approaching that, or we should have approached it.' However, Mirza warned that the crisis has increased the risk of escalation in the future. He also stated that the conflict has reduced the threshold between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, and that it will not be limited to the disputed territory of Kashmir, but will extend to the entire India and Pakistan. 'This is a very dangerous trend,' Mirza said. The conflict began after an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22 that killed 26 people, mostly tourists. India blamed the attack on 'terrorists' backed by Pakistan, which denied the accusation. The two countries have been engaged in a series of clashes, including the use of fighter jets, missiles, drones, and artillery, over the past four days, the worst in decades. A ceasefire was announced after the clashes. 'We did not move towards nuclear weapons this time,' Mirza said. 'But you cannot rule out any strategic miscalculation at any moment, because when the crisis starts, the responses are different.'

**India and Pakistan Ease Tensions, but Concerns about Strategic Miscalculation Remain**
The tensions between India and Pakistan have eased, but concerns about strategic miscalculation remain. A senior Pakistani military official told Reuters that Pakistan and India are approaching the level of troop deployment on their borders to what it was before the recent escalation, but warned that the crisis has increased the risk of future escalation. The two countries used fighter jets, missiles, and artillery in four days of clashes, the worst fighting between them in decades, before a ceasefire was announced. The latest conflict between the two countries was sparked by an attack on April 22 in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, which killed 26 people, most of them tourists. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for the attack, which Pakistan denied. On May 7, India launched missiles at what it said were 'terrorist infrastructure' across the border, to which Pakistan responded, leading to both countries deploying additional troops to the border. General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee of Pakistan, said that the armies are in the process of reducing troop levels. He added, 'We have almost returned to the situation that prevailed before April 22... We are approaching that, or we have approached that now.' The Indian Defense Ministry and the office of the Indian Chief of Defense Staff did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment on Mirza's statements. Mirza, who is in Singapore to attend the Shangri-La Dialogue, said that although no nuclear steps were taken during this conflict, it was a dangerous situation. He added, 'Nothing happened this time... But any strategic miscalculation can happen at any time, because when the crisis is ongoing, the responses are different.' He added that the risk of future escalation has increased because the conflict this time did not only involve the disputed region of Kashmir, but also the entire region. During the clashes, both sides attacked military installations in each other's territory, but neither admitted to any significant damage. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned Pakistan this month that New Delhi would target 'terrorist hideouts' across the border again if there were new attacks on India. The two countries have fought three major wars, two of which were over Kashmir, and have had numerous armed clashes since independence from Britain in 1947. India blames Pakistan for instigating an insurgency in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, which began in 1989, while Islamabad says it only provides moral, political, and diplomatic support to the people of Kashmir seeking self-determination. Mirza said, 'This (conflict) lowers the nuclear threshold between the two nuclear-armed neighbors... In the future, the conflict will not be limited to the disputed region, but will involve India and Pakistan as a whole. This is a very dangerous trend.' Reuters reported that the rapid escalation of the conflict ended due to diplomatic efforts behind the scenes involving the US, India, and Pakistan, and the key role played by Washington in mediating peace. India denied any role for a third party in the ceasefire, saying that any interaction between it and Islamabad should be bilateral. However, Mirza warned that international mediation may be difficult in the future due to the lack of mechanisms for managing crises between the two countries. He said, 'The time available for the international community to intervene is narrow in the current period, and I believe that damage and destruction may occur before the international community takes advantage of this period.' Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said today, 'If there are talks, they will only be about terrorism and the part of Kashmir under Pakistan's control. If Pakistan is serious about talks, it should hand over the terrorists... to India to achieve justice.' Mirza pointed out that there were no secret or unofficial negotiations to ease tensions. He confirmed that he does not plan to meet General Anil Chauhan, the Indian Chief of Defense Staff, who is also in Singapore to attend the Shangri-La Dialogue. Mirza said, 'These issues cannot be resolved except through dialogue and consultations at the negotiating table, not in the battlefield.'

**Indian defence minister says navy to lead response in any future conflict with Pakistan**
Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh stated that the country will utilize the firepower of its navy in response to any future 'aggression' by Pakistan. This comes after recent fighting between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, which resulted in the deaths of 53 individuals, including 13 military personnel and 40 civilians. Singh said, 'If Pakistan resorts to anything evil or unethical, it will, this time, face the firepower and ire of the Indian Navy.' Pakistan has rejected Indian allegations and called for an independent probe into the April 22 attack in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), which killed 26 people. A ceasefire took effect on May 10, and both countries are close to reducing their troop build-up along their border to pre-conflict levels. 'Operation Sindoor', under which India launched strikes on Pakistan, was paused, but not yet over, according to Singh. Pakistan's armed forces launched a large-scale retaliatory military action, 'Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos', in response to India's unprovoked missiles and drone strikes on civilians and military installations.

**Pakistan's General Warns of Future Tensions After Border Conflict**
Pakistan's General Sahir Şemsid Mirza stated that the two countries have reduced the military presence at the border to pre-crisis levels. He said, 'We have almost returned to the situation before April 22.' However, Mirza emphasized that this process may lead to a higher risk of future military tensions. The recent conflict between India and Pakistan involved both sides using warplanes, missiles, drones, and artillery units. India suffered significant losses, including 5 confirmed warplane losses. Mirza noted that the current tensions do not involve nuclear weapons, but the threat level is high. He warned that in future crises, strategic mistakes cannot be entirely avoided, and responses may vary. Mirza also stated that any future conflict may not be limited to the disputed Kashmir region, saying, 'The threshold of tension between two nuclear powers has been lowered. The next conflict could spread to the entire India and Pakistan. This is a very dangerous trend.' The conflict was sparked by a terrorist attack on April 22 in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 26 people, mostly Indian tourists. New Delhi blamed Pakistan-backed 'terrorists' for the attack, while Islamabad denied the allegations. On May 7, India launched a missile strike on targets it claimed were 'terrorist infrastructure' in Pakistan, prompting a response from Pakistan.

**India’s 'strategic miscalculation' cannot be dismissed: CJCSC**
Pakistan's Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, stated that the country and India are close to reducing troop levels along their border to pre-conflict levels. However, he warned that the crisis has increased the risk of escalation in the future. The conflict, which was sparked by an Indian attack in Kashmir, resulted in the deaths of 26 people and the downing of six Indian fighter jets. General Mirza emphasized that the situation is 'very dangerous' and that the two countries are 'contiguous nuclear powers.' He also stated that international mediation might be difficult in the future due to a lack of crisis management mechanisms between the countries. Pakistan is open to dialogue, but India's foreign ministry spokesperson said that 'talks and terror don't go together.' General Mirza reiterated that issues can only be resolved through dialogue and consultations, not on the battlefield.

**Suffocating Kashmir In India-Pakistan Conflict**
The ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan has resulted in the deaths of at least 22 people, including a soldier and an additional district development commissioner, due to mortar shelling by Pakistan. The shelling has also caused widespread destruction and displacement in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir. Residents of Uri, a town in North Kashmir, have been forced to flee their homes and take shelter in safer areas. The Indian government has set up shelter camps in schools for those willing to relocate, and has assured the public that essential services, including accommodation, food, and medical assistance, are available at these sites. However, local residents have lamented the failure of the government to reach out to them in Uri, and have called for strengthening infrastructure with regard to providing shelters and bunkers for the public in border areas. The Indian Army has also been deployed in the region, and has taken steps to neutralize potential threats. The situation remains tense, with both countries accusing each other of aggression. 'Shells rained on our locality. Our life was torn apart,' says Tariq Ahmad, a driver who has been forced to flee his home. 'The government should provide proper bunkers to avoid losses during mortar shelling by Pakistan,' says Apni Party leader Raja Manzoor. 'The hospitals in Kupwara, like the main Sub District Hospital (SDH), lack staff. How can we deal with this situation then?' he asks. 'The areas of Karnah, Keran, Machil and Nowgam in Kupwara lack individual shelter houses and there are only limited community bunkers,' he adds. 'The government should provide proper staff at the hospitals to deal with border skirmishes,' he says. 'The entire administration, police, the central armed police forces and the armed forces are working together. We are alert, equipped and fully prepared to respond to any situation,' says LG Sinha. 'Take necessary steps as per guidelines of the Union Home Minister and to neutralise any potential threat in time,' he directs the officials. 'The Indian response has been in the same domain with the same intensity as Pakistan. It has been reliably learnt that an air defence system at Lahore has been neutralised,' a government statement adds. 'These were neutralised by the Integrated Counter UAS Grid and Air Defence systems. The debris of these attacks is now being recovered from a number of locations that prove the Pakistani attacks,' it says. 'The entire administration, police, the central armed police forces and the armed forces are working together. We are alert, equipped and fully prepared to respond to any situation,' says LG Sinha. 'Take necessary steps as per guidelines of the Union Home Minister and to neutralise any potential threat in time,' he directs the officials.

India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh stated that the Indian Navy will lead the country's response to any future aggression by Pakistan. Singh made the comment on the aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, off the coast of Goa, after recent fighting between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. The Indian Navy deployed its carrier battle group, submarines, and other aviation assets in the northern Arabian Sea within 96 hours of an April 22 attack in Kashmir, which killed 26 people. Singh said 'Operation Sindoor' was paused, but not yet over, and that India's forces had not yet shown their might. Pakistan's military spokesperson referred to a May 12 statement, which said there would be a 'comprehensive and decisive' response to any threats to Pakistan's sovereignty. A ceasefire took effect on May 10 and both countries are close to reducing their troop build-up along their border to pre-conflict levels.

**India and Pakistan: 'A Bad Nuclear War'**
The Trump administration brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a series of attacks, including a terrorist attack that killed 26 Hindu tourists in Indian-controlled Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian military launched Operation Sindoor, which targeted terrorist sites and military targets in Pakistan, including two installations linked to Pakistan's nuclear weapons arsenal. The situation remains volatile, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stating that Operation Sindoor has not ended and Pakistan threatening to resume hostilities. The possession of nuclear weapons by Pakistan has made its military-run regime bolder, and experts warn that the country may use its nukes in a future conflict. The United States has yet to develop a deterrence strategy to deal with this new reality, and the situation in South Asia remains a threat to global stability. As Blaine Holt, a retired U.S. Air Force brigadier general, said, 'The world was lucky this time.'

**India-Pakistan: A Relationship Marked by Hostility**
The India-Pakistan relationship has been marked by hostility since both countries gained independence from Britain in 1947. They have been involved in four major wars and numerous smaller conflicts. The region of Kashmir is a key point of contention, with both countries claiming it in its entirety. The region is home to a majority Muslim population and is a vital source of water for agriculture in both countries. The two countries have a long history of conflict, including the 1947-1948 Indo-Pakistani War, the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War, and the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War. In 1999, the Kargil War took place between the two countries in the Kargil region. Recently, tensions between the two countries have escalated, with India launching airstrikes against Pakistan in May 2025 in response to a terrorist attack that killed 25 Indian tourists. The conflict has resulted in significant losses for both countries, with estimates of Indian military deaths ranging from 527 to 4,000. The two countries are nuclear powers, and a conflict between them could have devastating consequences. India has a population of 1.438 billion, while Pakistan has a population of 247.5 million. India is also the 4th most powerful military power in the world, while Pakistan is 12th. The two countries have a long history of conflict, and it is essential that they find a solution to their differences and work towards a lasting peace.

**Pakistan and India War**
The 2025 India-Pakistan conflict marked the most severe escalation between the two nuclear-armed neighbors since the 1999 Kargil War. The conflict was triggered by a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, where 26 people were killed. India attributed the attack to Pakistan-based militants, a claim Pakistan denies. The conflict saw missile exchanges and artillery fire, resulting in at least 11 deaths and 56 injuries, mainly in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. India confirmed that its airbases suffered 'limited damage' due to Pakistani attacks, while Pakistan reported civilian casualties from Indian strikes. The conflict prompted international concern, leading to U.S.-mediated talks, and ultimately resulted in an immediate ceasefire on May 10, facilitated through mediation by the U.S. and additional diplomatic support from Saudi Arabia and Turkey.

**India-Pakistan Conflict: Latest Developments**
The ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan has resulted in the deaths of at least 50 people. On May 9, 2025, Pakistan accused the Indian government of seeking to draw two nuclear-armed neighbors into conflict, after over 72 hours of cross-border fire. In response, the Pakistani military mobilized tanks and troops to its border with India, near Lahore. Meanwhile, the Indian military continues to launch an offensive with armed drones, targeting Pakistani military infrastructure. Mediation efforts between the two countries continue, but military attacks persist. Pakistani security forces accused India of trying to provoke two of its nuclear-armed neighbors, without explaining the reasons behind this move. In response, the Pakistani military mobilized forces to its border with India, with the intention of increasing military presence in the area. As a result, tanks were seen on the road to Muridke, leading to the city closest to India, Lahore. Following the Pakistani military's troop mobilization, the Indian government authorized the military to activate its reserve forces. This decision will add over a dozen battalions to the Indian military, preparing for the conflict. Additionally, security forces stationed near the Pakistani border continue to launch drone attacks, while artillery fire has been exchanged between the two sides, resulting in at least 50 deaths.

**Ominous warning as death toll rises**
The death toll has risen in the conflict between India and Pakistan, with over 50 people killed in the biggest armed confrontation between the two nuclear-armed states in decades. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shafqat Ali Khan blamed India for the conflict, saying its 'reckless conduct has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict'. India accused Pakistani forces of targeting three military stations, while Pakistan denied targeting any locations in Indian-administered Kashmir. The conflict has led to the closure of schools on both sides of the border, affecting tens of millions of children. American Vice President JD Vance has called for de-escalation, while several countries have offered to mediate. The International Crisis Group warned that foreign powers appear to have been indifferent to the prospect of war, despite warnings of possible escalation.

**India and Pakistan Engage in Worst Clashes in Decades, 44 Civilians Killed**
India and Pakistan continued to exchange artillery fire along the disputed Kashmir border on Thursday, with at least 44 civilian deaths reported. New Delhi warned that it will respond 'very firmly' to a Pakistani attack. The worst clashes in decades between the two nuclear-armed neighbors continued on Thursday, with 31 deaths reported on the Pakistani side and 13 on the Indian side. The Indian government also reported the death of a soldier due to Pakistani gunfire. The escalation in the crisis began on April 22, with a bombing in the tourist city of Pahalgam, in the Indian-administered part of Kashmir, which killed 26 people, mostly Hindus. 'We will avenge every drop of blood of these martyrs,' promised Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday night. The Indian army claimed to have destroyed nine 'terrorist camps' in Pakistan with 'precision airstrikes' in Kashmir and the Punjab region, where over half of Pakistan's 240 million population lives. 'The Pakistani army carried out unprovoked firing with small arms and artillery,' said a military statement from New Delhi, to which 'the Indian army responded proportionately.' India warned on Thursday that any Pakistani attack will provoke a 'very firm response.' The conflict does not only involve military action. Hours before the bombings, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that his administration would cut off the flow of water from its rivers to Pakistan. Islamabad responded that it would consider such a measure as 'an act of war.'

**India-Pakistan Conflict: At Least 38 Dead in Worst Violence in 20 Years**
A severe conflict between India and Pakistan has resulted in at least 38 deaths, making it the most violent conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbors in the past 20 years. According to reports, at least 38 people have been killed in the latest clashes between the two countries. The Pakistani government claims that Indian air strikes and artillery fire have killed 26 civilians, while the Indian side says that Pakistani shelling has resulted in at least 12 deaths. The Pakistani military reports that 21 civilians, including 4 children, were killed in Indian air strikes, and 5 others were shot dead near the border. Indian military officials claim that 'justice has been served' and report that 9 'terrorist camps' have been destroyed. The Indian government emphasizes that their actions are 'clear, measured, and will not escalate.' Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of launching the attack to 'boost' his popularity in India, and said that Pakistan has already launched a counterattack. Asif told AFP, 'The retaliatory action has begun, and we will settle this account soon.' Pakistani military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry also stated that 5 Indian warplanes were shot down. Meanwhile, an anonymous Indian high-ranking security official revealed that 3 Indian warplanes crashed on Indian soil. The conflict escalated after a terrorist attack in the Indian-controlled region of Kashmir two weeks ago, which killed at least 26 people. An investigation by India found that at least 3 of the perpetrators were Pakistani nationals, and India accused Pakistan of supporting the attack, leading to a significant increase in tensions between the two countries.

**India and Pakistan: A history of armed conflict**
Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated after India launched deadly strikes at Pakistani territory, killing at least eight people. Pakistan has begun retaliating, and both countries have exchanged gunfire in Kashmir, expelled citizens, and ordered the border shut. This is the latest in a long history of armed conflict between the two nuclear-armed rivals, which has seen multiple conflicts since their partition in 1947. According to Pakistan, India has accused them of backing the deadliest attack in years on civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir, in which 26 men were killed. Islamabad has rejected the charge. As reported by The Star, the two countries have fought multiple conflicts, including the 1947 partition, the 1965 war in Kashmir, the 1971 Bangladesh conflict, the 1989-90 Kashmir uprising, the 1999 Kargil conflict, and the 2019 Pulwama attack. 'The poorly prepared partition unleashes bloodshed that kills possibly more than a million people and displaces 15 million others,' said a report. 'A UN-backed, 770-kilometre (480-mile) ceasefire line in January 1949 divides Kashmir.' The conflict has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people and the displacement of millions. 'An estimated three million people are killed in the nine-month conflict and millions flee into India,' said another report. 'At least 1,000 people are killed over 10 weeks' in the 1999 Kargil conflict. 'A suicide attack on a convoy of Indian security forces kills 40 in Pulwama,' said a report. 'India sends fighter jets which carry out air strikes on Pakistani territory to target an alleged militant training camp.'
