**Geomagnetic Storms Cause Starlink Satellites to Lose Altitude and Crash to Earth**
A new study by a research group led by Danny Oliveira from the Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA) has found that geomagnetic storms are causing Starlink satellites to lose altitude and potentially crash to Earth. The study analyzed the trajectories of Starlink satellites from 2020 to 2024, a period that coincided with the active phase of the solar cycle. The analysis showed a clear correlation between solar magnetic activity and the loss of satellites. Over the five-year period, 523 Starlink satellites left orbit prematurely. The cause of this is the heating of the upper atmosphere due to solar flares, which causes it to expand and increase resistance for the satellites, causing them to lose altitude faster. In severe storms, a satellite's orbital life can be shortened by 10-12 days, which can prevent the planned re-entry into the atmosphere for safe disposal. Another serious consequence is the reduction of time spent in the dense layers of the atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of unburned fragments. In 2024, a 2.5 kg fragment fell on a farm in Saskatchewan, Canada. While SpaceX claims that the debris poses no danger, scientists note that unpredictable solar flares make such cases more likely. According to astronomer Jonathan McDowell (Harvard), there are currently over 7,500 Starlink satellites in orbit, with plans to expand the network to 42,000. Given similar ambitions from other companies, this poses a significant challenge to managing space traffic. Scientists warn that humanity is entering an era where the near-Earth space is becoming increasingly crowded, with satellites de-orbiting almost weekly, and soon this may become a daily occurrence. Understanding the impact of the Sun on orbital stability is crucial not only for maintaining satellite infrastructure but also for the safety of Earth's inhabitants. The study's results are currently available as a preprint and require independent review. However, this research already provides a new perspective on the relationship between the cosmos and modern technology.

**Solar Flares Accelerate Starlink Satellite Fall to Earth, Raising Concerns**
A recent study by the Goddard Space Flight Center, a NASA facility, found that geomagnetic storms caused by solar flares can accelerate the fall of Starlink satellites to Earth, due to increased atmospheric drag at low altitudes. The study revealed that these satellites, which often orbit at altitudes below 300 kilometers, become more susceptible to burning up in the atmosphere faster than expected, with their orbital lifetime decreasing by about 10 days during storm periods. The Starlink constellation is particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon as the sun approaches its peak activity, which occurs every 11 years. Researchers warn that the risk lies in the possibility of unburned debris from these satellites reaching the Earth's surface, according to the British Independent newspaper. Actual cases of debris falling have been recorded, including in February 2022, when most of the 49 Starlink satellites launched by SpaceX fell to Earth shortly after launch due to a geomagnetic storm. A piece of a satellite was also found on a farm in Canada in August 2024. With over 7,000 Starlink satellites currently in orbit, SpaceX plans to increase the number to 30,000, raising concerns about the environmental and safety implications of space debris falling to Earth.

**Stephen Hawking's 1995 Prediction for 2025: 'A Turning Point'**
Stephen Hawking predicted that 2025 would be a 'turning point' for various fields, including space exploration, technology, and robotics. In a 1995 BBC program, Tomorrow's World, he forecasted that space exploration would not be limited to government action, but also involve private companies and initiatives. He also warned about space debris, which poses a significant problem for satellites and space missions. Hawking predicted the widespread use of the internet, which has become a reality, and also foresaw the impact of artificial intelligence, which he called 'revolutionary' at the time. He identified the industries, medicine, and services as areas where robotics would be present, and indeed, robots are now integrated in these fields. In medicine, robots have led to a clear advancement in medical care, including surgical operations and disease diagnosis.

**Mythbuster: Space won't explode you, but it will boil you from within**
Contrary to Hollywood's depiction of space as a deadly explosion, the real danger of vacuum exposure lies in ebullism, where internal fluids expand and boil due to the lack of external pressure. According to Dr. Kris Lehnhardt of NASA's Human Research Program, 'all of your body tissues that contain water will start to expand,' causing a physiological collapse due to oxygen loss and internal changes. As Richard Harding explains, the skin won't burst like a balloon, but the body's tissues will expand and vaporize, leading to a deadly outcome.

**No Injuries or Fatalities in Ukrainian Drone Debris Fall in Kursk Region**
According to acting governor Alexander Khinstein, no one was injured in the fall of Ukrainian drone debris in the Kursk region. Russian air defense systems had previously destroyed and intercepted 57 drones over the region the night before. Khinstein reported that three private homes, one apartment building, and a garage were damaged, as well as the glass and a section of the building at the Kursk dermatovenereological dispensary. Fortunately, there were no fatalities or injuries. Khinstein stated that a post-attack inspection will begin in the region soon, with assessment commissions working on site and repair teams following. 'In the morning, assessment commissions will be working at the sites, and after that, repair and construction teams will be sent. All residents whose homes were damaged in the attacks will receive necessary assistance,' he added.

**SpaceX Starship Rocket Debris Puts Marine Ecosystem at Risk in Tamaulipas**
A maximum risk of ecological damage to the waters of Bagdad Beach has been warned by Conibio Global, after the arrival of trash from the Starship rocket that was launched on May 27, putting the marine biodiversity at risk. Environmentalist Jesús Elías Ibarra Rodríguez stated that millions of plastic and aluminum parts, as well as 12 tanks weighing 4,500 pounds each, were released after the explosion of the rocket's booster, which weighs 200 tons. 'Our Conibio Global A.C. team has been documenting the sighting of residues generated by the SpaceX rocket,' he explained, after inspecting 40 kilometers of beach. The team also located the millions of fragments that arrived on the beach, which, he said, 'puts the entire marine ecosystem at high risk, generates a negative impact on fishing families, and represents a danger to boats that could collide with the scattered tanks in the sea.' Rodríguez added that while they had doubts about who owned the space trash, after reviewing the particles and tanks, they were able to observe labels with the name SpaceX. 'Without a doubt, it is a direct damage to the marine ecosystem, the impact it causes to our activities; we have been in the sea turtle conservation program for eight years, and it undoubtedly affects us because we are just a few days away from releasing baby turtles and there are millions of plastic pieces, without a doubt they will ingest them, thinking they are food.'

**SpaceX Starship Rocket Launch Causes Massive Debris to Wash Up on Mexican Beaches**
A SpaceX Starship rocket launch on May 27th has caused a massive amount of debris to fall into the Gulf of Mexico, with millions of particles of trash now washing up on the shores of Playa Bagdad in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Jesus Elias Ibarra Rodríguez, head of Conibio Global A.C, stated, 'It's a social sin not to vote', but in this case, the 'sin' is the massive amount of trash generated by the rocket launch. The debris, including 12 tanks weighing 4,500 pounds each, is posing a significant threat to the marine ecosystem and local fishing families. Rodríguez expressed concern that the eight years of conservation efforts for the endangered sea turtle are now at risk due to the contamination of the beaches. He is calling on the 'Mariana Boy' organization and the Procuraduría Federal de Protección al Medio Ambiente to take action against SpaceX for the damage caused. Rodríguez also urges the public to share information and report any objects found on the beach, stating, 'The trash found has SpaceX labels, just like the tanks. I ask everyone to share this information and report any objects they find on the beach.'

**24 people, including 3 minors, die by drowning in Canarias in the first five months of 2025**
According to the Association for the Prevention of Accidents in the Aquatic Medium 'Canarias, 1500 Km of Coast', 24 people have died by drowning in Canarias in the first five months of 2025. Among the victims, three were minors, and two of them died from the 'invisible drowned' syndrome, a situation where people in the surrounding area are aware of the person's distress but do not intervene. This is the highest number of child drownings in the past decade. In 2024, two minors died by drowning in aquatic spaces in Canarias, in 2023 one, in 2022 two, and three in 2021. The association emphasizes that 90% of child drownings are caused by a lack of adult supervision. The organization recommends always entering the water with children. In the first five months of 2025, 59 people were affected by accidents in aquatic spaces in Canarias, including 24 fatalities, 4 critical cases, 15 moderate injuries, 6 light injuries, and 6 people rescued unharmed. The average monthly death toll by drowning in Canarias remains at 5 people per month.

**CIA Report Warns of Global Catastrophe by 2030: A Countdown to Disaster**
A 2003 report by the CIA, 'The 2030 Spike: Countdown to Global Catastrophe', written by Colin Mason, describes six factors that will converge in the next decade, leading to a global catastrophe. These factors include energy scarcity, demographic disparities, global poverty, climate change, food shortages, water scarcity, and international anarchy. The report proposes over 100 measures to mitigate the consequences of this crisis. According to the report, 'estimates place available petroleum resources at less than one billion barrels, and global consumption at 28 billion barrels per year, indicating depletion in as little as 34 years.' The report also cites studies by the International Water Management Institute, predicting that one billion people will face absolute water scarcity by 2025. To avoid this, the report suggests using science, particularly genetics and climatology, to address climate change, water and food scarcity. However, some measures proposed in the report are more controversial, including: diverting scientific effort from arms, space research, and 'doubtful' technologies to practical goals for humanity; establishing a global authority to define priorities and advise on implementation; forming a 'censor' body to examine new technologies and identify potential harm; creating a specialized international penal law body to prevent the application of harmful technologies; and establishing research institutes with secure funding. The report concludes that these objectives may not be achievable, but can be approached.

**The Problem of Space Debris: A Growing Concern**
Raphaël, a 30-year-old astronomy enthusiast from Colfontaine, recently observed two Russian satellites from his backyard using his telescope and the Stellarium app. Jean-François Mayence, president of the scientific juries of the 'pôle espace' at the Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO), explains the significance of these satellites and the challenges they pose. 'It's a problem on the international agenda for several decades, it's the problem of space debris,' Mayence said. 'A large number of objects are in orbit for several dozen, or even hundreds, of years. Some are detectable by optical means, while others are too small to be tracked.' The problem of space debris is a pressing issue, with many objects in orbit that can pose a threat to operational satellites. Mayence notes that 'the population of debris extends to several types of orbits, particularly low Earth orbit (around 300 km to 2000 km altitude), and threatens a large number of space systems, including manned flights.' To mitigate this issue, efforts are being made to limit new debris creation and to develop solutions for the removal of existing debris. However, Mayence warns that 'the re-entry of dozens of thousands of satellites into the atmosphere will have an impact, and the cumulative impact on this marine zone should also be measured.'

**Growing Space Debris Threatens Earth's Infrastructure**
The growing amount of space debris in Earth's orbit poses a threat to the planet's infrastructure. According to NASA employee Donald Kessler, the 'Kessler-Syndrom' could make parts of the Earth's orbit unusable. Currently, around 40,000 objects are orbiting the Earth, with only a third of them being functional satellites. The rest is space debris, including fragments from explosions, broken-down spacecraft, and collisions. The European Space Agency (ESA) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) are working together to develop a 'Zero Debris Charter' to reduce the creation of new space debris by 2030. The charter has already been signed by over 100 actors in the international space industry. To mitigate the problem, experts are discussing new concepts and technologies to prevent further growth of space debris and collisions. These include controlled re-entry of used satellites, removal of non-functional objects from overburdened regions, and recycling of space debris in orbit. The ESA reports that in 2024, there were several major and numerous smaller fragmentation events that added thousands of new debris objects to the orbit. Even small particles can cause significant damage to satellites, and larger pieces can cause massive damage upon collision. The global satellite population is expected to exceed 60,000 by 2030, and the development of more space-based technology will continue to increase the amount of space debris. 'We need to take action to prevent a disaster,' says Manuel Metz, an expert on space debris at the DLR. 'The handlungsbedarf is great' (the need for action is great), adds Pamela Dörhöfer.

**Space Debris: A Growing Problem in Earth's Orbit**
The European Space Agency (ESA) has raised concerns about the growing problem of space debris in Earth's orbit. According to the ESA, there are approximately 1.2 million pieces of debris larger than 1 centimeter orbiting the planet, with 50,000 of them being over 10 centimeters in size and potentially causing significant damage to active satellites. Currently, only about 40,000 of these pieces can be tracked. However, new technologies, such as the Space Debris Hunter project, are being developed to improve tracking and control. The ESA has also reported that the situation is particularly critical at an altitude of 550 kilometers, where many satellites are in operation. The problem is exacerbated by collisions between debris, which create even more fragments. In 2024, it is estimated that at least 3,000 new trackable objects were added due to these fragmentations. On a positive note, there has been an increase in controlled reentries of discarded satellites in 2024, indicating that space agencies are taking the issue seriously. The ESA is also working on its ambitious Zero Debris Approach project, aiming to drastically reduce the number of space debris by 2030. As the agency notes, 'it's time to put some order before leaving the house' if we want to return to the Moon or go beyond.

**The New Space Race Creates a Problem of Space Debris and Increases the Likelihood of a Spacecraft Colliding with an Airplane**
The new space race has created a problem of space debris, which also increases the likelihood of a spacecraft colliding with an airplane. According to a study by the University of British Columbia, the consequences of such a collision would be devastating. The problem is exacerbated by the increasing number of satellites and rockets in orbit, particularly those carrying internet to remote areas, such as SpaceX's Starlink program. These satellites are sent on rockets that, when they complete their mission, lose altitude and re-enter the planet. Some disintegrate partially, while others, without control, fall anywhere. The ocean is often the primary recipient, but it's also possible for them to fall in urban areas or collide with an airplane. The probability of these space debris impacting an airplane is still low, but it's increasing. According to The Aerospace Corporation, in 2021, the risk was one in 100,000, or 0.001%. By 2035, the predicted percentage would rise to seven in 10,000, or 0.07%. The study also analyzed how this depends on air traffic density. Taking into account the traffic on September 1, 2023, and the United States as the area, it was found that there is a 99% probability of re-entries occurring in green areas, a 75% in yellow, a 26% in orange, and a 0.8% in red. The red areas are the most active, such as major airports, while the orange areas are large cities, and the yellow and green areas are further away from urban centers and, therefore, from the concentration of airplanes. Another problem is the risk of a collision leading to the decision to close airspace. The 4th of November 2022, the body of the Long March 5B rocket, weighing 20 tons, re-entered the atmosphere, falling over the Pacific Ocean. However, it could have been otherwise: the location of entry was due to chance, as the rocket body was abandoned in orbit and no planned design was made for the re-entry of the remains. The night before the re-entry, different monitoring agencies, as well as the European Aviation Safety Agency, issued reports urging national authorities to restrict airspace 'in a corridor of at least 70 kilometers and up to 120 kilometers on each side of the estimated re-entry trajectory' of the rocket. Spanish and French authorities followed this and closed part of their airspace. As a result, 645 flights were delayed, with an average of 29 minutes per plane. Some planes that were in flight had to return to their original airport or take a detour. This was evidence of a lack of planning, anticipation, and control over this space debris. Interestingly, Portugal, Italy, and Greece did not take the decision to close, generating other problems in their airports due to the unexpected increase in air traffic from diverted flights. Unfortunately, controlling the re-entry of space debris does not have an immediate solution. Researchers propose that those responsible for launching rockets invest in controllable re-entry technologies so that they do not enter the atmosphere unpredictably. These technologies include engines capable of re-igniting to partially direct the rocket, but also better mission planning to have the rocket fall in a remote area of the ocean, away from populations and, of course, from air traffic. The problem is that, although the technology is there, it is estimated that less than 35% of launches perform these controlled entries, and with 2,300 objects in orbit and an annual increase of between 30 and 40 objects, the risks will continue to increase. It is also a huge expense, which is why achievements like capturing the Starship propeller and the advances of SpaceX engineers to not have to launch and throw rockets are so important. And it is also necessary to have a global protocol to manage these re-entries and take coordinated decisions, not delegate everything to an aeronautical industry that is not responsible. Ultimately, it is much more likely to have disruptions in air traffic due to this space debris than a collision with a plane, but as long as that probability is not zero, solutions must be considered.

**Falling space junk poses growing threat to aviation, warns B.C. researcher**
A study by researchers at the University of British Columbia found that there is a 26% chance of space junk re-entering the atmosphere and passing through busy airspace, including Metro Vancouver. This could result in costly closures and potentially deadly consequences. The study used space junk tracking data and flight data from commercial aircraft to model the risk. Ewan Wright, a PhD researcher, said, 'We found that there's about one per cent risk of a re-entry over the really high-density airspace, like around airports.' He also stated, 'It could be hours later, or it could be months, or years later — that rocket comes back down.' Wright warned that ignoring the threat could lead to disruptions to airspace and potentially deadly consequences. He said, 'What we're kind of heading towards, I think, is potentially having more and more disruption, or maybe someone on the ground gets hit by space debris, and then we'll see some action on the issue.' Wright is presenting his research to the United Nations' Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to convince people of the urgency to act and to develop technology to eradicate space junk by 2030.

**Space debris is cluttering our orbit. Can falling space junk hit a plane?**
A new study by University of British Columbia researchers has found that there is a 26% chance every year that a leftover rocket will come down in a busy airspace somewhere in the world, posing a catastrophic collision risk to planes. The study's authors, including co-director of the Outer Space Institute Aaron Boley, warn that the risk is so great that by 2035, there will be a one-in-119 chance every year of someone dying from space debris. The study highlights the economic costs of airspace closures and delayed flights, which can be in the tens of millions of dollars. Boley says that the space industry is imposing its risks on the aviation industry, and that regulation is needed to prevent the worst-case scenario. 'The airspace closures right now, the junk that we're finding on the ground, that's the warning,' Boley said. 'It's telling us that unless we change our practices, that low-probability, high-consequence event can indeed happen.'

**Space Debris: A Growing Threat to Air Travel**
A new study by the University of British Columbia has found that the risk of space debris hitting an airplane or a passenger is much higher than previously thought. According to the study, space debris poses a 2,200 to 1 risk of death for airplane passengers each year. This is a conservative estimate that only takes into account large rocket parts. By 2025, the likelihood of space debris falling on busy airspaces is estimated to be 26%. While the risk of a direct collision with a plane is low, the debris can cause significant disruptions to air traffic and increase costs. Researchers note that this estimate only accounts for rocket parts and that the actual risk may be higher when smaller debris from broken satellites and rockets are included. As the amount of space debris in orbit increases, the risk of it falling to Earth also increases. Space agencies and private companies are working to develop new technologies to mitigate this problem.

**Your odds of being hit by a piece of space junk are higher than you'd think**
A new study by University of British Columbia researchers has found that the odds of being killed by a piece of space debris while flying in a plane are one in 2,200 per year. MailOnline reports that this is likely a conservative estimate, as it only takes into account the risk of falling rocket bodies and not other types of space debris such as satellites and rockets breaking up into smaller pieces. Additionally, there is a 26% chance that a piece of space debris will fall through busy airspace in 2025. According to Joe Rogan, a recent discovery on Mars has left him baffled, and a NASA director has shared a warning about a 'city-destroying' asteroid that could hit Earth within the next 10 years.
