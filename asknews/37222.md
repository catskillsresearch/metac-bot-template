**Kyrgyzstan to outpace all Central Asian and EAEU countries in GDP growth in 2025**
The Eurasian Development Bank (EDB) has increased its forecast for Kyrgyzstan's GDP growth to 10.3 percent by the end of 2025, driven by rising gold prices, increased household consumption, and strong investment demand. According to the bank's forecast, inflation will be close to the target of 7.3 percent, and the som exchange rate will remain unchanged at 87.5 soms per $1. The EDB analysts expect that all Central Asian countries will continue to demonstrate confident GDP growth, with an average of 6.5 percent over five months of 2025. They also predict that the high growth rates of the economies in the region will continue in the near future, driven by internal sources of growth, primarily infrastructure and industrial investments, as well as dynamically growing consumer demand. The EDB forecast says that GDP growth in the region will amount to 2.7 percent by the end of 2025, while inflation in the region will slow down to 7.7 percent in 2025 from 8.8 percent in 2024. According to analysts, the economy of Armenia will grow by 5.5 percent, Belarus -- 3 percent, Kazakhstan -- 5.5 percent, Russia -- 2 percent, Tajikistan -- 8.4 percent, and Uzbekistan -- 6.5 percent in 2025. 'Countries will continue to actively rely on internal sources of growth, primarily on infrastructure and industrial investments, as well as on dynamically growing consumer demand against the backdrop of a significant increase in household incomes,' the EDB analysts noted.

**German Industry Association Expects Shrinking Economy in 2025 Due to US Trade Dispute**
The German Industry Association (BDI) is more pessimistic about the country's economy due to the trade dispute with the US. They expect a 0.3% decrease in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the current year, down from a 0.1% decrease previously predicted. BDI President Peter Leibinger stated, 'The industrial production remains nine percent below the 2019 level, before the Corona crisis. The capacity utilization is only 77 percent.' The US tariffs are expected to cost the German economy 0.3 percentage points, according to the BDI. This is in contrast to many economists, who have revised their estimates upwards and expect a slightly growing economy. The economy has already shrunk in 2023 and 2024.

**German industrialists expects national GDP to drop 0.3% in 2025**
The Federation of German Industries (BDI) forecasts a 0.3% decline in Germany's GDP this year. According to the BDI, US tariffs have had a particularly adverse impact on the national economy. BDI head Peter Leibinger stated, 'We still have to travel a certain path for going out of recession.' The federation expects economic growth next year only if the German government takes decisive action and implements structural reforms. Currently, industrial output is 9% lower than the pre-crisis level of 2019.

**Spain Awaits Brussels' Evaluation on Fifth Payment of European Funds**
The Spanish government is awaiting the evaluation from Brussels on the fifth payment of European funds before August. The funds, which have been deployed for four years, amount to 51.3 billion euros, with 40% going to small and medium-sized enterprises. According to Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo, the government is in 'close contact' with the European Commission. Cuerpo stated that the execution of the Recovery, Transformation, and Resilience Plan has surpassed 68% of the total amount convoked. The funds have been used for various projects, including the development of the green hydrogen industry, the decarbonization of the manufacturing industry, and the energy efficiency of 29,940 social housing units. The government expects the evaluation to be made public before August, and the European Commission has urged Spain to accelerate the execution of the plan to avoid losing resources and maximize its positive impact on the economy. The good performance of the Spanish economy, marked by a 2.6% increase in GDP in 2024, is evidence of this. The government estimates that by 2031, the improvement in terms of GDP level will be around 3.4 percentage points.

**US military-industrial complex the real threat: China Daily editorial**
China Daily editorial warns that the US military-industrial complex is the real threat to global security, not China. The US accounts for 40% of the world's annual military spending, with a budget of $820 billion in 2023, larger than the next nine countries combined. The editorial argues that the US' 'misplaced power' thrives on wars and regional tensions, and that its military spending is driven by the interests of defense contractors and policymakers. The US is demanding that its allies in the Asia-Pacific region spend 5% of their GDP on defense, but Japan has canceled a high-level meeting with the US in response to this demand. Other US allies, including Spain and Italy, have also rejected the US' defense spending coercion, arguing that it is unreasonable and counterproductive. The editorial concludes that the US should rethink its ideologically driven perpetual military spending and prioritize peace and human lives.

**U.S. Economy Grows More Than Expected**
The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first quarter of 2018, exceeding Wall Street analysts' forecast of 2 percent. The Commerce Department report showed business investment rose more than 6 percent, but was offset by declines in consumer spending, which was its weakest in nearly five years with a 1.1 percent gain. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent, close to full employment, and first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell to 209,000, the lowest level since 1969. Economists believe the combination of tax cuts and a tight labor market should boost spending in the coming months, and the Fed is now predicting the economy will grow at an annual rate of 2.7 percent this year.

**UK vows to spend 5% of GDP on national security by 2035**
The UK has vowed to spend 5% of its GDP on national security by 2035, with the 1.5% 'resilience' element expected to be met by 2028. The government expects to reach 4.1% of GDP on national security by 2027. Sir Keir previously set out plans to increase defence spending to 2.5% by 2027 and 3% by 2034. Speaking at a press conference, Mark Rutte said the 5% spending commitment was 'a quantum leap that is ambitious, historic and fundamental to securing our future'. However, it is unclear how nations will meet the target or whether they will at all. Ukraine is not a member of Nato and will not be taking part in discussions of the North Atlantic Council.

**Market Analysts Confirm Interest Rate Increase for the Year**
Analysts in the financial market have confirmed the expectation of an increase in the basic interest rate for the year, which rose to 15% in the recent meeting of the Monetary Policy Council (Copom) of the Central Bank. The directors of the institution decided to raise the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, which also led the financial market to revise its projections for the Selic rate this year. According to the Focus Report, the new rate is expected to be 15% (see full report). However, the change only applies to this year, maintaining the forecast of 12.5% for 2026, 10.5% in 2027, and 10% in 2028. Agents in the financial market also made a slight downward revision of the inflation expectation for the year, passing to 5.24% - 0.01 percentage point less than estimated last week. The index is still above the inflation target ceiling of 4.5%, which will only be reached next year. The center of the target, 3%, remains distant and is not expected to occur in the next years. The growth of the Brazilian economy, measured by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), will have a slight increase of 0.01 percentage point this year, passing from 2.20% to 2.21%. Next year, it will be 1.85% and 2% in 2027 and 2028. The Focus Report also points out that the dollar exchange rate will end 2025 at R$ 5.72, or R$ 0.05 less than expected last week. For the next years, the US currency will have a slight variation.

**Third Year Without Growth: BDI Lowers GDP Forecast for 2025**
The German industry association BDI has lowered its forecast for Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025 to minus 0.3%. 'We still have a way to go out of the recession,' said BDI President Peter Leibinger. The pessimism about the economy in Germany is increasing due to the trade dispute with the US. According to BDI, the US tariffs will cost the German economy 0.3 percentage points if they are not withdrawn. BDI's main executive Tanja Gönner said that global trade is expected to grow by only 1.5 to 2% this year. The association expects the 20% tariffs on European exports to the US to be reinstated in July. Gönner spoke of growing uncertainty due to US President Donald Trump's tariff policy. The German industry association expects exports to decline by 2% this year, with the second half of the year being particularly difficult. Simulations by the Munich Ifo Institute suggest that a further US tariff package could severely affect the German industry, potentially shrinking it by 2.8% in the medium term. German exports to the US could decline by 38.5%, and exports to China could decline by 4.7%.

**Economy Grows 5.8% in 2024, Driven by Tax Revenue**
The economy grew 5.8% in 2024, driven by tax revenue rather than production. According to the Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas y Censos (INDEC), the main contributors to this growth were: 31.8% from formation of fixed capital, 27.2% from financial intermediation, 11.6% from fishing, and 9% from hotels and restaurants. On the other hand, the sectors that experienced a decline were: -0.66 percentage points from administration and defense, -2.2% from households with domestic service, and -0.6% from social and health services. The INDEC also reported that the main sectors that contributed to the growth were: 3.7% from agriculture, 11.6% from fishing, 5.1% from manufacturing, and 7.3% from wholesale and retail trade. 'The economy grew 5.8%, but it was driven by taxes, not production,' said no one in the article. However, the article does mention that the growth was driven by tax revenue rather than production, which is a key point. The article also mentions that the main contributors to the growth were formation of fixed capital, financial intermediation, fishing, and hotels and restaurants.

**Is the U.S. heading into a recession? The key signals are mixed**
The US economy is showing mixed signals, with some indicators suggesting a recession may be looming, while others indicate stability. A preliminary estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed a 0.3% decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first quarter, but economists argue this was distorted by the prospect of higher tariffs. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total GDP, continued to grow, and employment remained stable, with the nation's jobless rate holding steady at 4.2% in April. However, consumer sentiment numbers have been dropping, and bankruptcy filings have increased by 10% in April. Manufacturing activity has softened, but a notable exception is the decision by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to add another $100 million to its Phoenix chipmaking hub. Stock-market investors have turned more optimistic, with the S&P 500 notching its first nine-day winning streak in 21 years. The Conference Board has revised its forecast downward for US economic growth in 2025 to a sluggish 1.6%, citing the impact of deepening trade wars.

**US GDP Declines for First Time Since 2022 Amid Trump's Trade War**
The US GDP has decreased for the first time since 2022, with a 0.3% decline in the first quarter of 2025, adjusted for inflation. This is a stark contrast to the 3% growth in the two previous years and the 2.4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2024. According to Bloomberg, analysts attribute this to the fact that American companies have been stockpiling goods in anticipation of Donald Trump's plans to introduce large-scale tariffs on imports. This has led to a record trade deficit for US goods in March. The difference between import and export figures is an important factor in calculating GDP, which also measures domestic consumption, investments, and government spending. Some economists have revised their growth forecasts for the US economy, expecting a further slowdown in the second half of the year due to Trump's trade war and resulting price increases. The International Monetary Fund has also lowered its expectations from 2.7% to 1.8% growth. Many private analysts predict that US economic growth will not occur in the second half of the year. This is due to a record 41.3% increase in imports, which is the highest in almost five years, and a slowdown in consumer spending. These changes are largely attributed to Trump's trade policy. According to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, the net export reduced GDP by almost 5 percentage points, the highest ever recorded. Additionally, the decrease in government spending, particularly on defense (-8%), further dampened economic activity. However, business investments (including equipment purchases) increased by 22.5%, the highest rate since 2020, demonstrating growth in demand for aircraft and computer equipment, which partially offset the decline in trade.

**US GDP Decreases for First Time Since 2022 Amid Trump's Trade War**
The US GDP has decreased for the first time since 2022, with a 0.3% decline in the first quarter of 2025, adjusted for inflation. This is a significant change from the previous two years, which saw a 3% growth, and the fourth quarter of 2024, which saw a 2.4% growth. According to Bloomberg, this is due to the fact that American companies have been stockpiling goods after President Donald Trump announced plans to impose large tariffs on imports. This has led to a record trade deficit for US goods in March. Some economists have revised their growth forecasts for the US economy, expecting a further slowdown in the second half of the year due to Trump's trade war and the resulting price increases. The International Monetary Fund has also lowered its growth forecast from 2.7% to 1.8%. Many private analysts predict that there will be no growth in the US economy in the second half of the year.

Additionally, the decrease in government spending, including defense (-8%), has further suppressed economic activity. However, business investments (particularly in equipment purchases) have grown by 22.5%, showing the highest rates since 2020. The growth in demand for airplanes and computer equipment has partially offset the decline in trade. As previously reported by OBOZ.UA, prosecutors from several US states have filed a collective lawsuit against President Donald Trump's new tariffs, arguing that the head of state is illegally undermining the constitutional powers of Congress to regulate foreign trade.

**US GDPNow Falls to -3.7% for January-March 2025**
The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow, a model that automatically calculates the US GDP based on economic indicators, has been updated. The estimated real GDP for January-March 2025 has fallen to -3.7%, a significant drop from the previous estimate of -2.8% announced on March 28. The decline is attributed to the worsening of the manufacturing sector, as indicated by the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Index released on April 1, which showed a decrease in production and new orders.

**US Manufacturing Index Falls to 49 in March, First Contraction in 2025**
The US manufacturing index, measured by the Ism, fell to 49 in March from 50.3 in February, marking the first contraction in 2025. This is below the expected level of 50, which indicates a contraction. Job openings in the US have also decreased, from 7.76 million in January to 7.57 million in February, which is below the expected level of 7.65 million. This suggests a gradual cooling of the labor market. According to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, if universal tariffs of 20% were to be imposed by the Trump administration, the US economy could fall into recession, with a 7% unemployment rate. This could lead to the loss of over five million jobs and a unemployment rate of 7.3% by early 2027, before decreasing to around 6% in 2028. The White House has stated that no decision has been made and that the 20% tariff on most imports is just one of the options being considered.

**'De-Americanization' of trade is on the cards**
The US' weaponization of tariffs is harming other countries' interests and increasing uncertainty for the US economy, which in turn affects global trade and the world economy. The US' weak consumption growth and shrinking manufacturing activities have lowered market expectations and risk aversion is on the rise. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, the total number of US corporate bankruptcies in the first two months of this year has reached 129, the highest since 2010, and most of the bankrupted companies are small businesses. Research by the Peterson Institute for International Economics shows that the US' steel and aluminum tariffs protected about 14,000 jobs in the steel industry in 2018, but led to the loss of 75,000 jobs in the downstream manufacturing industries. The OECD estimates that global GDP growth will moderate from 3.2 percent in 2024 to 3.0 percent in 2026 due to higher trade barriers and increased geopolitical and policy uncertainty. The US tariff policy deviates from the principle of free trade and undermines the multilateral cooperation mechanism of global economic governance, potentially leading to a trend of 'de-Americanization' in the global industry and supply chains. As the OECD said, 'Global GDP growth is projected to moderate from 3.2 percent in 2024, to 3.1 percent in 2025 and 3.0 percent in 2026, with higher trade barriers in several G20 economies and increased geopolitical and policy uncertainty weighing on investment and household spending.'

**Business News | GDP Growth of US Economy to Slow Down Gradually to 1.6% by 2027 from 2.8% Now: S&P Global | LatestLY**
According to a report by S&P Global Market Intelligence, the US economy's GDP growth is expected to slow down gradually over the next three years. The report predicts that the country's GDP growth will decline from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.9% in 2025 and 2026, followed by 1.6% growth in 2027. The slower growth forecast for 2025 is mainly due to weaker economic activity in the first half of the year, which was affected by harsh winter weather and expected federal layoffs. Ben Herzon, Senior US Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, stated, 'The markdown to growth this year is fully accounted for by weaker growth over the first half of this year. Unseasonably harsh winter weather contributed to a 1.1 percentage point markdown to our first-quarter forecast of PCE growth.' The report also highlighted that changes in trade policies, such as rising tariffs on imports from mainland China, will affect economic growth. Additionally, inflation in the US economy remains a concern, with core PCE inflation expected to increase this year. As a result, the report stated that the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged until December 2025.

The report predicts that the country's GDP growth will decline from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.9% in 2025 and 2026, followed by 1.6% growth in 2027. The slower growth forecast for 2025 is mainly due to weaker economic activity in the first half of the year, which was affected by harsh winter weather and expected federal layoffs. Ben Herzon, Senior US Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, stated, 'The markdown to growth this year is fully accounted for by weaker growth over the first half of this year. Unseasonably harsh winter weather contributed to a 1.1 percentage point markdown to our first-quarter forecast of PCE growth.' The report also highlighted that changes in trade policies, such as rising tariffs on imports from mainland China, are expected to affect economic growth. Additionally, inflation in the US economy remains a concern, with core PCE inflation expected to increase this year. As a result, the report stated that the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged until December 2025.

**U.S. Economy Grows More Than Expected**
The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first quarter of 2018, exceeding Wall Street analysts' forecast of 2 percent. The Commerce Department report showed business investment rose more than 6 percent, but was offset by declines in consumer spending, which was its weakest in nearly five years with a 1.1 percent gain. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent, close to full employment, and first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell to 209,000, the lowest level since 1969. Economists believe the combination of tax cuts and a tight labor market should boost spending in the coming months, and the Fed is now predicting the economy will grow at an annual rate of 2.7 percent this year.
