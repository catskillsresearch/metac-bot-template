**Annalena Baerbock Elected as Next President of the United Nations General Assembly**
Annalena Baerbock, the former German Minister of Foreign Affairs (2021-25), has been elected as the next president of the United Nations General Assembly for the 80th session, starting in September. Baerbock won the vote with a landslide majority, receiving 167 votes, while her compatriot Helga Smith received only 7 votes. Fourteen countries abstained from the secret vote. Baerbock's candidacy was widely negotiated and agreed upon within the European Union. She will be the fifth woman to hold the position, following María Fernanda Espinosa, the last woman to hold the position, who was elected in 2018. The United Nations has set goals to advance gender equality and women's empowerment, but has yet to have a woman as Secretary-General, a position that is currently held by António Guterres, who will step down in 2026. Baerbock said, 'It was a great day.' Baerbock's election is seen as a step towards greater representation of women in the UN, but it is also noted that the UN's decisions are ultimately made by its member states.

**Annalena Baerbock to Become New President of the UN General Assembly**
The United Nations General Assembly is set to elect a new president, with former German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, representing the 'Green' party, being the sole candidate. According to experts, the election, which will take place at a plenary session, is a formality. The position of president carries significant diplomatic influence and the ability to set the agenda for the largest representative body of the global community. Baerbock, 44, has stated her intention to be a 'unifier' if elected, saying, 'I will serve all 193 member states, big and small.' The official election will take place on June 2, 2025, marking an important step in Baerbock's career, who served as Germany's Foreign Minister from 2021 to 2025. During her tenure, she established herself as a strong advocate for multilateral diplomacy and international law. Baerbock's inauguration as president is scheduled for September 9, 2025, ahead of the general debates featuring high-ranking representatives from UN member states. Her term will last one year.

**Annelena Berbock Elected as President of the 80th UN General Assembly**
Annelena Berbock, the former German Foreign Minister, has been elected as the President of the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, starting from today. She was the only candidate for the position, which is largely ceremonial and does not involve the same level of authority as the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres. The election was a formality, with 193 member states of the UN present. Berbock will be formally inaugurated on September 9, just before the start of the General Assembly's general debate. Originally, the prominent German diplomat Helga Schmidt was supposed to take the position, but it was decided to make it a political appointment, and Berbock was chosen as the German candidate for the 2025-2026 term. In October 2024, a network of Palestinian civil organizations called for an investigation into Berbock by the International Criminal Court, citing her justification of Israeli war crimes against Palestinian civilians, describing her statements as 'dangerous'. Berbock had said in a speech to the German Federal Parliament on October 10, 2024, that 'defending oneself means destroying the terrorists, not just attacking them', claiming that 'Hamas' hides in civilian gatherings and schools. She added: 'That's why I explained to the UN that civilian areas can also lose their protected status due to the misuse by terrorists.' A survey in March 2025 found that Berbock's nomination to a high position in the UN did not receive good approval from most Germans. The survey, conducted by the 'Jugend & Volk' institute on behalf of the German Press Agency (dpa), found that 42% of Germans saw Berbock's nomination as a negative thing, 15% as somewhat negative, 12% as positive, and 16% as somewhat positive.

**Lee backs nuclear power - for now**
Presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being', but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables to supply industrial hubs and aims to phase out coal by 2040. He supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' In contrast, Lee's main rival, Kim Moon-soo, supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60% of the mix. South Korea's latest energy blueprint aims for nuclear to make up 35% of the power mix by 2038, with renewables at 29%. If elected, Lee is expected to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30% of the power mix by 2030.

**Key Dates for Mexico's Upcoming Elections: 2026 and Beyond**
In 2026, Mexico will hold one of the most significant electoral processes of the sexenio, where millions of citizens will vote in the midterm elections. This process will not only define the new composition of the Chamber of Deputies at the federal level, but also have a significant impact on the state and municipal political map of the country. During this election, Mexicans will vote to renew the 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, a fundamental body for the creation and reform of laws in the country. Additionally, in the states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Campeche, Chihuahua, Colima, Guerrero, Michoacán, Nayarit, Nuevo León, Querétaro, Quintana Roo, San Luis Potosí, Sinaloa, Sonora, Tlaxcala, and Zacatecas, citizens will elect a new governor and municipal presidents, shaping the local political leadership for the next years. Claudia Sheinbaum, who is about to complete her first year as President of Mexico, will have to face the presidential elections in 2030, which are expected to be one of the largest in history, and will allow citizens to express their opinion on the current governing party, Morena, which has not met expectations in recent months.

**Eduardo Bolsonaro Vows to Run for President in 2026, if Father Allows**
Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, has expressed his willingness to run for president in 2026, stating 'obviamente, se for uma missão dada pelo meu pai, vou cumprir' (obviously, if it's a mission given by my father, I will fulfill it). He mentioned that he is happy to see his name in some polls, but believes that the candidate in a 'normal democracy' should be his father. Eduardo also stated that he is not the owner of his father's will and that the decision of who will be the candidate will be up to Jair Bolsonaro. He also mentioned that his father is still a possible candidate, despite being ineligible until 2030. Eduardo also spoke about his own plans, saying that he is an 'exilado político' (political exile) and that he will likely stay in the US until 2026, when he plans to return and possibly run for the presidency or senate.

**Stacey Abrams is the Democrats' self-made nightmare  --  as she hints...**
Stacey Abrams, the perennial Georgia gubernatorial candidate, is reportedly considering another run for the office in 2026. However, many Democrats are worried that she would be a liability in the general election, citing her inability to win a statewide race despite her popularity in Democratic primaries. 'She's run twice, and that's enough to convince me she won't win' a general election, said Jimmy Johnson, former chair of the Appling County Democratic Committee. Abrams' 'unabashed liberal platform and relentless GOP attacks have taken a toll on the swing voters who help decide Georgia races,' according to Greg Bluestein of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The article suggests that Abrams' inability to win a general election is a result of her own making, and that Democrats created a 'monster' in her by promoting her as a progressive folk hero despite her lack of political talent. Abrams has been plagued by scandal, including a $300,000 campaign-finance fine and an investigation into a $2 billion federal grant she played a role in securing.

**Stacey Abrams considers Third run for Georgia governor despite back-to-back defeats**
Democrat Stacey Abrams is considering a third-straight run for Georgia governor in 2026, despite losing to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in the past two elections. Abrams, a former Democratic Party leader and nationally known voting-rights advocate, has remained politically active in Georgia since 2022. She has been appointed to a chair at Howard University and has served as a senior counsel for a climate action nonprofit organization. Abrams has also founded several organizations focused on voting rights, economic power, and community building. Kemp, who is term limited, is not seeking reelection in 2026, making the race to succeed him a 'toss up' according to The Cook Political Report. Republican Attorney General Chris Carr has already announced his gubernatorial campaign, while Lt. Gov. Burt Jones is rumored to be mulling his own bid for the Republican nomination.

**OF COURSE: Stacey Abrams mulling another bid to be Georgia’s Gov after two failed attempts – The Right Scoop**
Stacey Abrams, a former Democratic Party leader in Georgia, is reportedly considering a third run for governor in 2026, despite losing to Brian Kemp in 2018 and 2022. Abrams, a voting-rights advocate, would face a competitive race in the battleground state, with Republican Attorney General Chris Carr and Lt. Gov. Burt Jones already announcing their gubernatorial campaigns. Abrams' potential candidacy has raised concerns among Republicans, with one stating, 'Georgia cannot and must not allow Abrams to win in this state. She's lost twice, thankfully, but now that Kemp is term-limited a strong Republican needs to run a great campaign to defeat her for a third time. She would be a disaster for Georgia.'

**Stacey Abrams Considers Third Run for Governor in Georgia**
Stacey Abrams is considering a third run for governor in Georgia after back-to-back defeats to Gov. Brian Kemp. Abrams delivered a speech in 2016 that channeled liberal outrage over President Donald Trump's first term into her own campaign for governor. Trump is now in his second term, and Republicans are again ascendant in Georgia. Abrams' recent performance has been inconsistent, with some praising her dedication and others criticizing her lack of progress. The Daily Item reports that Abrams is considering a third run, but no official announcement has been made. Abrams' past performances have been marked by controversy and criticism, but she remains a prominent figure in Georgia politics.

**Former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms Announces Intention to Run for Georgia Governor**
Former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has announced her intention to run for Governor of Georgia in 2026. In a statement, she said, 'Now is the time for 'extreme urgency' as Martin Luther King Jr. reminded us. For the people of Georgia, this means having leaders who will not blindly follow Trump into a moral and economic cliff, but instead focus on our community's pressing needs.' Bottoms previously expressed her consideration of running for Governor and expects to make a formal announcement soon. She served as Atlanta's mayor from 2018 to 2022 and was a senior advisor to President Biden from 2022 to 2023. Bottoms has not specified which policies she will prioritize in her campaign, but she has said she 'reserves all options' and is praying and discussing her political future with her family. Her potential candidacy has increased with the recent announcement by Lucy McBath, a Georgia congressman, that she will not run for Governor due to her husband's cancer treatment. If Bottoms enters the race, the Democratic Party's potential candidates will be narrowed down. Other potential candidates include former DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond and current state Senator Jason Estevez. Stacey Abrams, a former candidate for Governor, has not ruled out running in 2026.

**2028 US Presidential Election: Top Democratic Candidates Emerge**
Despite the 2028 presidential election being relatively far away, the competition within the Democratic Party is already heating up. Several prominent leaders are seeking to strengthen their national presence and build strong support networks in preparation for the biggest race in the United States. While no official candidate has announced their candidacy yet, the actions of some political figures clearly indicate their future ambitions. Amidst the ongoing uncertainty within the party about how to deal with President Donald Trump's policies after his 2024 win, the competition between Democrats in 2028 appears more open than ever. A report by Axios highlighted the top names vying for the potential presidential race, and their political moves that may pave the way to the White House. Pete Buttigieg has shown his national ambitions clearly by running for president in 2020 while serving as the mayor of South Bend in Indiana. He served as the Transportation Secretary in President Biden's administration, where he faced numerous crises. He was considered a strong candidate for the Michigan governor or Senate race next year, but he announced his withdrawal from both races last week. Stacey Abrams has long been considered a potential Democratic presidential candidate, as she has worked to build a national network of supporters and donors over the years and has received more media attention. After Trump's 2024 win, Abrams called for a special legislative session in California to raise funds to challenge the Republican president's policies legally. Abrams has recently tried to present himself as a moderate politician to expand his base of support, and he sparked controversy when he said in a conversation with right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk that allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' and women's sports is 'extremely unfair.' Emanuel, who served as the US Ambassador to Japan during the previous Biden administration, has raised questions about his potential candidacy. Emanuel was Obama's White House Chief of Staff and has appeared in several public events warning of the need for Democrats to reassess their political strategies before the 2026 midterm elections. Emanuel joined CNN as a commentator last month and writes an article in The Washington Post. Walz announced last month that he would not run for the new Senate seat in Minnesota in 2026, leaving the door open for a potential presidential candidacy. Walz, who served as the Governor of Minnesota for two terms and was the Democratic nominee for Vice President in the 2024 presidential election, began a national tour of town halls in Republican-leaning districts. Pritzker is a wealthy businessman who has established himself as one of the symbols of 'Democratic resistance' in Illinois. He has worked to strengthen his national image in recent years and was included in unofficial lists as a potential alternative to President Biden after his poor performance in the first presidential debate last year. Whitmer is considered one of the rising stars in the Democratic Party and has presented herself as a pragmatic and moderate leader since Trump's win. She met with Trump this week to discuss issues related to jobs, tariffs, and defense investments. In recent weeks, she has praised the deployment of National Guard troops to the border to combat illegal immigration and expressed openness to imposing new tariffs to protect industry. However, she refused to join a multi-state lawsuit against Trump's attempt to ban birthright citizenship. Polis, who served as Governor of Colorado for two terms, was one of the names floated as a potential alternative to Biden in the 2024 election. Like Yoder, he has taken a centrist approach since Trump took office, saying in his address to the state that he hopes to work with Trump and Congress 'to secure the border, stop human trafficking, and prevent the flow of illegal weapons and drugs.' He supported Trump's controversial nomination of Robert Kennedy Jr. for Secretary of Health and Human Services. The list of potential candidates also includes Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, and Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy. Axios believes that Democratic leaders are divided on how to face Trump, given the party's identity crisis after the 2024 elections. This time, there is no consensus on the strategy, as Democratic leaders are taking different paths.

**Venezuela's Election: What's Next for Maduro?**
As Venezuela prepares for its July 28 elections, the question on everyone's mind is what will happen to President Nicolás Maduro if he loses. Elliott Abrams, a former special envoy for Venezuela, has urged the US to offer Maduro an amnesty deal if he steps down. Abrams cited the example of Panama's Manuel Noriega, who was offered an amnesty deal in 1988 in exchange for leaving office. Noriega refused, and was later deposed and sentenced to 40 years in prison. Abrams believes that an amnesty deal could be the key to a peaceful transition in Venezuela, where Maduro's regime is facing significant opposition. The opposition candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia, is expected to win with around 60-70% of the vote, while Maduro is predicted to receive around 30%. The outcome of the election will depend on the military, who have been a key supporter of Maduro's regime. However, there are signs that the military is becoming increasingly divided, and a large opposition victory could cause a rift within the ranks. The opposition will need to negotiate with Maduro and his allies to secure a peaceful transition, and an amnesty deal could be a key part of that process. However, the idea of an amnesty deal is not without controversy, and many see it as a betrayal of the victims of Maduro's regime. As Abrams noted, 'sin la recuperación de la democracia, toda lucha habrá sido en vano' (without the recovery of democracy, all struggle will have been in vain).

**US Presidential Election 2024: How it Works**
The US presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024. The winner of the election will be determined by the Electoral College system, where the candidate who wins the most votes in a state gets all of that state's electoral votes. In most states, the candidate who wins the most votes gets all of the state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, where the electoral votes are allocated proportionally. To be eligible to vote in the US, one must be a US citizen and at least 18 years old. The candidates will finance their campaigns through donations and the 'Citizen-United-Urteil' allows for indirect campaign support with few restrictions. The election process is complex, with multiple stages, including the nomination convention, debates, and the final election. The winner of the election will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. As of now, the candidates for the election are Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, with the first debate scheduled for September 10, 2024. The election will be a crucial moment in US history, with the winner determining the course of the country's future.
