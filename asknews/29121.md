**Michelle Bolsonaro Gains Strength as Potential Candidate for 2026 Presidential Election**
Michelle Bolsonaro, the wife of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, is gaining strength as a potential candidate for the 2026 presidential election. According to a recent survey by Paraná Pesquisas, she is tied with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) with 31.7% of the vote. Michelle has been consolidating her position as a viable candidate within the Liberal Party (PL), particularly among evangelical and conservative women. She has been actively involved in social causes, such as defending the deaf population and advocating for the anistia of prisoners from the January 8, 2023 protests. Michelle has also been touring the country, attending events and giving speeches in support of conservative candidates, particularly women. Her popularity is growing, and she is seen as a potential candidate for the presidency, with some analysts suggesting that she could be a strong contender. However, there are also concerns about her ability to connect with the broader electorate and her potential to be seen as a continuation of her husband's policies. 'She starts with consistent support among evangelicals and conservative women, especially if she gets the direct endorsement of Jair Bolsonaro,' said Juan Carlos Arruda, CEO of the Ranking dos Políticos. 'However, the challenge will be to expand her reach to the moderate center-right electorate, the business community, and young urban voters. To do this, she will need to adjust her discourse - without abandoning her conservative identity, but signaling commitment to issues like institutional stability, economic development, and pragmatic public policies.'

**Lula Seeks Alliances with PSD and MDB for 2026 Elections**
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) is seeking alliances with the PSD and MDB parties to ensure a strong presence in the 2026 elections. A survey by Estadão indicates that the PT may form an alliance with either party in at least 10 states, either by supporting their candidates or nominating their own. Lula is focusing on individual names from the MDB and PSD rather than the parties themselves, a move reflected in the regional alliances. In Alagoas, the PT is expected to support the candidacy of Renan Filho (MDB), while in the Pará, Lula is likely to run alongside the vice-governor Hana Ghassan (MDB). In Sergipe, the PT is considering supporting the re-election of Governor Fábio Mitidieri (PSD) and nominating his vice. The PT is also seeking to repeat the logic of the 2022 municipal elections, supporting competitive candidates even if they are not from the party. Other alliances are beginning to take shape, such as the PSB in São Paulo and the Solidariedade in the Amapá.

**Ciro Nogueira Defends Withdrawal of Progressistas Party from Government**
Senator Ciro Nogueira defended the withdrawal of the Progressistas party from the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, stating that it does not make sense to maintain the party's alliance with the government. He promised to suggest the withdrawal after the officialization of the federation with the União Brasil party. Nogueira justified that the minority of parliamentarians from the two parties are on the side of Lula in the Legislative. He stated that the federation should adhere to the opposition bloc, but guaranteed the approval of national interest bills. 'My personal position, and I think there is acceptance from Rueda, is to take the decision to leave the government to the party's benches. It does not make sense if you are not going to be with the party next year, to stay in a government with which we do not have an identity.' Nogueira also stated that the federation should make opposition to the government, not to Brazil. He emphasized that the party will not support Lula in 2026 and will have to go for a center or center-right candidate. He mentioned that the party has a strong chance of winning the election and that the current government is in its worst moment. He also mentioned that the party will not support any candidate who does not have the support of former President Jair Bolsonaro. 'We have a strong chance of winning the election, it's a completely viable chance. I think it's very difficult for us to lose the next election. Because we have the best moment of the center and right in our country and the Workers' Party and President Lula are in their worst moment.'

**Lula Confirms Plans for 2026 Re-election Bid**
Brazilian President Lula has been telling his allies that he plans to run for re-election in 2026, saying 'I only lose to myself.' This statement has been seen as a clear indication that Lula does not intend to follow the example of Argentine President Alberto Fernández, who gave up his re-election bid and left space for another left-wing candidate. According to sources close to the president, Lula is not concerned about the current disapproval ratings of his government, and believes that the economic situation will improve by October 2026, driven by investments and job creation, which could reverse the negative assessment. Lula has been prioritizing securing the support of the MDB party, which has a strong national presence and influence in regional alliances. He has been meeting with MDB leaders to consolidate this alliance, but there are internal divisions within the party, with some leaders, such as Michel Temer and Ricardo Nunes, resisting Lula's re-election bid, while others, like Renan Filho and Jader Barbalho, are aligning with the continuity project. Additionally, Lula is involved in the internal succession process of the PT party and is supporting the candidacy of Edinho Silva, the current mayor of Araraquara, for the party's presidency.

**Lula's Government Leader May Sacrifice Re-election for PSD Support**
According to allies of Wagner, the leader of the government may be sacrificed in 2026 in exchange for guaranteeing the support of the PSD of Gilberto Kassab for Lula's re-election. A faction of the PT is advocating for a 'puro sangue' (pure blood) slate in Bahia, with Governor Jerôminio Rodrigues as the re-election candidate and Wagner and Minister of the Civil House Rui Costa as Senate candidates. However, this formation would exclude current Senator Angelo Coronel from the slate. If Coronel is excluded, he threatens to work for his party to support a Lula opponent. In this scenario, Wagner's withdrawal from the election would be a possibility. To guarantee the PSD's support for Lula, the government leader would sacrifice his own re-election to give the spot to Coronel. Wagner's allies deny that he will give up his candidacy. On Friday (23/5), Wagner himself said that there is still uncertainty about his future.

**Rueda Sees Lula as 'Tired and Analogic' and Tells Businessmen: Union Will Be on Presidential Ticket in 2026**
Antonio de Rueda, president of the União Brasil, stated that the party will be the largest political machine in the country. Despite holding ministerial positions in the Lula government, the party is taking steps to distance itself from the president in the 2026 elections. Rueda revealed plans to launch 17 state governor candidatures, elect 140 deputies, and over 20 senators. The party's leader, Riedel, has a 75% approval rating, according to a recent survey by the Instituto Paraná. Rueda met with former President Jair Bolsonaro, advocating for amnesty for those convicted of the January 8, 2023, invasion of government buildings. However, the PT party still holds positions in Riedel's government, as stated by Rueda, 'a federação União/PP será a a maior máquina política da República' (the União/PP federation will be the largest political machine in the Republic).

**Otoni de Paula Prepares Senate Candidacy with Evangelical and Pablo Marçal Support**
Federal deputy Otoni de Paula is preparing to launch his official candidacy for the Senate in the 2026 elections. The event, scheduled for August 28, will feature the presence of Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes, Bishop Abner Ferreira, and businessman Pablo Marçal. Otoni plans to join the PRTB party, which is also Marçal's party, during the next party window. The launch of his campaign will have a strong presence of evangelical leaders, particularly from the Assembleia de Deus. Otoni, who has a strong base among evangelicals, is betting on the conservative vote in the state of Rio, where pastors have been elected to the Senate in the past, such as Marcelo Crivella and Arolde de Oliveira. Aligned with politicians like Jair Bolsonaro and Pablo Marçal, Otoni reaffirms that he will not make alliances with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva or the Workers' Party. His discourse focuses on defending conservative issues, religious freedom, and combating what he calls the 'left's agenda'. The presence of Eduardo Paes at the event is noteworthy, as he has been building alliances with different sectors to compete in the 2026 state election. Otoni wants to represent the right within this coalition, ensuring space for the evangelical and conservative electorate in the majority coalition.

**Lula's 2026 Candidacy: A Force to be Reckoned With**
Former Brazilian President Lula's potential candidacy in 2026 is not to be underestimated. According to an analyst, Lula's ability to adapt to changing circumstances and his strategic thinking make him a formidable opponent. Lula's decision to choose Geraldo Alckmin as his vice-president in the 2022 election, despite being a member of the opposition, was seen as a clever move to avoid losing votes to the far-right. Some believe that Lula may even support Alckmin's candidacy in 2026, with Lula himself leading the PT's campaign. The article argues that Lula's ability to balance his own ideology with pragmatism has allowed him to maintain a strong position in Brazilian politics. In contrast, the current governor of São Paulo, Tarcísio de Freitas, is seen as lacking the same level of authenticity and independence. As one analyst noted, 'Lula is not the same, but his opponents will not have an easy fight in 2026.'

**Lula Signals Candidacy in 2026 Presidential Elections**
During a dinner meeting with party leaders, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva signaled that he will be a 'very likely' candidate in the 2026 presidential elections. Lula stated, 'I am a very likely candidate,' according to Metrópoles. The dinner was an attempt to reestablish ties between the National Congress and the Planalto. Lula spoke for 30 minutes, following the leaders and Minister of Institutional Relations Gleisi Hoffmann. He mentioned the PL of Amnesty, a priority for the Bolsonarista bloc in the Chamber, but stated that it is not a topic of interest to the population. The meeting with deputies occurred on the same day that Lula sent the proposal of constitutional amendment (PEC) of Public Security to Hugo Motta and Davi Alcolumbre, president of the Federal Senate. The PEC is one of the main projects of Lewandowski's ministry and faces strong criticism from governors and opposition parliamentarians. Lula said, 'We will put ourselves at the disposal with intelligence, money, resources, and our political will to see if we can alleviate the fear that the Brazilian people live daily, whether it's a home appliance theft or the madness of a cell phone on the street.' He also stated, 'We will try to show that we will penalize those who commit any crime that interferes with the tranquility of the Brazilian population.'

Alckmin also mentioned that this condition applies to mayors and governors seeking re-election. When asked about the possibility of re-running the ticket with Lula, Alckmin said it's too early to make decisions, but expressed satisfaction with his performance as Minister of Development, a position he was appointed to by Lula. 'The natural candidate for the presidency is President Lula. [...] It's still early [to define the ticket with Lula], but I want to say that I'm very happy doing what I'm doing,' he said. Alckmin also downplayed the possibility of Jair Bolsonaro returning to politics, saying 'Imagine him outside of government.'

**Lula Announces Possible Re-election Bid in 2026**
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has stated that he will run for re-election in 2026 if he is in good health and feels he can be a candidate. 'If I'm feeling well and I think I can be a candidate, I'll be a candidate,' he said in an interview with a local radio station. However, he acknowledged that he must be aware of his advanced age and not 'lie to anyone, much less to himself.' Lula, who is 79 years old, has had some health issues since taking office, including a recent surgery to drain a brain hemorrhage and a hospitalization for a vocal cord lesion. Despite this, he expressed his intention to 'deliver much' until the end of his government. Lula's party, the Workers' Party (PT), has already considered him as their candidate for 2026, but Lula has not yet made a final decision. Meanwhile, Lula also stated that Brazil will respond with 'reciprocality' to the United States if President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on Brazilian steel, as announced. 'If they tax Brazilian steel, we will react commercially or denounce them to the World Trade Organization or tax the products we import from them,' he said.

**Lula Considers Re-Election in 2026, But Prioritizes Health**
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has expressed the possibility of running for re-election in 2026, provided he is at 100% health and has the same energy as he does now. In an interview with a local radio station, Lula stated, 'If I'm feeling well and I think I can be a candidate, I will be a candidate. But it's not my priority now.' Lula, 79 years old, acknowledged that he must be aware of his age and cannot lie to himself or Brazilian society about his ability to continue in politics. Lula's focus is currently on fulfilling his commitments until the end of his term, as he is in the third year of his government and will be 81 years old when the 2026 elections take place. According to polls, Lula is favored in a fragmented right-wing, where leaders are trying to gain political support left by former President Jair Bolsonaro. The Workers' Party (PT) continues to see Lula as their only candidate for the 2026 elections, although Lula has not made a final decision.

**Lula's Candidacy for 2026: 'If I Have 100% of My Health, I Can Be a Candidate'**
Brazilian President Lula stated that his decision to run for re-election in 2026 will depend on his health condition and political factors. In an interview with Rádio Clube do Pará, Lula emphasized that, although he has the disposition and energy to continue in politics, his priority is to govern and fulfill the promises made to the Brazilian people during the last election campaign in 2022. According to Lula, 'If I'm going to be a candidate or not, there's a discussion with many political parties, with Brazilian society. I have 79 years and I have to be aware of myself. I cannot lie to anyone and even less to myself. If I have 100% of my health, with the energy I have today, if I'm feeling good and think I can be a candidate, I can be a candidate. But it's not my priority now.' Lula's focus is currently on the administration of the country and delivering projects and works that are part of his government plan. 'I want to govern in 2025, I want to walk this country, I want to visit cities in the interior, I want to deliver things. It's a lot of school, a lot of Federal Institute, many health programs... I want to return the decency of state treatment to the Brazilian people. After that, I'll think about elections. For now, I want to make the deliveries I promised to the people,' he said.

According to Padilha, Lula will arrive in 2026 'with health and appetite' to continue the government's achievements. He emphasized that Lula is the best candidate to defend the government and that re-election is the best way to do so. The possibility of Lula's re-election was a concern due to his advanced age, but with the absence of key figures in the government to combat the right, the government is starting to organize its communication around the president. The government is focusing on presenting a strong candidacy in 2026, but this will depend on addressing the economic issues that are affecting the government's popularity. Padilha stated that there is no silver bullet, but the government wants to address these issues in Congress. He also mentioned that the government will present an agenda in February, which includes economic, environmental, and educational priorities.
