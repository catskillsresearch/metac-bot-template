**Revolut: A deep dive before the IPO**
Revolut, a fintech company, is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) with a valuation of $45 billion. The company has 53 million users and has recently obtained a full banking license in the UK. Revolut's revenue comes from interest, cards and payments, consumers margins, wealth and trading, and subscriptions. The company's growth is driven by user expansion, geographic expansion, and product growth. According to a model, Revolut's revenue and net income are expected to roughly double between 2024 and 2027, maintaining solid profitability. However, the company faces risks such as regulatory risk, competitive risk, profitability risk, valuation risk, and operational risk. Revolut's valuation is compared to its listed fintech peers, and a discounted cash flow (DCF) model suggests its intrinsic value. The company's growth and profitability are expected to taper off in the future, but it is still considered a high-growth, high-expectation fintech.

**Revolut Establishes Paris as New Hub for Western Europe, Plans €1 Billion Investment in France**
Revolut, a fintech company, has announced that Paris will become its operational hub for Western Europe. As part of this expansion, the company plans to apply for a banking license in France and invest over €1 billion in the country over the next three years, creating over 200 jobs and representing the largest foreign investment in the French financial sector in the past decade. Revolut aims to reach over 100 million global users in the coming years. To facilitate this growth, the company has opened local branches since 2021, starting in France and continuing in Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Romania, and Italy. Further openings are planned in other European countries in the coming months. Based on its local branch network, Revolut is advancing its growth strategy in Europe, announcing the request for a French banking license and the opening of a new headquarters for Western Europe in France, in addition to its current headquarters in Lithuania. This dual-headquarters model for the European Economic Space (EES) will enable Revolut to consolidate its presence in strategic markets, improve interaction with local authorities, and offer tailored services more efficiently to its millions of customers in the region. The new Revolut headquarters for Western Europe will initially be responsible for managing operations in France, while branches in Ireland, Germany, Portugal, Spain, and Italy will be added subsequently; the Lithuania headquarters will continue to serve Revolut customers in other European markets.

**Revolut announces new Paris HQ as part of a £840m investment in France | This is Money**
Revolut, a £35billion fintech firm, announced a £840million investment in France, creating over 200 jobs and establishing a western Europe HQ in Paris. The firm will also apply for a French banking licence. France's economy minister Eric Lombard stated, 'Revolut's investment further strengthens Paris's position as the leading financial hub in Europe.' This move comes after Revolut's founder Nik Storonsky criticised Britain's 'extreme bureaucracy' as it seeks a UK bank licence. However, Revolut clarified that London will remain its global headquarters and it will continue to expand operations in the UK. The choice of France for its western Europe HQ reflects the firm's EU base of 40million customers.

**Revolut names Paris as European HQ with €1bn investment, raising fresh concerns for London**
Revolut, the UK's most valuable fintech company, has chosen Paris as its new European headquarters, investing €1 billion in France over the next three years. The company will apply for a French banking licence and create over 200 new jobs in Paris, in addition to the 300 staff it already employs there. While Revolut maintains its global headquarters in London and states that 'no jobs will be relocated' from the UK, the decision has sparked concerns over London's post-Brexit competitiveness. Éric Lombard, France's finance minister, said the decision strengthens 'Paris's position as the leading financial hub in Europe'. Revolut's move is part of a wider trend of financial services firms increasing their European footprints to retain access to EU markets. The company stressed that London remains central to its strategy, but the scale of investment and job creation in France is likely to raise eyebrows.

**Revolut to Invest €1 Billion in France, Obtain Banking License**
Revolut, a fintech company founded by billionaire Nikolai Toropov, plans to obtain a banking license in France and invest €1 billion in the country. The company, which has a global headquarters in London, announced the opening of its new Western European headquarters in Paris, with a staff of at least 200 employees. Revolut also plans to submit an application to the French banking regulator Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR) to conduct banking activities in France. According to an informed source, the regulator is pushing Revolut to obtain a license because a significant portion of its European retail customers are in France. Currently, Revolut has around 300 employees in France, offering loans and cryptocurrency to nearly 5 million customers. The company aims to increase this number to 10 million by the end of 2026 and 20 million by 2030. Revolut is currently the largest digital bank in Europe, valued at $45 billion, with 55 million customers worldwide and a revenue of $4.1 billion in 2024. 'Not having a banking license was a mistake,' said Toropov. Revolut received a European banking license in Lithuania in 2018 and submitted applications for banking licenses in the UK, UK, and other countries. 'A license with restrictions' was granted by UK regulators in summer 2024, and the company has since submitted 10 more applications for banking licenses worldwide.

**Is Revolut really worth $45bn?**
Revolut, a fintech company valued at $45bn, has released its first annual results since securing a UK banking licence. The company has achieved profitability for the second year in a row, with year-on-year growth and diversified revenue streams. According to fintech industry watchers, Revolut's valuation is justified to some extent, but the company needs to sustain its breakneck growth to exit at or exceed its current price tag. Revolut makes money through fee income, interest income, and wealth trading products. The company's revenue is expected to mirror that of NuBank, a Brazilian neobank, but Revolut has the advantage of acquiring market share in developed markets. Revolut's success is linked to more 'volatile' corners of the financial services industry, such as crypto trading. However, public market investors view its reliance on fee income favourably, provided it can continue to show growth. Revolut is preparing to enter the mortgage market in several countries and will be able to lend to customers in the UK once it exits the mobilisation stage of its banking licence process.

**Revolut to start British banking operations this year as profits surge**
Revolut, a London-based fintech firm, expects to start operating as a UK bank in 2025 after securing a banking licence from the Prudential Regulation Authority in July 2024. The firm's annual pre-tax profit rose by 149 per cent to £1.1billion last year, driven by card payments, interest on higher interest rates, and its wealth arm incorporating trading and crypto products. Customer numbers grew to 52.5million, up from 38million in 2023, and wealth revenues grew 300 per cent year-on-year. Revolut's chief executive and founder, Nikolay Storonsky, said 2024 had been a 'landmark' year for the business, and the firm is making strong progress towards 100million daily active customers across 100 countries. Meanwhile, Zopa Bank, another online-based bank, doubled its pre-tax profit to £34.2million in its second full year of profitability, driven by a 60 per cent surge in its deposits base to £5.5billion.

**Revolut Plans to Become a 'Real' Bank in Ukraine: What's Known and When It Will Happen**
Revolut, a British neobank, plans to obtain a banking license in Ukraine to launch accounts in hryvnia, credits, and business e-acceptance. Although the exact timeline for obtaining the license is unknown, the company's head of new markets, Dmitriy Strelchuk, said that it is a strategic goal. Revolut already allows users to transfer money from their Revolut card to Ukrainian bank cards, but the company wants to offer more services, including deposits and lending, once it receives the license. The license will enable Revolut to operate as a bank in Ukraine, providing users with more financial services in the national currency. Revolut has been working with Ukrainian clients, including those living abroad, but wants to expand its presence in the Ukrainian market. The company sees potential for growth in digital banking services among Ukrainians, who have become more interested in such services due to the war and migration processes. Revolut plans to compete with traditional banks by offering more flexible and technological services. The exact timeline for obtaining the license is unknown, but it is expected to happen by the end of 2025.
