**Bananas May Become a Luxury: Climate Experts Warn of New Threat**
According to a new study by Christian Aid, by 2080, nearly two-thirds of the areas in Latin America and the Caribbean suitable for banana cultivation may become unsuitable. Temperature records, extreme weather events, and climate-related pests are destroying crops in countries such as Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Colombia, reducing yields and devastating entire rural communities. Bananas are not only the most popular fruit but also the fourth most valuable crop in the world after wheat, rice, and corn. About 80% of bananas are grown for local consumption. For over 400 million people, bananas provide up to 27% of their daily calories. Aurore Pop Shoy said, '80% of bananas that enter supermarkets worldwide are exported from Latin America and the Caribbean, regions that are most affected by climate disasters.' The 'cavendish' variety, which dominates the global export market, is particularly vulnerable to temperature fluctuations, requires moderate watering, and cannot withstand storms that damage leaves and disrupt photosynthesis. According to Osai Ojigho, Christian Aid is calling on countries with high greenhouse gas emissions, the main culprits of the climate crisis, to urgently reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and fulfill their commitments to financing climate adaptation for vulnerable communities.

**The Disappearing Fruit: How Climate Change Threatens the World's Bananas**
Climate change may lead to the disappearance of bananas from store shelves. According to Christian Aid research, up to 70% of land suitable for banana cultivation in Latin America and the Caribbean will become unsuitable by 2080. Bananas are the world's most popular fruit and the fourth most important food crop after wheat, rice, and corn. Approximately 80% of global banana exports come from regions particularly vulnerable to climate crisis consequences. Scientists warn that human-induced climate change threatens not only yields but also the lives of millions of people whose existence depends on banana production and export. 'Climate change is killing our crops. We have no income - nothing to sell. My plantation is dying,' said Guatemalan farmer Aurelia Pop Kso, 53. The Cavendish variety, which dominates the global market, is particularly affected. It requires a specific temperature range (15-35°C) and water balance - drought and excess water are equally deadly. Cavendish is also sensitive to storms: strong winds damage leaves, disrupting photosynthesis and reducing yields. Although there are many banana varieties worldwide, almost all exports are focused on Cavendish due to its ease of transportation and high yields, but its genetic uniformity makes it extremely vulnerable to climate change challenges.

**Climate Change Threatens 80% of Banana Exports**
The banana is the fourth most important crop in the world by revenue, but climate change threatens 80% of exports. According to Christian Aid, the first exporter of bananas worldwide is Ecuador, with $3,420 million in 2023, followed by the Philippines, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. However, the future of the banana industry is uncertain due to climate change, which could affect 60% of banana and plantain cultivation zones by 2080. The main problem is the lack of genetic diversity in the Cavendish variety, which dominates the global market. Christian Aid warns that if a disease were to affect this variety, it could cause significant damage to the sector. The banana is a staple food in many countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, where it is consumed daily. In Uganda, for example, the average banana consumption is 191 kg per person per year. The Cavendish variety, which is widely cultivated, has a high resistance to fungal diseases, but it is also a monoculture, which makes it vulnerable to disease outbreaks. 'The 80% of bananas that are exported worldwide come from Latin America and the Caribbean,' explains Christian Aid. 'The problem is that the Cavendish variety is not the only one that is cultivated, but it is the one that dominates the market.'

**How climate change is impacting the banana**
Climate change poses a significant threat to the world's banana supply, with nearly two-thirds of banana cultivation areas in Latin America and the Caribbean expected to become unsuitable for farming by 2080. Rising temperatures, extreme weather, and climate-related pests have reduced yields and devastated rural communities in countries like Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Colombia. According to Christian Aid's report, 'Going Bananas: How Climate Change Threatens the World's Favourite Fruit,' the Cavendish variety, which accounts for 80% of global exports, is particularly vulnerable due to its lack of genetic diversity. The report calls for an urgent need to phase out fossil fuels and meet climate change goals to protect the livelihoods of communities that rely heavily on bananas for food and income.

**Bananas on the Brink: Climate Change Threatens the World's Favorite Fruit**
New research warns that climate change threatens the future of the world's most popular fruit, bananas. According to a new report by Christian Aid, nearly two-thirds of land in Latin America and the Caribbean may no longer be suitable for growing bananas by 2080. The report, 'How climate change threatens the world's favorite fruits', highlights that rising temperatures, extreme weather conditions, and climate-related pests are reducing yields in producing countries, particularly in Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Colombia. This leads to significant losses for rural communities that rely on banana plantations. Bananas are the most consumed fruit in the world and the fourth most important food crop after wheat, rice, and maize. About 80% of the world's bananas are grown for local consumption. Moreover, over 400 million people worldwide rely on bananas for 15-27% of their daily calorie needs. 'Climate change is killing our harvest. This means there is no income because we can't sell anything. My plantation is dying. So, death is happening,' said 53-year-old Guatemalan farmer Aurelia Pop Xo. Bananas, especially the 'Cavendish' variety, are highly sensitive to changes in conditions. They grow in a temperature range of 15°C to 35°C, require moderate humidity, but not excessive. Hurricanes and floods damage leaves, disrupting photosynthesis. Despite hundreds of banana varieties, 'Cavendish' dominates global exports due to high yields and durability. However, the lack of genetic diversity makes this variety particularly vulnerable to climate change. Climate change also contributes to the spread of fungal diseases that are already destroying entire plantations. Black Sigatoka, for example, thrives in a humid environment and can reduce photosynthesis by 80%. Changes in rainfall patterns also trigger outbreaks of tropical fusariosis disease, which can destroy an entire 'Cavendish' plantation. Researchers are calling on the world's most polluting countries to abandon fossil fuels and fulfill their financial commitments to support affected communities. 'Bananas are not just the world's favorite fruit, but also an important product for millions of people. We must recognize the danger that climate change poses to this culture,' said Osai Ojigho, Christian Aid's director of policy and campaigns. Scientists have developed a method that can provide food for over 13.6 billion people. Electric agriculture will allow plants to grow without sunlight and soil.

**Climate Crisis Threatens World's Most Popular Fruit: Bananas**
According to a report by the British humanitarian project Christian Aid, the climate crisis threatens the world's most popular fruit, bananas. The report states that around 80% of the world's bananas are exported from regions where the climate crisis is affecting the crops. By 2080, around 66% of the land used to grow bananas in these regions may become unsuitable for agriculture. The report, titled 'Bananas on the move: how climate change threatens the world's favorite fruit', explains that countries that grow bananas (such as Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Colombia) are facing the following challenges: 'Climate change is killing our harvest. This means there is no income, as we cannot sell anything. My plantation is dying. So, what is happening is death,' said a banana producer from Guatemala, 53-year-old Aurelia Pop Xo. Bananas, especially the popular Cavendish variety, are relatively 'weak' fruits. They require: 'Despite the existence of hundreds of banana varieties, fruit conglomerates have chosen to grow and sell Cavendish for its high yield, frost resistance, and good taste. However, the lack of genetic variation makes these fruits particularly vulnerable to the rapidly changing climate. Christian Aid notes that bananas are: 'Around 80% of the crop is consumed locally. Meanwhile, over 400 million people worldwide receive 15-27% of their daily calorie needs from bananas. Experts emphasize that the communities that grow bananas are largely unaffected by global warming. In light of this, Christian Aid is calling on countries that contribute the most to environmental pollution: 'Bananas are not just the world's favorite fruit, but also an essential food source for millions of people. We need to recognize the danger that climate change poses to this vital crop,' said Osai Ojigho, director of policy and campaigns at Christian Aid.

**Climate Change Threatens the Future of the World's Most Consumed Fruit**
A new study suggests that climate change threatens the future of the world's most consumed fruit, bananas. Approximately two-thirds of banana-growing regions in Latin America and the Caribbean may not be suitable for cultivation by the coming decades. Rising temperatures, extreme weather, and climate-related pests are affecting banana-producing countries such as Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Colombia, leading to decreased yields and destruction of rural communities that depend on banana production. Bananas are the world's most consumed fruit and the fourth most important crop globally after wheat, rice, and corn. They account for 80% of the world's banana production, and more than 400 million people rely on them for 15-27% of their daily caloric intake. According to estimates, 80% of the world's banana exports come from Latin America and the Caribbean, which are among the most vulnerable regions to extreme weather and slow-onset climate disasters. Aurielia Pob Zú, a Guatemalan banana farmer, says, 'The climate change has affected our crops, which means we have no income because we can't sell anything. My farms are dying, so what's happening is death.' Bananas are a sensitive crop, requiring temperatures between 15-35°C to grow and sufficient water. They are also susceptible to storms that can cause leaf damage, hindering photosynthesis. While there are hundreds of banana varieties, the Cavendish variety accounts for the majority of exports due to its delicious taste, high yield, and ability to withstand disease. Climate change directly damages the growing conditions of different banana varieties and contributes to the spread of fungal diseases that already devastate crops and livelihoods. The black leaf spot fungus can reduce a banana plant's photosynthetic capacity by 80%, thriving in wet conditions. Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns also exacerbate the spread of another fungus, the fourth type of Fusarium tropicalis, which is a soil-borne microbe that can destroy Cavendish banana farms worldwide.

**Climate Challenges and Economic Pressures Threaten the Future of Bananas**
The banana, one of the most consumed and exported fruits in the world, is facing significant challenges due to global warming. Experts warn that the increase in temperatures and the spread of diseases can directly impact the supply and, consequently, the prices of this essential fruit. Pascal Liu, an economist at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), highlighted that climate change is a growing threat to banana production, as it exacerbates the spread of diseases. In 2024, banana supplies in the UK were disrupted by marine storms, but local ripening systems were able to mitigate the impact on consumers. However, the main concern lies in the long-term effects of climate change on plantations. The spread of the fungal infection Fusarium Wilt TR4 is also a concern for producers worldwide, as it has devastated plantations in Asia and Australia and has reached South America. The Cavendish variety, the most consumed globally, is particularly at risk due to this disease. In addition to climate conditions and disease, producers face rising costs of fertilizers, energy, and transportation. It is estimated that without a significant expansion of supply, banana prices will continue to be high in the coming years. Sustainability in banana production was another key topic at the forum, with consumers demanding more sustainable products, which implies adaptations in production methods and independent certifications. Sustainable regulations are seen as an opportunity to make the sector more 'green', but they also result in additional costs that are ultimately passed on to consumers. In summary, the banana faces an uncertain future with climate and economic challenges. Efforts to mitigate these issues are crucial to ensuring the economic sustainability of producers and continued access to this essential fruit.
