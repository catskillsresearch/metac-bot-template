**Red Lobster and TGI Fridays File for Bankruptcy: A Sign of a Broader Transformation in the Food Industry?**
Red Lobster and TGI Fridays, two well-known American restaurant chains, have filed for bankruptcy due to financial difficulties. Red Lobster, known for its seafood, filed for bankruptcy in May 2024 and closed 187 restaurants in 44 states. The company's CEO, Jonathan Tibus, stated that the decision was 'difficult but necessary' and that their goal is to create a sustainable model for the future. Meanwhile, TGI Fridays, known for its classic American cuisine, closed 161 restaurants after filing for bankruptcy in November 2024 and now operates with only 85 locations. The company plans to transition to a franchise model to reduce operational costs and revitalize the brand. Industry experts warn that this trend may not be limited to these two chains, as rising rent costs, increasing personnel expenses, and supply chain disruptions are putting pressure on chain restaurants. Additionally, consumers are increasingly opting for local, unique, and more authentic flavors, which may be contributing to the decline of chain restaurants. This shift may signal a broader transformation in the food industry, with more chains potentially facing similar challenges.

**Bailey issues consumer alert to 23andMe customers following bankruptcy filing**
Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey has issued a consumer alert to 23andMe customers following the company's bankruptcy filing in March 2025. Bailey advises customers who believe 23andMe owes them money to file a proof of claim by July 14, 2025. Additionally, customers who were affected by the 2023 data breach should file a special proof of claim form. Bailey also recommends deleting their account or restricting the company's access to their data, as it may be viewed as an asset during the bankruptcy process. According to Bailey, 'consumers' generic data could be viewed as an asset as the company attempts to sell to a potential buyer.'

**Red Lobster and TGI Fridays File for Bankruptcy Amid Rising Costs and Changing Consumer Habits**
Two major American restaurant chains, Red Lobster and TGI Fridays, have filed for bankruptcy due to rising costs and changing consumer habits. Red Lobster, which filed for bankruptcy in May 2024, was forced to close approximately 187 locations after the bankruptcy process. The company currently operates 478 restaurants in 44 states. According to CEO Jonathan Tibus, the restructuring process is 'the best way forward for Red Lobster, enabling us to overcome financial and operational challenges and grow stronger.' A potential buyer, Wesley Edens, who is also a co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, has made a bid for the company through Fortress Investment Group, but the outcome is still unknown. TGI Fridays, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2024, has quietly closed around 161 locations, leaving only 85 stores operational. The company is now focusing on its franchise model to sustain its presence. Mark Kalinowski, a food industry consultant and analyst, warns that the bankruptcies may not be limited to these brands: 'Consumers are increasingly opting for local and unique experiences over chain restaurants. Rising rent, labor, and raw material costs pose a significant risk to chains. The industry's reorganization over the next two years is inevitable.'

**Wolfspeed's Last Hope: Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Filing Looms**
Wolfspeed, a leading manufacturer of silicon carbide semiconductors, is facing financial difficulties and may file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company's stock price has plummeted by 60% after a report by the Wall Street Journal stated that Wolfspeed plans to file for bankruptcy in the coming weeks. Wolfspeed has been struggling with a growing debt of $6.5 billion and has been in talks with investors to restructure its debt, but these talks have reportedly failed. Despite receiving $1.5 billion in government funding and tax refunds, Wolfspeed has failed to meet its sales targets and has expressed doubts about its future. The company's new sales forecast for 2026 is $850 million, which is below analyst expectations. Wolfspeed's management has expressed concerns about the company's ability to compete with other semiconductor manufacturers like Infineon and Onsemi. 'It's a last hope for Wolfspeed,' said an insider, referring to the potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. 'Even if the company manages to restructure its debt, it's unclear if it will be able to compete with its rivals.'

**Beyond Meat's Struggle: Can the Veggie Pioneer Recover?**
Beyond Meat, a pioneer in plant-based meat alternatives, is struggling with massive sales problems and significant financial losses. Despite a new injection of capital and radical cost-cutting measures, the company is facing a crisis. The latest quarterly results show a 9.1% decline in sales and an 11.2% drop in product sales. The US market was particularly hard hit, with a 15.4% decline in retail sales. Instead of profits, Beyond Meat reported a net loss of $1.1 million, a dramatic decline from the previous year's quarter. 'Consumers seem to have little interest in plant-based alternatives at the moment,' comments a market observer. The company has taken drastic measures, including a $100 million injection of fresh capital, which will be used for marketing campaigns to promote plant-based proteins. 'We need to reposition ourselves in the consumer's decision-making process,' explains the CEO. While the domestic market is struggling, there are small successes in the international business: retail sales in foreign markets rose slightly by 0.8%, driven by higher prices. In the food service sector, international sales even increased by 12%, mainly due to increased demand for vegan chicken meat. However, the future remains uncertain, and Beyond Meat has withdrawn its annual forecast, expecting positive results only by the end of 2026. The stock, which has lost over 65% since its peak in 2024, reflects the skepticism of investors. Whether the veggie pioneer can turn the tide or continue to decline remains the exciting question.

**France Takes the Lead in Food Regulations: Beyond Meat, PFAS Ban, and Rewe's Protein Strategy**
In France, Beyond Meat is required to remove the cow from its logo and change its communication strategy due to misleading claims. The Rewe Group has announced its protein strategy, which includes a 'Planetary Health Diet' that promotes a diet with less animal protein. Jeff Bezos is getting married in Venice, which is expected to have a significant economic impact on the city. Additionally, a new law in France will ban the production, import, export, and sale of products containing the toxic chemicals PFAS, starting from January 1, 2026. The law will apply to cosmetics, ski waxes, and clothing and shoes, with other textiles being banned in 2030. A court ruling in France has also forced Beyond Meat to stop making misleading claims in its advertising and to remove the cow logo from packaging that does not contain meat or milk. 'This ruling makes sense,' said a source. Meanwhile, the Rewe Group is investing in food-tech startups and will provide them with shelf space and promote the topic of nutrition. This move follows a similar initiative by Lidl, which announced a corresponding product range adjustment in January.

**Beyond Meat forced to restructure after unprecedented speculative mania**
Beyond Meat, a plant-based protein specialist, has seen its market capitalization plummet from almost $10 billion to $250 million over the past three years. Despite a surge in sales from $16 million in 2016 to $465 million in 2021, the company has never generated a profit and has burned cash in increasing proportions. The company's cash burn has decreased significantly, from $437 million in 2021 to $106 million in 2024, but its growth has slowed, raising questions about its solvency. MarketScreener's analysts note that institutional shareholders have increased their stakes despite the stock market rout, while the management team is selling shares they receive as stock options, which have cost the company $142 million over the past five years.

**Beyond Meat (BYND) Stock Falls After Disappointing Earnings**
Beyond Meat's (BYND) stock plummeted after the company released a disappointing earnings report, which fell short of bottom-line estimates. The plant-based meat manufacturer announced layoffs and cost reductions, and its 2025 forecast did not meet analyst expectations. The company reported a modest revenue increase of 4% to $76.7 million, but experienced an operating loss of $37.8 million and a per-share loss of $0.65, which was steeper than the projected $0.45 loss per share. Beyond Meat anticipates 2025 revenue between $320 million and $335 million, below the consensus estimate of $331.8 million. The company's financial health appears distressed, with a risk of bankruptcy within two years and weak operational performance. A potential value trap is identified by GF Value, indicating that investors should proceed with caution. Despite some positive signs, Beyond Meat faces significant challenges, including excessive debt and low earnings quality.

**Beyond Meat Faces Flat Demand In 2025, Path To Profitability Remains Uncertain: Analyst - Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND)**
J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman reiterated an Underweight rating on Beyond Meat Inc (BYND) shares. The company exceeded revenue expectations in the fourth quarter, but fell short of EBITDA estimates due to a weaker-than-anticipated gross margin. The 2025 revenue guidance also underperformed, with a midpoint forecast of approximately $327 million, below the Consensus Metrix estimate of $337 million. Goldman does not see significant changes to the consensus EBITDA for 2025, and notes that the company has a history of missing its guidance. The analyst thinks the path to profitability remains uncertain, and current demand patterns are flat. Goldman changed the 2025 EBITDA estimate from -$63 million to -$61 million and for 2026, the estimate is changed from -$44 million to -$39 million.

**Bankrupt BuyBuy Baby gets second chance a year after closing all 120 locations with help of Bed Bath & Beyond**

Marcus Lemonis, executive chairman at Beyond, believes the BuyBuy Baby brand has a strong future both online and in brick-and-mortar. However, financial experts warn that the company will have to overcome some hurdles to make BuyBuy Baby profitable again.
