**UN Expresses Concern Over Humanitarian Situation in Chad**
The United Nations has expressed deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in eastern Chad, amid a massive influx of refugees and returnees from Sudan, and a severe funding shortage. According to humanitarian workers, over 55,000 Sudanese refugees and 39,000 Chadian returnees have arrived in the eastern states of Ennedi and Wadi Fira since the escalation of violence in northern Darfur last month. This new number adds to the nearly 1 million people who have fled to eastern Chad since the Sudanese crisis began in April 2023, according to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, who attributed this to Chad's 'open-door policy'. Dujarric stated, 'The current capacity of reception sites is largely insufficient to meet the needs', adding that 'most of the new arrivals are women and children who are suffering from psychological trauma'.

**UN Calls for Urgent International Support for Chad's Humanitarian Crisis**
The United Nations has expressed deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in eastern Chad, due to the massive influx of refugees and returnees from Sudan, and a severe lack of funding. According to humanitarian workers, over 55,000 Sudanese refugees and 39,000 Chadian returnees have arrived in the eastern states of Ennedi and Wadi Fira since the violence escalated in North Darfur last month, adding to the nearly 1 million people who have fled to eastern Chad since the Sudanese crisis began in April 2023. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) stated that the current capacity of reception sites is 'grossly inadequate to meet the scale of needs', with most new arrivals being women and children who are suffering from psychological trauma. The spokesperson for the UN said, 'The people in the area desperately need food, shelter, access to water, sanitation, hygiene, and healthcare services, as well as protection services for survivors of violence. It is clear that children suffering from malnutrition also need proper treatment, and until today, the Chad humanitarian response plan, worth $1.4 billion, has only been funded at 7%, or $99 million.' Dujarric added, 'With only 2,000 shelters available out of the 13,500 needed, and one doctor for 44,000 people in some areas, this funding gap highlights the urgent need for increased international support, especially as the rainy season approaches.'

**UNHCR Sudan: Flash Update #1 - Refugee arrivals in White Nile State**
Since 8 April 2025, approximately 25,400 South Sudanese refugees, mostly women and children, have arrived in White Nile State, Sudan. According to the Commission of Refugees (COR), the refugees are self-settling into existing camps, with the majority of Nuer ethnicity settling in the Um Sangour refugee camp and those of Shiluk ethnicity moving to the Aljameya refugee camp. The main reasons for flight are insecurity, inter-communal violence, and deteriorating humanitarian conditions in Upper Nile State, South Sudan. UNHCR and COR are ready to commence profiling of newly arriving refugees and asylum-seekers, and have identified additional land and communal shelters to accommodate new arrivals. However, additional resources are required to upgrade and expand WASH, health, and shelter services.

**UN Calls for Urgent Support for Refugees and Displaced Sudanese in Chad**
The United Nations has called for urgent support for the refugees and displaced Sudanese in Chad, expressing deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in eastern Chad, amid a massive influx of refugees and returnees from neighboring Sudan, and a severe funding shortage. According to the United Nations Information Center, more than 55,000 Sudanese refugees and 39,000 Chadian returnees have arrived in the eastern states of Ennedi and Wadi Fira since the violence escalated in northern Darfur last month. This new number adds to the nearly one million people who have fled to eastern Chad since the Sudanese crisis began in April 2023, which UN spokesperson Stephan Dujarric attributed to Chad's 'generous open-door policy'. Dujarric emphasized that the current capacity of reception sites is 'far from sufficient to meet the needs', adding that most of the new arrivals are women and children who are suffering from psychological trauma. Dujarric said, 'The Tiney transit site, which can accommodate 500 people, is hosting around 20,000 people - scattered throughout the site, sleeping outdoors waiting to be relocated away from the border area.' Since mid-April, UN partners have provided emergency aid, including building hundreds of family shelters, distributing food to over 6,000 people, and providing medicine to cover the needs of 20,000 people. Dujarric said that the local population urgently needs food, shelter, access to water, sanitation, and hygiene services, healthcare, and protection services for survivors of violence, 'and it is clear that children suffering from malnutrition also need proper treatment.' However, as of today, only 7% of the $1.4 billion Chad Humanitarian Response Plan has been funded, amounting to just $99 million. Dujarric said, 'With only 2,000 shelters available out of the 13,500 needed, and one doctor for 44,000 people in some areas, this significant funding gap highlights the urgent need for increased international support, especially as the rainy season approaches.'

**55,000 Sudanese Refugees Enter Chad Amid Escalating Violence in North Darfur**
The United Nations has reported that over 55,000 Sudanese refugees have entered Chad since the escalation of violence in North Darfur (western Sudan) in April last year. The organization expressed concern over the 'deterioration of the humanitarian situation in eastern Chad' due to the influx of refugees and returnees from Sudan and a severe shortage of funding. According to humanitarian workers, more than 55,000 Sudanese refugees and 39,000 Chadian returnees have arrived in the eastern states of Ennedi and Wadi Fira. This number adds to the approximately one million people who have fled to eastern Chad since the outbreak of the Sudanese crisis in April 2023. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric attributed the large influx of Sudanese to Chad's 'generous open-door policy'. Dujarric said during a press briefing in New York that the current capacity of reception sites is insufficient to meet the needs, adding that most new arrivals are women and children suffering from psychological trauma. He noted that the 'Tiné' border crossing site, which can accommodate 500 people, is hosting around 20,000 people scattered throughout the site and sleeping outdoors awaiting transfer. The local population is in dire need of food, shelter, water, sanitation, hygiene, and healthcare services, as well as protection services for survivors of violence. With only 2,000 out of 13,500 needed shelters provided and only one doctor for 44,000 people in some areas, 'the large funding gap and the urgent need for increased international support are evident, especially as the rainy season approaches.' The UN reported that its partners have provided emergency aid since mid-April, including building hundreds of family shelters, distributing food to over 6,000 people, and providing medicine to cover the needs of 20,000 people. However, the organization emphasized that the humanitarian response plan for Chad, worth $1.4 billion, has only been funded at 7%, or $99 million, to date.

**Today's top news: Occupied Palestinian Territory, Yemen, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad, Haiti**
The United Nations (UN) Relief Chief, Tom Fletcher, stated that 'much, much more' aid is needed to enter Gaza after the first trucks of vital baby food crossed the border after 11 weeks of blockade. The UN is distributing flour, medicines, and nutrition supplies through the Israeli fence into the Palestinian side of Kerem Shalom. However, the Israeli authorities are requiring the UN to offload supplies on the Palestinian side and reload them separately, causing delays. The UN is calling for civilians to be protected, whether they move or stay, and for aid to be allowed to reach those in need. Meanwhile, the humanitarian community is appealing for urgent action to assist people in Yemen, who are facing their toughest year yet after more than a decade of crisis and conflict. The UN and its partners are also responding to displacement and humanitarian needs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad, and Haiti. In Chad, over 55,000 Sudanese refugees and 39,000 Chadian returnees have been registered, and the UN is warning of a severe funding gap. In Haiti, the deportation of pregnant and breastfeeding women from the Dominican Republic has raised serious humanitarian and human rights concerns.

**Sudan Emergency: Population movements from Sudan (19 May 2025)**
According to ReliefWeb, there are now 12.4 million people forcibly displaced due to the conflict in Sudan since April 2023, including 8.1 million internally and 4 million in neighboring countries. Sudan and neighboring countries already host large refugee populations and require additional support to provide protection and critical life-saving assistance. Urgent needs include water, food, shelter, health, and core relief items. The current priority activities are registering new arrivals, relocating people away from border areas, identifying vulnerable families and individuals with specific needs, and preventing and responding to gender-based violence.

**Over 40,000 Sudanese Refugees Flee to Chad in a Month, UN Reports**
According to the United Nations, over 40,000 Sudanese, mostly women and children, have fled the ongoing conflict in Sudan to seek refuge in Chad in the past month. The majority of them are fleeing the growing violence in the Darfur displacement camps, particularly in Zamzam and El Fasher. 'A large number of people are still on the move, walking from Sudan due to unaffordable transportation costs,' said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (HCR) in its latest situation report on the Sudan conflict. Many children injured by the war are among the new arrivals, and families have been separated, with some members reported missing, exacerbating the refugees' distress. The UN emphasizes the extreme vulnerability of these populations, particularly minors, and the urgent need to strengthen protection mechanisms, emergency medical care, and psychosocial support at the border and in reception areas. The relocation of refugees from Tiné to Iridimi continues, with over 7,000 refugees relocated by May 11, 2025. 'Due to insufficient resources, some are still living under trees or in public spaces, while others have been installed in community hangars,' notes the UN agency. Only 20% of the $409 million needed to respond to the refugee crisis in Chad in 2025 has been allocated so far. Chad is already hosting 1.3 million refugees, including nearly 800,000 Sudanese who have fled the conflict since over two years. Humanitarian resources are severely overstretched, and needs for water, healthcare, shelter, education, and protection exceed local and international capacities, the UN reminds.

**Sudan Crisis Drives Nearly 20,000 Refugees Into Chad Amid Escalating Violence | Headlines**
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has raised alarm over the mass displacement of nearly 20,000 Sudanese refugees into Chad, fleeing a surge in violence in Sudan's North Darfur region. The refugees, mostly women and children, have reported targeted attacks, sexual violence, and the destruction of homes. According to a rapid protection assessment, 76% of newly arrived refugees have been subjected to severe protection violations. UNHCR is urging the international community to mobilize immediate resources and solidarity to address the humanitarian emergency. The refugee site in Iridimi, Wadi Fira Province, has received eight convoys relocating almost 1,850 newly arrived refugees, but efforts remain vastly inadequate. UNHCR has issued an urgent appeal for $409 million in 2025 to support the refugee response in Chad, but only 20% has been funded.

**UNHCR Warns of Critical Protection Needs as Thousands of Sudanese Refugees Arrive in Chad**
The UNHCR has expressed deep concern over the rapid increase in the number of Sudanese refugees crossing into eastern Chad. Over 18,500 people, mostly exhausted and traumatized women and children, have arrived in the past two weeks. The influx is most pronounced at the Tiné border crossing in Wadi Fira province, where nearly 6,000 people arrived in just two days. Since April 21, over 14,000 people have arrived in Wadi Fira, with 12,000 arriving in the past seven days. The sudden flow of people is a result of the growing violence in Darfur North, Sudan, particularly in El Fasher and its surroundings, which is causing massive displacement at an alarming rate. Many of the refugees report having suffered grave acts of violence and human rights violations that forced them to flee. They describe horrific scenes of men being killed, women and girls being subjected to sexual violence, and homes being burned. The routes to safety were extremely perilous, with robbers and extortionists at checkpoints, and constant threats during the journey. The majority of people have arrived in Chad with nothing: no food, no money, and no documentation. An initial assessment of protection needs conducted by UNHCR and its partners indicates that 76% of the new arrivals have been victims of severe protection incidents, including extortion, robbery, and sexual violence. Despite the extraordinary efforts of local communities and authorities, the capacity to host the new arrivals is overwhelmed. Chad already hosts 1.3 million refugees, including 794,000 who arrived from Sudan since the conflict began over two years ago. The country cannot continue to bear this burden alone. Humanitarian resources throughout the country are extremely limited, while needs are increasing in water, shelter, health, education, and protection. UNHCR is providing vital assistance at border points and in relocations spaces, but current efforts are insufficient to address the magnitude of the crisis. The international community is urged to redouble its support for the emergency, with only 20% of the $409 million needed to respond to the refugee crisis in Chad in 2025 having been funded so far.

**Cuts to Humanitarian Funding Leave Sudanese Refugees in Chad Without Access to Basic Services**
The unprecedented cuts to global humanitarian funding are having severe consequences for Sudanese refugees in Chad, with clinics, schools, and programs to protect women and children from violence and exploitation forced to close. According to the UNHCR, reproductive health services have been particularly affected, with a maternity ward that served refugee women being forced to shut down. As a result, more women are being forced to give birth at home without medical assistance, leading to an increase in maternal and infant mortality. In total, over 8,500 displaced children risk losing access to secondary education this year, as the cuts to funding have made it impossible to pay teachers. If the cuts persist until 2026, over 155,000 refugee children could be left without education, leaving young people without hope and more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. 'The cuts are having a devastating impact on the lives of refugee women and children in Chad,' said the UNHCR. 'We urge donors to reconsider their funding priorities and provide the necessary support to protect the most vulnerable populations.'

**Sudan Conflict: Refugee Numbers to Europe Rise Amid Humanitarian Crisis**
The conflict in Sudan has led to a humanitarian crisis, with over 15 million people displaced internally and in neighboring countries. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, over 1,000 people fleeing the conflict in Sudan have arrived or attempted to arrive in Europe in early 2025, due to increasing desperation caused by a decline in aid in the region. While some Sudanese have returned to their homes in Khartoum, millions in neighboring countries such as Egypt and Chad face difficult choices with reduced services in refugee programs, particularly US-funded aid after President Donald Trump's decision to suspend US foreign aid. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a post on X that 'most refugees fleeing violence caused by the military conflict in Sudan are women and children.' He added that due to reduced aid, the UN is forced to provide them with 'smaller quantities of food, water, medicine, and shelter.' Grandi urged donors along the Chad-Sudan border to 'not reduce your support for victims of the Sudan war.' In a press conference in Geneva today, UNHCR spokesperson Olga Saradova said that around 484 Sudanese citizens arrived in Europe in January and February 2025, a 38% increase compared to the same period in 2024. Saradova added that around 937 others were rescued from the sea or intercepted and returned to Libya, noting that this number represents more than double what was recorded in the same period last year. She warned that 'in the midst of humanitarian aid collapse, and if the war in Sudan does not subside, there will be no option for a much larger number but to take the same route.' It is worth noting that a large number of people who embark on irregular migration journeys have lost their lives in the Mediterranean Sea. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that the number of deaths recorded in the migration route across the Mediterranean reached a record high in 2024, with many losing their lives in the journey, which is considered one of the most dangerous migration routes in the world.

**Aid cuts shut down critical services for Sudanese refugees in Chad - Chad**
The UNHCR and its partners are forced to close or scale back critical services for Sudanese refugees in Chad due to severe funding shortages. Reproductive health services have been particularly hard hit, with a maternity ward forced to close, leading to more women giving birth at home without medical care. Over 8,500 displaced children may lose access to secondary education this year, and if the cuts persist, over 155,000 refugee children could be left without education by 2026. Community leaders are mobilizing to try to fill the gaps, but UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi has described the funding shortfall as 'a crisis of responsibility' and warned that the cost of inaction will be measured in suffering, instability, and lost futures.

**Chad: Registration of Sudanese Refugees and Chadian Migrants**
Since the conflict in Sudan began in April 2023, the CNARR, UNHCR, and IOM have been identifying and registering Sudanese refugees and Chadian migrants returning from Darfur. An estimated 973,000 people in need of humanitarian assistance have been established. To ensure their protection, a census operation was launched along the border, allowing for the collection of essential data on refugees for targeted assistance. In parallel, relocation from spontaneous sites to prepared sites is being implemented, enabling the continuation of individual biometric registration of refugees.

**Situation d'urgence au Tchad : Mise à jour des arrivées du Soudan**
The Chadian government estimates that the number of refugees and returnees in Chad could reach 973,000 by the end of 2025 due to the ongoing conflict in Sudan and the constant arrival of new refugees and returnees. Since the start of the conflict in Sudan on April 15, 2023, the CNARR, UNHCR, and IOM have recorded an influx of people forced to flee, including Sudanese refugees and Chadian returnees arriving spontaneously in Chad through over 32 border entry points in eastern Chad, mainly in the provinces of Ouaddaï, Sila, Wadi Fira, and Ennedi Est. Humanitarian workers are providing vital assistance and a range of protection services to the Chadian government and local authorities in spontaneous sites, extensions, and newly established sites. 'The situation is critical and requires immediate attention,' said the Chadian government. 'We need to provide support to the affected populations and ensure their safety and well-being.'

**Chad Country Socioeconomic Profile of Sudanese Refugees, January 2025 - Chad**
As of November 2024, over 710,500 new refugees arrived in Chad due to the conflict in Sudan, making Chad the world's fifth-largest refugee-hosting country per capita. The Chadian government has been swift to respond to the crisis, implementing the 2020 Asylum Law to provide refugees with opportunities such as access to land, freedom of movement, and identity cards. The government and UNHCR have established seven new settlements and created ten extensions in existing settlements, supporting a model of local integration of refugees in areas with economic potential. According to UNHCR, the number of forcibly displaced individuals is expected to rise further in 2025, exacerbating uncertainty in one of the world's poorest countries.

**Chad Launches Emergency Project to Support Sudanese Refugees and Host Communities**
The Chadian government, in collaboration with the African Development Bank and the United Nations Development Programme, has launched an emergency project to support the stabilization and recovery of Sudanese refugees and host communities. The project aims to respond quickly and effectively to the humanitarian challenges faced by the refugees and their host communities. According to Fatima Haram Acyl, the Minister Delegate to the Economy and Plan, 'The situation of refugees seeking security and dignity reminds us of the importance of our mission: to protect the most vulnerable and work tirelessly to offer them a better future.' The project is a concrete and determined response to these humanitarian imperatives, aiming to build on the dividends of humanitarian aid to strengthen the technical and structural capacities of state actors and the socio-economic capacities of beneficiaries, ensuring a gradual transition from emergency to resilience and development.
