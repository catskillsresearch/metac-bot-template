**DOJ sues Wash. over law mandating priests to report child abuse - UPI.com**
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed a lawsuit against Washington State over a new law that requires clergy members, including Catholic priests, to report child abuse or neglect. The DOJ argues that the law violates the First Amendment right to freedom of religion and forces priests to choose between their obligations to the Catholic Church and their penitents or face criminal consequences. The law, which goes into effect on July 27, adds clergy members to the list of people required to report child abuse or neglect under threat of being charged with a gross misdemeanor offense. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon stated, 'Laws that explicitly target religious practices such as the Sacrament of Confession in the Catholic Church have no place in our society.' The lawsuit is an intervention in a complaint filed by Washington State Catholic bishops, who argue that the law discriminates against them as attorneys are exempt from inclusion as mandatory reporters. Governor Bob Ferguson responded, 'It's disappointing, but not surprising, to see the DOJ seek to shield and protect child abusers.'

**Public Integrity Law Project Advances to Second Debate with Reforms to Penal Code and Traffic Regulations**
The Public Integrity Law project will be debated for the second time in the National Assembly on June 24, with reforms to the Penal Code and changes to traffic regulations. The proposal aims to combat corruption and improve state management by reforming 19 regulatory bodies. One of the main changes is the inclusion of prosecutors in sanctions for prevarication, through a modification to the Organic Integral Penal Code (COIP). Currently, this figure only applies to judges and arbitrators, but with the reform, prosecutors who issue resolutions intentionally contrary to the law will also be sanctioned. Another transitory provision requires all public entities with assets for police training to transfer them to the University of Citizen Security and Police Sciences within six months. The project also proposes reforms to the Transportation Law, including a provision that prohibits contracts for the operation of traffic detection technology, such as radars, from being conditioned on the amount of fines collected. Additionally, economic sanctions for traffic infractions will be suspended while the certifications of the companies responsible for calibrating these devices are evaluated. This is the second urgent economic law sent by President Daniel Noboa in his new government period, part of his agenda to strengthen institutionalism and promote a more transparent public administration.

**DOJ Issues New FCPA Guidelines Amid Growing Ambitions of UK and European Prosecutors**
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has issued new guidelines for Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) enforcement, which confirm that FCPA enforcement will continue but provide opportunities for foreign authorities to lead in cases where US interests are not significantly impacted. The guidelines outline non-exhaustive factors that DOJ prosecutors should consider when evaluating whether to investigate or prosecute FCPA cases, and indicate that foreign authorities may be expected to take the lead in cases that do not have a significant impact on US interests. The guidelines also reflect a focus on holding individual bad actors accountable, rather than attributing all individual misconduct to the corporation. This contrasts with recent UK legislation, which has focused on strengthening prosecutors' tools to pursue corporate criminal liability and efforts to hold corporations accountable for failing to prevent violations. As the global enforcement environment continues to evolve, companies must ensure robust compliance frameworks that align with the varied enforcement priorities of US and UK regulators, safeguarding their operations in an interconnected world.

**CGPJ Criticizes Proposed Reform of Public Prosecutor's Office for Lack of Autonomy**
The General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ) has approved a report criticizing the proposed reform of the Public Prosecutor's Office for not explicitly prohibiting the government from giving orders to the Attorney General of the State. The report, over 100 pages long, notes that the current draft law establishes limits on the requests the Executive can make to the Public Prosecutor's Office, but fails to address direct requests to the Attorney General. The CGPJ argues that this would undermine the autonomy of the Public Prosecutor's Office and reduce the role of the Fiscal Council, which is an elected body representing the Prosecutorial Career. The report states, 'In the systematic of the draft law, the Fiscal Council is configured as an advisory and consultative body of the Attorney General of the State, whose functions are limited to the consultative sphere, without determining participation in decision-making, thus reducing its competences.' The CGPJ also questions the delay in implementing the changes, which would not take effect until January 1, 2028, while the accompanying reform of the Criminal Procedure Law would be implemented simultaneously.

**Patricia Benavides on her reinstatement: 'There are two interpretations of time in the Prosecutor's Office'**
Patricia Benavides, a former prosecutor of the Nation, has spoken out again about her situation in the Ministry of Public Prosecution after the National Justice Council (JNJ) decided to reinstate her in her position. In a recent interview, Benavides asked the current head of the Ministry of Public Prosecution, Delia Espinoza, to comply with the resolution in her favor. Benavides mentioned that there are two interpretations about the time she would have left in front of the Prosecutor's Office, in case of being reinstated. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Constitutional Court have different positions. While the Inter-American Court holds that she should complete the remaining time of her management -- approximately one and a half years --, the Constitutional Court indicates that she should only complete the remaining term of her mandate, which was initially set to conclude in July 2025. 'This must be decided, because there are two interpretations, one from the Inter-American Court and another from the Constitutional Court,' Benavides said, clarifying that her lawyers will determine the correct interpretation and the actions to follow once she assumes her position again. Benavides insisted that she will not go to the Ministry of Public Prosecution this Monday, as she did last week, but will continue with the legal process before the JNJ. She assured that her lawyers have presented a document requesting the JNJ to require Delia Espinoza to comply with the ruling. 'We, as defenders of legality, must comply, even if we don't like the content of the ruling,' Benavides added.

**Episode 374 -- Justice Department Resumes FCPA Enforcement with New, Focused Guidance**
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has resumed FCPA enforcement with new, focused guidance. This new approach will have a significant impact, but its scope will depend on legal factors, resources, and the importance placed on foreign bribery cases. Despite a reduction in FCPA Unit attorneys, the DOJ has authorized 94 US Attorneys' Offices to investigate and prosecute FCPA cases with less oversight, potentially increasing overall enforcement. The DOJ's Guidelines for Investigations and Enforcement of the FCPA, released on June 9, 2025, outline several key issues and priorities for future FCPA cases.

**Al-Hajjaj Summons Bushkiyan as Witness in Corruption Probe**
The Public Prosecutor, Judge Jamal al-Hajjaj, has summoned former Industry Minister, MP George Bushkiyan, to testify as a witness in a hearing scheduled for Wednesday. This comes as part of an investigation by the Information Branch of the Internal Security Forces, led by Judge al-Hajjaj, into allegations of corruption, embezzlement, and bribery by the Ministry of Industry. In a preventive measure, Judge al-Hajjaj had issued a travel ban on Bushkiyan's office manager, Leon Kromyan, who was allegedly involved in collecting bribes from businessmen and traders. However, Kromyan managed to leave the country before the travel ban was implemented. The prosecution of Bushkiyan differs from that of the minister, as the court will request a waiver of parliamentary immunity through the Minister of Justice, who will then request permission to prosecute him based on a report submitted by Judge al-Hajjaj, including the type of crime, the time it was committed, and a summary of the evidence justifying immediate action.

**JNJ Demands Immediate Compliance with Resolution to Reinstatement of Patricia Benavides**
The National Justice Council (JNJ) has again demanded the immediate compliance with its resolution N.º 231-2025-JNJ, which orders the reinstatement of Patricia Benavides Vargas as the National Prosecutor. The measure was reiterated in a letter sent to Congress, where it was also reminded that, if the contempt continues, the use of public force could be requested. According to the JNJ, the resolution was issued on June 12 and 'must be complied with for the corresponding purposes.' This statement comes after a previous communication on June 23, in which the JNJ demanded that the Supreme Prosecutor Delia Espinoza comply with the measure immediately. Despite this, no formal act from the Public Ministry has been reported to officially return Patricia Benavides to her position. She continues to receive police protection as Supreme Prosecutor, but is not formally recognized as National Prosecutor. The JNJ has warned that, if the reinstatement is not respected, the support of the public force could be requested. In its resolution, the JNJ specifies that the measure must be complied with in accordance with article 3 of the document, leaving no room for delays. The situation continues to develop, while waiting for an institutional definition that resolves the conflict opened in the Public Ministry.

**CGPJ Criticizes Deficits in Autonomy of Prosecutors in Bolaños Reform**
The General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ) has identified significant deficits in the autonomy of the prosecutors in the reform of Bolaños, which has sparked controversy in the judicial and fiscal careers. The reform, initiated by Minister Félix Bolaños, aims to prepare the Ministry of Public Prosecution for the future assumption of the direction of the investigation of crimes, currently carried out by judges of instruction. However, the CGPJ argues that the reform does not incorporate a 'prohibition of explicit and absolute' nature that the Government cannot direct the General Prosecutor 'orders, instructions or indications of any kind', as established for the European Public Prosecutor's Office. The CGPJ also criticizes the reform for eliminating the binding nature of the reports of the Fiscal Council, the only elected body of the Public Ministry, and for transferring the assessment of incompatibilities and prohibitions to the General Prosecutor. The CGPJ values positively the establishment of a five-year term for the General Prosecutor, but considers 'discutable' the provision that the person holding the position at the entry into force of the law (January 1, 2028) will continue in office until completing the five-year term. The CGPJ also suggests an alternative redaction for the distribution of the reparto of work, 'avoiding any type of arbitrariness, through non-discretionary and random criteria, the publicity of the same, prioritizing specialization and contemplating expressly the possibility of impugnating any decision related to the reparto according to the pre-established norms'.

**DOJ may wave key review for elected officials' prosecutions**
The Department of Justice (DOJ) is considering a shift in policy that would allow prosecutors to bypass consultation with the Public Integrity Section when pursuing charges against elected officials. This move would cut a key review from a team of prosecutors who specialize in bringing cases against public officials. According to a Justice Department official, the potential change is aimed at 'ensuring that equal responsibility is held in the field.' However, this comes at a time when Trump administration members have floated cases against several officials, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Rep. Robert Garcia. The Public Integrity Section has brought several cases against officials, but several have not resulted in conviction. Federal prosecutors have also lost high-profile cases against elected officials, including former Sen. John Edwards and former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell.

**Trump Justice Dept. considers removing key check on lawmaker prosecutions**
The Trump Justice Department is considering a proposal to remove a key check on lawmaker prosecutions, allowing federal prosecutors to indict members of Congress without approval from the Public Integrity Section. This change would alter a long-standing provision in the Justice Department's manual, removing a layer of review intended to ensure cases against public officials are legally sound and not politically motivated. Attorney General Pam Bondi has vowed to remove politics from the Justice Department, but critics argue that this proposal would give presidentially appointed U.S. attorneys more authority in shaping public corruption cases, making prosecutions more political. 'The reason you have the section is exactly what this administration says they want, which is stop politicization,' said Dan Schwager, a former Public Integrity Section attorney. 'That requires a respect and ability to understand how the laws have been applied in similar situations in the past.' The Public Integrity Section has been under fire since the early days of the Trump administration, with most leaders resigning in February after a standoff with the Trump administration over corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams.

**WaPo: DOJ Plans to Remove Lawfare Safeguards**
The Department of Justice (DOJ) is planning to remove safeguards that prevent politically motivated prosecutions, according to unnamed sources. The proposal would allow federal prosecutors to indict members of Congress without approval from the Public Integrity Section (PIN), which is responsible for ensuring that investigations of elected officials are conducted fairly. The move has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that it would give appointed U.S. attorneys too much power and undermine the integrity of the justice system. As one former Public Integrity Section attorney noted, 'The reason you have the section is exactly what this administration says they want, which is stop politicization.' The proposal comes after the Trump administration has accused the Biden administration of weaponizing the DOJ against Trump with politically motivated prosecutions. 'The only way to ensure that public officials on both sides of the aisle are treated similarly is to have as much institutional knowledge and experience as possible,' said Dan Schwager, a former Public Integrity Section attorney.

**Trump DOJ Considers Making it Easier to Indict Members of Congress**
The Trump Justice Department is considering a move that could reduce the power of the Public Integrity Section (PIN), which oversees indictments of members of Congress. If the proposed changes go through, U.S. attorneys would no longer need to consult PIN at key points during investigations and prosecutions of public officials. This could potentially lead to politically motivated prosecutions. The PIN was established after the Watergate scandal to ensure that the Department of Justice fairly investigates corruption by government officials. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse has raised concerns about the proposed change, saying it would signal that the Trump Department of Justice does not intend to protect the American people against corruption. 'This is part of a shift in limiting the power of law enforcement experts in public corruption,' said Georgetown Law professor and former PIN attorney Paul Butler.

The Department of Justice under Attorney General Pam Bondi is considering a plan to allow federal prosecutors to investigate and indict members of Congress without traditional oversight, potentially leading to political persecution. According to the Washington Post, the proposal would eliminate the review process by the Public Integrity Section, allowing prosecutions based on politics rather than evidence. Former Public Integrity Section attorney Dan Schwager warned that this could lead to U.S. attorneys pursuing perceived enemies of the president who appointed them, undermining the purpose of the Public Integrity Section. Schwager stated, 'The reason you have the section is exactly what this administration says they want, which is stop politicization...

**Trump administration eyes cuts to Justice Department public corruption unit, people familiar say**
The Trump administration is considering cutting most of the lawyers in the U.S. Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, which handles public corruption cases. According to four people familiar with the matter, Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Galeotti told employees that the majority of the attorneys would be offered transfers or face layoffs. Approximately 20 attorneys would be reassigned to handle cases involving drugs, violent crime, or immigration, leaving a handful behind. The changes would also shift control over public corruption and election-related cases from the Washington-based unit to U.S. attorneys' offices across the country. The Public Integrity Section would no longer be responsible for prosecuting cases, but instead play a consulting role. This move comes after five attorneys from the section and a senior career Criminal Division attorney resigned last month over demands to dismiss a case against New York Mayor Eric Adams. 'No final decisions have been made,' said a Justice Department spokesperson, adding that leadership is still looking at resources broadly across the department.
