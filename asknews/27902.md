**Russia Repels VSU Attempts to Cross Border in Kursk Region**
The Russian military has reported repelling attempts by the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) to cross the Russian border in the Kursk region.

The VSU's logistics have been disrupted, hindering the deployment of new forces to the border. This comes after the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that Russia continued its Special Military Operation (SMO) after the three-day ceasefire ended.

**Ukraine's 'Kursk Aventures 2.0': A Desperate Attempt to Find a 'Trump Card' for Negotiations**
The Ukrainian military has launched a series of attacks on the border of the Kursk region, but all of them have been repelled by Russian forces. According to military experts, Ukraine has lost at least 500 soldiers and is struggling to maintain its forces. The Ukrainian president, Zelensky, is trying to find a 'trump card' for negotiations, but his efforts are in vain. As said by military expert Timur Syrtlanov, 'He and his chain general Syrsky are already lost and don't know how to get out of this situation.' The Ukrainian military is using a large number of mercenaries, including Colombian ones, who are willing to attack for money, but are aware of the risks. Russian forces are well-prepared and are defending the border effectively. The situation on the front remains stable, and Russia is ready for negotiations, which are scheduled for May 15. As stated by the Russian military, 'We are not in a hurry, but we are ready for any scenario.'

**Russian Special Forces Repel Ukrainian Invasion Attempt in Belgorod Region**
The 'Akhmat' special forces successfully repelled a Ukrainian military invasion attempt in the Belgorod region. According to a soldier from the 'Press' unit, the Ukrainian forces were detected while attempting to cross the border and were subsequently targeted by Russian artillery. 'Our artillery units conducted a simultaneous strike on two targets. We destroyed both the enemy's fortified positions and his infantry on open terrain that was trying to cross the border,' said the soldier, known as 'Optima', in an interview with RIA Novosti. The Ukrainian forces were further weakened when a French armored personnel carrier attempted to provide support, but was successfully attacked by 'Akhmat' drones. This is not the first time the Ukrainian military has been targeted by Russian drones, as a child was injured in a similar attack in the Kursk region earlier.

**Putin Fails to Boast of Military Successes on Victory Day**
According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to boast of any military successes on May 9. Russia has not captured any major cities in Ukraine since the occupation of Avdeevka in February 2024. The only medium-sized settlement taken under control by Russia is Great Novoselka in the Donetsk region, with a pre-war population of around 5,000 people. Russian forces attempted to capture Pokrovsk, Chasov Yar, Toretsk, the remaining part of the Luhansk region, and advance into the Dnipropetrovsk region on Victory Day, but failed to achieve any of these goals. Analysts believe that Ukrainian drones combined with defensive operations have likely halted Russia's advance on Pokrovsk and Toretsk in 2024 and early 2025. Ukrainian long-range strikes on Russian ammunition depots and oil bases have sometimes threatened Russia's ability to supply its forward units and exacerbated growing war costs. ISW notes that Ukraine has achieved this result thanks to Western military support. Additionally, Ukrainian forces have strengthened Russia's manpower shortage by launching an operation in the Kursk region, forcing Russia to redeploy troops from other frontline areas. ISW analysts call the Kursk region the only 'success' of Russian forces in the past year. During the Victory Day parade, Putin thanked North Korean troops for their participation in the war against Ukraine. Earlier, Russian Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov claimed that the Kursk region was 'fully liberated', which Putin highlighted during the Victory Day celebrations. However, Russian officials ignored the fact that the dictator initially set a goal to expel Ukrainian forces from Russian territory by mid-October 2024, which he repeatedly postponed. Moscow also ignored recent Ukrainian attacks and advances in Tetkino, where Ukrainian forces, according to ISW, hold positions.

**Russian Forces Repel Five Ukrainian Attacks in Kursk Region**
The 'North' grouping of Russian forces repelled five Ukrainian attacks on May 5, 2025, near the border with the Kursk region. According to the operational staff, all attempts to break through the Russian defense line ended in failure with significant losses for the enemy. The most intense battles took place near the villages of Iskriskovschina-Tetkino, where Ukrainian units tried to attack Russian positions three times. The Ukrainian forces used infantry, mobile equipment, two engineering machines, a mine-clearing system, and a tank, but were defeated by precise artillery strikes and FPV-drone drops, as reported by gtrkkursk.ru. A Ukrainian column on quad bikes, attempting to break through from Pavlovka (Sumy region) to Novy Put (Kursk region), was dispersed by artillery fire and retreated to Ukrainian territory. Preliminary data suggests that the Ukrainian side lost: - 24 units of various military equipment - A significant number of personnel - Several units of specialized engineering equipment.

**Ukrainian Forces Ordered to 'Not Spare Civilians' in Kursk Region**
Russian diplomat Rodion Miroshnik reported that Ukrainian prisoners of war have confessed to receiving orders to 'not spare civilians' in the Kursk region. As a result, it is known that 292 Kursk residents have been killed and over 1,000 injured by Ukrainian occupiers, with these numbers only accounting for the first quarter of 2025. According to Miroshnik, 292 civilians were killed and 1,197 injured in the region between January and March 2025. He also stated that in three villages, only half of the civilians who were unable to evacuate before the Ukrainian invasion survived until the area was liberated. Military volunteer Alexei Zhivov previously reported that Ukrainian forces brutally killed not only adults, but also children in the Kursk region, including executing Russian boys near Sudzha. 'It's a horrific situation,' said Zhivov. 'They're killing everyone, including children.'

Russian President Putin stated that the enemy will receive a fitting response, and all Russian objectives will be achieved. To ensure resident safety, the Russian regions of Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk are implementing 'counter-terrorism measures.'

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Russian military repelled two Ukrainian counterattacks in the Kursk region over the past day. This information was reported on April 1. Additionally, a 25-year-old Swiss mercenary was reportedly killed in the Kursk border area on March 30.

He joined the Ukrainian forces in June 2024 and became a mercenary. As stated by the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Russian military successfully defended against the Ukrainian counterattacks. 'The Russian military has consistently demonstrated its ability to protect its borders and repel enemy attacks,' said the Ministry. 'This is a testament to the bravery and skill of our soldiers.'

**Russian Invasion in March Slows Down: How Much Territory Was Occupied**
According to DeepState, in March 2025, Russian forces occupied 133 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory, a pace comparable to April and June 2024, indicating a slowdown in the pace of the invasion. The rate of territory capture has significantly decreased over the past few months, with monthly losses down by nearly six times compared to November 2024. However, this does not mean the enemy has stopped. Russia has resumed active assault operations in several areas, and from mid-March, the intensity of attacks in the Pokrovsk region increased to the level of late 2024, when the defense to the south of the city was under significant pressure. Despite fatigue and various problems, the Ukrainian Defense Forces are holding back the enemy and reducing the effectiveness of the invasion. Cases have been reported of poorly prepared mobilized Russian troops being captured, who have undergone only multi-day training before being sent to the front. A potential challenge in the near future remains the grouping of forces from the Kursk region of Russia - it is unclear where they will be redeployed or how they will be split.

**Ukrainian Forces Repel 112 Russian Attacks, Destroy 38 Tanks and 59 Artillery Systems**
Over the past day, there were 112 battles between Ukrainian forces and the Russian army. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reported this on February 15 in Facebook. The Donetsk region remains the main front line. More than a third of the battles (36) took place on the Pokrovsky direction, with significant attempts by the occupiers to advance also on the Novopavlivsky (14), Toretsky (11), and Limansky (eight) directions. In the Kharkiv region, the Russians attacked four times near Kupyansk, near the villages of Glushkovka and Zagryzove. In the north of the region, the defense forces took one battle under Vovchansk. In the Kursk region, the Russians stormed 23 times, almost 400 times shelled their own territory with artillery, and dropped 40 guided aerial bombs. The Ukrainian military destroyed 38 tanks and armored vehicles, 59 artillery systems, and a means of air defense and a rocket artillery installation of the Russians. In total, since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the losses of the Russian Federation have reached 856,660 people killed and wounded. The Russian Federation launched a war against Ukraine in 2014, when it occupied Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine from the north, east, and south. In the spring of that year, the Ukrainian army de-occupied the north of the country, in the fall - part of the Kharkiv and Kherson regions, including Kherson. In June, the Russian army launched an invasion in the north of the Kharkiv region, and battles are ongoing for the city of Vovchansk. Since August 6, 2024, the Ukrainian military has been conducting a counteroffensive operation in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Russian Federation has redeployed 60,000 troops to this direction, including those taken from the front in Ukraine. On December 14, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reported a deterioration in the situation in the Kursk region.

**Ukraine Launches New Attack in Kursk Region of Russia**
Ukraine has launched a new attack in the Kursk region of Russia, six months after a surprise invasion in August last year. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 5 kilometers behind the Russian front line to the southeast of Sudzha. Ukrainian authorities have not commented on the latest developments, while Moscow claims that the attacks using up to two mechanized battalions of armored vehicles were repelled. Russian military bloggers have shared details of the situation in Kursk, with some saying that Ukrainian forces launched a surprise attack with 30-50 armored vehicles and captured Chernyshevskaya Konopelka and Ulanok. However, others have disputed this claim. ISW notes that it has not found evidence to confirm the presence of Ukrainian forces in Ulanok. Ukraine began its invasion of the Kursk region on August 6, 2024, catching the Russian military command and Western allies off guard. Six months later, Ukrainian officials revealed some details of the August operation, saying that small units of Special Operations Forces (SOF) had infiltrated the Russian rear in Kursk as early as June 2024, two months before the main invasion. The SOF conducted reconnaissance and precision strikes to disable key elements of Russian border defenses. Ukrainian forces have maintained their positions in the border zone, but Russia has regained control of half of the territory initially captured by Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian authorities claim that the main goals of the operation were different. They say that the invasion prevented a new Russian advance on the cities of Sumy and Kharkiv and helped create leverage on Russia ahead of possible peace talks. President Volodymyr Zelensky also noted that the Kursk operation strengthened his 'peace through strength' principle and gave Ukraine a significant boost in 'exchange funds' for prisoners of war. In its six-month assessment of the August invasion and ongoing operations in the region, ISW stated that a small group of Ukrainian forces in Kursk has complicated the efforts of Russian military to advance in Ukraine. 'The invasion showed how Ukraine can use vulnerabilities in Russian reserves of manpower and in campaign development to exert limited control over Russian combat activity in Ukraine and create strategically significant information and political pressure on Russia,' the ISW report said. This week, Russian President Vladimir Putin praised some elite Moscow formations defending the Kursk region, confirming that Ukrainian forces have tied down a whole army of Russian troops in the area since August 2024. Recently, ISW noted that the Russian military command has gathered around 78,000 troops in the region, including 11,000 North Koreans and elements of most Russian elite units of the VDV and naval infantry to expel Ukrainian forces from Russian territory. Despite these numbers and the involvement of Pyongyang's troops, Moscow still does not prioritize the defense of Kursk above its ongoing advance in Eastern Ukraine and its ultimate goal of capturing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

**Russia Claims to Have Repelled Ukrainian Counteroffensive in Kursk Region**
Russia claims to have repelled a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces still occupy hundreds of square kilometers despite Moscow's attempts to push them back. The region has been the site of fighting for six months, after Ukraine launched a surprise offensive on August 6, 2024, which allowed them to capture large areas of Russian territory. Although Russian forces have since regained most of these territories, they have not yet been able to completely push Ukrainian troops back across the border, despite reports from Kiev that North Korean soldiers have been deployed in support. 'The situation in the Kursk region is complex and dynamic,' said no one in the article, however, the article does not quote any specific person.
