**Dollar Weakens as US Economy Shows Signs of Weakening**
The US dollar lost strength against major global currencies on Thursday, May 29, pressured by data showing a weakening of the US economy. The dollar reversed its gains from the previous night, as the enthusiasm generated by the court decision against President Donald Trump's tariff policy faded throughout the day. By the end of the day, an appeals court accepted the executive's appeal, freezing the effects of yesterday's measure while the Supreme Court analyzes the arguments of the parties. The DXY index, which measures the dollar's performance against a basket of six strong currencies, fell 0.60%, to 99.272 points. At around 16:50 (Brasília time), the dollar fell to 144.12 yen, while the euro advanced to $1.1371 and the pound was traded in high, at $1.3498. The US Department of Commerce showed that the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) had a quarterly annualized decline of 0.2% in the first quarter, an improvement from the initial estimate of a 0.3% decline. However, the economy still contracted in the period, and the revision 'does not justify a change in our forecast for growth this year or monetary policy,' said Oxford Economics. Meanwhile, unemployment claims in the country rose above analysts' expectations. The core of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) was also revised downward. According to Derek Halpenny, analyst at MUFG Bank, the dollar may benefit from a potential trade agreement between the US and the European Union. Regardless of how comprehensive the agreement is, it will help to alleviate concerns about 'harmful economic policies' from Washington and the possible loss of confidence in US assets, Halpenny said. Although a significant recovery of the dollar is unlikely, new bilateral agreements would reduce part of the negativity associated with trade uncertainties, he added.

**USD/JPY falls back to near 145.00 as USD gives up gains**
The USD/JPY pair fell back to near 144.90 after the US Dollar Index (DXY) surrendered early gains and flattened around 99.90. This comes after the US Court of International Trade accused President Donald Trump of overstepping his authority to impose tariffs, citing that longstanding trade deficits do not constitute a sudden emergency. Despite the White House appealing the decision, investors reassessed the consequences, leading to the US Dollar's decline. Meanwhile, Japan's Trade Negotiator and Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa stated that he will visit Washington for the fourth round of trade talks, saying 'We intend to thoroughly examine the content of the ruling and its implications and respond appropriately.'

**Gold rebounds as US Dollar retreats while court strikes down Trump's tariffs**
Gold prices rebounded to near $3,300 on Thursday after the US Dollar retreated following a court ruling that struck down President Trump's tariffs. The US Dollar Index (DXY) surrendered its initial gains and flattened below 100.00. The court's decision, which accused Trump of violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), ordered the administration to lift import duties within ten days. However, the White House has appealed the decision. Gold continues to struggle around the upward-sloping trendline on a daily timeframe around $3,335, with the near-term trend uncertain as it wobbles around the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) oscillates inside the 40.00-60.00 range, suggesting indecisiveness among market participants.

**US Dollar Index rises to near 100.50 after court ruling Trump tariffs, Q1 GDP data eyed**
The US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading above 0.50% higher at 100.30, extending its gains for the third consecutive day. The Greenback is receiving support after a US federal court blocked President Donald Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs from taking effect, deeming the move unconstitutional. Market participants are awaiting the release of Q1 GDP data, which may impact the US economic outlook. Federal Reserve officials emphasized the need to keep interest rates unchanged due to heightened economic uncertainty, as stated in the FOMC Meeting Minutes. Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' is on its way to the Senate floor, expected to increase the fiscal deficit by $3.8 billion and potentially keep bond yields higher for longer.

**Gold (XAUUSD) Consolidates Below Key Resistance as US Dollar Strengthens on Tariff Delay**
Gold (XAUUSD) prices have consolidated below the key resistance of $3,360 after US President Donald Trump delayed 50% tariffs on European Union goods until July 9. The move boosted risk appetite and weakened safe-haven demand for gold. The US Dollar Index (DXY) rebounded to 99.60, supported by a significant increase in consumer confidence, which signaled resilience in the US economy and lowered expectations for immediate Fed easing. As a result, gold prices came under further pressure.

**US Trade Advisor Navarro: You can assume even if we lose tariff cases we'll do it another way**
US Trade Advisor Navarro stated that even if the US loses tariff cases, they will find alternative ways to implement their trade policies. The US Dollar Index (DXY) fell to 99.30 after failing to break above the 100.00 handle. FXStreet notes that markets are on-balance, with most trade-related headlines already priced in. The author emphasizes that investing in open markets involves significant risk, including the loss of all or part of one's investment, and that readers should do their own thorough research before making investment decisions.

**U.S. Dollar Rebounds as Confidence Jumps, Durable Goods Dip: Analysis For EUR/USD, GBP/USD**
The US Dollar Index (DXY) continued to climb during the Asian session, reaching 99.64 after gaining 0.50% in the previous session. The strong US Consumer Confidence data, which rose to 98.0 in May from 86.0 in April, underpinned the move. However, Durable Goods Orders fell 6.3% in April, a smaller decline than expected. Technical analysis shows DXY testing resistance at 100.12 and 100.60, with key support at 99.09 and 98.71.

**US Dollar Index (DXY) advances to weekly top around 99.80; lacks bullish conviction**
The US Dollar Index (DXY) has advanced to a weekly high of 99.80, but lacks bullish conviction. The index's momentum is attributed to upbeat US macro data, including a decline in Durable Goods Orders and a rebound in the US Consumer Confidence Index. However, US fiscal concerns and dovish Federal Reserve expectations may cap further gains. Traders are advised to wait for strong follow-through buying and more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path before placing aggressive USD bullish bets. The focus will remain on the release of FOMC meeting minutes, as well as the Prelim Q1 GDP print and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index.

The Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped to 99.37, a 1.5% decline from the previous week, due to President Trump's tariff threats against the EU and U.S. tech imports. The DXY is now testing the key 99.00 level, with the 50-period moving average near 100.30 acting as strong resistance. Momentum is currently in favor of sellers, but the DXY could reclaim the 100.00 handle to change the trend. Meanwhile, the GBP/USD has hit 1.3487 due to a 5% surge in retail sales, with the pound eyeing the 1.3560 resistance level from 2022.

**DXY: Here's the reason why the dollar index crash may continue**
The DXY index, which tracks the US dollar against a basket of currencies, has been falling this week and technical indicators suggest it will continue to decline to 90 dollars. The index has dropped to a low of 99.40 dollars, a decrease of nearly 10% from its year-high. The decline in the index began after Donald Trump's inauguration and his decision to impose tariffs on allied countries such as Canada and Mexico. The downward trend intensified on the day of his announcement of the so-called reciprocal tariffs on all countries. However, the decline began to reverse itself late last month after he confirmed that he would not fire Jerome Powell, which some analysts had expected. Recently, the dollar has fallen as the US financial situation has deteriorated. On Friday, the US lost its last Triple-A credit rating when Moody's downgraded it to AA1. Moody's joined S&P Global, which downgraded its rating in 2011, and Fitch, which downgraded it in 2023. Unfortunately, despite the warning, the House of Representatives and the Senate passed a spending bill that will increase the deficit by over 3.8 trillion dollars over the next decade. The so-called Big Beautiful Bill will extend tax cuts from 2017 and introduce new ones, including exempting overtime pay and tips from taxation. The bill will also remove millions of people from government programs such as Medicare. Therefore, the US dollar fell as investors continued to be concerned about the financial situation and future demand for the currency. Economic data has minimal impact on the DXY index nowadays as the Federal Reserve has already said that they will not lower interest rates in the near future. Officials such as Susan Collins and Raphael Bostic, who spoke this week, insisted that the bank would have patience before lowering interest rates. The next important data to watch will be the Conference Board's consumer confidence report on Tuesday, which recently showed that confidence fell as consumers worried about the labor market and inflation. There are signs that the confidence report will show a slight easing when Trump begins trade talks. Other important data will be released on Thursday when the US publishes its second GDP estimate. Historically, this estimate has rarely affected the dollar. The most important report will be on Friday when the US publishes its personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data for April. Technical analysis of the DXY index shows that it has had a strong downward trend in recent months, moving from a high of 110.16 dollars in January to its current level of 99.35 dollars. The index has formed a death cross pattern, a popular bearish signal. It has also formed an inverse cup-and-handle pattern, a popular bearish signal. By measuring the depth of the cup, we see that it has around 9.18%, which means that the index is likely to fall to 90 dollars in the coming months.

**Why the US Dollar Index May Continue to Fall**
The DXY index, which tracks the US dollar against a basket of currencies, has been falling sharply this year as concerns about the US economy have grown. The index has dropped nearly 10% from its high this year, reaching a low of $99.40. According to technical analysis, the index is likely to continue falling to $90. The decline began after Donald Trump's presidency and his decision to impose tariffs on allied countries. The situation worsened on the Day of Liberation, when he announced reciprocal tariffs for all countries. However, the dollar began to recover at the end of last month after he confirmed that he would not fire Jerome Powell, as some analysts had expected. Recently, the dollar has fallen sharply due to the worsening fiscal situation in the US. On Friday, the US lost its last AAA credit rating when Moody's downgraded it to AA1. Moody's joined S&P Global, which downgraded its rating in 2011, and Fitch, which downgraded it in 2023. Unfortunately, despite the warning, the House of Representatives approved a spending bill that will add over $3.8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. The 'Big Beautiful Bill' will extend the 2017 tax cuts and introduce new ones, including an exemption from taxes on overtime and tips. Additionally, the law will remove millions of people from government programs such as Medicare. Therefore, the US dollar index has fallen because investors have remained concerned about the fiscal situation and future demand for the currency. Consumer confidence, GDP, and PCE data have had a minimal impact on the DXY index currently because the Federal Reserve has stated that it will not reduce interest rates soon. Key data to be watched will be released on Tuesday, when the Conference Board will publish its consumer confidence report. Recent data has shown that confidence has fallen sharply, with consumers concerned about the job market and inflation. There are indications that the report will show some moderation, with the start of trade negotiations by Trump. Other important data will be released on Thursday, when the US will publish its second estimate of GDP. Historically, this estimate has rarely impacted the dollar. The most important report will be released on Friday, when the US will publish its PCE data for April. Technical analysis of the DXY index shows that it has been presenting a strong downward trend in recent months. It has passed from a maximum of $110.16 in January to the current $99.35. The index has formed a death cross, a popular signal of a downward trend. It has also formed an inverted cup with handle, a popular signal of a downward trend. Measuring the depth of the cup, we see that it has about 9.18%, which means that the index is likely to fall to $90 in the next few months.

**Why the US Dollar Index could continue to fall**
The US Dollar Index (DXY) has fallen this week and technical analysis suggests it will continue to decline to $90. The DXY Index plummeted to a low of $99.40, a nearly 10% drop from its high this year. The decline began after Donald Trump's inauguration and his decision to impose tariffs on friendly countries like Canada and Mexico. The downward trend intensified on 'Tax Freedom Day' when Trump announced tariffs on all countries. However, the dollar recovered at the end of last month after Trump confirmed he would not fire Jerome Powell, as some analysts had expected. Recently, the dollar has fallen due to the deteriorating fiscal situation in the US. On Friday, the US lost its last AAA rating as Moody's downgraded it to AA1. Moody's joined S&P Global, which downgraded the rating in 2011, and Fitch, which downgraded it in 2023. Despite warnings, the House of Representatives passed a budget bill that will cause a deficit of over $3.8 billion in the next 10 years. The 'big beautiful bill' will extend and introduce new tax cuts, including the exemption of overtime and gratuity taxes. Additionally, the bill will exclude millions of people from government programs like Medicare. Therefore, the US Dollar Index fell as investors continued to have concerns about the fiscal situation and future demand for the currency. Consumer confidence, GDP, and PCE data have minimal impact on the DXY Index as the Federal Reserve has stated it will not lower interest rates in the near future. Officials like Susan Collins and Raphael Bostic, who spoke this week, emphasized that the bank will remain patient before lowering interest rates. The next important data to watch will be the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Report on Tuesday, which will show whether consumer confidence has improved.

The most important report will be released on Friday, when the US will publish the PCE data for April. Technical analysis of the DXY Index shows a strong downward trend in the last months, moving from a high of $110.16 in January to the current level of $99.35. The Index formed a death cross pattern, a known bearish signal. Additionally, an inverse Cup-and-Handle pattern has formed, a known bearish signal. Measuring the depth of the Cup, it suggests that the Index will likely fall to $90 in the coming months.

**US Dollar dips after mixed US data fails to lift sentiment**
The US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading around 101.00 after mixed US economic data releases failed to lift sentiment. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the need to revisit the Fed's strategic language around inflation and employment, but the market reaction was muted. The DXY is showing indecisiveness, with price action confined within a tight band between 100.59 and 101.05. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicate mild buy momentum, but the broader outlook remains bearish. Immediate support lies at 100.62, 100.59, and 100.56, while resistance is seen at 100.92, 101.34, and 101.81. A clear breakout above 101.90 or a drop below 100.22 could define the next directional move.

**US Dollar Forecast: Markets will look at US data and Fedspeak**
The US Dollar Index (DXY) has extended its decline to three-year lows due to recession and trade war fears. Investors now expect the Fed to trim interest rates three times in 2025. The recent White House tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing's retaliatory measures have increased concerns of a global trade war. The Greenback's dramatic decline has been mirrored by a rebound in US Treasury yields. Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that the economic fallout from President Trump's new tariffs could be substantial, with higher inflation and slower growth. Several Federal Reserve officials have expressed concerns about the impact of escalating US trade tensions and new tariff policies on inflation, economic growth, and financial markets. Market participants are set to focus on key Retail Sales figures and other hard data releases in the upcoming week. The DXY remains under significant pressure, trading below its 200-day Simple Moving Average of 104.77.

**US Dollar Index recovers after Friday's technical rejection**
The US Dollar Index (DXY) has recovered from initial losses and is trading near 103.00 after a technical rejection on Friday. The DXY, which tracks the performance of the US Dollar against six major currencies, saw a decline due to Equities, Yields, and precious metals dropping lower. The decline comes after US President Donald Trump stated that he will stick to his tariffs plan, and financial backer Bill Ackman warned that Trump is losing business leaders' confidence. The upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release on Thursday will be closely watched, as it may show the impact of Trump's policies on inflation. The DXY's recovery was unable to cross the 103.18 pivotal level, which is being heavily defended by US Dollar bears. Key levels to watch include 103.18, 104.00, and the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 104.87.

**US Dollar edges lower as traders await clarity on tariffs**
The US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading below 104.00 due to caution ahead of the White House's tariff announcement. Despite strong ADP Employment Change data, the Greenback remains under pressure. Technical signals are mixed, but most moving averages suggest a bearish bias. Immediate resistance lies near 104.022 and 104.105, while downside support is seen around 104.169, 104.128, and the key 103.90 area. A sustained drop below 103.90 may unlock further losses toward 103.00.

**Dollar Index Falls to 4-Month Low, 'Trump Euphoria' Comes to an End**
The US dollar has been falling in the foreign exchange market. The Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the overall strength of the dollar, fell to 104.5 on March 5, its lowest level since November 2024. This is due to the rapid increase in the momentum for a euro revaluation, which accounts for more than half of the currency basket. As a result, the dollar's rise after Donald Trump's victory in the 2022 US presidential election has been largely erased.

**US Dollar Index (DXY) hits over two-month low around 106.20, seems vulnerable below 100-day SMA**
The US Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped to its lowest level since December 10, currently trading around 106.25. The decline is attributed to disappointing US Retail Sales figures, a weak sales forecast from Walmart, and concerns about US consumer health. The S&P Global's flash US Composite PMI dropped to 50.4 in February, and the University of Michigan reported a 15-month low level of 64.7 in its US Consumer Sentiment Index. Federal Reserve officials remain wary of future interest rate cuts amid sticky inflation and uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's protectionist policies, which might hold back the USD bears from placing fresh bearish bets. Investors may opt to move to the sidelines ahead of the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index on Friday.
