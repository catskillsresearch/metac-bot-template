**New Independent Review Paper Strengthens Therapeutic Rationale for Artelo's FABP Inhibitor Program in Anxiety and Depression | Taiwan News | Jun. 2, 2025 21:00**
Artelo Biosciences, a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, has welcomed the publication of a comprehensive review in Neurobiology of Disease that underscores the therapeutic potential of Fatty Acid Binding Protein (FABP) inhibitors in treating mood and anxiety disorders. The review, co-authored by Doctor Steven Laviolette, details extensive preclinical evidence supporting FABP5, FABP3, and FABP7 as key regulators of lipid trafficking, neuroinflammatory signaling, and endocannabinoid tone. Gregory D. Gorgas, Chief Executive Officer at Artelo Biosciences, said, 'We believe this paper provides compelling evidence that inhibition of FABP5 can significantly elevate anandamide levels, modulate stress-related neurocircuits, and produce robust anxiety-reducing and antidepressant effects without the cognitive side effects typically seen with current standard of care.' Artelo's proprietary FABP inhibitor platform, including its clinical-stage candidate ART26.12, selectively targets FABP5 and are designed to elevate endogenous anandamide and related lipid signaling molecules.

**Acid test: Why we used Lotto lady as guinea pig in psychedelic therapy trial**
New Zealand has undergone a shift in its perception of psychedelic drugs, from prohibition to research and potential therapeutic use. A documentary, Mind Menders, explores this change, featuring interviews with participants in LSD and psilocybin trials, including Sonia Gray, a Lotto lady who underwent LSD microdosing for depression. The documentary also examines the use of ketamine as a treatment for depression and the potential of psychedelics to help ease anxiety in people nearing the end of their lives. Dr Suresh Muthukumaraswamy, a leading figure in psychedelic research in New Zealand, notes that modern brain imaging techniques have shown that psychedelics do not cause brain damage, but rather stimulate the growth of new neural connections. A 2023 University of Otago study ranked classic psychedelics as having low harm, and a 2025 study highlighted the importance of intent in determining the outcome of psychedelic use. The Ministry of Health has approved an application to administer psilocybin outside of a trial, marking a significant step towards the potential therapeutic use of psychedelics.

**I Tried Magic Mushrooms for My Mental Health. Here's What Happened.**
Teresa Anne Volgenau, a 50-year-old ballet teacher, actress, and artist, was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer and underwent extensive treatments. She was recruited for a clinical study on psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, to see if it could offer relief from anxiety and existential distress. Volgenau took a 25-milligram dose of synthetic psilocybin and experienced a profound mental transformation, including feelings of euphoria, nausea, and emotional release. The study, led by Jim Grigsby, a CU Denver neuroscience and neuropsychology professor, aims to explore the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for cancer patients. Colorado has become a hub for psychedelic research and innovation, with the state decriminalizing psilocybin and creating a pathway for approved healing centers to offer supervised trips. Elizabeth Cooke, owner of the Center Origin, has obtained a license to offer psilocybin therapy and plans to offer sessions for $3,500, with discounts for veterans and those in need. However, the lack of licensed suppliers and testers is a major obstacle for the industry.

**Maine Committee Advances Bill to Decriminalize Personal Possession of Psilocybin**
The Maine House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee has voted to advance House Bill 1034, which would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of psilocybin for adults 21 and older. The bill, introduced by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, removes criminal penalties for possessing up to one gram of psilocybin or one ounce of psilocybin-containing mushrooms. Supporters of the bill point to research suggesting psilocybin may have mental health benefits, particularly in treating depression and PTSD. This move reflects a national trend of easing restrictions on psychedelics, with Oregon and Colorado already implementing broader psilocybin reform and several cities adopting decriminalization policies.

**New Mexico prepares to enter modern medical psychedelic movement**
New Mexico is preparing to launch a medical psilocybin program by late 2027, following the path of Oregon and Colorado. The program will allow patients to receive psilocybin-assisted therapy for conditions such as major treatment-resistant depression, PTSD, substance use disorder, and end-of-life care. Crystal Romero, a mother of three who has struggled with PTSD and depression, believes that psilocybin can do tremendous good for people in New Mexico. She said, 'Working with psilocybin has really allowed me to sit with my grief... Depression doesn't have to consume your life.' The program will be tightly regulated, with patients receiving psilocybin treatment in an approved clinical setting, and will be overseen by the New Mexico Department of Health. The program has received bipartisan support and is expected to be fully launched by December 31, 2027.

**UC San Francisco's psilocybin therapy shows promise for Parkinson's patients**
A clinical study at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) has shown promise for psilocybin therapy in treating Parkinson's disease. The study, which involved 12 patients, found that the treatment improved motor and cognitive functions, and reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. Dr. Ellen Bradley, a researcher at UCSF, said, 'This is a first step, and now we've opened the door to being able to really investigate the effects of Psilocybin for people with Parkinson's.' The study's results were promising, with no serious adverse effects reported. Jeff Deming, a participant in the study, credited the treatment with giving him his life back and allowing him to do the things that make him happy. He said, 'Something about this experience just freed everything back up so I could think again, I could dream again.' The researchers are now scaling up their work and recruiting for a larger study due to the success of the initial research.

**New Study: 'Magic Mushrooms' Compound Reduces Parkinson's Symptoms**
A new study conducted by the University of California in San Francisco has shown promising results for the use of psilocybin, the active compound in 'magic mushrooms', in reducing the psychological and motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease. The study involved 12 patients aged 40-75 with mild to moderate Parkinson's symptoms, as well as depression and/or anxiety, who received two doses of psilocybin under the supervision of a specialist. The participants showed significant improvement in mood, cognition, and motor function, which lasted for at least three months. Dr. Elin Bradley, the assistant director of the university's program for research on psychedelic substances, noted that the improvement in mood is a stronger indicator of the quality of life for Parkinson's patients than motor improvement alone. She also emphasized that this type of treatment may represent an effective alternative to traditional antidepressants, which often do not provide satisfactory results for this group of patients. Dr. Amir Inamdar, a British pharmacist and chief medical officer of a pharmaceutical company, commented that the improvement in motor symptoms was unexpected and likely due to the multiple effects of psilocybin on serotonin and dopamine receptors in the brain. Despite the promising results, the researchers warned against using psilocybin outside of medical supervision and emphasized that the study is still in its early stages and needs further, more controlled trials, particularly since it did not include a control group. Bradley noted that her team has already begun a larger study to measure the efficacy of psilocybin more accurately, as well as collect biological data to understand its mechanism of action comprehensively, and considered that this research not only contributes to improving Parkinson's treatment but also paves the way for the development of a new generation of targeted psychiatric medications. It is worth noting that psilocybin is a controlled substance and, despite its potential benefits, it is not yet officially approved as a treatment for Parkinson's disease, requiring further research and regulation before its widespread use in clinical practice.

**Missouri House Committee Unanimously Approves Bill To Create Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Research Pilot Program**
The Missouri House Rules Committee has unanimously approved a bill to create a psychedelic-assisted therapy research pilot program for military veterans. The bill, led by Rep. Richard West (R), would allow veterans with certain medical conditions to access laboratory-tested psilocybin. To participate, veterans must be at least 21, enrolled in a clinical trial, and have PTSD, major depressive disorder, a substance use disorder, or be in end-of-life care. The program would be limited to 150 mg of psilocybin per 12-month period, and the state Department of Health would provide up to $2 million in grants for research. Eapen Thampy, a lobbyist for American Shaman, said, 'It seems that there’s a widespread acceptance that these therapies need to be deployed.' The bill now heads to the floor for further consideration.

**Psilocybin: How Science Is Turning Magic Mushrooms Into Medicine**
Psilocybin, a substance found in magic mushrooms, has shown promise as a treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions. A 2016 study led by researchers from Imperial College London and King's College London demonstrated the drug's ability to produce rapid, lasting improvements in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, to gain regulatory approval, industry trials are needed, which are typically expensive and require sponsorship from big pharmaceutical companies. Compass Pathways is currently conducting a series of clinical trials using synthetic psilocybin, with two Phase III trials underway and expected to be completed in 2026. These studies aim to confirm the efficacy of psilocybin in treating depression and other mental health conditions, and to understand its mechanisms of action. Research has shown that psilocybin increases global functional connectivity in the brain, amplifies emotional responses to negative stimuli, and may help patients engage with their feelings rather than avoid them. These findings suggest that psilocybin may be a genuine alternative to conventional antidepressants, and that it may be worth exploring as a treatment for other mental health conditions, such as eating disorders, OCD, and PTSD. However, incorporating psychedelic trips into mainstream medical practice will be a massive challenge, requiring the right expertise and infrastructure.

**Optimism About Psychedelics and Psychiatry**
Psychedelics, once viewed with suspicion, are now being researched as potential treatments for psychiatric disorders. Studies have shown promise for psilocybin in treating treatment-resistant depression and MDMA in treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A recent study found that survivors of a terrorist attack who took MDMA before the attack suffered fewer symptoms of PTSD than those who took other substances. Researchers are still learning about the effects and safety of these substances, but there is optimism that they will soon have the answers they need to approve them as treatments. The FDA is demanding more rigorous studies before granting approval, and studies are currently underway. As one researcher notes, 'These are a new set of compounds still in the early phases of being studied. Their advantages are that they begin acting very quickly after being administered, and they act over a short period of time. These characteristics make them much more practical for clinical use.'

**Missouri lawmakers explore psychedelic therapy for veterans suffering from PTSD**
Missouri lawmakers are pushing legislation to study the use of psilocybin, also known as 'magic mushrooms', to treat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, substance use disorders, or end-of-life care. Similar legislation has been filed for the past three years, but this time, several members of the House Veterans Committee who were initially against the proposal have changed their minds after researching the topic. The bill's sponsor, Republican state Rep. Richard West, said he 100% believes in the effectiveness of this treatment, citing studies done by psychiatry researchers at Washington University School of Medicine. The study would be conducted in collaboration with a Missouri university hospital or medical center operated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and would focus on veterans suffering from PTSD, depression, substance use disorders, or end-of-life care. The suicide rate among veterans in Missouri is nearly double the state rate and one of the highest in the country. As state Rep. Michael Johnson said, 'I wish this was available then or we knew more about it then, because I’ve seen the ill effects that the war has caused on a lot of my fellow comrades.'

**Biotech company testing psilocybin pill requests preemptive change in Kansas law**
Compass Pathways, a biotech company, is seeking to modify Kansas' controlled substances act to allow for the use of their synthetic psilocybin drug, COMP 360, for treating treatment-resistant depression. The company's representative, Tess Bettler, stated, 'This bill does not decriminalize or legalize psilocybin or any other psychedelic substance, nor does this bill allow access to drugs that have not been FDA-approved.' The bill would exempt any FDA-approved form of psilocybin from the state's controlled substances act. International research has shown psilocybin to be an effective treatment for various mental health conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, treatment-resistant depression, and end-of-life anxiety. The FDA has not yet approved the drug, and it is not guaranteed that they will. However, if approved, the bill would allow Compass Pathways to bring the drug to Kansas doctors' offices. Regulations and restrictions for psilocybin treatment have taken shape in Oregon and Colorado, leading to the establishment of psilocybin manufacturing facilities and treatment centers.

**Medical Psilocybin bill shown unanimous support**
New Mexico's Senate Bill 219, which aims to fully legalize supervised medical psilocybin, has passed through a Senate committee with unanimous bipartisan support. The bill would establish a medical psilocybin program to treat depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and end-of-life anxiety, with a $4 million annual allotment to cover administrative costs, salaries, an equity fund, and research. According to Sen. Jeff Steinborn, the program would not result in psilocybin dispensaries and would be strictly under medical supervision. Sen. Craig Brandt said the treatment has been proven effective and Sen. Steinborn is optimistic that the bill will pass into law this session. If signed, it would go into effect June 20, but patients would not begin dosing until December 31, 2027, after a multiyear process of setting up the program.

**Vancouver Islanders invited to join Nanaimo psilocybin therapy trial**
A trial for psilocybin therapy to treat depression is being conducted in Nanaimo, with the goal of making B.C. a leader in access to advanced mental health treatments. The study, which aims to help patients with treatment-resistant depression, will involve 568 participants across several countries. Adam Watson, clinical operations lead at the Medical Arts Health Research Group, said, 'The end goal is ultimately to see if psilocybin coupled with psychological support can ultimately help patients who have depression that have failed conventional therapies, to see if they can experience a greater sense of relief from depressive symptoms.' The trial is expected to take several years, with data to be submitted to Health Canada for wider approval. The group is looking for 40 patients from across B.C., including 10 from Vancouver Island, to participate in the study, which also aims to explore the potential of psilocybin in treating PTSD, complex grief, and addictions.
