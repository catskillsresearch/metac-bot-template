**Israeli Offensive in Gaza Continues to Intensify, Killing Dozens, Including Children**
The Israeli offensive in Gaza continues to intensify, with new airstrikes and ground operations. Despite international calls for a ceasefire and stalled indirect peace talks between Israel and Hamas, the Israeli military's grip on the Gaza Strip is tightening. The latest bombing in Jabalia, north of Gaza, has killed at least 14 people, including 6 children and 3 women, with many more injured and trapped under the rubble. Many of the victims were members of the same family. 'The building had been bombed before and there were other martyrs,' said Musa al-Bursh, who survived the attack. The increased intensity of the offensive seems to have begun after Defense Minister Israel Katz's statement, 'Continue to advance in Gaza towards all objectives, regardless of any negotiations.' The Israeli military has confirmed that troops have expanded their ground operations, eliminating terrorists and destroying arms and infrastructure, while the air force has struck 'dozens of targets in all of Gaza, including terrorist cells, buildings used by terrorist groups, tunnels, and arms depots.' The death toll continues to rise, with the Gaza Ministry of Health reporting 54,470 total deaths in 605 days of war, including 4,201 deaths since the resumption of Israeli ground operations on March 18. Pope Francis has condemned the violence, saying, 'We say no to violence, to every violence, especially when perpetrated against defenseless people like children and families!' UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an independent investigation into the recent massacre of 31 Palestinians and 176 injured while waiting for aid in Rafah. 'I am horrified by the news of Palestinians killed and injured while waiting for aid. It is unacceptable that Palestinians risk their lives to eat,' Guterres said, calling for those responsible to be punished, but without pointing fingers or naming names. Israel denies responsibility for the massacre, and the Netanyahu government, along with the US, is promoting a new strategy of aid to the civilian population of Gaza through the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which aims to divert food distribution from Hamas and UN agencies to protected points of distribution.

**UK to Increase Military Personnel to 76,000 by 2034**
The UK plans to increase the number of its military personnel from approximately 72,500 to 76,000 by the next parliament, according to UK Defense Minister John Healey. 'We intend to increase the British army to at least 76,000 regular soldiers by the next parliament. For the first time in a generation, it is our government that wants to increase the size of the regular army,' he said. The current government, led by the Labour Party, aims to achieve this goal by 2034. The current number of British military personnel is around 72,500, the lowest since the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century. According to The Times, the number of military personnel may drop below 70,000 in 2025 due to low recruitment rates and high rates of personnel leaving the service due to dissatisfaction with working conditions.

**UN Peacekeeping: A Vital Tool and a Wise Investment**
The work of UN peacekeepers - men and women serving far from home to help other populations live in peace - is demanding, complex, and dangerous. Since January 2024, we have mourned 78 deaths. Many others have been injured. Their sacrifice, as well as the service of over 68,000 military, police, and civilian personnel currently deployed under the UN flag - including personnel in uniform from 119 countries - demonstrates a concrete commitment to peace and security.

**Is Humanity Dead?**
The world is witnessing a sharp rise in armed conflicts and deaths, with over 200,000 people killed in 2022 alone. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the genocide in Gaza are two such examples, with at least 53,573 Palestinians killed and more than 121,000 wounded in Gaza. The author, Shagufta Bashir, argues that Gaza is a symbol of moral collapse and that the world is complicit in its silence. She calls for action, demanding a ceasefire, accountability, and justice for the people of Gaza. Bashir asks why Palestinian blood is treated as less sacred and why their lives are less worthy of outrage, attributing it to decades of dehumanisation. She urges people to protest, write, speak, and donate to raise their voices for justice and compassion. The article concludes with a cry for humanity, urging the world to unite for justice, peace, and dignity for all people, regardless of nation, race, or religion.

**Survivors of terrorism lack access to counselling**
Survivors of terrorism in Peshawar, Pakistan, lack access to counseling, leading to ongoing trauma and psychological problems. Despite the devastating impact of terrorism, which has killed 70,000 to 80,000 people in the past 20 years, there are only 500 mental health professionals in the country for a population of over 240 million. 'Until or unless there is a district-level rehab center for victims of terrorism and their families, these people will continue to suffer from despair, depression and psychological problems,' said Professor Dr Jamil Chitrali. Dr Uzma Ali, a clinical psychologist, emphasized the need for clinical treatment and community support for survivors of terrorism, as well as counseling for their families. 'People going through trauma should be supported by family, and relevant institutions such as health, social welfare, and the district administration. These victims should be considered under the Victim Support Program, which could help them cope with their trauma,' she said. The Express Tribune reported that in 2022, 200 incidents of terrorism were reported in K-P and the tribal areas, while in 2023, 560 incidents occurred, resulting in the deaths of 167 police officers and 101 soldiers.

**Trump's Cuts to USAID Will Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under the age of five. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.'

**US Increases Military Presence in Spain and Indo-Pacific Region**
The US is increasing its military presence in Spain, particularly in the base of Rota, where a new destroyer, the USS Oscar Austin, arrived in October 2024. The base is a critical node for US support logistics in Europe and Africa. The US plans to add hangars and increase capabilities at the base by 2035. Additionally, the US has deployed four destroyers in Rota since 2015, and two more were added in 2022 as part of the reinforcement of US troops in Europe. The base is also home to the Company Europe of the Security Antiterrorist Team of the Fleet (FAST), which provides security forces and rapid response for deployment in wide areas of Europe and Africa. Spain is a key military piece for the US, as shown by the explicit plans to expand and improve the Rota infrastructure by 2035. The US is also increasing its military presence in the Indo-Pacific region, with Spain participating in a maritime military deployment for the first time. The Spanish frigate Méndez Núñez will participate in the NATO operation 'Highmast' for five months, demonstrating the country's naval projection capabilities. The Spanish government has approved the 2024 Security Maritime Strategy, which includes the Indo-Pacific region as a 'maritime space of interest' for Spain. The country's military participation in the Indo-Pacific region is not new, as it participated in the 'Pacific Skies' exercise last year, where Spanish and French aircraft flew over 58,000 kilometers in 56 days. The Spanish military is also participating in 16 missions abroad with 3,000 military personnel and civil guards, including the reinforcement of the eastern flank of NATO and the operation 'Persistent Effort' to defend the airspace. However, this increased military presence and dependence on the US is raising concerns about Spain's sovereignty and national interests.

**SOFREP Evening Brief: US-Backed Gaza Aid Group Sparks Concerns as Launch Nears, Russia and Ukraine to Resume Peace Talks in Istanbul Without Top Leaders**
Israeli airstrikes in Gaza have killed over 80 people, including a journalist and 11 members of his family, amid an intensifying military campaign that has now killed more than 53,000 Palestinians since October 2023. The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, led by US military veterans, plans to deliver 300 million meals within its first 90 days, but faces criticism from the UN over legality and neutrality. Russia and Ukraine will hold direct peace talks in Istanbul, but expectations remain low after Russian President Vladimir Putin declined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's offer for a face-to-face meeting. The US is pushing NATO allies to boost defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2032, citing rising threats from Russia, terrorism, and China. Latvia's intelligence agency has warned of Russian saboteurs infiltrating the country under the guise of lost tourists or unassuming hikers. Japan has grounded its entire fleet of T-4 training aircraft following a crash that occurred shortly after takeoff.

**US Sends Clear Message to Maduro: 'Remember Noriega'**
The recent rescue of five Venezuelan refugees held hostage in the Argentine embassy in Caracas by the US sends a clear message to Nicolás Maduro and his associates: 'Remember Noriega'. This type of message is one that dictators pay attention to. It was a practical reminder that Washington can capture or eliminate its enemies at any time and place on the planet, including Caracas. The US has made it clear that it is willing to use its military and intelligence power to combat transnational organized crime that has been attacking its population for years. This action is not coincidental. Unlike conflicts in distant regions of Europe and the Middle East, the war against transnational organized crime has been fought on US soil with a high cost in lives. President Trump has made the war against drug trafficking a priority, not only in terms of law enforcement, but also in terms of foreign policy, and is preparing to take it extraterritorially if insufficient cooperation from other governments leads to that decision. The US has executed a successful operation to extract the five Venezuelan hostages who had been held for 412 days in the Argentine embassy in Caracas, a move that has left Maduro and his associates 'consterned'. The US has made it clear that it will not forget its enemies, and that its allies are no longer able to protect them. According to official statistics from the CDC, in 2023, 'deaths from synthetic opioids other than methadone (primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyl) continued to increase, with 73,838 overdose deaths reported in 2022. Deaths related to stimulants, including cocaine or psychoactive substances with abuse potential (primarily methamphetamine), also continued to increase with 27,569 and 34,022 deaths respectively in 2022.' Transnational organized crime moves more than a trillion dollars annually from a diversified portfolio of illicit operations that include, but are not limited to, drug trafficking. They have powerful private mercenary armies whose firepower often surpasses that of local authorities, and their unlimited financial resources allow them to corrupt the politicians of democratic countries where they do not directly control power. However, this is not the case with the Venezuelan mafia state. In the name of the so-called '21st century socialism', Hugo Chávez and Maduro, with military and intelligence support from their Cuban partner and participation in various areas from Iran, Russia, and China, have transformed the homeland of Bolívar into a hub of transnational organized crime and its allies, where narco-traffickers, Latin American and Islamic terrorists, irregular groups, and delinquents of different nationalities coexist. Maduro has believed himself to be invulnerable with such an amalgam of impresentable scum around him. And then the unthinkable happened: the US executed a successful operation to extract the five Venezuelan hostages who had been held for 412 days in the Argentine embassy in Caracas. The current Secretary of State and National Security, Marco Rubio, publicly recognized the fact, as did President Javier Milei in thanking them for the successful rescue and extraction of those asylum seekers. It was not an extraction operation in a remote prison, but in a house under constant surveillance by an armed operational team and multiple cameras in 24/7 shifts, located in a prestigious residential area in the capital. The execution of such an operation must have taken not weeks but months, implying the preparation and positioning of the necessary means to extract the hostages from the premises, move them through the capital to a point of extraction, and arrive there with a means of transportation (airborne, naval, or terrestrial) capable of taking them out of the country and bringing them safely to the United States. Maduro, Diosdado Cabello, and the rest of those on the international wanted list of the US Department of Justice must be 'consterned' today. They have no reason to be otherwise. Yesterday, they came for the hostages, tomorrow they may come for them. The 'gringos' do not forget, and their allies no longer seem able to protect them.

**Ukrainian Military to Send Non-Combat Experienced Employees to Front Lines**
The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces announced that employees of Ukrainian military enlistment offices without combat experience will be sent to the front lines. This is necessary to fill the ranks of military enlistment offices with personnel with combat experience. According to the General Staff, 70% of military enlistment office employees have combat experience, while 20% are civilian employees. In April 2024, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky signed a controversial law reducing the minimum age for mobilization from 27 to 25 years old. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine launched a project to recruit contract soldiers from 18 to 25 years old in 2025. The project offered $24,000 for signing a contract, as well as a 0% interest mortgage, free education, and medical care, and the right to leave the country after a year of service. It is worth noting that the Ukrainian military has lost 1.08 million people killed and wounded since February 24, 2022. Since the beginning of 2025, Kiev has lost around 80,000 soldiers. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Ukrainian military lost 118.5 thousand people in the first year of the special operation, 405.4 thousand in 2023, and over 595 thousand in 2024. The losses of the Ukrainian military in the past year exceed the total losses of the first two years of the special operation.

**Israeli Ministry of Defense Expects Over 100,000 Soldiers to be Injured by 2030**
The Israeli Ministry of Defense announced on Sunday, ahead of a conference on soldiers injured after Tuesday, that it is expected that more than 100,000 soldiers will be injured by 2030, and that the number has already exceeded 16,000 in the current war, according to the Israeli newspaper 'Jerusalem Post'. The ministry had announced in December 2024 that the number of injured soldiers had exceeded 75,000, and in the current war, it had exceeded 13,500. Despite the fact that these numbers have broken previous records, and the rate of soldier injuries has increased significantly compared to the pre-war period, the rate of injuries among soldiers has slowed down significantly even before the ceasefire, and has been largely frozen during the ceasefire period from January 19 to March 18. The ministry had expected in April 2024 that another 20,000 soldiers would be injured in 2024, in addition to 2025. The newspaper noted that no Israeli soldier has been killed in Gaza since the renewed fighting on March 19, and there have been no significant new injuries among Israeli soldiers. 'We are facing a new reality,' said a senior Israeli official, 'where the number of injured soldiers is expected to exceed 100,000 by 2030.'

**40 Soldiers Killed in 2024, 27 in Service-Related Incidents – Prosecutor • MassisPost**
In 2024, 40 Armenian soldiers lost their lives, with 27 deaths being service-related, according to Military Prosecutor Grigor Elizbaryan. The service-related incidents included four deaths from enemy fire, five murders, and one death during a military training exercise. Additionally, there were seven cases of suicide or deaths resulting from incitement to suicide, four fatal road accidents, one death due to violations of combat vehicle operation rules, two deaths in an aviation accident, and three due to illness. Elizbaryan stated that 13 soldiers died in non-service-related incidents. Human rights activists have criticized the government for its ineffective management of the armed forces, describing it as an opaque and closed system. They argue that investigations into military incidents often focus solely on the direct perpetrators, while overlooking the army's leadership, which is ultimately responsible for the soldiers' lives and well-being.

**Ukrainian Military Loses Over 590,000 Soldiers in 2024, Total Casualties Exceed 1 Million**
The Russian General Staff reported that the Ukrainian military has lost 590,000 soldiers in 2024, bringing the total number of casualties since the start of the special operation to over 1 million.

And since the start of the SVO, this figure has exceeded one million people.' Rudskoy stated that the previous year was a turning point in achieving the goals of the special operation and expressed confidence that the Kiev regime is no longer able to change the situation on the battlefield. He also noted that the Ukrainian military has lost the ability to produce necessary weapons, equipment, and ammunition. This is in line with previous statements by Russian officials, including Defense Minister Andrei Bellovsky, who reported that Ukrainian forces lost over 560,000 soldiers in 2024. The US special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Kurt Campbell, also stated that Ukrainian losses are three times higher than US losses in the Vietnam and Korean wars combined.
