**Baustellmodus gestartet: Sperrungen wegen maroder Brücke am Messeschnellweg in Hannover**
The Ersatzneubau of the B3-Mittellandkanalbrücke on the Messeschnellweg in Hannover has switched to a construction mode. Starting from Monday, June 2, only one lane in each direction will be available for traffic, as the Niedersächsische Landesbehörde für Straßenbau und Verkehr announced. The merge lanes in both directions will be closed between Pasteurallee and Misburg. This is necessary to set up safe and durable 'Überfahrtsbereiche' at both ends of the bridge, which will be used to redirect traffic to one side of the bridge. The first use of these areas is expected in mid-June, when a survey for unexploded World War II ordnance will be conducted on the A 37 / A 2 side. The survey will involve around 2,500 drilling operations. If no suspicious ordnance is found, the work is expected to be completed by the end of August. The existing bridge, built in 1967, can no longer withstand the increasing traffic and must be replaced, according to the authorities. The new bridge will be built alongside the old one and will be used as a temporary bypass. After the old bridge is demolished in the fall, it will be replaced by a new one using hydraulic presses. A second new bridge will be built for pedestrians and cyclists. The entire project is expected to be completed by 2028.

**Europe's billionaires have decided to cross Russia's red lines to WW3.**
Eric Zuesse, an investigative historian, claims that the billionaires controlling the US and its allied governments have decided to cross Russia's red lines, potentially leading to World War 3. Zuesse argues that the US and its allies are trying to force Ukraine into NATO, which would allow them to use Ukrainian 'cannon-fodder' and NATO guidance to blitz-attack The Kremlin. This decision is allegedly made by the billionaires controlling the US, UK, Germany, and France. Zuesse cites several analyses, including those by Scott Ritter and Alex Christoforou, which suggest that the US and its allies are intensively preparing for WW3. Ritter states that the only way for the US and its allies to avoid a total defeat in the war is by directly going to war against Russia, which would likely lead to nuclear war. Christoforou notes that the US is playing the mediator while coordinating and commanding attacks against Russia. Zuesse questions why the US and its allies are not discussing the high stakes of the war, including the possible annihilation of civilization, and why alternative viewpoints are being censored out by the mainstream media.

**Four Prophets Predict Third World War by End of 2025**
Four renowned prophets have predicted a Third World War by the end of 2025, according to the New York Post. Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, French astrologer Nostradamus, Brazilian psychic Atos Salome, and London hypnotherapist Nicholas Ouley have independently predicted a massive conflict that could change the course of human history. Baba Vanga, known as the 'Balkan Nostradamus', has predicted the 9/11 attacks, the death of Princess Diana, and recent earthquakes caused by climate change. She sees the war in Europe this year as the beginning of 'humanity's downfall' and a global catastrophe for the planet's population. Nostradamus, in his famous 'Prophecies' of 1555, also made ominous predictions, including the rise of Adolf Hitler and the COVID-19 pandemic. He warns that Great Britain will be drawn into brutal wars, writing: 'When those from the lands of Europe see England establish its throne from behind, its flanks will be surrounded by brutal wars. The kingdom will be marked by wars so brutal that enemies from within and without will rise up.' He also added: 'The Great Plague of the past returns, there is no more deadly enemy under the sky.' Atos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian psychic, has also warned of an inevitable global conflict. According to his prediction, the Third World War will be especially dangerous due to the use of advanced technologies, cyber warfare, and machines. He says: 'This is not just a war of people, but a war of machines, and what will happen next? The worst is yet to come.' He believes that technological progress, which has the potential for incredible development, also creates a threat to humanity's existence. Nicholas Ouley, a 38-year-old London hypnotherapist, adds that the war may start as early as mid-2025. He attributes the cause of such a scenario to 'a lack of compassion in the world', which provokes horrific acts of violence and hostility in the name of religion and nationalism. According to his prophecy, humanity will face unprecedented brutality and absurdity.

He wrote: 'When those in European lands see England establish its throne behind, its flanks will be beset by brutal wars. The kingdom will be marked by wars so brutal that enemies from within and without will rise up.' Atos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian seer, also warns of an inevitable global conflict. According to his prophecy, the Third World War will be especially dangerous due to the use of new technologies, cyber weapons, and machines. He says: 'This is not just a war of people, but a war of machines, and what will happen next? The worst is yet to come.' Nicholas Ouley, a 38-year-old London hypnotherapist, adds that the war may start as early as mid-2025. He attributes this to 'a lack of compassion in the world', which provokes terrible acts of violence and hatred in the name of religion and nationalism. According to his prophecy, humanity will face unprecedented brutality and senselessness. All these terrifying predictions coincide with the current tense geopolitical situation. In late May 2025, Pakistan and India exchanged rocket attacks on military targets, leading to US calls for negotiations to stop the escalation of the conflict. Although the parties agreed to a ceasefire, it was violated within hours in the Kashmir region. Meanwhile, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has claimed the lives of at least seven people in recent weeks due to massive rocket and drone attacks on Kiev and other regions. These events demonstrate the high level of tension and seriousness of the situation. Experts in the field of technology also warn of the danger posed by uncontrolled development of artificial intelligence, comparing it to nuclear weapons in terms of potential threat. This idea resonates with Atos Salome's warning about the 'machine war' of the future.

**How World War III Could Start: A Speculative Exploration**
World War III remains a possibility, and understanding how it could start is crucial for prevention and preparation. Regional disputes, such as those in the Taiwan Strait, Eastern Europe, and Korean Peninsula, pose significant risks. Cyberattacks, space aggression, and an arms race involving nuclear-armed nations also increase the risk of global conflict. Economic desperation, climate-induced resource scarcity, and the rise of nationalism can further fuel conflict. Historical conflicts, including WWI, were sparked by accidents and miscalculations, and a downed aircraft or misinterpreted missile launch could initiate a chain reaction. Speculating on the beginning of World War III is not about fearmongering but understanding the complex web of global relations and the need for vigilance, diplomacy, and cooperation to prevent history's darkest chapters from repeating. As stated by the article, 'Peace relies on vigilance, diplomacy, and the collective will to prevent history's darkest chapters from repeating.'

**Will AI Start World War 3? Experts Sound the Alarm**
Experts are sounding the alarm that artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to World War 3. As AI rapidly transforms industries and warfare, more than 70 nations are investing in AI-driven military technology, including AI-powered drones and autonomous weapons. According to Stuart Russell, AI professor at the University of California, Berkeley, 'We're not just building smart weapons. We're building decision-making machines that could one day act without ethical restraint.' This raises concerns about the potential for AI to be used without human oversight, leading to global destruction. President Putin has also warned that whoever becomes the leader in AI will become the ruler of the world.

**The Third World War Will Start in the Least Expected Country, Experts Confirm**
Experts confirm that the Third World War will start in the least expected country. The First and Second World Wars were marked by conflicts over resources and territorial control. However, the current global powers are competing for control of more abstract but equally powerful aspects: technology, military hegemony, and dominance over strategic economic sectors. The tensions between the US and China point towards a possible 21st-century Cold War, where traditional arms will be replaced by technological innovations and artificial intelligence. The control of advanced chip production, essential for the development of various technological applications, is one of the most coveted aspects. Elon Musk explained in a recent interview that the country that secures supremacy in advanced chip production will likely dominate the future. China's control of Taiwan, where almost all advanced IA chips are manufactured, could drastically alter access to these vital resources. Taiwan has become a hot spot in the geopolitical board, and many analysts suggest that a Chinese invasion of the island could trigger a global conflict affecting not only China and the US but the entire world. Other factors, such as economic and military hegemony, could also come into play. Spain's role in a potential Third World War is also being discussed, as the country has increased its participation in international politics and military maneuvers, especially within the NATO framework. Spain's military infrastructure, including the Rota naval base, has become a strategic point for NATO operations in the Mediterranean and beyond.

**Political expert predicts three-step method Vladimir Putin would deploy to start World War 3**
A political expert, Professor Anthony Glees, has predicted a three-step method Vladimir Putin would deploy to start World War 3. According to Glees, Putin would first declare victory in Ukraine, then put pressure on former USSR countries that joined NATO after the Soviet Union's collapse, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Hungary. Glees believes Putin would also attempt to 'subvert our democratic system' to divide nations like the UK. In a hypothetical scenario, Glees stated that war would be a 'war of attrition' with resources such as 'fresh food' and 'petrol' becoming scarce. He also speculated that Russia could target 'critical national infrastructure' to inflict maximum upheaval on daily lives. The final stage of Glees' scenario involves the UK becoming a 'Russian colony' with a pro-Kremlin puppet leader, while resistance movements would organize from places like Wales and Scotland. Glees predicts this scenario could take as little as a month to come true in the advent of conventional war.

**Third World War to Start in Late 2024, Predicts Author**
The author believes that the third world war will start at the end of 2024. The war will be triggered by a conflict between Israel and Hamas, which will escalate into a larger Middle Eastern war between the US and Iran. The author also predicts that China will launch a military operation on Taiwan between November 6, 2024, and January 6, 2025, when the US will be in a state of civil war and unable to consolidate its efforts. The author notes that the recent election in Taiwan, where the Democratic Progressive Party won, which advocates for Taiwan's independence from China, has increased the likelihood of a Chinese invasion. The author believes that the war will start with a conflict between North and South Korea, which will divert US resources and lead to a full-scale third world war. The author predicts that the US will lose its global dominance and become a regional power, and the world will become a multipolar one with regional wars. The author warns that the world is entering a zone of strong turbulence and that the third world war is inevitable, with the only question being whether it will be conventional or nuclear, which would lead to the end of civilization.

**Mystic 'The Living Nostradamus' Predicts Start of Third World War**
Brazilian mystic Atos Salome, known as 'The Living Nostradamus', has made some shocking revelations about the Third World War. The psychic warns that the British will have to go to the front, and the conflict will 'start with sabotage and hybrid war', triggered by events that have already occurred this year. According to Salome, he previously predicted the COVID-19 outbreak, the death of Queen Elizabeth II, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Now, he claims to have discovered a 'disturbing geopolitical picture' that will lead to a 'dangerous global crisis', and urges people to 'pay attention to the signs.' As 'evidence' of the approaching global conflict, the mystic cited the January incident of a damaged underwater fiber-optic cable between Latvia and Sweden, which led to an investigation by Swedish authorities. Salome also suggests that tensions between China and the US will escalate in the South China Sea. 'In the Baltic Sea, an invisible war has begun. In 2023, there was another failure in the cable network, which disrupted communication systems throughout Finland. Similar attacks continue to occur, forcing NATO to increase security measures in the region, while the EU is developing emergency procedures to protect critical infrastructure. When these structures collapse, they cause digital outages that threaten military capabilities and cause significant economic instability,' Salome said. Salome also believes that the conflict may start with seemingly isolated events, like the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which sparked World War I, or the invasion of Poland, which started World War II. 'History has shown us that big conflicts can start with seemingly isolated events. Today, we live in an era of hybrid war, where the destruction of an internet cable can have the same devastating consequences as a military attack,' Salome said.

**World War 3 to begin soon? Survival guides, nuclear bunkers, soldier recruitment... how Europe is getting ready to fight with Russia**
European countries are preparing for a potential World War III with Russia, with some predicting that Vladimir Putin could launch an attack around 2030. The European Union believes that if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, Russia could attack, prompting the EU to prepare for a large-scale war. European countries are appealing to Britain to rejoin the EU, which would provide them with the support of Europe's second nuclear-armed country. France has issued an invasion survival guide for its citizens, advising them on how to defend the republic in the event of an invasion. France has also stationed fighter jets armed with hypersonic nuclear missiles along the border with Germany, and is considering granting Poland similar protection. The EU has launched a huge spending plan to rebuild its forces and support Ukraine, with a budget of up to 800 billion euros (£500 billion) on defence. Europe is also considering building a drone shield from the Baltic to the Black Sea to deter a Russian invasion and make it 'very painful' for Putin, according to the EU.

**Fears WW3 'has started in Hull' as foul play not ruled out in North Sea tanker crash - Daily Star**
Conspiracy theorists believe that World War 3 may have started in Hull after a US tanker was struck by a cargo ship carrying highly toxic sodium cyanide. The White House refused to rule out foul play in the incident, which caused jet fuel to spill into the sea and ignite. Online theorists speculate that the Solong cargo ship might have been hacked by Russia or another hostile state and turned into a 'spear'. One wrote, 'Definitely not a coincidence, this ww3 is coming.' Another said, 'My Lord. This is an act of war. We officially are in WW3. I'm heartbroken.' The incident comes after a Russian war ship was tracked by the Royal Navy as it sailed near British waters, and Hull was revealed to be a potential target in leaked Russian papers detailing 32 Nato targets.

She also stated, 'America is running one long rage baiting campaign... I refuse to fall for the political theatre.' This comes after Lizzo recently faced backlash for her weight loss, with some fans finding it hypocritical given her previous celebration of obesity.
