**AI Set to Disrupt 85 Million Jobs by 2025 - Blogging.org**
According to the World Economic Forum, artificial intelligence and automation are expected to displace 85 million jobs by 2025, while creating 97 million new roles. The shift marks a significant transition in how work is divided between humans and machines, with automation handling information processing, administrative tasks, and routine labor. A study by McKinsey suggests that 50% of current work activities could be automated using existing AI technologies, with jobs involving repetitive, rule-based processes particularly vulnerable. However, roles requiring creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving will remain largely in human hands. As economist David Autor notes, 'As always with technology revolutions, the jobs that get created tend to be better and higher-paying than the ones that get destroyed.' Adaptation through upskilling will be critical for both companies and workers, with 77% of surveyed companies planning to reskill and upskill their existing workforce between 2025-2030. Individuals can gain the top skills needed for emerging professions in as little as one to two months, according to Coursera data.

**AI to impact 40% of jobs globally  --  UN**
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) predicts that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will become a $4.8 trillion global market by 2033. However, the report highlights the growing inequality in the AI landscape, with only 100 companies responsible for 40% of the world's private investment in research and development. This gap could lead to 40% of global jobs being affected. UNCTAD experts emphasize that AI will not replace people, but create new industries and empower workers. To maximize the benefits of the next industrial revolution, governments must invest in reskilling, upskilling, and workforce adaptation. Developing countries must also strengthen their infrastructure, data, and skills, including high-quality datasets and reliable Internet connections. Education systems must equip people with digital and problem-solving skills necessary for an AI-driven world, as said by UNCTAD experts. 'We can expect that existing jobs will become obsolete, and their workers will be displaced, particularly in developing countries where their main selling point is cheap labor,' UNCTAD said. However, they also emphasized that 'AI will create new industries and empower workers,' and that governments must invest in reskilling and upskilling to ensure the continuous employability of workers.

**AI supercomputers could need as much power as a city by 2030**
A study by Epoch AI projects that top supercomputers by 2030 could require as much power as 9 million homes, equivalent to 9 nuclear reactors. This is due to the rapid growth of AI, with current estimates suggesting a doubling of power requirements each year. The leading AI supercomputer in 2030 could require 2 million AI chips and cost $200 billion to build, according to Epoch AI's paper. Companies are racing to develop AI that surpasses human intelligence, with OpenAI's Stargate project aiming to build critical AI infrastructure, including a computing system, worth over $500 billion in investment over four years. However, as Epoch AI's research suggests, this growth would come with greater power demands, with AI supercomputers improving in energy efficiency but not quickly enough to offset overall power growth.

**Preparing for the AI Revolution: A Call to Action for Business Leaders**
According to a World Economic Forum report, by 2030, 92 million jobs could be lost due to AI transformation, but 170 million new jobs will be created. These new jobs will be in areas such as agriculture, construction, and education, as well as in software development and AI expertise. Tigran Sloyan, CEO of CodeSignal, emphasizes that AI will not replace humans, but rather redefine their roles. He notes that there is a significant need for 'AI literacy' among business leaders and managers, as only 20% of them feel that their employees are well-prepared to work with AI, according to a Deloitte study. Sloyan stresses that AI is not magic, but rather infrastructure that requires understanding and proper use. He recommends that leaders focus on developing their employees' AI skills in three key areas: understanding AI capabilities, improving prompting skills, and managing the limitations of AI use. Sloyan also emphasizes the importance of soft skills, such as strategic decision-making and empathy, for leaders to effectively lead and inspire their teams. Ultimately, the most successful companies will be those that see AI as an opportunity to enhance human potential, rather than a threat.

**Bill Gates Recommends Book on AI, Predicts Massive Changes in Jobs**
Bill Gates believes that everyone should read his favorite book on artificial intelligence, which predicts that AI will change the shape of most jobs in almost every industry within the next five years, according to a report by CBS News. The book, 'The Next Wave: Technology and Power and the Greatest Challenge of the 21st Century', was written by Mustafa Suleyman, a pioneer in AI and the founder of the research lab DeepMind, which was sold to Google in 2014 and is now the executive director of Microsoft AI. Gates wrote on his blog last month: 'It is the book that I recommend more than any other book on AI - to heads of state, business leaders, and anyone else who asks - because it provides something rare: a clear vision of both the extraordinary opportunities and the real risks of the future.' In the book, Suleyman predicts that the rapid development of AI will change the way almost every industry works. He cites a 2023 study by McKinsey, which estimated that nearly half of all 'work activities' will become automated by 2030. Suleyman writes that the consequences of AI will be 'extremely destabilizing' for hundreds of millions of people who will need, at the very least, to be retrained and transition to new types of work. According to McKinsey, more than 400 million workers worldwide may need to transition to new jobs or roles. Suleyman says that AI will help workers become more efficient, as it already has in some cases, but only initially. He explains that 'these tools will only augment human intelligence temporarily. They will make us more intelligent and efficient for a while, and they will open up huge amounts of economic growth, but they will replace labor essentially.' How to prepare for the impact of AI on the workforce? Suleyman notes that from 'physical manufacturing' to 'cognitive work', the AI revolution will touch almost every industry. In the end, there will be 'few areas' where humans will be able to surpass machines. AI will quickly surpass human workers in office tasks such as administration, customer service, and content creation, according to Suleyman. He points out that the increase in inputs is likely to lead to a reality where employers will create millions of new jobs in response to economic growth. However, Suleyman notes that all this work will not go to humans: employers will choose 'very low-cost incentives' whenever possible. Some jobs are harder for AI to replicate. These include skilled trades such as plumbers and electricians, as well as office roles that rely heavily on social skills, critical thinking, and creativity. However, it is likely that everyone will need to upgrade their skills - and learn how to integrate this type of technology into their current jobs, as AI services spread across all industries over the coming years. Suleyman writes that many others will need to transition to entirely new jobs. This transformation is already underway. In 2023, a survey by EY found that 41% of American companies surveyed were implementing plans to train employees to work with AI products. According to a survey by Slack Workforce Lab in March 2024 of over 10,000 professionals, the key AI skills - such as rapid prototyping, machine learning, and data literacy - are a major factor in hiring for nearly 70% of employers. The massive challenge posed by AI to jobs. Some experts suggest that the economic benefits of AI will create enough new jobs to outweigh those lost. AI will create 78 million more jobs than it replaces by 2030, and the future of work will revolve around collaboration between humans and machines, according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs 2025 report earlier this year. Even the optimists about AI agree that the massive changes in how people work are likely to lead to a period of dramatic transformation. In his book, Suleyman predicts that the new jobs enabled by AI developments will not come soon enough to save large parts of the global workforce. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said in a discussion with MIT President Sally Kornbluth in May 2024 that AI 'will kill a lot of current jobs, (and) there will be categories of jobs that will disappear completely.' 'Innovative treatments' and 'innovative solutions' and other benefits. Suleyman and Gates remain generally optimistic about the ability of AI to change people's lives for the better. Gates wrote last month that if workers and leaders prepare for massive changes, everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of 'innovative treatments for deadly diseases, innovative solutions to climate change, and high-quality education for all.' To achieve this better scenario, humans need to adopt AI by learning how to work with new technologies while implementing them in their daily lives and careers. This can start by exploring free online AI services such as 'Chat GPT' or other large language models that use AI. More advanced options include taking online courses to learn AI skills such as rapid prototyping. Suleyman emphasizes that 'this is a massive challenge that will determine, without exaggeration, the quality and nature of life in this century and the next.'

**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, According to WEF**
According to data from Stocklytics.com, big data specialists and fintech engineers are the jobs that will grow the most between 2025 and 2030. The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and automation, along with the increasing adoption of digital tools and platforms, has had a significant impact on the global economy, changing the way companies operate and communicate with their customers. However, the rise of these technologies has also transformed the job market, forcing workers to requalify and adapt to new opportunities. Big data specialists form the backbone of innovation in AI across various sectors, from healthcare to finance and commerce. They play a crucial role in managing large datasets that enable fraud detection, predictive analysis, and recommendation systems. According to the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Report on the Future of Work 2025, big data specialists lead the list of fastest-growing jobs, with a projected increase of 110% between 2025 and 2030, far surpassing any other profession. Fintech engineers, who develop cutting-edge financial technologies such as blockchain and digital payment systems, come in second, with a projected increase of 86% over the next five years. Meanwhile, machine learning specialists have fallen to third place, with a growth expectation of 81% by 2030. Application developers and security managers complete the top five jobs, with projected increases of 58% and 57%, respectively. The WEF predicts that training to become a data storage specialist, autonomous and electric vehicle specialist, or UI/UX designer will also be a good option for those seeking a secure job in the near future. While some jobs are growing, others are shrinking. According to the WEF, postal service employees, bank tellers, and data entry assistants face a decline of 25-35%. Secretaries, administrative assistants, and cashiers are also facing significant declines as automation advances. The 2024 Annual Report on Work Trends revealed that 75% of employees used AI at work last year, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises. Additionally, two out of three technology leaders were more likely to give an opportunity to someone with AI skills than an experienced candidate without those skills. According to the WEF's predictions, AI will create over 170 million new jobs by 2030, far more than any other technology. This number brings many opportunities for workers willing to learn and adapt.

China and the U.S. are the biggest contenders in the AI compute race, with China investing $6.12 billion in AI data centers and the U.S. investing $30 billion annually in data infrastructure. However, the rapid expansion of data centers has created an urgent need for utilities and the government to increase power generation capacity, with a focus on a perfect mix of renewable and conventional energy sources. Saudi Arabia is also becoming a force to be reckoned with in the AI infrastructure race, with a planned $100bn Project Transcendence AI hub. Companies such as Innatera are advocating for neuromorphic computing, which uses less energy than traditional practices. Whoever leads in AI compute will have the strongest voice in the future, and it's not just about being among the first, but about shaping the next revolution of technology.

**Artificial Intelligence to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, Report Says**
The World Economic Forum (WEF) has recently released the Future of Jobs Report 2025, which extensively analyzes global trends in the labor market and predicts their impact on jobs, skills, and worker transformation strategies in 2025-2030. A significant part of the report is dedicated to the role of artificial intelligence in the world's workforce. According to the report, the most significant trends in the labor market in 2025-2030 are: technological advancements, economic turbulence, green energy, lack of security, and an aging population. The report is based on surveys of over 1,000 employers representing over 14 million workers in 22 industry clusters and 55 economies worldwide. The authors of the report also collaborated with platforms such as Coursera, LinkedIn, and Indeed to supplement the survey results with real data on employment trends. The report predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 170 million new jobs created, with AI playing a key role. However, 92 million roles will be replaced, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs. Technological changes remain the main driver of changes, with the expansion of digital access creating and displacing more jobs than any other macro-trend. AI and information technologies can provide 11 million new jobs, despite the expected displacement of 9 million. Meanwhile, robotics and autonomous systems will become the largest reducer, reducing the number of jobs by 5 million. For example, since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investment in AI has increased by almost eight times, accompanied by increased funding for server infrastructure and energy systems to support AI systems. Although information technologies are leaders in the implementation of AI, the real sector of the economy, including industries such as construction and manufacturing, lags behind. Generative AI, in particular, technologies based on natural language processing (NLP), most significantly change work processes in finance, healthcare, education, retail, and the IT sector. It is expected that by 2030, the share of tasks performed exclusively by humans will decrease from 47% to 33%, and the share of automated tasks will increase from 22% to 33%. The report notes a change in the paradigm of future human-machine work. Interaction between humans, machines, and algorithms changes work roles in various fields. It is expected that automation will lead to changes in the way people work, and the proportional share of tasks performed exclusively or primarily by humans will decrease as technologies become more universal.

**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, WEF Study Finds**
According to a World Economic Forum (WEF) study, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to create 170 million new job openings by 2030. However, current job vacancies and specializations are expected to decrease by 22%. The study, conducted among 11,000 employers from 55 countries, found that despite the expected job loss, the net employment growth will be around 7%. This is due to approximately 8% of the workforce being redirected to new fields, requiring employees to adapt and retrain. In response to the challenges of AI implementation, 77% of employers expressed willingness to invest in employee upskilling. Additionally, over half of companies plan to restructure their business to integrate AI, and 65% intend to hire professionals with expertise in new technologies. Nevertheless, around 40% of companies may lay off employees if AI automation becomes possible. Notably, 86% of employers believe that AI will fundamentally change the labor market, particularly in finance and electronics.
