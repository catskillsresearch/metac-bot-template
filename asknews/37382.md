**3 varied alternatives to X for when you simply cannot with the new iteration of Twitter**
Since Elon Musk rebranded Twitter as 'X,' many users have left the platform in search of alternatives. Three popular options are Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon. Threads, owned by Meta, has gained 350 million active monthly users and is seen as a 'Twitter-killer app' due to its Instagram design and ease of use. Bluesky, launched as a research project by Jack Dorsey, offers users the ability to heavily moderate their experience and has gained 35 million active monthly users. Mastodon, a decentralized platform, has struggled to sustain its growth, but has around 880,000 active monthly users. Each platform has its own unique features and user base, but all offer a refuge for those dissatisfied with Musk's Twitter.

**Bluesky Introduces Authentic Verification System with Blue Checkmarks**
Bluesky has introduced a new verification system, featuring blue checkmarks that indicate the authenticity of accounts. According to the platform, 'selected accounts' will receive a blue checkmark, signifying their authenticity, which is determined by Bluesky itself. Additionally, 'trusted third-party organizations' like The New York Times and Wired can also verify accounts, with their own unique, slightly wavy blue checkmark. Users can see who verified the account by tapping on the symbol. Over 270,000 accounts have already verified themselves through the connection with their own domain, and this process will remain in place, with the new blue checkmarks serving as an additional verification method. Users can opt out of displaying the verification symbol in their app settings. Bluesky claims to have created a flexible solution that balances security and user privacy. Currently, users cannot apply for a blue checkmark themselves, but this will be possible through a registration form in the future.

**Bluesky Faces Censorship in Turkey: 59 Access Block Requests Made**
According to Prof. Dr. Yaman Akdeniz, a founder of the Freedom of Expression Association, 59 access block requests have been sent to social media platform Bluesky from Turkey, and 13 accounts and 1 post have been blocked. These requests were made under Article 8/A of the 5651 Law by the peace courts. However, Bluesky only partially implemented these requests, and did not provide information on which content led to the blocking of the accounts. Akdeniz noted that Bluesky does not have an official representative in Turkey, and that the platform published transparency reports in 2023 and 2024, but did not include any data on Turkey in the 2024 report. The detected blockages are from 2025. Akdeniz stated, 'Bluesky is now also facing censorship. The government's insistence on interfering with freedom of expression is continuing unabated, even in its new form.' The blockages were justified under the pretext of 'protecting national security and public order'.

**Bluesky's Surge: 35 Million Users and Counting**
After Twitter's (X) recent decisions sparked concerns about freedom of expression, millions of users have started to migrate to Bluesky, a platform founded by Twitter's co-founder Jack Dorsey in 2019. The platform's user base has grown rapidly, reaching 35 million users as of April 5, 2025. Bluesky's unique feature is its algorithm, which is user-controlled, allowing users to create custom feeds based on their interests. The platform also has an 'anti-toksisite' system to prevent unwanted interactions. Notable users who have joined Bluesky include comedian Cem Yılmaz, who closed his 16.3 million follower X account and joined Bluesky. 'It's a great day,' said Cem Yılmaz, as he joined the platform. The rapid growth of Bluesky is seen as a 'digital migration' and a response to the concerns about freedom of expression on X.

**Here's Why X Keeps Going Down, According To Elon Musk**
X (formerly Twitter) experienced a 'massive cyberattack' on March 10, 2025, resulting in over 40,000 reports of outages, with users facing difficulties logging in, posting, and viewing content. During this time, alternative platforms like Bluesky remained operational, offering uninterrupted service. According to Elon Musk, the issue with X is due to its 'old infrastructure' and 'inefficient' systems, which he claims are being addressed through his unconventional methods of working with government agencies. Musk's tenure as X owner has been marked by challenges, including cyberattacks and user migration to platforms like Bluesky, which has seen significant growth since the 2024 U.S. presidential election, reaching 30 million users by January 2025. As Musk continues to implement his unique approach to government efficiency, it has sparked both interest and criticism, with some federal workers forming networks like #AltGov to resist certain policies using platforms like Bluesky.

**The new social media flames: Brands are being drawn to Threads and Bluesky**
New data from Sprout Social's Q1 2025 Pulse Survey reveals that more than half of marketers are already posting on emerging social media platforms such as Threads (57%) and Bluesky (52%). The survey found that 36% of industry insiders say their audience is joining emerging platforms like Threads, Bluesky, Lemon8, and Mastodon. However, only 26% of marketers plan to create unique content for these channels, with many repurposing content from other platforms. For example, Netflix repurposes content from established networks to show up on emerging platforms, while Google uses Threads to keep its users up to date on product developments. The survey assesses the activities of 650 US, UK, and Australian marketers.

**Bluesky is similarly structured to other social media, but with some unusual features**
A recent study published in PLOS One analyzed the social media platform Bluesky, finding that it has a unique structure but user interactions are similar to other platforms. The researchers found that Bluesky users are relatively left-leaning, with over 60% of links shared leading to left-leaning websites. However, users diverged on the topic of the Israel-Palestine conflict, with a sharp split between pro-Israel and pro-Palestine posts after the October 7 attacks. The study's authors, Dorian Quelle and Alexandre Bovet, noted that 'Our study shows the potential of open social media platforms for investigating the impact of their design and algorithms on collective human behavior.' The researchers tracked spikes in new Bluesky users, which often correlated with news related to X (formerly Twitter), such as Elon Musk's announcement of a fee for X users in September 2023. The study analyzed Bluesky's trajectory from its invite-only launch in February 2023 to 5.7 million users in May 2024.

**Jack Dorsey says Bluesky's rapid growth is because 'people are running away from X'**
Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey attributes the rapid growth of Bluesky to people 'running away from X, rather than running to something on Bluesky.' He believes that users are fleeing X due to dissatisfaction with Elon Musk's changes, rather than being drawn to Bluesky's features. Dorsey thinks that people will eventually be attracted to Bluesky's unique features, such as the ability to choose their own algorithms, but for now, they are primarily motivated by a desire to escape X. Bluesky has grown from 3 million users in February 2024 to 25.9 million users by the end of the year, according to the company. Bluesky CEO Jay Graber has stated that the platform is 'billionaire-proof' and that users will always have the option to move without starting over. Bluesky is working on improving its custom feeds and has announced plans to not show users algorithmically recommended ads.
