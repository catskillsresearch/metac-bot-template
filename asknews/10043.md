**Ukraine Joins EU's Single Roaming Area, Benefiting Ukrainians and Europeans Alike**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a document allowing Ukraine to join the European Union's (EU) single roaming area. According to the Ministry of Digital Transformation, this will enable Ukrainians to use their mobile operators' tariffs in 27 EU countries without incurring additional charges, and vice versa for EU citizens in Ukraine. As the Ministry noted, 'This is a significant step, as no country outside the EU has previously joined the Roam like at Home (RLAH) policy. It confirms Ukraine's importance as a digital player on the European stage.' The process began in February 2023, when the European Commission proposed including Ukraine in the single roaming zone, and was approved by the EU-Ukraine Association Committee in April 2023. In June 2024, Zelensky signed the main law implementing EU roaming norms, and in July 2024, the EU extended a one-year agreement between 22 European and 7 Ukrainian operators, allowing Ukrainian refugees to stay connected abroad at Ukrainian operator rates.

**Ukraine Signs Law to Join EU's Single Roaming Space**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a law that brings Ukraine closer to joining the European Union's single roaming space. According to 'Glavkom', this was announced by Minister of Digital Transformation Mikhail Fedorov. As a result, Ukrainians will be able to use mobile communication in the EU without additional roaming tariffs. Fedorov stated, 'The signing of the law has brought Ukraine closer to the Single Digital Market of the EU and strengthened the chances of joining the RLAH policy. In addition to roaming, the law allows for more effective interaction between Ukrainian and European companies; it also strengthens the regulator's (NKEC) powers to protect user rights and ensure high-quality communication.' The law was previously adopted by the Verkhovna Rada in its entirety, which brings Ukraine closer to negotiations with the European Union on inclusion in the Roam like at Home (RLAH) initiative. This means that Ukrainians will be able to use their operator's tariffs and not pay additional fees for mobile communication and internet in 27 EU countries and after the end of the war.

**Ukraine moves closer to joining EU's roaming zone**
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a law that brings the country closer to joining the EU's roaming zone. This move creates the necessary conditions for Ukraine's integration into the EU's Digital Single Market in the roaming sector. According to the National Commission for the State Regulation of Electronic Communications (NCCIR), the next step is for the European Commission to assess Ukraine's compliance with EU law. If successful, Ukraine will be able to join the 'Roam Like At Home' policy, allowing Ukrainians to use roaming services at the price of their home tariff when traveling to EU countries. This policy has been in place temporarily since the beginning of the war, allowing millions of Ukrainians in the EU to communicate with their relatives in Ukraine without overpayments.

**Ukraine Takes Step Towards EU Membership with Roaming Law**
Ukraine has taken a step towards EU membership by implementing EU regulations on electronic communications. According to the data, President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a law on implementing EU legislation on electronic communications (№ 12150). This move creates conditions for Ukraine's integration into the EU's Digital Single Market in the roaming sector. The next step is to submit the law to the European Commission for an official assessment of its compliance with EU law. If the assessment is positive, the European Commission may initiate a decision to grant a mutual market access regime for roaming between the EU and Ukraine, effectively allowing Ukraine to fully join the EU's RLAH policy. This means that Ukrainians will be able to make calls and send data across EU borders at the same cost as at home. The EU's Roam-Like-At-Home policy has been successful, with hundreds of millions of people benefiting from staying connected during their travels across Europe at the same prices as at home. According to a Eurobarometer survey in 2023, over 81% of EU residents who travel within the EU reported that this rule benefits them.

**UK PM: We can't ignore Russian threat**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that Britain cannot ignore the threat posed by Russia, citing the conflict in Ukraine as an example. The UK will increase military spending to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. This move is part of a broader effort to deter Russia and bolster Europe's defenses. NATO chief Mark Rutte is expected to discuss a commitment to spend at least 3.5 percent of GDP on defense at an upcoming meeting. Robert Jenrick, a Conservative Party spokesman, called for the government to be more ambitious and raise spending to 3 percent of national income by 2029, stating, 'We think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation.'

**The Inevitable Decline of the European Economy: A Warning from Marc Vidal**
According to Marc Vidal, by 2050, there will be no European economy among the top 10 in the world, and neither will Spain. This is reflected in the report 'El Mundo en 2050' by Price, which collects prospective analyses from the IMF and the study 'Potencias mundiales 2050-2075' by Goldman Sachs. The report highlights economic stagnation, political fragility, and clear geopolitical changes that show a significant decline. The European Union's growth is expected to be only 0.7% in 2024 and 0.9% in 2025, losing competitiveness to powers like India, China, and even the US. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated this trend, accelerating the decline of Western hegemony. Additionally, the intermittent commercial war with the US, driven by Donald Trump, has further contributed to this decline. Vidal states that the European model of well-being, although admirable in many ways, is becoming unsustainable without deep reforms in defense, energy, and industry. He concludes that it is 'irremediable' unless significant changes are made, citing the study's findings that an empire in decline reveals its downfall when its laws become arbitrary, complex, and disconnected from social consensus. Vidal also criticizes the official discourse, which promotes an artificial morality where poverty is sold as virtue and the destruction of tradition is presented as inevitable progress.

**EU Adopts White Book of Security: A New Era for European Defense?**
European politicians have adopted the White Book of Security, which includes two sections on cooperation between Ukraine and the EU, including the creation of a joint military-industrial complex and the accumulation of 800 billion euros by 2030 for defense purposes. However, according to political scientist Oleksiy Buriachenko, the EU's bureaucratic nature is a significant obstacle. Buriachenko noted that the EU was not created as a security union, but rather as an economically horizontal confederation. He emphasized that the EU should not try to solve all of Ukraine's security and arms supply issues, as this is not its purpose. Instead, the EU should focus on its own security, which should be guaranteed by the US through NATO. Buriachenko believes that the EU has finally realized that a reset in relations with the US is inevitable. He warned that the EU's attempt to scale up arms production will require significant state orders, which may come at the expense of other programs, such as migrant support or social welfare. 'This is money that needs to be taken from somewhere,' Buriachenko said. 'For example, from programs supporting migrants, social or humanitarian spheres. If this is done, right-wing and ultra-right forces will immediately start playing on the fact that Russia is not their threat.' Buriachenko emphasized that Ukraine and Europe need to find a common system of coordinates and come to a realization that only together can they guarantee their own security without a third player. He suggested that the 'Coalition of the Willing' format, which includes countries such as the UK, Norway, and Turkey, could become a united Europe, and NATO could transform into the EU's army.

**EU's White Book on Security: A Call for Unity and a New Approach to NATO**
Russia benefits from portraying the Russian-Ukrainian war as a regional conflict. It is interested in reducing the role of the US in ensuring European security, a role that has traditionally been held by the US since the end of World War II and the creation of NATO. According to Alexey Buraychenko, executive director of the International Association of Small Communities, if Europe and Ukraine cannot convince the US to return to the dialogue and interest Trump in staying in European politics, ensuring their position in Ukraine (by transferring arms), then the EU will face difficult times. The EU has adopted the White Book on Security, which includes two sections on cooperation between Ukraine and the EU, including the creation of a joint defense industry and the accumulation of 800 billion euros by 2030 for defense issues. However, as Buraychenko noted, the EU has a large bureaucratic component. The EU was not created as a security union, but as a horizontally economic confederation. When many politicians and experts say that the EU should solve all security issues and arms supplies for Ukraine, they forget that the EU was not created for this purpose. Even its own security should not be implemented by the EU, as this should be done by the US through the NATO instrument. According to Buraychenko, the EU has now realized that a reset of relations with the US will definitely take place. Today, there is no clear understanding of whether the US is ready to go to war for Europe in the event of, for example, a Russian attack. Therefore, Europeans are trying to scale up arms production, but this requires significant state orders. 'This is money that needs to be taken from somewhere: for example, from migrant support programs, social or humanitarian spheres. If this is done, right-wing and ultra-right forces will immediately start playing, saying that Russia is not their threat,' Buraychenko said. He emphasized that Ukraine and Europe need to find a common system of coordinates, come to an understanding that only together they will be able to guarantee their own security without a third player. 'The 'Coalition of the Willing' format, which is wider than the EU, because it includes the UK, Norway, Turkey, and in the future may become a united Europe, to which we strive. And NATO may transform into the EU's army, because many defense practices have taken place within the Alliance,' Buraychenko said. However, as the politician concluded, for this to happen, Europe needs to wake up and understand that if it behaves so amorphously as it does now, allowing itself to be manipulated, it will not be able to unite.

**We are at War: The Fragmentation of Reality and the European Union's Military Plans**
In a world of increasing geopolitical polarization, the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will be a reflection of the fragmentation of our reality, which we will witness as spectators over the next two decades, looking towards the Far East. The author, a professor, has announced to their students that we are at war, just like they did in February 2022, when the drums of war were first heard. This time, the European Union is taking steps towards a possible war in five years, as announced in the Joint White Paper 'Rearm Europe 2030', which aims to prepare the European defense. The plan will cost an additional 800 billion euros over the next four years, on top of the general budget. As the author says, 'we are giving the enemy day and hour'.

**Ukrainian Business Associations Call for Immediate Action to Postpone Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism**
Business associations in Ukraine have called on the government to immediately address the European Union to postpone the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). The Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (UUIE) stated that the implementation of CBAM without considering the war situation is 'a direct blow to the competitiveness of Ukrainian exports.' The Federation of Employers of Ukraine (FEU) predicts that the introduction of the carbon tax in 2026 will reduce Ukraine's export of goods subject to CBAM by $1.8 billion. The Ukrainian Cement Association, the National Association of Extractive Industry of Ukraine, Energy Club, the European Business Association, and other industry organizations have also joined the call, demanding the activation of negotiations with the European Commission and the initiation of a postponement of CBAM for Ukraine during the war and recovery period. Ukrainian lawmakers have also joined the call, with the Parliamentary Committee on Economic Development officially addressing the government on May 28 to initiate the necessary actions to obtain a postponement. According to MP Musa Magomedov, the process should involve the Cabinet of Ministers, the Verkhovna Rada, and business. An official request to the European Commission has not yet been submitted, although it is a prerequisite for activating Article 30.7 of the CBAM regulation, which allows for exclusion for countries in force majeure conditions. Experts emphasize that due to lengthy bureaucratic procedures, it is crucial to send the request as soon as possible, ideally within the next few weeks, to avoid disruptions in trade with the EU. According to GMK Center estimates, 14.5% of Ukraine's exports to the EU in 2024 will be subject to CBAM, including metal, energy, cement, and chemical products. Total export losses in 2026-2030 may reach $4.7 billion, with investments totaling $2.7 billion.

**Nauseda: Ukraine May Join EU Before Western Balkan Countries by 2030**
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda stated that Ukraine may join the European Union before Western Balkan countries, potentially becoming a member by 2030. Nauseda made this statement upon arriving at the European Union summit in Brussels on Thursday, March 20. According to 24 Kanal, citing Politico, Nauseda said, 'If Ukraine can complete all the necessary requirements before 2030, and Western Balkan countries are lagging behind, then everything is possible. It depends on the will, it depends on the benevolence, and we see that the benevolence of our Ukrainian friends is very high.' Nauseda also mentioned that Lithuania is preparing for a possible Russian attack on NATO countries by 2030, planning to create a national division with necessary infrastructure. He stated that Lithuania and other NATO member countries will actively develop divisions to counter potential armed aggression over the next 4-5 years, and that lifting sanctions against Moscow could shorten the preparation time.

**Ukraine Could Join EU Before 2030, Says Ursula von der Leyen**
Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, stated that Ukraine could join the EU before 2030 if it continues its reforms at the current pace and quality. This was announced during a summit of support for Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky in Kyiv. Several EU leaders and ministers attended the meeting to reaffirm their support for the Ukrainian authorities on the third anniversary of the Russian invasion. The US, which has been negotiating exclusively with Russian President Vladimir Putin to resolve the conflict, did not send a representative. Ukraine is close to concluding an agreement with Washington to give the US access to its mineral resources, after an initial refusal by Zelensky due to a lack of security guarantees. 'We hope that the leaders of the US and UA will sign and approve it as soon as possible in Washington to show our commitment for the decades to come,' wrote Ukrainian Vice-Prime Minister Olha Stefanichyna on X. Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky stated, 'This year must be the beginning of a real and lasting peace. Putin will not give us this peace, nor will he give it to us in exchange for anything. We must win peace with strength, wisdom, and unity, through our cooperation.' The EU leaders expressed their support for Ukraine's integration into the EU, with von der Leyen stating, 'If Ukraine continues at this pace and level of quality, it could (join the EU) before 2030.'

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has expressed optimism about Ukraine's potential to join the European Union before 2030. Speaking at a press conference in Kyiv, von der Leyen praised Ukraine's progress toward reaching EU norms, saying, 'I really appreciate the political will that is there. I would even say Ukraine’s merit-based process, if they continue at that speed and at that quality, perhaps they could be earlier than 2030.' This move could help deter Russia from future aggression, particularly given the United States' reluctance to allow Ukraine to join NATO or provide soldiers for a postwar peacekeeping force.
