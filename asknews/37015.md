**Norway becomes 55th nation to sign NASA Artemis Accords for peaceful space exploration**
Norway has become the 55th country to sign the NASA Artemis Accords, committing to peaceful space exploration. The signing ceremony took place on May 15 at the Norwegian Space Agency in Oslo, with Norway's Minister of Trade and Industry Cecilie Myrseth signing on behalf of the Norwegian government. According to the U.S. Department of State, the United States and Norway have a 'longstanding relationship in space' dating back to 1962. Acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro stated, 'We're grateful for the strong and meaningful collaboration we've already had with the Norwegian Space Agency. Now, by signing the Artemis Accords, Norway is not only supporting the future of exploration, but also helping us define it with all our partners for the Moon, Mars, and beyond.' The Artemis Accords aim to promote peaceful, cooperative space activity, echoing key concepts from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. However, the recent 'skinny budget' released by the White House slashes NASA's budget by nearly 25%, canceling the massive SLS rocket after Artemis 3 and scrapping Gateway, the lunar space station.

**Saudi Arabia Signs Agreement with NASA to Launch First Climate Satellite**
Saudi Arabia has signed a cooperative agreement with NASA to launch its first satellite for studying the climate, as part of the historic Artemis 2 mission. The new satellite, part of the 'Ndleb' program, aims to collect accurate data on solar activity and its effects on the Earth's magnetic field. According to the Saudi Space Agency, the satellite will support global scientific research, protect communication systems and satellites, and safeguard astronauts from space fluctuations. The project aligns with Saudi Vision 2030 goals, enhancing the country's position as a leader in space technology. This move represents a practical translation of the international Artemis agreement, signed by Saudi Arabia in July 2024, which promotes peaceful international cooperation in space exploration. This step also has a strategic and national dimension, contributing to the localization of space technologies within the Kingdom, increasing local content in technical industries, and developing Saudi cadres capable of designing and operating space systems, in line with Vision 2030 goals. The agreement was signed on the sidelines of US President Donald Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, as part of a series of agreements and deals in various fields. According to Al-Masdar newspaper, the new satellite is a key milestone in Saudi Arabia's space strategy, aiming to transform the country into a emerging space power that actively contributes to scientific knowledge production and expands the boundaries of scientific exploration for humanity.
