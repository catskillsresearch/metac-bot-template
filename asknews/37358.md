**June 2025 US Visa Bulletin: New Changes in Employment and Family-Based Green Card Categories**
The June 2025 Visa Bulletin, published by the US Department of State, presents significant changes in the availability of visas for immigrants seeking permanent residence. The impact is felt both within and outside the country, with movements that could accelerate or delay visa issuance depending on the country of origin and the category of application. The modifications in family categories were minimal, with only the F-4 category, corresponding to siblings of US citizens from India, experiencing a two-month advance in its priority dates. The other family categories remained unchanged. In terms of employment-based Green Card categories, the greatest advances were seen in EB-2 for Mexico, the Philippines, and 'All Other Categories', with nearly four months of progress. EB-1 and EB-5 did not experience any changes, and EB-4 reached its annual limit, remaining suspended until the fiscal cycle is renewed. The Visa Bulletin is an official monthly publication that allows applicants to know when they can submit their applications for a Green Card. It contains two key dates: the filing date, when beneficiaries can submit their applications, and the final action date, when immigration authorities can make a final decision. These dates vary depending on demand, country of origin, and migratory category, which can cause delays or advances.

**USCIS Announces Suspension of EB-4 Green Card Category Due to Annual Limit**
The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced that the EB-4 category of Green Card has reached its annual limit, affecting thousands of immigrants who were waiting to advance in their process towards permanent residence. According to the June 2025 Visa Bulletin, the EB-4 category, which is reserved for special immigrants, has exhausted its annual quota. This decision means that the Department of State will stop issuing new visas under this category until the next fiscal year cycle, which begins on October 1. This suspension applies to both those who are applying for their visa from abroad and those who are seeking to adjust their status from within the country. The announcement has put on hold hundreds of cases that were ready to move forward.

**State Department Advises Against Some Travel to the Philippines**
The U.S. State Department has issued an advisory warning U.S. residents to avoid traveling to the Sulu Archipelago and Marawi City in the Philippines due to 'crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping.'

The advisory for the Sulu Archipelago and Marawi City is a level four, or 'Do Not Travel,' while the advisory for the country as a whole is a level two. As Katherine Rodriguez noted, 'the city isn't exactly known as the safest in the country,' and the situation on the ground remains uncertain. Travelers are advised to have plans in place in case of an emergency.

**US Visa Application: New Appointment Dates for Those Who Apply Before June**
The US visa is an official document issued by the US Department of State that allows the holder to request entry into the country. It does not guarantee entry, but authorizes a person to present themselves at a port of entry, such as an airport or border crossing, where a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer will determine if they can enter. The main purpose of the visa is to control and regulate the entry of people into the United States. Each type of visa is designed for a specific purpose: tourism, business, studies, temporary employment, or permanent immigration. This allows US authorities to manage the flow of migration and ensure national security. However, the process of obtaining a visa can be complex and time-consuming, with wait times varying greatly depending on the country and city. For example, in 2025, some consulates in Latin America have wait times for a B1/B2 tourist visa exceeding 200 days, while others may have wait times of 60 to 90 days. The Department of State recommends starting the process several months in advance to avoid complications. With the 2026 FIFA World Cup approaching, many fans are planning their trip to the United States. If you are one of them and plan to apply for a US visa before June, you should know that the wait times still allow for anticipation of the high demand expected in 2026. The Department of State has an official platform where applicants can check the estimated time for a visa interview appointment. Although wait times vary by city, there are strategic options if you want to obtain your visa before June. For example, in Mexico, the wait times for visa appointments at some consulates are:

**US travel advisory for Philippines slammed**
Cagayan de Oro City Rep. Rufus Rodriguez has criticized the US travel advisory for the Philippines, calling it 'unfair' and urging the US to review the warning. Rodriguez said, 'This is an unfair, shotgun warning. There are certainly many places in our country that are safe to tourists. The United States should review this advisory. We do not deserve this unfair treatment from our No. 1 ally.' The US State Department has placed the Philippines under 'Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution' due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping, with some areas having increased risk such as the Sulu archipelago and Marawi City.

**Bangladeshi tribunal frames charges against 8 persons for atrocities during 2024 uprising**
A Bangladeshi tribunal has accepted charges against 8 individuals, including former Dhaka police commissioner Habibur Rahman Habib, for their alleged roles in mass killings and atrocities during the July 2024 uprising. The tribunal, headed by Justice M Golam Mortuza, set June 3 as the date for starting the hearing. According to the charges, Habib allegedly ordered subordinates to open fire on protesting crowds, while four of the accused are in jail and three are on the run. The move comes as government employees staged protests against a proposed ordinance that would make it easier for authorities to take punitive actions against them. The interim government, led by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, is facing several challenges, including reports of discord between the military and the government over the timeline for holding parliamentary elections and a proposed humanitarian corridor to Myanmar's rebel-held Rakhine state. The military has called for elections by December this year and has expressed reservations about the corridor issue. Yunus's government has also been criticized for its handling of 'mob justice' incidents, with troops being called out to maintain law and order. The advisory council, led by Yunus, has stated that they discussed the 'three primary responsibilities entrusted to the interim government - elections, reforms, and justice' in a recent meeting. 'The Council discussed how unreasonable demands, deliberately provocative and jurisdictionally overreaching statements, and disruptive programmes have been continuously obstructing the normal functioning environment and creating confusion and suspicion among the public,' the statement read. 'Despite all obstacles, the interim government continued to fulfil its responsibilities by putting national interests above group interests,' it added.

**US Updates List of Countries Under Level 4 Travel Advisory: 'Do Not Travel'**
The US Department of State has updated its list of countries under a Level 4 travel advisory: 'Do Not Travel', expanding it to 21 nations for 2025. This category, the highest in the Department of State's travel advisory system, indicates destinations where US citizens face grave risks such as terrorism, armed conflicts, kidnappings, violent crimes, or arbitrary detentions. The latest additions to the list are North Korea and Burkina Faso, with the US authorities issuing new travel advisories for both countries in April 2025, citing concerns over traveler safety and limited consular assistance in case of emergencies. The Department of State classifies its travel alerts into four levels, with Level 4 being the most severe, indicating that US citizens should avoid all travel to designated countries due to critical threats. The US government recognizes that it cannot guarantee the safety of its citizens in these territories and may have restricted or closed embassies or consulates due to local conditions. The Department of State recommends that US citizens consult the latest travel advisories before planning international trips, even for destinations with lower advisory levels, as specific risks such as natural disasters, disease outbreaks, or civil unrest may exist. For countries with a Level 4 advisory, it is advised not to travel under any circumstances, as consular assistance may be non-existent or severely limited. Additionally, travel insurance may deny coverage for destinations designated as high-risk.
