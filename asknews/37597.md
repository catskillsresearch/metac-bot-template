**Trump to Attend NATO Summit, EU Threatens Counter-Tariffs, Pentagon Warns of China Threat**
US President Donald Trump has announced that he will attend the NATO summit in June, despite previous uncertainty due to disagreements over defense spending among member states. Trump has been pressuring NATO partners to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP. The summit will take place on June 24-25 in The Hague, where leaders will discuss defense spending and other issues. Trump's decision to attend the summit comes after his administration announced plans to withdraw the nomination of Jared Isaacman as NASA administrator, citing concerns over his past support for Democratic candidates. The EU has threatened to impose counter-tariffs on the US in response to Trump's announcement of higher tariffs on steel imports. The Pentagon has warned of a growing threat from China in the Indo-Pacific region, with US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stating that China is preparing for a potential invasion of Taiwan. Trump has also announced plans to double tariffs on steel imports to 50% from 25%, effective from next Wednesday.

**Trump to Attend NATO Summit, Ending Speculation Over His Participation**
US President Donald Trump will attend the NATO summit in the Netherlands at the end of June, according to the White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. Trump had not previously confirmed his attendance, sparking speculation that he might skip the meeting due to disagreements over defense spending within the alliance. The summit, scheduled for June 24-25, will focus on defense spending, with Trump pushing for 5% of the gross domestic product to be allocated for defense. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has proposed a compromise: 3.5% for the military and 1.5% for infrastructure relevant to defense. Trump has been pressuring NATO partners for years, threatening to withdraw the US from the alliance in 2017 if they did not meet their commitment to invest at least 2% of their GDP in defense. Since then, he has claimed credit for increasing NATO partners' spending due to his pressure.

**Trump to attend NATO summit in The Hague**
US President Donald Trump will attend the NATO summit in The Hague in June, where defense spending will be a major topic of discussion. Trump has long criticized NATO partners for not paying their fair share, and has demanded that they spend 5% of their GDP on defense. However, none of the 32 NATO members currently meet this level. To address Trump's concerns, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has proposed a compromise deal, which includes 3.5% of GDP on direct defense spending by 2032 and 1.5% on broader security-related expenditures. This deal has received backing from key allies Germany and France, increasing its chances of being implemented. 'I can confirm he will be going to the NATO summit, yes,' said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. The summit will also discuss Ukraine's war with Russia, with President Volodymyr Zelensky confirming his country's invitation.

**Trump's June 2025 schedule: Summits, celebrations, and more**
President Trump's June 2025 schedule is packed with high-profile events, including the G7 leaders' summit in Canada, the NATO Summit in The Hague, and a multimillion-dollar parade in Washington DC to mark his 79th birthday and the US Army's 250th anniversary. According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Trump will attend the G7 summit from June 15 to 17. The summit marks the 50th anniversary of the first G7 Summit and will be held in Kananaskis, Alberta. Trump's visit comes at a time of strained US-Canada relations, but Canada's newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney has made a positive step by visiting the White House. Trump will also attend the 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague from June 24 to 26, where leaders will discuss adapting and strengthening the alliance in a rapidly changing security environment. Additionally, Trump has secured a historic second state visit to the United Kingdom, although no official date has been announced. 'The Netherlands is a founding member of NATO and makes critical contributions to the deterrence and defense of the Alliance,' said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. 'At our Summit, Leaders will make decisions to continue to adapt and strengthen our Alliance for a rapidly changing security environment. Together, we are stronger and safer in NATO.'

**Rutte Expresses Concerns Over NATO Summit Amid Tensions with Trump and Ukraine**
NATO Secretary General expects a positive outcome from the June summit in The Hague, without a public split on the Ukraine issue. However, Mark Rutte, a key figure at the summit, is concerned about the potential for disagreements between the US and its allies on Ukraine's future. Donald Trump's attendance at the summit may exacerbate tensions, as he has already expressed his willingness to attend, according to The New York Times. The relationship between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky is well-known, and it remains unclear whether Zelensky has received an invitation to a dinner marking the summit's opening. The first day of the summit will focus on defense spending among NATO members, and a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council may not take place. Zelensky may attend a parallel forum on defense industry instead. The 2025 NATO summit will be marked by the US's reduced role as the primary security guarantor of the EU and decreased support for Ukraine. Trump is also trying to improve relations with Russia after a period of cooling. According to military expert Michael Kofman, NATO members without the US will struggle to address defense industry issues and provide support to Ukraine simultaneously.

**Trump to Attend NATO Summit, Demands 5% Defense Spending from Member Countries**
US President Donald Trump has announced that he will attend the upcoming NATO summit in June, despite earlier reports that he was considering skipping the meeting. The summit will take place in The Hague, Netherlands, and will focus on increasing defense spending among NATO member countries. Trump has called for NATO member countries to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, up from the current 2% target. This has been met with resistance from some European countries, who are struggling to meet the current target. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has suggested that the new target could be implemented over a period of 7 years, starting from 2025. The US Ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, has stated that the 5% target is not just a number, but a necessity for the alliance's security. The summit will be a crucial test of NATO's unity and commitment to its member countries. The outcome of the summit will have significant implications for the alliance's future and the security of its member countries.

**Trump Threatens to Skip NATO Summit if European Members Don't Increase Defense Spending**
According to Der Spiegel, US President Donald Trump may skip the NATO summit in The Hague in June 2025 if European members of the alliance do not increase their defense spending. The American leader's warning is based on the reports of US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Wittaker, who has been emphasizing the need for European countries to increase their defense spending. As Der Spiegel notes, Wittaker's warnings are now being taken seriously by NATO members. The US has been pushing European countries to increase their defense spending from 2% to 5% of their GDP. If the financial issue is not resolved by June, Trump will not attend the summit in The Hague. Interestingly, only 23 out of 32 NATO members have reached the 2% GDP target in 2024, according to NATO's own statistics. The alliance acknowledges that significant increase in defense spending is necessary to ensure its own security.

**Polish Foreign Minister: Trump Committed to NATO's Article 5, Will Attend Summit in The Hague**
Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski stated on Friday that US President Donald Trump is still committed to upholding NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause and will attend the NATO summit in The Hague in June. NATO's Article 5 is one of the alliance's core principles, stating that an attack on any member state will be considered an attack on all member states. However, Trump's security policies previously raised concerns among Europeans about whether the US would fulfill this commitment. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reaffirmed at the NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels on Thursday that the US remains committed to NATO, while also emphasizing that member countries must significantly increase their defense spending. According to Reuters, when Sikorski was asked if he believed the US was still committed to defending NATO territory, he replied, 'Yes. President Trump has confirmed this to other leaders, and this commitment remains in effect, and as far as we know, President Trump will attend the summit in The Hague.' The Trump administration is pushing for NATO member countries to increase their military spending to 5% of their GDP, far exceeding the current 2% target. Although 23 member countries have reached or exceeded 2% last year, countries such as Belgium, Italy, and Spain still have not met the target. The 2025 NATO summit will be held from June 24 to 26 at the World Forum in The Hague, which is also the first time the Netherlands will host a NATO summit.
