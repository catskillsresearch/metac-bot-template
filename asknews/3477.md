**War Escalates to a New Level: Expert Expresses Concern Over AI's Impact on Global Security**
Political observer Gaziz Abishev expressed his surprise at the events in Russia and Ukraine, saying, 'If this were a computer game, the world would be left with nothing but admiration.' However, this is a real war with real human casualties and economic damage. Abishev noted that the world has long 'overcome its surprise' and now only 'sadly watches' as two once close nations 'methodically erase each other.' He also recalled that Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev raised the topic of the senselessness of wars in the digital age at the Astana International Forum. In an era of AI development, robotics, and biotechnology, it is strange to resolve problems on the battlefield. Last year, 52 countries were in a state of armed conflict, with economic losses from violence reaching $19 trillion, or 13.5% of the world's GDP. 'The greatest concern in the global situation is that it is in complete contradiction with new trends related to artificial intelligence, which is beginning to dominate, leading humanity to a fundamentally new and unknown reality, bringing new meanings and new assessments,' Tokayev said. In other words, as Abishev noted, the new digital reality, the widespread penetration of AI in the coming decades, will create a completely new global order: any language, ethnic, and cultural boundaries will be minimized in the virtual space, and even in real communication between people using nano-devices, the Internet, and AI architecture. 'Moreover, AI and robotics will totally change the labor market, shifting the focus in the development of countries. Consequently, strategic considerations in the field of national security will also change. And when all this happens, the key question will arise - for what are the current wars being fought? For what are thousands and thousands of people dying?' Abishev asked. He believes that Kazakhstan occupies a historically correct position in this sense. 'Minimizing conflictuality on the external perimeter, focusing on multilateral cooperation. Why waste people if the reasons for this will lose all meaning in the near historical perspective? It is better to spend resources on approaching this perspective than on senseless expenditure of human lives,' Abishev concluded.

**Anthropic Researchers Warn Of A 'Pretty Terrible Decade' Where AI Outpaces Robotics And People's Main Benefit Is They're 'Fantastic Robots' - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)**
Researchers from Anthropic, an AI startup backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, warn that artificial intelligence is about to upend white collar work around the world, potentially leading to a 'pretty terrible decade' where humans are valued primarily for their physical abilities. According to Sholto Douglas and Trenton Bricken, AI models are already capable of performing many computer-based jobs, and it's likely that white collar work will be automated within the next five years. They argue that it's financially justifiable to automate office tasks, even if it means 'hand spooning' every single task to the model, and that countries that don't prepare for this shift could be left behind. Douglas warned that countries without highly advanced AI models will have tough decisions to make, and advised governments to start investing in compute infrastructure, AI companies, and the broader tech ecosystem. 'Compute becomes the most valuable resource in the world,' he said. 'The GDP of your economy is dramatically affected by how much compute you can deploy.'

**World Economic Forum Warns of Global Economic Fragility**
The World Economic Forum's 'Chief Economists Outlook' report highlights growing concerns about the fragility of the global economy. Based on a survey of chief economists from the public and private sectors, the report notes that the state of the global economy will weaken significantly, with abrupt changes in US commercial policy being the main cause. The report also notes that the uncertainty persists despite a 90-day pause in the escalation of tariffs between the US and China. The 79% of surveyed economists share this view. The report also highlights that the risks are not limited to the US, with Europe showing signs of recovery driven by more expansive fiscal policies, especially in Germany. In China, the 5% growth target is met with skepticism, with the IMF reducing its projections to 4% due to internal and external factors affecting demand and the dynamism of the housing sector. In Latin America, the situation is equally challenging, with a 2% growth expectation for 2025, down from 2.4% in the previous year. The report also notes that the increasing fragmentation of the global economy is a growing concern, with 98% of economists expecting it to accelerate in the coming year. The report concludes that the uncertainty has become a structural feature of the global economy, with over 80% of surveyed economists rating it as 'very high' and only a slight majority expecting it to decrease in the next year. The areas most affected will be trade, GDP growth, and foreign direct investment. The report also highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to be a double-edged sword, with 45% expecting it to be disruptive in 2025, while 81% believe it can contribute between 1 and 10 percentage points to global growth in the next decade. However, its impact on employment is uncertain, with 47% anticipating net job losses and only 19% expecting net gains. The report concludes that AI can become the main driver of economic innovation if it is properly channeled, but also warns of the associated risks, such as market concentration, unemployment, increased inequality, and disinformation. The report recommends that governments and businesses prepare to integrate AI into their operations, with 89% of economists believing it is essential to invest in AI infrastructure and 75% seeing the need for public investment in training and labor retraining. At the business level, priorities include redesigning processes, improving data infrastructure, and strengthening cybersecurity.

**Is AI a Threat to Human Employment? The Truth No One Wants to Admit**
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is sparking a heated debate about its impact on human employment. While some warn of massive job losses and growing inequality, others see AI as a catalyst for innovation, creating new opportunities and enhancing human work. According to a 2023 McKinsey study, up to 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated by 2030. Real-world examples, such as tech company layoffs in 2024, suggest that AI-driven automation is already contributing to significant job cuts, with a 44% wave of job cuts reported. As AI continues to transform industries, it's essential to consider both sides of the argument and prepare for the future of work.

**Between opportunity and obsolescence: The human side of the AI revolution**
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the world of work, presenting both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, AI can enhance productivity and create new, higher-value roles, while also emerging as a powerful tool for learning and training. On the other hand, it generates uncertainty about the replacement of traditional jobs and the potential erosion of certain human skills. According to the World Economic Forum, approximately two-fifths of current workers' knowledge and skills may become obsolete by 2030, while three out of five workers will require some form of training during that same period to remain employable. To address this challenge, companies must invest in reskilling and upskilling programs, facilitate access to certifications or microcredentials, and design career paths that help workers at risk of automation move into in-demand roles. Ultimately, the impact of AI on human capability will depend on how we integrate it into our mental and organizational processes, and companies must take responsibility for updating their employees' skills and resisting the temptation of 'easy layoffs' in response to each technological advance.

**The Double-Edged Sword of AI: Opportunities and Challenges**
The debate about the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on society and the future of humanity is ongoing. Some experts, such as Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg, believe that AI will increase productivity, generate abundance, and support the resolution of complex problems, while others, like Yuval Noah Harari, are concerned about job loss, decreased critical thinking, and potential apocalyptic scenarios. Despite the uncertainty, there are data-driven insights that can be evaluated from a broad perspective. According to the World Economic Forum, automation has displaced 85 million jobs but created 97 million related to data, robotics, and clean energy, resulting in a net gain of 12 million jobs. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that AI will add $2.6 to $4.4 trillion to the global GDP annually, while PitchBook reports that a third of global venture capital in 2024 went to AI startups, with 52% annual growth. Additionally, the Epoch AI lab shows that the computing power used to train AI models doubles every six months, leading to rapid advancements. However, a global Adobe survey reveals that 83% of professionals already use AI, but 52% of Americans are more concerned than enthusiastic about AI, highlighting the need for education, digital infrastructure, and clear ethical frameworks to ensure that AI benefits humanity.

**AI Could Boost Global GDP by 15% by 2035, Says PwC Report**
According to a report by PwC, artificial intelligence (AI) could boost the global GDP by 15% by 2035. However, the report notes that the benefits of AI are not guaranteed and depend on its responsible deployment, clear governance, and consumer trust. In other scenarios analyzed by PwC, the incremental boost to the economy could be more moderate, at 8% or even 1% in a pessimistic scenario. The report also suggests that the sectors will reconfigure themselves to meet new needs, leading to the creation of new spaces or domains that will blur the traditional differences between sectors. For example, the rise of electric vehicles is bringing energy providers, battery manufacturers, technology companies, and many others into the mobility sector, allowing them to create value alongside automakers. However, the report notes that climate-related physical risks could limit the growth, with models suggesting that the global economy could be 7% smaller in 2035 if climate risks were not mitigated. PwC estimates that the increased adoption of AI could lead to a higher energy consumption by data centers, but this could be neutralized if 0.1% of each percentage point of growth generated by AI is dedicated to reducing energy intensity. PwC has launched a set of initiatives to help clients unlock the value of AI at scale, including its AI Operating System (OS), which enables businesses to connect intelligent agents in workflows up to 10 times faster than traditional methods. The company has also established the 'Network AI Academy' and has partnered with companies like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft to develop new AI initiatives.

**BRICS Countries to Drive Global Economic Growth, Experts Say**
Experts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predict that China, India, Indonesia, and Turkey will increase their shares in the world's GDP by 2029. Russia's share will slightly decrease from 2.95% to 2.71%. However, Russia's dynamics have improved compared to the previous IMF forecast in October 2023, which predicted a decrease to 2.6%. Developed Western countries will continue to grow, but at a slower pace than developing countries. According to Maxim Oreshkin, Deputy Head of the Russian Presidential Administration, economic growth over the next 30 years will be concentrated in countries with growing urbanization and GDP per capita, driven by increasing birth rates. India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Ethiopia have the highest potential for growth, with China and Russia also continuing to grow, albeit at a slower pace. The BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) will drive global economic growth, with their combined share of the world's GDP expected to reach 50% in the near future. Russia is a leader in civilian nuclear energy, China in robotics, and India in software development. Experts see opportunities for growth in technology development, including artificial intelligence, for both BRICS countries and Russia. Russia's Rosatom is working on 22 nuclear power plant projects in seven countries, and the country has a 40% share of the uranium enrichment market. Russia is also a leader in the development of small nuclear reactors, with 17 projects underway. The country has a significant number of researchers, with 428,900 people employed in research in 2020, ranking it fourth in the world after China, the US, and Japan. However, Russia ranks 34th in the number of researchers per 10,000 people employed in the economy. The increasing importance of human capital in the digital economy has led to a significant increase in the demand for skilled workers. Experts emphasize the need to invest in education and training, particularly in the development of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. Russia is one of the leading countries in this area, with a strong focus on education and research. The preservation of natural resources and the fight against climate change are also key areas for growth, with experts emphasizing the importance of developing a coordinated climate policy among BRICS countries. Climate solutions can have a positive impact on global economic development, with every dollar invested in environmental management creating 8.2 'green' jobs, compared to 3.5 jobs in traditional infrastructure. For Russia, the key risks associated with global climate change include increased flooding and forest fires, the spread of diseases carried by insects, and the accelerated aging of buildings and infrastructure. However, experts also see opportunities for Russia to benefit from the growth of its natural and environmental assets, including water, soil, and forest resources.

**UN Development Report 2025: AI and Human Development**
The United Nations Development Programme (PNUD) has released the Human Development Report 2025, which shows that the global Human Development Index (IDH) has reached a new record, but with a worrying trend: the growth of IDH is the slowest since the beginning of the historical series, 35 years ago. The report highlights that the disparities between countries with high and low IDH, which had been decreasing for decades, have increased since 2020. 'The wounds generated by the falls in the global IDH between 2020 and 2021 have not yet healed, and the recovery since then may be losing steam. A few years ago, we were on the path to living in a world with a very high IDH by 2030,' says a passage from the report. 'This world has been postponed for several years based on the trend from 2021 to 2024. Now, it is projected to be postponed for decades.' The report notes that the accumulated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, global inflation, wars, and technological changes are making it difficult for developing countries to recover. According to the report, despite the global IDH value being projected to reach a record in 2024, the increase will be the lowest since the beginning of the records 35 years ago. The report also highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to amplify human capabilities, but also to deepen existing inequalities. The adoption and impact of AI will depend less on the technology itself and more on social and political choices made now - about where, how, and by whom it will be used. The report emphasizes the importance of considering the user side of AI, focusing on how people are using this technology and how it can amplify or weaken human autonomy. 'The value of AI for human development is not in knowing if machines are intelligent, but in how they can amplify human intelligence,' highlights the report. The report concludes with a warning: no future path is written in the stars, and technology alone will not guarantee development. To make AI an ally and not a vector of inequality, it is necessary to adopt policies that stimulate collaboration between humans and machines, value critical and inclusive education, and protect workers and social institutions.

**UNDP Report: Human Development Progress Slows Down to Lowest Level in 35 Years**
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has released its new report on human development around the world, stating that progress in human development has slowed down to its lowest level in 35 years. The report highlights that instead of experiencing a sustainable recovery after the exceptional crisis period of 2020-2021, human development has shown a weak progress. The report notes that the expected slight increase in global human development this year is the lowest increase since 1990. According to the report, about 60% of people surveyed expressed their hope that artificial intelligence will provide new job opportunities. The report monitors progress in human development through a set of indicators known as the Human Development Index (HDI), which includes achievements in the fields of health and education, as well as income levels. The report points out that the expectations for 2024 reveal a setback in human development in all regions of the world. Achim Steiner, Director of the UNDP, said that in addition to the alarming rate of slowing down global development, there is a widening gap between rich and poor countries, emphasizing that with the tightening of global pressures on traditional development paths, it is necessary to take decisive actions to get the world out of the prolonged stagnation in progress. He added that if the slow progress of 2024 becomes the new normal, the achievement of the target of high human development by 2030 will be delayed for decades, making the world less secure, more divided, and more vulnerable to economic and environmental shocks. The report warns that the challenges of development facing low-HDI countries are extremely serious, driven by increasing trade tensions, worsening debt crisis, and increasing unemployment. The report emphasizes that in the midst of these global disturbances, it is urgent to explore new ways to drive development, pointing out that with the rapid progress of artificial intelligence in many aspects of life, it is necessary to consider its developmental potential, where new capabilities emerge almost daily. The report shows that people around the world are realistic and optimistic about the change that artificial intelligence can bring, and it indicates that half of the participants in the new survey believe that their jobs can be automated, while six out of ten believe that artificial intelligence will positively affect their job prospects, providing opportunities for jobs that may not exist today. The report highlights that only 13% of survey participants fear that artificial intelligence will lead to job loss, while 70% in low- and middle-HDI countries expect artificial intelligence to increase their productivity, and one-third expect to use it in education, health, or work in the coming year, making the gap in electricity and internet access even more pressing, emphasizing that access alone is not enough, as the real gap will depend on the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in complementing and enhancing what people do. The report calls for a human-centered approach to artificial intelligence, which has the ability to redesign development approaches fundamentally, pointing out that the survey results show that people around the world are ready for this type of reboot. The report identifies three key areas of work, including building an economy that collaborates with artificial intelligence rather than competing with it, integrating human roles in the complete life cycle of artificial intelligence from design to deployment, and updating education and health systems to meet the requirements of the 21st century. Pedro Conceição, Director of the Human Development Report Office at the UNDP, emphasized that the choices made by the world in the coming years will determine the legacy of this technological transformation in human development. He added that through the right policies and a focus on human beings, artificial intelligence can be a bridge to new knowledge, skills, and ideas, enabling everyone from farmers to small business owners.

**Global economic growth to average at 3.1% in next 5 years: IMF**
According to Nigel Clarke, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global economic growth is expected to average around 3.1 percent in the next five years, below the pre-pandemic level of 3.7 percent. Clarke stated, 'Global growth is steady but underwhelming. Our five-year ahead growth forecast remains at 3.1 percent -- well below the pre-pandemic average of 3.7 percent.' He emphasized the importance of structural reforms to boost productivity and ensure medium-term growth, particularly in aging societies and emerging markets. Clarke also highlighted the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost global gross domestic product growth between 0.1 and 0.8 percentage points per year in the medium term. He noted that effective measures should be taken to strengthen the private sector and create an environment that could help them thrive. The IMF has created a new Advisory Council on Entrepreneurship and Growth to help countries develop ideas on easing regulatory barriers, adapting tax systems, and incentivizing long-term savings to boost innovation.

**Only Global Growth Will Reflect True Value of AI: Microsoft CEO**
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has emphasized the importance of global growth generated by artificial intelligence (AI) over the hype surrounding the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Speaking to podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Nadella said that the real value of AI will be reflected in a boost to GDP, citing the need for growth rates of 10%, 7%, or 5% in the developed world. He compared this to the Industrial Revolution, saying that AI needs to bring about a similar level of growth to be truly valuable. Nadella's views contrast with those of OpenAI, which has been racing to develop AGI. Nadella also addressed concerns about AI replacing human jobs, saying that it should act as a facilitator for productivity rather than replacing 'cognitive labour'. His comments come at a time when thousands of people have been laid off in favor of AI, and experts have warned about the potential for AI to cause economic harm.

**Professions of the Future: Jobs with the Highest Growth Potential in the Next 5 Years**
A World Economic Forum report highlights significant changes in the job market projected until 2030, emphasizing the growing demand for certain careers and skills. While some professions are gaining space, others are at risk, either in declining sectors or in functions where artificial intelligence is replacing the need for human professionals. According to the report, 92 million jobs will be eliminated by 2030, while 170 million new positions will be created, resulting in a net gain of 78 million jobs. The following positions are expected to grow in the next five years, according to the World Economic Forum: However, some professionals are threatened by the advances of artificial intelligence. A recent report indicates that global banks may cut up to 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years as AI takes over tasks currently performed by humans. Recent changes in the job market suggest that the World Economic Forum's optimism may be exaggerated, especially regarding the impact of artificial intelligence and automation on software developers, designers, and other technology careers. As with any projection, only time will tell. In the technology sector, companies like Meta are restructuring their teams in response to AI advancements. CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to lay off around 5% of the team and replace them with AI solutions. Other companies may follow the same strategy. The question remains: how will this trend develop in the next five years? Systems of AI are already capable of performing complex data analyses, legal research, and even aspects of medical diagnosis, traditionally occupied by highly qualified professionals. As a result, administrative and corporate jobs are losing space. In light of these changes, the World Economic Forum's predictions may underestimate the disruptive potential of AI in jobs. Although new categories of work may emerge, the transition may cause significant displacement and layoffs, requiring major efforts in requalification and adaptation. Nevertheless, some professions and sectors are expected to remain immune to automation and continue to offer good prospects. These functions are increasingly susceptible to automation, reinforcing the need for continuous updating and development of skills. To ensure employability in the future, it is essential for professionals to invest in qualification and adapt to new market demands.
