**Keir Starmer warns against the risk of turning UK into an 'island of foreigners'**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has promised to 'significantly' reduce the number of foreign nationals admitted to the country annually and end the 'failed experiment of open borders' applied by successive Conservative governments after the Brexit victory in 2016. The net legal immigration almost reached the one million mark in the 12 months up to June 2024, with the vast majority coming from India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and other non-EU countries. Starmer emphasized the importance of regulations that 'guide us towards our rights, but also our responsibilities and the obligations we owe to each other.' 'Without them, we risk becoming an island of foreigners, not a nation walking together towards the future,' he said. The Labour government plans to strengthen the legal pathway for deporting not only foreign nationals convicted of prison sentences, but also those convicted of lesser crimes. The new rules, outlined in a White Paper on Immigration published on Monday, propose extending the minimum period from five to ten years that a non-British national must reside in the UK and contribute to the tax system before applying for citizenship. The reform aims to 'regain control' of the borders, according to Starmer, who has adopted the slogan that contributed to the success of the Brexit campaign in the EU referendum and Boris Johnson's massive electoral victory. 'All areas of the immigration system will be made tougher, including work, family, and studies, so we have more control,' he said. Under the Labour government, the immigration system will be 'controlled, selective, and fair,' governed by 'common sense and control of our borders,' Starmer added. He ruled out abandoning the European Convention on Human Rights, which is demanded by the Conservative right and the rising populist party of Nigel Farage, Reform UK. 'I don't think it's necessary,' he replied in the meeting with the media. 'International treaties that we have signed have provided the basis for the agreements we have closed on illegal migration,' he said in reference to the new ties secured with EU partners in the fight against human trafficking mafias. The immigration reform includes new language requirements for visa applicants and their dependent family members, as well as restrictions on the hiring of foreign social workers and other low-wage job candidates.

**Farage's Reform Overtakes Tories as the Opposition Party for Voters: Poll**
A recent Ipsos survey has found that the Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage, is now seen as the main opposition to the Labour government, with 37% of the public viewing them as the most likely to lead the next government. This is a significant shift since December 2024, when the Conservative Party was seen as the main opposition. The survey also found that 39% of the public believe Nigel Farage is the most likely candidate to become the next prime minister, compared to just 25% for Tory leader Kemi Badenoch. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Starmer's ratings have slumped, with 57% of voters expressing disappointment with the Labour government, and 43% predicting a leadership change before 2029. Farage has vowed to 'abolish' the Net Zero green agenda and 'revive our North Sea oil and gas industry' if he becomes prime minister. He also promised to 'ban two-tier justice' and foster a 'meritocracy where people are judged by what they give, not by what they take.' Farage wrote, 'I will repay those who put their trust in me. I will not let the country down. If there is one lesson that was given by the historic election results on May 1, it is that change can happen via the ballot box.'

**Boris Johnson reckons he could swoop in to rescue Tories when Reform 'self-destructs' - Daily Star**
Boris Johnson's allies are suggesting that he could make a comeback as Conservative Party leader after the party's recent local election losses. A poll found that Johnson was the only potential leader who could lead the party to higher opinion poll numbers than Nigel Farage's Reform party. An ally said, 'Boris is convinced that the wheels will come off the Reform bandwagon within three years, and then he would come back as leader.' Luke Tryl, author of the poll, said, 'As the Conservatives grapple with their survival, it does seem Boris Johnson might be part of the answer.' Meanwhile, cabinet ministers are expecting a partial U-turn by Chancellor Rachel Reeves on winter fuel payment cuts, with one minister saying, 'I think Rachel might ultimately bow to pressure to save her job.'

**UK Considers Tightening Visa Regulations Amid Rising Migration Concerns**
The UK government is considering tightening visa regulations to reduce the number of migrant workers entering the country through legal channels. According to the immigration white paper, the London authorities will introduce a new bachelor's degree requirement for technical visa applicants and limit the number of low-skilled worker visas. The Home Office announced on November 11 that it will appoint a working group to identify industries that rely heavily on foreign labor. The Home Office stated that one of the measures will be to issue low-skilled worker visas with a time limit only if there is clear evidence of labor shortages and employers commit to strengthening domestic talent training and recruitment. The department will explain the related plans when the white paper is published in Parliament on December 12. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised to reduce the number of migrants in response to concerns about the growing pressure on public services. This issue also sparked protests and right-wing violence after the Labour Party took office last summer. Since the previous Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government introduced the technical labor visa program in 2020, the number of related visas has increased by two times. The program was originally intended to strengthen border control after Brexit. From June 2023 to 2023, the UK's net migration reached a record high of 906,000. The number of permanent residents in the UK grew by 80% from 2021 to 2024, and the number of family members increased by 360% from 2021 to 2023. Critics argue that the UK government has not considered the impact of immigration on businesses and has not effectively prevented visa holders from being exploited, such as being trafficked or enslaved, especially in the care industry. Conservative Party Home Affairs Spokesman Philip said that the current measures are not sufficient to cope with the surge in legal immigration.

According to an ally, Johnson is convinced that Nigel Farage's party will struggle to deliver in areas where they have won power and that voters will tire of their candidates. This prediction has sparked rumors of Johnson's potential return to politics, following the Conservatives' poor performance in the local elections earlier this month.

Boris Johnson's allies believe he will return as leader when Reform self-destructs in three years. An ally said, 'Boris is convinced that the wheels will come off the Reform bandwagon within three years – that they will be found wanting in the areas where they have won power, and voters will tire of all the fruitcakes and loonies they have in their ranks.' However, not all of his friends are convinced that Reform will be a flash in the pan. Boris Johnson has publicly expressed confidence in Kemi Badenoch's leadership, but demoralized activists are talking up his chances of a comeback. A source added, 'He appears to be less able to make inroads with Labour and especially Lib-Dem voters, and his negatives here might make it hard for him to win an election.' Johnson was ousted three years ago due to the Partygate saga and sinking ratings. When asked about his plans, he said, 'I've got as much of a chance of returning to Parliament as I have of being decapitated by friends, locked in a disused fridge or being reincarnated as an olive, or whatever else it was I used to say.'

**UK's Starmer Announces Shift in Migration Policy**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a shift in the country's migration policy, aiming to regain control over the borders of the UK. He plans to introduce a new law that will tighten the immigration system in all areas, including work, family, and education. The government wants to require better English language skills for migrants and set the minimum education level for immigration to a bachelor's degree. Additionally, it will take 10 years, instead of 5, to be eligible for British citizenship. The recruitment of foreign workers in the healthcare sector will also be restricted, and the training of local healthcare professionals will be increased. On the other hand, the government plans to improve the entry opportunities for highly skilled and well-educated foreign workers. Starmer used the slogan 'Take back control!' in his speech, which was originally used by Nigel Farage, the leader of the Reform UK party. He stated that the previous conservative governments failed to reduce immigration between 2019 and 2023, and the net migration increased fourfold, reaching almost 1 million in 2023. He promised to reduce immigration during his term and take further steps if necessary. The Labour Party's policy is to reduce immigration, which is a major concern for the party, according to Starmer. 'I do this because it is fair and because I believe in it,' he said. The current immigration policy, he argued, risks making the UK 'an island of strangers.' The think tank British Future pointed out that a recent population survey showed that the British public's dissatisfaction is not directed against foreign care workers, but against illegal immigrants. The Scottish National Party (SNP) criticized the measures as not being in Scotland's interest, where immigration is welcomed. The Greens also joined the criticism, while the conservative opposition leader Kemi Badenoch stated that the Labour government has rolled back some of the Tory measures and that they do not go far enough. Critics from the British healthcare sector argued that the low wages are the reason why people are deterred from taking the jobs, and that they are already trying to train and recruit local workers. The announced measures will further burden the sector. The Labour-affiliated organization Stand-up-to-Racism called for a protest rally in response to Starmer's announced measures.

**UK Tightens Immigration Rules to 'Significantly' Reduce Numbers**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced plans to tighten immigration rules, aiming to 'significantly' reduce the number of immigrants arriving in the country. The proposals include English language tests for all visa applicants and their adult dependents, as well as a longer path to permanent residency. Starmer stated that the UK has a 'problem of immigration or migration liquidity' and that the number of immigrants has quadrupled since 2019, reaching a record of nearly one million in 2023. He claimed that this is 'almost the size of the city of Birmingham, the second-largest city in the UK.' Starmer said, 'This is not control, it's chaos.' The measures are aimed at reducing legal migration, which accounts for the majority of migration to the UK. The plan does not address illegal immigration, with 11,516 people having crossed the Channel to the UK by boat so far this year. The government has not set a target number, but Starmer promised that the migration balance will 'significantly' decrease. He said, 'We will finally regain control of our borders.' The changes will make it harder for skilled workers to obtain a visa, reverting to the stricter requirements in place before the Boris Johnson government. However, the government will expand the eligibility for the 'high potential individual' visa, doubling the number of universities where candidates can obtain a qualified degree. The number of research internships will also increase, and the government aims to make it easier for 'top scientific and design talents' to come to the UK using the global talent visa. Immigrants will typically have to reside in the UK for 10 years before they can apply for indefinite leave to remain, double the current period of five years. There will be a faster path for 'highly qualified and high-contribution' individuals with certain jobs, with details to be defined after consultation.

**Badenoch launches review into Reform's election drubbing of Tories**
Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative Party, has launched a review into the party's local election drubbing, where they lost control of every single local authority they were defending. Badenoch stated that the party must 'absolutely earn its place' in British politics and that there isn't a day to waste in making improvements. The review will focus on the party's activities, communications, campaigning, and strategy, and will involve input from every single MP, peer, councillor, candidate, and member. Badenoch said, 'The electorate are frustrated with mainstream politics, and Reform and the Lib Dems are on the rise. But we cannot be complacent and expect the voters to come back to us.' The review is expected to report back to Badenoch by the end of June.

**Japanese MP Muneo Suzuki on Putin's Diplomatic Power**
Japanese MP Muneo Suzuki has stated that the ball is now in Ukraine's court, and expressed his hope that Kiev will make a 'wise' decision. Suzuki wrote in his blog that Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal to hold direct talks with Kiev and his lack of response to the demand for a 30-day ceasefire demonstrates his 'diplomatic power'. Suzuki noted that on May 10, leaders from the UK, Germany, France, and Poland joined Ukraine in demanding an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, but Putin did not mention it, instead advocating for direct dialogue with Ukraine. 'We can feel the diplomatic power of President Putin', Suzuki said. Suzuki also recalled that Putin had planned to sign the Istanbul agreement in April 2022, but then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson traveled to Kiev and prevented the agreement from being concluded with Ukraine. 'When we observe these trends, we can only hope for a return to the basics', Suzuki stated. 'The ball is in Ukraine's court. I sincerely hope that a wise and correct decision will be made for an immediate ceasefire', Suzuki concluded.

Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the Conservative Party is in a 'tough spot' but will 'recover' and the 'goal is really wide open' for the next general election. Johnson praised party leader Kemi Badenoch, saying she is an 'original thinker' who 'just needs time to get going'. He urged her to 'keep going' and suggested that the party will regain popularity due to the public's dissatisfaction with the current government by 2028-2029. Johnson stated, 'The Tories are going to recover. Of course they will.' He believes the public will become 'completely fed up' with the current government's 'high tax, high regulation, massively woke' policies. Badenoch had previously apologized to defeated councillors and acknowledged the party has 'a big job to do to rebuild trust with the public'.

**Boris Johnson is only Tory leader who can beat Farage's Reform: poll**
A new poll by More in Common suggests that the only way the Conservatives can defeat Nigel Farage's Reform UK is if Boris Johnson returns as leader. The survey found that both Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick would lose to Farage, with Badenoch being less popular with voters than Jenrick. The party is currently languishing third in most opinion polls behind Labour and Reform, which took a significant chunk of the Tories' council base in the local elections. Former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith warned that swapping leaders so soon would make the party a laughing stock, calling those who think another leadership election is the answer 'deluded'. Badenoch has only been in charge for six months and is under pressure to reverse the party's fortunes after the disastrous local elections.

**BORIS JOHNSON: The Tories CAN win the next election - here's how...**
Boris Johnson believes the Conservative party has a good chance of winning the next election due to the Labour government's extreme vulnerability. He argues that Labour's policies, such as massive public sector pay increases, tax rises, and a jihad on the private sector, have created a mess with the economy. Johnson also criticizes Labour's handling of immigration, saying they are 'hopeless' at stopping the small boats and tackling illegal immigration. He believes the public is fed up with Labour's 'woke' policies and their lack of strategy for growth. Johnson thinks the electorate will choose the Conservatives in 2028 because they are the only party that can fix immigration, level up the country, invest in skills, cut taxes, and boost growth and productivity. He also believes that the Conservative party, under Kemi Badenoch, has the original mind and instinct to take the country in the right direction. 'This Labour government is so bad, so misguided, so fundamentally out of tune with what the public want, that in 2028, or whenever we have the next election, I think there is a real chance of a tipping point,' Johnson writes. 'I mean a 1979 moment, when the public decide with a great roar that they have had enough of Labour tax and spend, and the unions, and wokery in general, because they can see the damage it is doing.'

**'Boris Johnson will return to politics - if Donald Trump can do it so can he'**
Boris Johnson, the former UK Prime Minister, believes he can return to politics if Donald Trump can do it. He wants to ensure Labour, led by Sir Keir Starmer, does not win another term in power. Johnson argues that Labour's landslide victory was due to a low share of the vote (34%), and that the party is now unpopular. He believes that Labour's time in power will focus minds and make them more accountable. Johnson also shares his views on various politicians, including Jess Phillips and Ed Miliband, and expresses his support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia. He has no regrets about the UK's decision to leave the EU and believes it has saved billions of pounds. Johnson is fascinated by American politics and admires Trump's commitment to his voters. He would recommend a career in politics to his children, but warns that it requires thick skin. He will decide whether to stand for election again if the Conservatives show they are serious about winning.

Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson could make a comeback to Parliament as the Conservative candidate in a Runcorn and Helsby by-election, according to his ally Jacob Rees-Mogg. The seat's current MP, Mike Amesbury, has been sentenced to ten weeks in prison after admitting to punching a constituent in a 3am assault. Rees-Mogg predicts that Johnson could win the by-election, but notes that it would require an alliance to defeat Labour, potentially involving Conservatives and Nigel Farage's Reform UK joining forces. As Rees-Mogg said, 'an alliance to defeat Labour' would be necessary for a Conservative victory.

**Jacob Rees-Mogg tips Boris Johnson for sensational political comeback in by-election nightmare for Keir Starmer**
Jacob Rees-Mogg suggests that Boris Johnson could make a sensational political comeback in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, which could be a nightmare for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. Rees-Mogg, a former Cabinet member under Johnson, believes that Johnson could 'easily be the beneficiary' of a by-election if he throws his name into the hat. Kelvin MacKenzie, a former Sun editor, claims that Johnson would 'win by a mile' if he were to run. However, a Johnson ally says that he will only return to politics if he thinks he can offer something to the Tory Party, which is unlikely. Reform UK is demanding a by-election in the Cheshire seat, which they believe is their to win. Ex-Tory chairman Jake Berry says that the Conservative Party won't stand aside in a major by-election, but thinks that Reform UK can win.
