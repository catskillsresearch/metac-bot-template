**Crisis deepens as glaciers vanish, droughts intensify**
Recent climate change has led to devastating consequences, including the collapse of a massive glacier in southern Switzerland, droughts in northwest England, and the loss of three-quarters of the world's glaciers if climate change continues unchecked. A new study warns that if global temperatures rise to 2.7C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, 76% of current glacier mass will be erased, but if warming is held to the Paris Agreement's 1.5C target, 54% of glacial mass could be preserved. According to co-lead author Lilian Schuster, 'every tenth of a degree of additional warming matters,' and the study's release comes as Swiss authorities monitor flood risks following the collapse of the massive Birch Glacier. The loss of glaciers can have profound ripple effects, from disrupting tourism economies to eroding cultural heritage, and around 25% of current sea-level rise is attributed to glacier melt.

**Scientists Predict Sea Level Rise and Irreversible Consequences Due to Glacier Melting**
A group of international scientists from Switzerland, the US, Belgium, and other countries have concluded that if current warming trends continue, three-quarters of the Earth's glacier mass will disappear by 2100, causing a 23 cm sea level rise and other irreversible consequences. The study, published in the journal Science, highlights the situation in Alaska, where up to 69% of the glaciers could disappear, despite the region having the third-largest glacier reserve in the world (16,246 gigatons). Even in the best-case scenario, Alaska would lose 41% of its ice, and global losses would be 47%. Unlike previous studies, which were limited to 2100, the new modeling considers the period until the glaciers reach a state of 'equilibrium' - in the case of Alaska, this would take 330 years. The study involved 21 scientists from 10 countries, using eight different climate models to analyze 200,000 glaciers. The scientists believe that even if warming stops, glaciers will continue to melt for hundreds of years due to 'climate inertia'. They consider the current decade critical for taking measures to preserve the Earth's cryosphere.

**Scientists in Panic: Planet Faces Catastrophic Consequences Due to Ice Loss**
A group of international scientists from Switzerland, the US, Belgium, and other countries have concluded that if the current rate of warming continues, three-quarters of the Earth's ice mass will disappear by 2100, resulting in a 23 cm rise in sea levels and other irreversible consequences. The study, published in the Science journal, notes that the situation in Alaska is particularly alarming, where up to 69% of the ice could disappear, despite the region having the third-largest ice reserve in the world (16,246 gigatons). Even under an optimal scenario, Alaska would lose 41% of its ice, with global losses reaching 47%. Unlike previous studies, which were limited to 2100, the new modeling considers a period of up to 330 years to reach 'equilibrium' for Alaska's ice. The study involved 21 scientists from 10 countries, using eight different climate models to analyze 200,000 ice formations. The researchers emphasize that even if warming stops, ice will continue to melt for hundreds of years due to 'climate inertia.' They stress that the current decade is critical for taking measures to preserve the Earth's cryosphere.

**Indonesia has more people than Russia, Canada, Australia & Germany put together**
According to the UN projections for the year 2100, Indonesia is expected to surpass the combined population of Russia, Canada, Australia, and Germany. By 2100, African countries such as Congo, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Egypt are expected to form more than 10% of the global population. In contrast, China is expected to lose nearly half its people by the end of the century, while Russia and Japan are also in demographic decline. As the author notes, 'a lot of demographic dividend is yet to be realized' in countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nigeria, which are currently ranked lowly in terms of GDP.

**Toulouse Faces a Future of Extreme Heat: A Call to Action**
A recent report by Météo France confirms the alarming perspectives of a 4°C global temperature increase by 2100, with a mean annual temperature of 40°C and records of up to 50°C by 2050. This will lead to more frequent and longer-lasting droughts, potentially lasting 4-5 months in the northern half of France and over 7 months in the Mediterranean regions. The risk of forest fires will also increase, affecting the entire country. Jean-Michel Soubeyroux, co-author of the report and director adjoint scientifique of Météo France, warns that the Toulouse region will experience more intense and frequent heatwaves, and urges the need to develop a culture of risk management and adapt the environment to these changes. He suggests that the city should be designed to be more aerated and less mineral, with more green spaces and utilizing the Garonne river for cooling. Soubeyroux remains optimistic, stating that the report is 'an invitation to action' rather than a catastrophist prediction.

**Toulouse Faces Rising Temperatures and Water Scarcity by 2100**
Météo France has released a report predicting a significant increase in temperatures in France by 2100, with a general rise of 4°C and records of heat reaching up to 50°C by 2050. The region of Toulouse is expected to experience temperatures above the national average, with more frequent and intense heatwaves. Jean-Michel Soubeyroux, co-author of the report and director adjoint scientifique of Météo France, warns that the city of Toulouse must adapt to these changes by developing a culture of natural risks and preserving water resources. 'La ville que l'on construit aujourd'hui sera en grande partie encore là en 2100. Nos règles d'aujourd'hui doivent donc intégrer dès à présent la contrainte du + 4 °C', he says. Soubeyroux also suggests that the city should rethink its urban planning, reducing the urban sprawl and increasing the use of nature and the Garonne river to provide cooling. 'Il faut ainsi être attentifs aux forêts proches de Toulouse, comme Bouconne, à l'ouest. Mais il y a aussi les pluies diluviennes qui accentuent l'érosion des sols.' The report is not a call for alarm, but rather an invitation to action, according to Soubeyroux.

**Most of Western Canada's glaciers 'doomed' to disappear, researchers find**
A new study has found that Western Canada's glaciers are 'doomed' to disappear over the coming decades due to climate change. Even if warming stops today, the southern half of B.C. is expected to lose nearly 75% of its alpine ice. If Earth's average temperatures rise 2.7 degrees C by 2100, the loss rises to 98%, near annihilation levels. Harry Zekollari, the study's lead author, said, 'The committed loss is almost 80%. So our results indicate that, unfortunately, most of the glaciers in Western Canada are doomed to be lost even without any additional warming.' Lilian Schuster, a co-author, said, 'There is still a small hope: Under very ambitious climate mitigation efforts, some glacier ice could still be saved.'

**South Africa under siege: AI reveals climate change's terrifying toll**
Auto & General has released powerful imagery to visualize what South Africa could look like by 2100 if global warming continues unchecked. The initiative, which uses predictive data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and AI-generated visuals, highlights the distinct vulnerabilities facing each region. According to Obakeng Moloisane, Executive Head: Distribution at Auto & General, 'The impacts of climate change are not uniform across South Africa.' Moloisane advises homeowners to understand their regional risks, implement location-specific protections, review insurance coverage based on regional threats, and consult their insurer. The campaign aims to empower homeowners with the knowledge to take proactive steps to protect their properties and secure the right insurance coverage. 'Auto & General recognizes that climate change presents distinct challenges for different regions of South Africa,' Moloisane continues. 'Our campaign is designed to support our customers across all provinces, ensuring they are insured for their unique climate risks.'

**40% of glaciers "are doomed" even if we were to stop global warming and sea levels would rise by 10 centimeters**
Even if global warming were to stop, 39% of the world's glacier mass would still disappear, and sea levels would rise by over 10 centimeters, according to a study led by Harry Zekollari. The study, which simulated the effects of current climate policies, found that glaciers would continue to melt for centuries, even without additional warming. 'Most glacier studies stop at the year 2100, which is problematic when simulating the long-term impact of current climate policies, given the glaciers' long-term response over time,' explains Harry Zekollari. The study also found that saltwater can more easily penetrate freshwater aquifers, affecting the supply in coastal areas. 'The decisions we make today will resonate for centuries,' Zekollari notes. The study was conducted within the framework of the Glacier Model Intercomparison Project (GlacierMIP) and coordinated by the Climate and Cryosphere Project (CliC) of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP).

**Study: Respecting Paris Agreement Could Save Twice as Much Ice**
A new study published in the journal 'Science' suggests that respecting the 1.5°C global warming limit set by the Paris Agreement could save twice as much ice as a scenario where the world is heading towards more significant climate change. According to the study, even if global temperatures stabilize at the current level of 1.2°C of warming, about 39% of the global ice mass would still be lost compared to 2020 levels, contributing to over 10 centimeters of global sea level rise. The researchers found that glaciers lose mass rapidly over decades and then continue to melt at a slower rate for centuries, even without further warming. 'One of the main strengths of our study is that we were able to project the evolution of global glaciers on multi-century timescales for the first time, using eight models instead of one or two,' said Harry Zekollari, co-author of the study. 'Most studies on glaciers stop at 2100, which is problematic when simulating the long-term impact of current climate policies, given the long-term response of glaciers over time.'

**Unesco Warns of 2.5 Billion People Living in Extreme Conditions by 2050**
According to a recent Unesco report, 2.5 billion people will live in extreme conditions by 2050. This includes 3.6 billion people who will be exposed to extreme heat, with temperatures reaching 35 degrees Celsius for over 12 weeks a year. The report highlights the 'deep social and economic inequalities' that have been exacerbated by climate change and climate action. The director of Social Policies at Unesco, Gustavo Merino, emphasizes the need for a 'just and inclusive' transition to address these inequalities. The report warns that the most vulnerable countries, including Chad, South Sudan, Niger, the Central African Republic, and Somalia, will be disproportionately affected. 'Who assumes the cost?' Merino asks, pointing to the need for a global response to address the climate crisis.

**Children Born After 2020 Face Unprecedented Heatwave Risks**
According to researchers, with a 1.5 °C global warming, 52% of children born in 2020 will experience unprecedented heatwaves. However, if the climate warming reaches 3.5 °C by 2100, 92% of children will suffer from extreme heat. It is crucial to take action and protect the planet to ensure a livable future for children. Our bodies are not adapted to withstand extreme heat, and children with pre-existing conditions such as asthma, developmental disorders, physical or mental disabilities, and heart problems are particularly vulnerable to heatwaves. As stated by the article, 'Il est donc vraiment temps d'agir et de mettre tout en œuvre pour protéger notre planète et surtout le futur des enfants d'aujourd'hui afin qu'ils puissent vivre dans des pays, des villes, des villages qui ne ressembleront pas à des déserts.'

**Limiting Global Warming to 1.5°C Could Protect 400 Million Children, Report Says**
According to a report released by Save the Children and the VUB, limiting global warming to 1.5°C by 2100 could protect approximately 400 million children, which is one-third of the world's 5-year-old children. The report, 'Born in a Climate Crisis 2: A Life Unprecedented,' analyzed the impact of climate change on children. It found that if current countries' greenhouse gas reduction targets are met, 83% of the 1.2 billion children born in 2020 will experience extreme heat for their entire lives. However, if the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C is achieved, the number of children exposed to extreme heat would decrease to 62.5 million, protecting 380 million children. The report defines climate change-induced weather extremes as 'a life unprecedented' and estimates that 800 million children could be protected from crop failures, 500 million from floods, and 500 million from tropical depressions. If global temperatures rise by 3.5°C, the worst-case scenario is expected. In this scenario, 92% of children born in 2020, or 1.1 billion, could be exposed to extreme heat for their entire lives. The report emphasizes that 'climate justice requires measures beyond temperature limits' and calls for 'phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, expanding climate finance, and introducing child- and community-led climate adaptation policies.'

**Climate Change to Disproportionately Affect Vulnerable Young People, Study Finds**
A study conducted by climate researchers at the VUB university and published in the Nature journal found that vulnerable young people will be disproportionately affected by climate change. The study, which modeled three different scenarios for global warming by 2100, found that 52% of children born in 2020 will experience heatwaves if the planet warms by 1.5°C, while 92% will if it warms by 3.5°C. The study also highlighted the social injustice of climate change, noting that children from low-income families will be almost universally exposed to heatwaves (95%), compared to 78% of children from more affluent families. As climate researcher, 'the children of today will be confronted with more extreme climate events than previous generations,' the study concludes.

**Study: Fighting Climate Change is Economically Worthwhile**
According to a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group and the University of Cambridge, inaction against climate change would result in massive economic losses. If global warming reaches 3 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100, the global economy could shrink by 15 to 34 percent. To limit warming to 2 degrees, researchers estimate that investments of 1 to 2 percent of global GDP in climate mitigation and adaptation would be necessary, limiting economic consequences to 2 to 4 percent of global GDP. This aligns with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, or at least below 2 degrees.

**Prediction shows the number of fire-related deaths by the year 2100 - Internewscast Journal**
A recent study by researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China warns that climate change could lead to a significant increase in urban fires, resulting in a staggering 22.2% rise in outdoor fires globally by 2100, with 335,000 fatalities and 1.1 million fire-related injuries anticipated. The researchers stated, 'We find that global warming could lead to an unexpectedly high volume of fire casualties.' The study, published in Nature Cities, analyzed data from 2,847 cities across 20 countries and found that under a high-emissions scenario, there could be an 11.6% increase in vehicle fires, a 22.2% increase in outdoor fires, and a 4.6% decrease in building fires by 2100. The UK is expected to be one of the worst-affected countries, with building fires potentially surging by 10%, vehicle fires by almost 15%, and outdoor fires by more than 20%. The researchers hope the findings will help shape climate mitigation strategies worldwide, stating, 'This study can serve as a starting point for developing climate-resilient strategies, such as updating fire standards, mitigating human impacts, ameliorating fuel management and enhancing vehicles' reliability.'

**Dire Future Predicted for the World by 2100: Rising Sea Levels, Extreme Weather, and Catastrophic Air Pollution**
A study using Google's ImageFX generator and the latest scientific research predicts a dire future for the world by 2100. Cities will be underwater, and millions of people will die from heat. The main factors will be rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions. If nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these changes will continue for a century. Climate scientist Professor Julian Stoye said, 'The biggest impact that everyone will feel is the rise in sea levels and the change in extreme weather conditions. All of this will be increasing over the century if we do nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.' The IPCC predicts that the global temperature will rise by 2.7°C by 2100 under a medium scenario and by 4.4°C under a worst-case scenario. The number of people living in arid regions will increase by more than double, from 2.3 billion to 5 billion by 2100. The risk of 'sudden droughts' will increase from 32% to 53% in Europe by 2100. Countries like France, already struggling with water scarcity, will likely face devastating droughts. It is predicted that only extreme heat will lead to 5.8 million additional deaths in Europe by 2100. Barcelona will be the most affected city, with 246,000 additional deaths predicted. The melting of ice and rising sea levels will continue as the atmosphere warms over the next 75 years. The study predicts that the global sea level will rise by 1.9 meters by 2100 if CO2 emissions continue to increase. Extreme weather events will become more frequent, with a 47% decrease in summer rainfall in the UK by 2070 and a 35% increase in winter rainfall. The risk of sudden floods will be high in areas where droughts have already weakened the land. Mega-tornadoes will become more common, posing a threat to countries like Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and the southern states of the US. Large-scale forest fires will also become more frequent, with a 50% increase in extreme forest fires by 2100. The World Environment Programme predicts that extreme forest fires will become 50% more frequent by 2100. Air pollution will become catastrophic, with 60,000 additional deaths worldwide by 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100.

**Scientists Predict Bleak Future for Earth in 2100**
Scientists from Google and MailOnline used a generator with artificial intelligence to predict what the world will be like in 2100. The picture is bleak: cities will be underwater, and millions of people will die from heat. The main impact will be the rise in sea levels and extreme weather conditions. 'The biggest impact we'll feel is the rise in sea levels and the change in extreme weather conditions. All of this will increase over the century if we don't do anything to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,' said Dr. Julian Stowell, a climate expert from University College London. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that the global temperature will be 2.7°C higher than the pre-industrial average by 2100, and 4.4°C higher in the worst-case scenario. The number of people living in arid regions will increase by more than twice, from 2.3 billion to 5 billion by 2100. The risk of 'sudden droughts' will increase from 32% to 53% in Europe by 2100. 'This will lead to devastating droughts in countries like France, which are already struggling with systematic water shortages,' said Dr. Stowell. It is predicted that only excessive heat will cause 5.8 million additional deaths in Europe by 2100. The city of Barcelona will be the most affected, with 246,000 additional deaths predicted. The melting of ice and rising sea levels will continue as the atmosphere warms over the next 75 years. 'This will warm the Arctic even faster, leading to more melting of Greenland and a faster rise in sea levels, destabilization of permafrost zones, and disruption of deep ocean currents,' said Dr. Stowell. It is predicted that more than half of the world's glaciers will disappear by 2100, and the European Alps will lose 75% of their glaciers under a high-emissions scenario. Scientists from the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore predict that the global sea level will rise by 1.9 meters by 2100 if CO2 emissions continue to increase. Extreme weather will become more frequent and intense, with a 47% decrease in summer rainfall in the UK by 2070 and a 35% increase in winter rainfall. 'When these sudden downpours hit areas where drought has already weakened the land, the risk of catastrophic flooding becomes extremely high,' said experts. The number of 'megastorms' will increase, which occur when warm, moist air rises from the ocean. For places like Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and southern US states, these destructive storms will become much more common by 2100. Large forest fires will also become more frequent, as a combination of strong heat and low rainfall makes some regions extremely vulnerable to fires. The UN Environment Programme predicts that extreme forest fires will become 50% more frequent by 2100. The frequency of extreme fires will increase by 14% by 2030, 30% by 2050, and 50% by the end of the century. Air pollution will become catastrophic, with cities like Delhi in India facing even worse conditions. Warm air and less rainfall mean that pollution stays in the air longer. In countries experiencing rapid industrial growth, poor environmental regulation has led to hazardous levels of pollution. Research shows that if climate change continues, air pollution will cause an additional 60,000 deaths worldwide by 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100.
