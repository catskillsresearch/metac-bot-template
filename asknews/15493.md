**Initial Concepts Provided on California Climate Disclosure Laws Implementation**
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has delayed the regulations for the California Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (SB253) until the end of 2025. The law requires companies with annual revenue in excess of $1 billion to disclose greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risk. CARB has provided initial staff concepts on how the laws will be implemented, including definitions for 'doing business in California,' 'revenue,' and 'corporate relationships.' The board is considering whether the program implementing SB261 will be through regulation or guidance. CARB has indicated that it will exercise its enforcement discretion and not pursue enforcement against entities that make a good faith effort to comply with the law's reporting obligations in 2026. The board will communicate further updates throughout the year.

**CA drops 'green' big-rig mandates, ending legal fight with Bill Barr-linked group**
California has agreed to drop its Advanced Clean Fleet (ACF) mandates, which dictated stringent emissions standards for big rigs, following a year-long court battle with the American Free Enterprise Chamber of Commerce (AmFree). The mandates, which required trucking firms to transition to zero-emission vehicles, were seen as a 'threat to our American free enterprise' by former Attorney General William Barr. AmFree CEO Gentry Collins said, 'This ruling is the final nail in the coffin of California's crazy attempt to eliminate the traditional trucking sector.' The decision is the latest in a series of reversals of green mandates, with Congress overturning at least three Biden-era EPA waivers granted to California. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito praised the rollback, saying, 'The impact of California's waiver would have been felt across the country, harming multiple sectors of our economy and costing hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process.'

**Regulatory Update: Senate Votes to Block California’s EV Mandate**
The U.S. Senate voted 51–44 to rescind California's authority to enforce its Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) regulation, which required all new light-duty vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035. The bill aims to repeal gas vehicle bans in California and 30% of the U.S. auto market, citing job loss concerns and unrealistic regulatory burdens. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta have denounced the measure and announced plans to mount a legal challenge, calling it an infringement on states' rights under the Clean Air Act. The law does not fully eliminate the authority of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which still maintains regulatory control over in-use emissions and certain specialized programs. The fate of the resolutions remains uncertain in the Senate, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Senate Parliamentarian have both concluded that California's EPA waivers are not subject to repeal under the Congressional Review Act. Legal experts note that California's authority to set stricter emissions standards is enshrined in the Clean Air Act and has historically withstood court challenges. The California standards, including ACC II and ACT, remain in effect, and private fleets in California and Section 177 states no longer have an obligation to acquire ZEVs. However, the manufacturer-driven ACT and ACC II rules are still in place, with litigation pending.

**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**Bilbao to Restrict Access to Vehicles with Yellow 'B' Environmental Label**
The city of Bilbao will start restricting access to vehicles with a yellow 'B' environmental label from June 15, 2025. According to the city's website, these restrictions will only apply during weekdays from 7:00 to 20:00 hours. The restrictions will affect vehicles that do not meet the requirements for a 'clean vehicle' label, such as those without a distinctive environmental label. However, there are exceptions, including residents who are registered within the designated area, people who need to access medical or veterinary consultations, and vehicles that access authorized rotating parking lots. These restrictions are in line with the Ley 7/2021, de 20 de mayo, de cambio climático y transición energética, and the Real Decreto 1052/2022, de 27 de diciembre, which regulate low-emission zones. Other cities in Spain, such as Málaga and Palma de Mallorca, will also implement similar restrictions in the future, with Palma de Mallorca starting to restrict access to vehicles with a 'B' label from January 1, 2027, and Málaga implementing restrictions in the future. Additionally, the Generalitat of Catalonia has announced that vehicles with a 'B' label will not be allowed to access low-emission zones on days when air quality protocols are activated, starting from January 1, 2026.

**Trump administration blocks California's electric vehicle mandate**
The California dream of a fully electric state has been shattered by the federal government. Since 1970, California has set its own rules for emissions, which are stricter than the federal government's. However, this has been challenged by the Trump administration, which has blocked the state's mandate to sell a certain percentage of electric vehicles by 2035. The norm is 35% in 2026, 68% in 2030, and 100% in 2035. California Governor Gavin Newsom maintains that the state will still meet its climate goals, citing its 'legal responsibility under federal law to protect the community and reduce major pollutants to levels required by federal law.' According to Mary Nichols, former president of the California Air Resources Board, the state could consider stricter emissions limits for factories and oil refineries to make up for the difference. The state could also encourage public transportation or impose penalties on gas-powered vehicle owners, as seen in Europe.

**Sustainability and ESG Advisory Practice Update, May 2025**
The US House of Representatives passed the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act', which includes significant changes to federal energy tax credits. The bill would eliminate various tax credits, including the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit and the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, if construction of the applicable facility does not begin before 60 days after enactment or if the applicable facility is placed-in-service after 2028. Additionally, the bill would end a number of tax credits earlier than under current law. Colorado redefined 'clean energy resource' to include nuclear energy, which may contribute to the state's 2050 net-zero emissions goal. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the registration of the first 'green' stock exchange, Green Impact Exchange (GIX), which will require listed companies to adopt sustainability standards. The European Commission published updated guidance and FAQs on the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and a draft of the Delegated Act, which is open for public consultation until May 13, 2025. The EC also published its 2025-2030 working plan for the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) and the Energy Labeling Regulation (ELR), which includes a list of products that should be prioritized for introducing ecodesign and energy labeling requirements over the next five years. The EC initiated a call for evidence to review the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and plans to revise it in the fourth quarter of 2025. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) consulted on proposed Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) under the ESG Rating Regulation, which aims to improve the transparency and integrity of the business activities of ESG ratings providers.

**Congress Revokes EPA Waivers for California's Clean Truck, NOx Rules**
The US Congress has revoked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) waivers for California's clean truck and NOx rules, which were set to phase out internal-combustion-powered cars and trucks and tighten diesel emissions limits. The American Trucking Associations (ATA) celebrated the move, calling it a 'monumental victory' for the trucking industry. However, California and environmental groups have criticized the action, saying it will increase air pollution and accelerate global warming. The revocation of the waivers will allow truck manufacturers to continue developing emissions-reduction technologies that best suit different types of operations, such as Cummins' new fuel-agnostic engine platform. The move has also sparked a debate about the competitiveness of the US auto industry in a global market that is rapidly advancing toward cleaner combustion technology and zero-emission vehicles.

**California to Sue Federal Government Over Emissions Standards**
California is preparing to sue the federal government to regain its right to set emissions standards for vehicles, according to a statement by Rob Bonta, the state's attorney general, to TechCrunch. Bonta said, 'The exploitation of the Congressional Review Act to attack California's exemptions is just another part of the ongoing partisan campaign against California's efforts to protect the public and the planet from harm.' He added, 'As we've previously stated, this reckless use of the Congressional Review Act is unlawful, and California will not stand idly by.' California has received over 100 exemptions since federal laws granted the state this right about 50 years ago. 16 other states, including the District of Columbia, follow California's emissions standards, and most have implemented a gradual phase-out of fossil fuel-powered vehicles. The Senate has also voted to repeal exemptions that allowed California to set stricter emissions standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles. In fact, California's mandate for electric vehicles is a zero-emission standard, and starting from 2026, the state was set to begin requiring a 35% increase in sales of zero-emission vehicles until 2035, when manufacturers would be required to sell only zero-emission vehicles. Currently, there are two technologies that are qualified: hydrogen fuel cells and battery-electric vehicles. Due to the increasing challenges faced by hydrogen fuel cell networks and hydrogen fueling infrastructure, battery-electric vehicles have become the preferred solution to achieve California's 2035 goal. Last year, 25.3% of new light-duty vehicles in California were electric, and almost all of them were battery-electric. The state's decision requires that 35% of new sales be zero-emission vehicles by 2026, which manufacturers have described as 'impossible.' It is expected that electric vehicle sales in California will remain steady in 2024, despite the varying years, with a market share of 7.8% in 2020 rising to 25% in 2023.

**US Senate Votes to Limit California's Emissions Standards**
The US Senate has voted to strip California of its authority to set its own emissions standards, according to The Wall Street Journal. This decision, which was previously approved by the House of Representatives, must be confirmed by President Donald Trump. Since 2022, California has been allowed to set stricter emissions standards than the federal level, and similar measures have been implemented in 11 other states, aiming to phase out gasoline-powered cars by 2035. American automakers and dealers have expressed concerns that these measures could harm the industry. California officials have vowed to sue the Trump administration, calling the Congressional vote an 'attack on the state's long-standing efforts to combat environmental pollution.'

**California filing suit over U.S. Senate vote revoking state's EV mandate and strict emission standards**
California is filing a lawsuit against the U.S. Senate after they voted to revoke the state's emission waivers that set stricter standards than federal regulations. The waivers, which include a rule to phase out gasoline-powered cars and require new vehicle sales to be zero-emission by 2035, were approved by the Biden administration Environmental Protection Agency in 2024. Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta stated, 'This Senate vote is illegal,' and 'With these votes, Senate Republicans are bending the knee to President Trump once again.' The stricter rules would begin in 2026 and would allow 20% of zero-emission cars sold to be plug-in hybrids. Sixteen other states and the District of Columbia have also adopted California's vehicle standards.

**Senate GOP set to revoke California's car emissions standards, in a move Democrats call "the nuclear option"**
The Senate is set to vote on revoking California's car emissions standards, a move Democrats call 'the nuclear option.' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer described the planned vote as 'the nuclear option.' The three waivers in question set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, with two relating to reducing tailpipe emissions from medium and heavy-duty vehicles, and the third being California's 'EV mandate,' which aims to phase-out gas powered cars and require all new vehicle sales in California to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act gives Congress the ability to overturn rules passed by federal agencies, but nonpartisan government watchdogs disagree. Senate Democrats say such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California's Air Resources Board claims that the state has applied for over 100 waivers that have resulted in vehicles being 99% cleaner in terms of pollution, compared to vehicles from 1970. If Congress uses Congressional Review to revoke the waivers, the state of California will sue the federal government, according to Mary Nichols, former chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board. 'The law is that the Clean Air Act says California can set its own standards if they are more stringent, more environmentally protective than whatever the federal government standard is,' Nichols said. Voting down California's waivers is expected to impact cities and states around the country, as 16 additional states and the District of Columbia have adopted California's vehicle standards.

**Moderate Republicans mull fate of California EPA waivers**
The fate of California's stringent air pollution rules, which promote the adoption of electric vehicles, may depend on a few moderate Republican senators. The Senate could vote as early as next week on repealing waivers given to California by the EPA, which allow the state to set new vehicle emissions standards, including a mandate for all new car sales to be electric vehicles by 2035. However, some Senate Republicans are uncertain about supporting the Congressional Review Act resolutions, citing the Government Accountability Office and Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough's ruling that the waivers are not rules for the CRA's purposes. As Elizabeth MacDonough said, 'Even though the parliamentarian's decisions are not binding, lawmakers usually follow them.'

**California Environmental Law & Policy Update 5.9.25**
The House has passed resolutions to rescind federal waivers that allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards. California's standards require the sale of most gas-powered vehicles to be phased out by 2035 and mandate reductions in nitrogen oxide and other emissions for trucks. California officials have condemned the measure as 'illegal', stating that the Senate is now considering whether to take up the legislation. If passed, this could impact California's ability to establish aggressive environmental policies, which often serve as a model for other states.

**House Passes Resolutions to Repeal California's Emissions Exemptions**
The US House of Representatives passed three resolutions on April 30, using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), to repeal the 'special exemptions' granted by the Biden administration to California, effectively canceling the state's right to implement zero-emission vehicle mandates and stricter emissions standards. The resolutions, H.J. Res. 87, H.J. Res. 88, and H.J. Res. 89, aim to revoke the exemptions granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to California, allowing it to implement stricter emissions regulations. According to California Republican Representative Doug LaMalfa, the issue stems from the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), which grants California a 'special exemption' to set its own emissions standards for cars and trucks. LaMalfa stated that the exemptions are crucial, as they would allow other states to follow California's lead and implement similar regulations nationwide. The resolutions will now be sent to the Senate for review, where they will need to be approved before being sent to President Trump for signature. 'These regulations are a direct attack on California residents and workers,' LaMalfa said. 'They drive up costs, limit consumer choices, and force the trucking and automotive industries to transition in an impossible timeline.' The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has granted California exemptions to set its own emissions standards, which have been criticized by environmental groups. The resolutions passed with a vote of 237-191 for H.J. Res. 87, 225-196 for H.J. Res. 89, and 237-191 for H.J. Res. 88. The American Trucking Associations (ATA) praised the House's decision, stating that California's regulations are 'unrealistic' and would be 'extremely costly' to implement. 'Today's trucks emit 99% less nitrogen oxides and particulate matter than they did decades ago, and new trucks emit over 40% less carbon dioxide than trucks built in 2010,' said Chris Spear, ATA president and CEO. 'California should not be allowed to set policies that affect interstate supply chains.'

**House Republicans move to stop California from setting its own vehicle pollution standards**
The US House of Representatives voted to revoke California's ability to set its own stricter pollution regulations for cars and heavy-duty trucks, but it's unclear if Republicans have a sound legal footing. The move is an attempt to kill California's ambitious climate plan, which requires all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035. However, the Congressional Review Act (CRA) may not apply to waivers issued by the EPA, and the Senate parliamentarian and Government Accountability Office (GAO) have previously said that Congress can't use the CRA to revoke these waivers. California's ability to set its own tailpipe emission standards was allowed by the 1970 Clean Air Act due to the state's higher pollution levels. At least 11 other states have adopted similar climate laws, and carmakers have criticized the Biden administration's approval of California's plan, saying it's unrealistic. 'This vote is an unprecedented and reckless attack on states' legal authority to address the tailpipe pollution causing asthma, lung disease and heart conditions,' said Kathy Harris, director of clean vehicles at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

**Experts Say Proposed Vehicle Emissions and Fuel Rules Not an EPA 'Ban' on Gas-Powered Cars - FactCheck.org**
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed new pollution standards for vehicles, which would increase the number of electric vehicles sold in the U.S. However, the proposed rules do not 'ban' the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles, as claimed by a trade group for fuel makers. Policy experts told FactCheck.org that carmakers would have flexibility in how they meet the proposed requirements, including by making vehicles with internal combustion engines more efficient. According to the EPA, the number of EVs produced would depend on 'the compliance pathways manufacturers select' to meet the standards. The proposed standards would increase at a rate of 10% per year for model years 2030 through 2035, and would 'complement and align' with the EPA's proposed emissions standards for similar vehicles. Experts said that the proposed federal regulations are not a ban on gasoline vehicles, and that automakers would still have the flexibility to include some gasoline-powered vehicles. As Kenneth Gillingham said, 'the standards are ambitious and would provide a strong incentive for automakers to produce and sell more electric vehicles.'
