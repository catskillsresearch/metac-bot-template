**France's 'New Generation' Aircraft Carrier Project: A Questionable Investment?**
Despite economic challenges, the French government continues to invest heavily in the 'new generation' aircraft carrier project, which has raised questions about the effectiveness of this type of military spending in an era of rapid geopolitical change. Even if we assume that Russia represents a direct threat to French national security, the question remains about the true role that an aircraft carrier can play in such a scenario, and whether these vessels still retain their strategic value in the current technological context? The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has ambitious goals that go beyond France's traditional role in Europe, seeking to reposition France as a major European power, and possibly the most influential power in the continent, similar to the role of the United States within NATO and on the international stage. However, reality imposes different facts; France, despite its rich military history, is no longer capable of waging large-scale military operations without logistical and technological support from major powers, as seen in its limited intervention in Mali, where it had to rely on American support. Despite this, Macron insists that France's military power must remain 'sacred' and untouchable, and he invokes in his speeches a vision of France as a great empire, similar to the Napoleonic Empire. To reinforce this image, he launched the new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier project, which is one of the largest French defense projects in recent decades. However, this project faces widespread criticism from defense and strategy experts, who see the era of aircraft carriers coming to an end, especially with the huge development in coastal defense systems and supersonic missiles, which make aircraft carriers large and easy targets in any high-intensity military confrontation. The criticism is further exacerbated by the fact that the new carrier will not enter service until the mid-2030s, meaning that France will invest billions of euros in a system that may be technologically outdated even before it enters service. Despite this, Paris continues with the project, having already begun assembling the initial components, with expectations that the actual construction will begin in a few years, despite the usual slow pace of work in French military industries. From a strategic perspective, decision-makers in France justify this massive investment as part of the 'rearmament' of Europe in the face of increasing Russian threats. However, reality shows that this wave of rearmament has not yet led to a fundamental change in European defense capabilities or in the nature of military industries on the continent. It appears that Europeans are trying to send a political message to the world that they are serious about taking responsibility for their own defense, at a time when doubts are growing about the United States' long-term commitment to European security. The report concludes that France's strategic priorities seem to be out of sync with the real threats. Even if we assume the outbreak of a large-scale conflict in Europe, the nature of this conflict would be land-based and aerial, and the French Navy, or even a new aircraft carrier, would not play a decisive role in the events. This approach raises questions about the justification of spending limited French taxpayers' money on a massive project like the 'new generation' aircraft carrier, especially since its entry into service will be many years away, and the nature of threats and military technology may change dramatically during that time. Many fear that the project may end up like other military projects that were abandoned due to high costs or changes in strategic priorities. The report concludes that if France is serious about enhancing its strategic security, it should reconsider its defense priorities and focus on investing in areas more closely related to modern threats, such as developing drone capabilities, supersonic missiles, cyber and electromagnetic spectrum protection, as well as updating and expanding its nuclear arsenal to make it more flexible and deterrent.

**Navy awards $536M contract to industry for first dismantlement of nuclear-powered ship**
The US Navy has awarded a $536 million contract to NorthStar Maritime Dismantlement Service to dismantle, recycle and dispose of the former aircraft carrier Enterprise (CVN-65). The four-year undertaking will set precedents for future nuclear-powered ship disposals. According to the contract announcement, the ship will be dismantled in its entirety, and all resulting materials will be properly recycled or disposed of. NorthStar, whose parent company is based in New York, has partnered with Modern American Recycling and Radiological Services to complete the work in Mobile, Alabama. Scott State, CEO of NorthStar, said the company will dismantle the ship 'safely, efficiently, cost-effectively and in an environmentally responsible manner.' The Navy expects to save an estimated $1 billion in cost by leveraging private-sector expertise in commercial nuclear power plant decommissioning.

**World's First Nuclear Aircraft Carrier Set For Dismantling Under $536M Plan**
The U.S. Department of Defense has awarded NorthStar Maritime Dismantlement Services a $536.7 million contract to dismantle the decommissioned nuclear aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN 65). The work will be carried out in Mobile, Alabama, and is expected to finish by November 2029. The contract includes the removal of hazardous materials, including low-level radioactive waste, and the recycling or proper disposal of all recovered materials. The decision to dismantle the USS Enterprise follows years of debate and a Navy report in 2022 exploring different options for the ship's fate. The dismantling project is expected to bring economic benefits to Mobile, Alabama, and the Navy and contractors have assured strict safety and environmental protections. The USS Enterprise was the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the world and played a significant role in many critical U.S. Navy operations throughout her service life.

**Ukraine Launches Significant Attack on Russia's Military Airfields**
Ukraine has launched a significant attack on Russia's main military airfields, according to expert Bogdan Dolince. 'The damage is a serious blow to the Russians,' he said. The real situation regarding the damage or destruction of aircraft will become clear in a few days after the appearance of satellite images. However, the attack is a significant blow to Russia. Dolince explained that the Russians have around 100 strategic aircraft, half of which are Tu-95MS, which are outdated and used to preserve resources for more modern Tu-22 and Tu-160. 'If we talk about the damage to such a number, then in fact, we are talking about the damage or destruction of half of all operational strategic aircraft of Russia,' he said. Dolince also noted that Russia is currently unable to produce new aircraft, which means that Russia will lose the ability to use these aircraft for many years. 'If we talk about strategic aviation, then indeed strategic aviation is a component of Russia's nuclear triad. So, we are talking about aircraft-carriers of nuclear weapons that can be used to launch from cruise missiles. Therefore, Russia is very afraid of losses, damage to these aircraft. If, of course, we are talking about damage, for example, to Tu-95, then this is a less significant loss for Russia, because these aircraft are morally outdated, and in the event of, for example, a conflict with NATO, they can be quickly destroyed,' he said. However, he noted that the loss or damage of more modern supersonic aircraft, such as Tu-160, and other types of bombers, is more serious. 'This is Tu-22, which are relatively modern. And in principle, today this is the basis of Russian nuclear security. And damage or loss of these aircraft can be very painful for the enemy,' he said. He added that such aircraft are in short supply in Russia and that Russia has only been able to assemble one test sample in 10 years. 'In general, Russia planned to produce up to 10 units of new Russian strategic aircraft by 2024. But this did not happen. And this speaks to the fact that today, in the event of a loss of aircraft, Russia will be unable to restore or rebuild its strategic aircraft, probably for the next 10, and possibly even 20 years,' Dolince explained.

**France's New Aircraft Carrier: A Crucial Factor in Detering Russia**
France plans to build a new aircraft carrier, the Porte-avions de nouvelle génération (PA-Ng), by 2038. The construction of the first components is expected to start in 2025, but the actual building of the ship will likely begin in 2031. According to Ruben F. Johnson, a consultant for the Pentagon and expert on international military issues, the construction of the aircraft carrier is a complex and expensive process, and it is unclear whether it is worth the cost, especially given the growing threat from Russia. Johnson notes that the presence of the French aircraft carrier is crucial for NATO and other partners in the region, and that it would be a key factor in deterring Russia from launching a nuclear attack on the West. The new aircraft carrier is also needed to provide a platform for the French military to launch fighter jets, including the Rafale M and future generations of fighter jets. A US naval contractor and shipbuilder notes that France is holding onto its aircraft carrier potential because it understands that once it is lost, it can never be regained. 'No country that has given up its aircraft carriers has ever gotten them back. It takes too many resources to do that after you've returned your aircraft carrier forces to zero. The Brazilians said they're going to try, and I wish them all the best, but the chances are not in their favor,' the contractor said.

**US Navy Plans to Deploy Land-Attack Tomahawk Cruise Missile to Counter China's Naval Expansion**
The US Navy plans to deploy a land-attack version of the Tomahawk cruise missile on its destroyers starting from September 2024. According to Daryl Caudle, the commander of the US Navy's Fleet Forces Command, the deployment of the land-attack Tomahawk will 'turn the tide' in the face of China's numerical superiority in its naval fleet. Caudle said that the land-attack Tomahawk is the US Navy's most well-known non-nuclear missile, currently used to attack ground targets, and the land-attack version will significantly increase the Navy's lethality. 'When you make a weapon more fungible, it becomes more useful in different situations,' Caudle said. The deployment of the Tomahawk will bolster the US Navy's anti-ship capabilities and complement the submarine-launched torpedoes, forming a key component in the event of a conflict in Asia. Caudle also said that the land-attack Tomahawk can be launched from submarines or destroyers, making it a 'very useful weapon.' Chip Whipkey, the deputy program manager for the Tomahawk, said that the Navy plans to begin deploying the new missile on destroyers on September 30, 2024, and will conduct testing from April to June 2025 before deploying it on submarines. The Navy plans to purchase 1302 sea-launched Tomahawk missiles from RTX. This plan is part of the 'copycat' plan, which involves deploying thousands of drones in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China's military expansion. Caudle also mentioned that the Navy's growing arsenal includes the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in submarine sonar systems to 'assist in identifying human-made noise from biological sources such as fish.' Navy spokesperson Frost added that this capability has been operational on Los Angeles-class and Virginia-class submarines for several years. The Pentagon predicts that by 2030, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, including submarines and aircraft carriers, will grow from 370 to 435 vessels. This has led to a commitment from US lawmakers to invest billions of dollars in building new warships. However, Caudle cautioned against a 'shipbuilding arms race' and emphasized that the focus should be on the capabilities of each ship. 'A better strategy is to build high-end, high-performance, high-capacity ships,' he said, referring to the Burke-class guided-missile destroyers. He also noted that the growing size of the Chinese naval fleet will create challenges, including increased ammunition procurement and personnel numbers. 'You have to provide sailors for these ships, maintain the ships, provide berthing, and prepare housing for the sailors, not just buying ships,' Caudle said.

**India readies to face 2040 naval threat, as Pak-China-Turkey axis emerges  - The Sunday Guardian Live**
India is facing a growing maritime challenge from a coordinated China-Turkiye-Pakistan naval build-up by 2040. The three nations are not part of any formal alliance, but their hidden coordination and converging maritime postures suggest the emergence of a strategic triangle. China is expected to operate six aircraft carriers, 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines, and a surface fleet of over 150 warships by 2040. Turkiye's naval modernisation includes an aircraft carrier, destroyers with up to 96 VLS cells, and stealth submarines. Pakistan is expected to field eight Hangor-class submarines, four Type 054A/P guided missile frigates, and four Babur-class corvettes. The combined strength of these three navies is projected to include over 80 submarines, at least seven aircraft carriers, and between 180 to 200 surface combatants by 2040. This triad presents a multi-axis challenge to India, forcing the Indian Navy to split its forces across three distinct theatres. India must evolve its naval force structure rapidly to effectively defend and attack simultaneously. Key programmes such as INS Vishal, the six planned nuclear-powered attack submarines, and the Arihant-class SSBNs must be delivered on schedule. Ensuring the fleet is fully operational and technologically current will be vital to countering the combined underwater advantage of China, Turkiye, and Pakistan.

**French Navy Offers Sneak Peek Of Its Future Carrier Air Wing**
The French Navy is planning to introduce a new, French-developed uncrewed combat air vehicle (UCAV) to its carrier air wing by 2038, alongside the F5 version of the Rafale M. The UCAV, which will be developed by Dassault Aviation, will have stealth characteristics and autonomous control, and will be designed to operate in concert with the crewed fighter. According to Dassault, the UCAV 'will be highly versatile and designed to evolve in line with future threats.' The UCAV's missions are expected to include suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD), and it will also have the ability to operate independently. The French Navy is also considering the possibility of operating the fighter-like Wingman drone, which is being developed by Airbus, aboard its carriers. The Wingman is intended to be a low-cost solution that can be brought into production and fielded rapidly, and it has been pitched as a potential launch platform for Remote Carriers. 'The requirement to have NGF — or a version of NGF — able to operate from French Navy aircraft carriers will bring additional challenges to the design,' said Dassault Aviation. 'The airframe would also have to be more robust for carrier operations, adding mass to the design, and that naval requirement would have to be accounted for in the wing and control surface design in order to allow for optimized carrier recovery.'

**US Predicts 448 Ship Orders by 2037, Opportunities for Korean Shipbuilding Industry**
A recent report by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) predicts that the United States will order up to 448 industrial and military ships by 2037, which is equivalent to about three years' worth of South Korea's total shipbuilding. The report suggests that the government and companies should not miss this opportunity. The prediction is based on the SHIPS for America Act and the US Navy's 2025 ship retirement and new construction plan. The report expects the US to order at least 100 commercial ships, including strategic supply ships, LNG carriers, and icebreakers. The US Navy plans to increase LNG exports, and by 2040, 10% of its LNG exports will be transported by domestically built ships. The report also predicts that the US will order 129 combat ships, 46 support ships, and 67 national defense reserve fleet (NDRF) ships. While the accuracy of the prediction is uncertain, the Korean shipbuilding industry is optimistic that it will secure a significant portion of the orders. The report suggests that Korean companies should prepare for localization and cooperate with the US to create a domestic shipbuilding ecosystem. Hyundai Heavy Industries and Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries are already exploring localization options, including investing in US shipyards and building LNG carriers. The report also suggests that the US will focus on building transport and support ships, and that domestic mid-sized shipbuilders will also benefit from the policy. The report recommends that the government and industry prepare for the short-term and long-term opportunities and challenges, and that the government should strengthen support for future shipbuilding, such as autonomous ships and hydrogen fuel cells.

**South Korea's 'Light Aircraft Carrier' Transformed into 'Multi-Functional Unmanned Combat Command Ship'**
South Korea's Navy has announced plans to transform its 'light aircraft carrier' project into a 'multi-functional unmanned combat command ship' that will use drones instead of F-35B fighter jets. The original plan, called 'Multi-Purpose Large Transport Ship-II', aimed to build a 3,000-tonne, 260-meter-long, and 40-meter-wide light aircraft carrier with 20 F-35B jets by 2033, with a total budget of 7 trillion Korean won (approximately 1.5 trillion New Taiwan dollars). However, the plan was put on hold after the current government took office due to concerns over cost-effectiveness and geopolitical demands. The new plan maintains similar ship specifications but replaces F-35B with drones, expected to save billions of Korean won. The Navy stated that the new ship will serve as a mobile command platform, executing anti-North Korean threats, precision strikes, amphibious assaults, and maritime traffic protection, as well as disaster relief. The Navy has commissioned HD Modern Heavy Industries to conduct concept design, with a report to be submitted to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in late May. If approved, the ship is expected to be built in the late 2030s. Experts note that the unmanned drone scheme was inspired by the Ukraine war, highlighting the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of unmanned systems in modern naval warfare. However, the plan still needs to be confirmed by the new government and faces potential technical and budget challenges.

**France Prepares to Launch Next-Generation Aircraft Carrier**
The French Navy is preparing to launch its next major technological and strategic milestone, the PA-NG (Porte-Avions de Nouvelle Génération), a new-generation aircraft carrier with nuclear propulsion. According to the latest annual report from Naval Group, the construction is expected to start officially by the end of 2025, marking the beginning of a new era for the Marine Nationale. The PA-NG will replace the current flagship, the Charles de Gaulle, which has been in service since 2001. The new aircraft carrier will be the largest warship ever built in Europe, with a displacement of 80,000 tons and an estimated length of 300 meters. It will be able to transport up to 30 new-generation fighters, such as the Rafale-M, and will feature an electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS), a technology already used in US Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers. The propulsion will be nuclear, with two new-generation reactors developed by TechnicAtome, which will provide energy for the ship's systems, catapults, radars, and advanced combat systems. This independence will ensure great autonomy and a high degree of global operability. The construction of the PA-NG has been defined as a 'project of national sovereignty' by the French government, which will also create thousands of direct jobs and hundreds of subcontracted jobs in the technological and defense sectors. If the planned deadlines are respected, the new aircraft carrier will enter service in 2038, when the Charles de Gaulle will have already been in service for over 35 years. 'This is a major step for the French Navy and for Europe,' said a Naval Group spokesperson. 'The PA-NG will be a game-changer in terms of military and strategic capabilities.'

**China, the war-monger - The Singapore Post**
China has rejected a proposal from US President Donald Trump to cut the defense budget by 50%, which would have reduced the chance of a global war and spared funds for development. Instead, China has increased its defense budget to a record high of $249 billion, a 7.2% increase over the previous year. This move has triggered an arms race, with the US and its allies stepping up their defense efforts to combat the threat. The US has announced plans to develop a next-generation fighter jet, the NGAD, which will be way ahead of any other fighter aircraft of the current generation. China has been modernizing its navy and air force, with plans to possess six aircraft carriers by 2035. The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is on the rise, and nations facing the Chinese threat are not sitting idle, increasing their defense budgets and developing advanced arms and weapon platforms. Posterity will brand China as the war-monger, having triggered an arms race through its aggressive moves.

**US aircraft carriers adrift as China surges at sea**
The US aircraft carrier fleet is facing significant challenges, including production delays, rising threats, and shrinking numbers. The USS John F Kennedy (CVN-79) and USS Enterprise (CVN-80) are behind schedule, with the latter's construction attributed to late-sequenced critical material. The US Navy is working to mitigate these risks and reach a combat-ready state as soon as possible. Meanwhile, China is surging ahead at sea, with its first nuclear-powered carrier, the Type 004, nearing completion. China's military planners believe that carriers can provide unique advantages in war, despite debates over their relevance. The US's continued building of aircraft carriers ensures their place as a centerpiece of force projection, but their growing vulnerability is a concern. According to the US Navy's FY2025 30-year shipbuilding plan, the fleet will reach 12 carriers in three years, but will drop to nine by 2047 in some scenarios.

**The shipbuilding industrial base is warning that the US Navy's aircraft carrier delay could be a disaster**
The Aircraft Carrier Industrial Base Coalition (ACIBC) is warning that a potential delay in the US Navy's aircraft carrier procurement could be a disaster. The coalition, representing over 2,000 businesses and 60,000 jobs across 44 states, is urging Congress to provide $600 million in advanced procurement funding for the fifth Ford-class carrier, CVN 82, to be named the USS William J. Clinton. ACIBC Chair Lisa Papini said, 'We're at a point where our companies are starting to go cold,' and that a delay would force businesses to slow down production, delay material orders, and see workers move to new projects. Papini noted that 73% of sole- or single-source CVN suppliers will stop continuous production in 2025 without immediate action, and that 71% of ACIBC businesses forecast significant cost increases and a reduction in the workforce if long intervals between Ford-class carriers continue. The Navy has proposed pushing procurement of CVN 82 to fiscal year 2030, which the ACIBC says would be the longest construction interval between nuclear-powered aircraft carriers to date.

**France’s New ‘PANG’ Aircraft Carrier Explained in 4 Words**
France is developing the PANG, a next-generation aircraft carrier set to replace the Charles de Gaulle in 2038. The nuclear-powered warship will be the largest vessel ever built in Europe and feature EMALS catapults to launch both Rafale-M fighters and future NGF jets. The PANG will be designed to support carrier drones (CCAs) and advanced battle management systems, making it a key component of France's power projection. However, delays and budget constraints may push back production and sea trials, raising concerns about whether France can maintain its carrier capability in an increasingly competitive global naval landscape. According to a Paris-based defense analyst, 'The French MoD are hoping for a 'perfect dovetail' – one ship ready to take over as the new carrier at the same time as the old, CDG is going out the door.' The PANG will be capable of launching and recovering aircraft at a much higher op-tempo than previous carriers, and will be designed to deploy a variety of aircraft, including the NGF and CCA platforms.

**China Has Unlocked the Secret to Winning the Aircraft Carrier Race -- And That's a Direct Threat to America**
China is challenging the United States' carrier dominance for the first time in 80 years. In just 13 years, China has gone from zero carriers to three, and is expected to build up to seven carriers by 2049. The US Navy has 11 Nimitz and Bush-class carriers, but China's carriers are smaller and less useful. However, China is taking a calculated approach to building and designing its carriers, and is building up a highly trained carrier force. Experts believe that China's carriers will require frequent refueling, limiting their ability to conduct sustained operations. The US Navy's newest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, is a significant leap forward in technology and capabilities compared to China's carriers. The Ford-class carriers use electromagnetic catapults and arrestor gear, allowing them to launch heavier aircraft with greater payloads. China's new carrier, Fujian, is conventionally powered and smaller in displacement than the Ford-class carriers. However, Fujian is overall far more similar to Ford than Liaoning and Shandong are to the Nimitz class. 'Fujian will require frequent refueling, limiting its ability to conduct sustained operations,' says Matthew Funaiole, a senior fellow in the China Power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'Fujian will be more reliant on replenishment ships and may not be able to store as much ammunition and fuel for her air wing compared to Ford.' The US Navy is set to put a new sixth-generation fighter, Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD), into service in the 2030s, which will give carriers a long-range punch, outranging Chinese anti-ship weapons. China is also developing new aircraft, including the Shenyang J-35 and a new aircraft known as 'J-XX,' which could be a carrier-based aircraft. By 2045, China will also operate the Xi'an KJ-600 airborne early warning and control aircraft, its version of the E-2D Hawkeye, boosting its ability to control fighters at long ranges.
