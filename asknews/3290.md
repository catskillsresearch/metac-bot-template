**Children make up 15% of Portuguese population**
According to the National Institute of Statistics, in 2023, Portugal had 1,675,610 children and adolescents, representing 15.7% of the population. This is a decrease from 25.2% in 1990. The number of live births per thousand women of childbearing age decreased from 46.5 to 38.8, and the average age of women at the birth of their first child increased from 24.9 to 30.2 years. The poverty risk rate for children up to 17 years of age remained higher than that observed for the general population, at 17.8% in 2023. Additionally, 3.6% of children lacked access to dental consultations or treatments, and 4.5% had limitations in carrying out normal activities due to long-term health problems. Furthermore, in 2024, a fifth of children lived in families unable to pay for at least one week of vacation per year, and a tenth of children were unable to regularly participate in an extracurricular or leisure activity.

**Climate Change Threatens Millions of Pregnant Women Worldwide**
A recent study by Climate Central found that millions of pregnant women around the world are at risk due to climate change, which can lead to health complications such as premature birth or fetal growth restriction. The study analyzed daily temperature data from 2020 to 2024 in 940 cities across 247 countries and found that extreme heat days, which are days with temperatures 95% above normal, have increased globally. In most countries, the number of extreme heat days during pregnancy has doubled over the past five years compared to a world without climate change. According to Dr. Christina Dahl, deputy director of science at Climate Central, 'each extreme heat day can increase the risk of severe pregnancy complications.' She added, 'climate change increases extreme heat, and increases the likelihood of unhealthy pregnancies worldwide, especially in areas where access to healthcare is limited.' The study found that the US has seen a 12-day increase in extreme heat days per year, with West Palm Beach, Florida, experiencing the largest increase at 48% between 2020 and 2024. Utah saw the largest increase in extreme heat days, with a 72% increase since 2020, and Hawaii's extreme heat days can be attributed entirely to climate change. Dr. Brigitte Becker, a women's health expert and expert on the effects of climate change on human health, said, 'extreme heat is currently one of the most pressing threats to pregnant women worldwide, pushing more pregnancies into high-risk areas, especially in areas already experiencing limited access to healthcare.' She added, 'reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning is not only good for the planet, but also a valuable step towards protecting pregnant women and newborns around the world.'

**Korea's birth crisis far from over**
South Korea's total fertility rate reached 0.82 in the first quarter of 2025, a 7.4% year-on-year increase, the highest since records began in 1981. Experts are cautiously optimistic, but warn that even if the government's target of a 1.0 fertility rate by 2030 is met, Korea would still be at the bottom globally in terms of fertility. The prolonged low birthrate has eroded the population of people capable of having children, and an increase in fertility rates may not translate into more births due to a smaller base population of parents. According to Statistics Korea, even under the agency's high-fertility projection scenario, the national population will fall to the 30-million range within 45 years. Complacency is not an option, and a fertility rate must rise to two or three children per woman to avoid a shrinking society. 'We must remember that we have merely bought a little more time to prepare for the demographic shock ahead,' said a warning from the article.

**Adriana Smith's Case Sparks Debate on Anti-Abortion Policies and Maternal Health in the US**
Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old pregnant woman, was declared brain dead after suffering a stroke, but her body was kept on life support to allow the fetus to develop. The case has sparked a debate about the ethics and legality of anti-abortion policies in the US, particularly in states with Republican governors. Smith's family, including her 5-year-old son, continues to visit her in the hospital, but they are not allowed to disconnect her life support machines because of a state law that prohibits abortion after the detection of fetal activity. The law was passed in 2019, but only took effect in 2022 after the Roe v. Wade case was overturned. Experts, including Kimberly Mutcherson, a reproductive rights specialist, have expressed concerns about the impact of such policies on women's health and the potential harm to the fetus. 'It's a kind of experiment: allowing a fetus to develop in a woman's body with brain death. Knowing the enormous effort a pregnant woman's body needs to sustain and nourish a pregnancy, it's impossible to know for sure the damage a fetus may suffer while remaining attached to a body without a functioning brain,' Mutcherson said. The case highlights the need for better healthcare and reproductive rights in the US, particularly for women from low-income backgrounds. According to the CDC, 80% of maternal deaths in the US are preventable. The country has one of the highest maternal mortality rates among developed countries, with 18.6 deaths per 100,000 births in 2023. The rate has decreased from 22.3 deaths per 100,000 births in 2022, but the number of deaths among black women has increased, reaching 50.3 per 100,000 births in 2023. 'In Tennessee, for example, we have one of the strictest abortion bans, with no exceptions for rape, incest, or young girls. It's also one of the states with the highest infant mortality rate (6.6 per 100,000) and maternal mortality rate (41.1, the highest in the country). At the same time, Republicans have complete control,' said Senator London Lamar. 'So, instead of fighting a lost battle, I changed my strategy to raise the banner of maternal health.'

**Research Highlights Worsening Mental Health of US Mothers - Internewscast Journal**
A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States from 2016 to 2023. The study, conducted by researchers from Columbia University and the University of Michigan, analyzed data from nearly 200,000 mothers participating in the National Survey of Children's Health. The results showed a decrease in the percentage of mothers reporting 'excellent' mental health, from 38% in 2016 to 26% in 2023, and an increase in the number of mothers rating their mental health as 'fair/poor', from 5.5% to 9%. According to Jamie Daw, an assistant professor of health policy and management at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, 'Although high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality have been well documented, national data on the health status of mothers beyond pregnancy and the first year postpartum is lacking.' The decline in mental health was observed across nearly every socioeconomic subgroup examined and is expected to have a negative impact on children's development.

**My GP laughed and said ‘you DO know how old you are?’ when I shared my dream of having a baby – I was 44**
Liberty Mills, 50, was told she had a 0.7% chance of conceiving at 44, but she got pregnant naturally within four months after making lifestyle changes. She now helps other couples with fertility issues, achieving a success rate of over 90%. Mills recommends removing alcohol, eating fertility-supporting foods, exercising regularly, staying hydrated, managing stress, and getting enough sleep to improve fertility. She also suggests exercising in line with the menstrual cycle and using weighted blankets to improve sleep quality. Mills' book, 360 Fertility, provides a 12-week plan for optimizing fertility. According to the NHS, fertility decreases with age, and women over 35 have a lower chance of conceiving. Liberty Mills said, 'I will never forget her asking, “You DO know how old you are, don’t you?”’ when she was told she had a low chance of conceiving. However, she didn't let it discourage her and went on to have a healthy baby girl at 45.

**Portugal: Less than 40% of children under five are registered**
According to the 2023-2024 Multiple Indicators and Health Survey (IIMS) published by the National Institute of Statistics (INE), less than 40% of children under the age of five in Portugal are registered. This means that out of every 10 children, six do not have a birth certificate or birth record. The survey also found that among registered children, 36% have a birth certificate. While there has been a slight increase in the number of registered children over the past decade, from 25% in 2015-2016 to 38% in 2023-2024, a significant disparity persists between urban and rural areas. Urban areas have a registration rate nearly twice as high as rural areas, at 49% compared to 25%. The province of Bié has the lowest registration rate, at 15%, while Lunda-Sul has the highest, at 71%. The numbers highlight the government's ineffectiveness in promoting mass birth registration, despite various programs and significant investments. The high rate of paternity evasion is cited as one of the main causes of the low registration rate.

**U.S. birth rate still near historical low: CDC**
The U.S. birth rate has risen by 1 percent in 2024 to 3.6 million, but remains near a historic low. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of births declined by an average of 2 percent per year between 2015 and 2020. The global fertility rate is 2.25 births per woman, while the U.S. fertility rate is 1.62 births per woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. As global birth rates continue to decline, the Trump administration is considering policies to reverse this trend in the United States, as stated by USA Today.

**Birth rates are close to a historic low: See charts**
The birth rate in the United States has reached a historic low, with 3.6 million births in 2024, a 1% increase from 2023. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the fertility rate in the US is 1.62 births per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. The fertility rate has been declining since 2014 and has fluctuated since. Allison Gemmill, a professor of family and reproductive health at Johns Hopkins University, notes that economic factors and societal expectations have led to people delaying parenthood, with the birth rate decreasing for women ages 20-24 and 15-19. However, the birth rate for women ages 40-44 increased 2% between 2023 and 2024. Brady Hamilton, a National Center of Health Statistics birth statistician, emphasizes the importance of birth rate and fertility rate data, which helps government agencies and companies prepare for the future and understand demographic changes.

**The Fertility of Immigrants and Natives in the United States, 2023**
According to a report by the Center for Immigration Studies, the overall total fertility rate (TFR) in the United States in 2023 was 1.8 children, with immigrants having a TFR of 2.19 and U.S.-born having a TFR of 1.73. The presence of immigrants raised the nation's overall TFR by about 0.08 children or 4.5 percent. However, the report also found that immigration's ability to increase fertility is limited by the relatively low fertility of every major racial group among the U.S.-born. The report also notes that immigration does increase births per thousand for the entire U.S. population, but the impact is still quite small, with a 6.6 percent increase from 11.2 births per thousand without immigrants to 11.9 births per thousand with immigrants. Additionally, the report found a negative correlation between the immigrant share of the population and the fertility rate of U.S.-born women in the nation's largest metropolitan areas, suggesting that immigration may reduce the fertility of the U.S.-born. The report also discusses the possible reasons why immigration may lower the fertility of the U.S.-born, including driving up housing costs, lowering wages, and straining public services. 'The long-term decline in fertility has been more pronounced for the foreign-born than the U.S.-born since 2008,' said the report. 'Though there was a modest post-Covid uptick in birth rates in 2021 and 2022, this increase had largely abated by 2023.'

**More than 3.6 million births recorded in the U.S. in 2024, up 1% from 2023**
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the provisional number of births in the United States in 2024 was 3,622,673, a 1% increase from 2023. The general fertility rate was 54.6 births per 1,000 females aged 15 to 44 years, a less than 1% increase from 2023. Birth rates declined for females aged 15 to 24 years, increased for women aged 25 to 44 years, and remained unchanged for those aged 10 to 14 and 45 to 49 years. The cesarean delivery rate increased from 32.3% in 2023 to 32.4% in 2024, while the preterm birth rate remained unchanged at 10.41%.

**America's baby bust laid bare: Shocking fall in mothers in graphs**
The US birth rate has hit a record low, with 3.62 million babies born in 2024, a 1% increase from 2023. The fertility rate was 54.6 births per 1,000 women between 15 and 44 years old, a less than 1% increase from 2023. Experts warn that the birth rate is still far below what's needed to sustain long-term population growth. Dr. Jamie Grifo, program director at New York University Langone Fertility Center, said, 'We're below zero population growth in the US, and have been for years.' The Trump administration is considering policies to encourage more people to have children, including tax incentives for parents, paid family leave, and child subsidies. Dr. Grifo also noted that women are having babies later in life, with the number of births to women in their late 30s rising by 3% from 2023 to 2024.

**Trump reportedly ponders $5K baby bonus as US fertility rate remains near record low | FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul**
The US birth rate has increased slightly to 3.6 million babies in 2024, up 1% from 2023, according to a CDC report. However, experts do not see this as evidence of reversing the long-term decline in birth rates. Hans-Peter Kohler, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist, said, 'I’d be hesitant to read much into the 2023-24 increase, and certainly not as an indication of a reversal of the trend towards lower or declining U.S. fertility.' The Trump administration is reportedly discussing ways to incentivize increasing the birth rate, including a potential $5,000 baby bonus. The average age of mothers at first birth has continued to rise, hitting 27 1/2 years, and birth rates have long been falling for teenagers and younger women, but rising for women in their 30s and 40s. The fertility rate in the US in 2024 was 54.6 births per 1,000 females ages 15–44, an increase of less than 1% from 2023.

**[Graphic News] Infertility treatments exceed 200,000 cases in 2022**
According to a report from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, there were 200,007 infertility treatment cases in 2022, a 36.7 percent increase from the past three years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) accounted for 83.4 percent of these treatments, while artificial insemination (IUI) made up 16.6 percent. Experts recommend that couples undergo fertility assessments before the age of 35 and prioritize natural conception, with IVF treatments being most common among women aged 35-39 and having an average success rate of 36.9 percent, with the highest success rate of 48.4 percent observed in women aged 25-29.

**The city where one in 10 women giving birth are aged 40 or older**
A new study from the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that 10.9 percent of women in San Francisco had babies when they were 40 or older in 2023, the highest age out of all U.S. counties with a population of at least 100,000. The average age of a Bay Area woman who gave birth that year was 33.6 years old. Experts attribute this shift to reproductive advancements like egg freezing and vitro fertilization, as well as the high cost of living in cities. 'We see a lot of patients after 40, even at 45 [giving birth],' said Lusine Aghajanova, a clinical associate professor in Stanford Medicine's obstetrics and gynecology department. Another expert, Sarah Hayford, noted that men are also waiting later to have children, and that people in cities, especially in expensive cities, tend to wait longer to have children due to the high cost of child care and housing.

**New study confirms Elon Musk's worst fear about life in the US**
A new study by Michigan State University has found that the percentage of Americans who do not want children has doubled over the past 20 years, from 14% in 2002 to 29% in 2023. The study, which analyzed data from 80,000 adults under 45, also found that the percentage of non-parents who plan to have children in the future has fallen from 79% to 59% over the same period. Elon Musk has been warning about the risks of low birth rates, but many demographers and experts have said his fears may be overstated. According to recent projections, the global population is expected to continue growing until it peaks around the mid-2080s, before experiencing a gradual decline. The fertility rate in the US has also plunged to a new low, with just under 3.6 million live births in 2023, sparking alarm about the shrinking workforce and taxpayer pool.

**US births fell to lowest level in decades in 2023**
The total number of births in the U.S. has reached a 44-year low, with 3.5 million births recorded in 2023, a level not seen since 1979. The total fertility rate also fell to 1.6 births per woman, a 2% decrease annually since 2007. This decline in birth and fertility rates is reflective of the global trend of women delaying or forgoing having children. The average age of first-time mothers has increased to 27.5 years, a record high. Teen birth rates have plummeted by 68% since 2007, while birth rates for women in their 30s have fallen by 3% since 2022. According to the report, use of prenatal care for pregnant women decreased from 2022 to 2023, with only 76% of pregnant women receiving prenatal care during the first trimester. 'Absent net immigration, the U.S. population will shrink' due to the falling total fertility rate, a key metric for determining the future of population levels.

**Italian IVF Births on the Rise, with 4.3% of Total Births in 2022**
According to the Italian Ministry of Health's annual report on the implementation of Law 40, the number of children born through in vitro fertilization (IVF) is increasing. In 2022, 16,718 children were born using various techniques, accounting for 4.3% of all births in Italy. The report highlights the growing trend of couples seeking assisted reproduction, with 87,192 couples seeking PMA in 2022, of which 74,099 used their own gametes and 13,093 used donor gametes. The number of embryos created and frozen has also increased, with 172,777 embryos created in 2022, of which 96,111 were deemed transferable, 76,736 were non-evolutive, and 62,618 were cryopreserved. The report notes that the success rate of IVF is still relatively low, with a success rate of 15.2% for all cycles initiated and 20% for couples who entered a fertility clinic. The report also highlights the increasing age of women seeking assisted reproduction, with an average age of 36.7 years, and the growing trend of using donor gametes, particularly ovociti, with an average age of 41.9 years.
