**Flight path shake-up promises quicker flights and fewer delays**
The UK government plans to modernize the country's flight paths through the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS), which aims to reduce journey times, delays, and emissions. The initial focus will be on London's airspace, with changes expected to come into effect in the 2030s. However, some changes outside of London could be implemented before then. Aviation Minister Mike Kane said, 'Modernising our airspace is also one of the simplest ways to help reduce pollution from flying and will set the industry up for a long-term, sustainable future.' But some residents, like Dr. Alan Lafferty, who lives near Heathrow, are concerned that new flight paths will make the situation worse for them. Tim Alderslade, head of Airlines UK, said the changes were 'long overdue' and called for swift action. Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2, also welcomed the announcement, saying it was 'excellent news' that would help achieve CO2 reductions. Finlay Asher, an aerospace engineer, emphasized the need to prioritize environmental impacts and community well-being. 'Using these changes to simply increase the number of polluting flights would send emissions soaring in the wrong direction,' he said.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak predicts a dystopian future for humanity, with the global population shrinking to 100 million by 2300 due to AI replacing jobs and causing a collapse in birth rates. According to Prof. Kak, 'Computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will be doing literally all that we do because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He warns that major cities like New York and London will become ghost towns, and that the world will be devastated. Prof. Kak, author of 'The Age of Artificial Intelligence', says that people are unaware of the consequences of AI and that it's likely that the world population will collapse. He also mentions that billionaire Elon Musk has expressed similar concerns, suggesting that humans should consider colonizing space to avoid extinction. Prof. Kak states, 'It's likely. I have all the data in the book. This is not just my personal opinion.'

**Londoners overwhelmingly support the Bakerloo line extension, according to a new report**
A recent survey of local businesses and residents in Southwark, Lewisham, Brent, and Westminster councils found that the majority support the proposed Bakerloo line extension. According to the poll, 89% of businesses back the proposal, with 76% of residents also in favor. The extension, which would modernize the 119-year-old line and add new stations and trains, is expected to bring benefits such as easier commutes, job access, and opportunities for local residents and businesses. As Mayor of Lewisham Brenda Dacres said, 'For too long, parts of Lewisham have been cut off from the Tube network -- but the Bakerloo Line Extension changes that.' Despite the strong support, the project still awaits government approval and funding, with a potential start date of 2030 and completion by 2040.

**Lessons from big cities that cut back cars**
Cities around the world are experimenting with policies to reduce traffic and improve air quality. New York City's congestion pricing policy, which charges cars up to US$9 a day to enter certain parts of Manhattan, has shown promising results, with commuting times decreasing on some of the busiest routes. In Paris, a 50kph speed limit on the city's outer ring road has led to a 12% improvement in air quality and a 17% decrease in traffic accidents. London's ultra-low emission zone has also had a positive impact on air quality, with a 33-39% decrease in nitrogen oxide emissions. These policies offer valuable lessons for cities looking to reduce traffic and improve air quality, according to Transport & Environment. 'Everyone in the capital is now breathing cleaner air because of ULEZ,' said Christina Calderato, Transport for London's director of strategy.

**NASA's Supersonic Aircraft Nears Liftoff, May Cut NYC To London Flight To 90 Mins**
NASA's supersonic aircraft, the X-59, is nearing liftoff and could potentially cut the travel time between New York City and London to just 90 minutes. The aircraft, dubbed the 'son of Concorde,' is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound, almost twice as fast as the original Concorde. Engineers are working to minimize the sonic boom by reducing the sound to a 'thump.' According to Cathy Bahm, the low boom flight demonstrator project manager, 'We are incredibly excited to reach this step in the mission. When the X-59 emerges from the paint barn with fresh paint and livery, I expect the moment to take my breath away because I’ll see our vision coming to life.' The first flight is scheduled for 2024, and NASA will collect data on people's perceptions of the sound it makes. This data will be sent to regulators, which could lead to the adjustment of current rules preventing commercial supersonic flight over land.
