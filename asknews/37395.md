**Spanish Prime Minister Vows to Raise Voice Against Gaza Genocide**
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez stated that they will raise their voices louder than ever against the situation in Gaza, where Israel continues to commit a genocide. Sanchez made the statement on the occasion of the first anniversary of Spain's official recognition of the State of Palestine. He said, 'One year has passed since the recognition of the State of Palestine, and the suffering in Gaza is unbearable, and Spain will continue to raise its voice louder than ever to put an end to the massacre that the world is witnessing today.' Spain is expected to impose sanctions on Israel during Sanchez's meeting with Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob in Madrid tomorrow. In May 2024, the Spanish government approved a resolution to officially recognize the State of Palestine. Israel, backed by the US, has been committing a genocide in Gaza since October 2023, resulting in over 177,000 Palestinians killed or injured, mostly children and women, and over 11,000 missing.

**Erdogan Appoints Team to Draft New Constitution, Raising Concerns Over His Future in Power**
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Tuesday that he has appointed a team of legal experts to begin working on a new constitution, sparking concerns that it will allow him to remain in power beyond 2028. Erdogan, who has been in power since 2014 and served as prime minister for over a decade before that, defended the need for a new constitution, saying that the current one, which was drafted after a 1980 military coup, is outdated and still retains elements of military influence despite several amendments. Erdogan said in a speech to local officials from his ruling party: 'I appointed 10 legal experts to start working on it as of yesterday, and we will continue, through this effort, to prepare for a new constitution. For 23 years, we have shown our genuine intention to crown our democracy with a new, civilian, and liberal constitution.' Erdogan denied that the new constitution is aimed at allowing him to remain in power, saying last week: 'We want the new constitution for our country, not for ourselves.' In 2017, the Turkish parliament approved constitutional amendments proposed by Erdogan's ruling party, which introduced a presidential system of government, giving the president powers to issue decrees, appoint ministers, and more. The amendments were approved in a national referendum the same year.

**Sánchez and Von der Leyen to Discuss EU Response to Trump's Tariffs and Gaza Crisis**
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez will meet with European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen in Brussels to discuss two key issues: the threat of US tariffs on the European Union and the escalating violence in Gaza. Sánchez will push for stronger EU action against Israel's military offensive in Gaza, which has resulted in over 53,000 Palestinian deaths, including more than 15,000 children, since October 2023. Spain is calling for the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement and individual sanctions against those obstructing a two-state solution in the Middle East, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The EU has already agreed to review its association agreement with Israel at the request of 17 countries, including Spain, to assess whether Israel is meeting its human rights obligations. Von der Leyen has delayed the imposition of a 50% tariff on EU products, which was set to take effect on June 1, and has given the US until July 9 to reach an agreement on tariffs. Meanwhile, Trump continues to escalate his trade war with China. Sánchez will also emphasize Spain's commitment to the Palestinian cause and its efforts to promote a just and lasting peace in the region.

**Erdogan Prepares New Turkish Constitution to Extend His Mandate**
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has appointed a team of experts to work on a new constitution, which critics say could allow him to stay in power beyond 2028. Erdogan, who has been president since 2014 and prime minister for over a decade before that, has argued that the current constitution, written after a military coup in 1980, is outdated and retains elements of military influence despite several amendments. 'Since yesterday, I have assigned ten legal experts to start their work, and with this effort, we will advance with the preparations for the new constitution,' Erdogan announced during a speech to local administrators of his ruling party. However, critics see the idea of a new constitution as a possible path to re-election. Erdogan denies that the reform aims to extend his stay in power, saying 'We want the new constitution not for ourselves, but for our country.' But Erdogan's ruling party and its nationalist allies lack the votes needed to pass a new constitution. Some analysts believe that the government's recent efforts to end the decades-long conflict with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) are part of a strategy to gain the support of a pro-Kurdish party in parliament for the new constitution. This comes two months after the arrest of Ekrem Imamoglu, the popular mayor of Istanbul and a key rival of Erdogan, on corruption charges. Many consider his arrest to have had political motives, although the government insists that the judiciary is independent and free from political influence.
