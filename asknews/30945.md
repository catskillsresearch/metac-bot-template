**The 'Magnificent Seven' Stocks: A Mixed Performance in 2025**
The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, have a combined market capitalization of over $14.6 trillion, representing more than 30% of the S&P 500. However, their group performance fell 14% in 2025. While these highly valued stocks have dominated the market in recent years, their high returns have not been seen in 2025, with the group's performance decreasing by 14%, while the rest of the S&P 500 increased by 0.8%. Despite this, the group's historical performance shows that they have significantly outperformed the rest of the market in the long term. However, some of the seven have had a more volatile price trajectory than others, with Nvidia performing well due to its innovative chip development, while Tesla's stock price fluctuated due to concerns about its growth prospects. Analysts recommend using momentum indicators to decide whether to invest in these stocks, as well as fundamental data such as sales, costs, and earnings. The growth of income is expected to continue, driven by the expansion of artificial intelligence. It is essential to remember the high volatility of most of these stocks, as well as the high correlation between their returns, which can have a significant impact on portfolios in both bullish and bearish markets. The future of these companies in investors' portfolios depends on the current technological boom and their ability to adapt to changing environments. When investing in these types of assets, it is crucial to consider the risks and challenges they represent, such as cybersecurity threats, economic crises, and market saturation. A careful and balanced analysis is required to include these assets in a portfolio, considering their strengths and the different factors that can impact their future performance.

**Secrets behind 'Magnificent 7' surge ahead of Nvidia earnings**
The 'Magnificent 7' stocks, which had underperformed in 2025 due to valuation concerns and macroeconomic risks, have seen a rally since the April 8 lows. This resurgence can be attributed to two key factors. Firstly, tech mega-caps like Microsoft and Alphabet significantly exceeded earnings estimates, beating analyst expectations by an average of 8% in the first quarter, according to Barclays' data. Secondly, the earnings growth for these major tech players in the first quarter was impressive, with large-cap tech stocks within the Mag 7 achieving an average earnings growth of 28%, compared to just 9% for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500, as revealed by Goldman Sachs' data.

**Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Semiconductor Stock Will Soar After May 28 | The Motley Fool**
The AI industry has seen significant growth in the past two years, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite generating returns of 58% and 87%, respectively. However, in 2025, there has been panic-selling across growth stocks due to concerns over President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Despite this, the author believes that the emotions are overblown and that Nvidia, a semiconductor king, could see its shares surge after its first-quarter results on May 28. The author points to recent updates from major AI companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Advanced Micro Devices, which are devoting significant resources to their AI-related pursuits. The author expects strong growth in the second half of the year and believes that Nvidia's stock will soar following its earnings report, with revenue and earnings expected to nearly double over the next two years. Su, a representative of AMD, expects production of their next-generation chip architecture to begin scaling up significantly in the latter part of the year, which the author sees as a positive trend for Nvidia. 'I think big tech's commitment to its infrastructure investments speaks volumes about how robust the hyperscalers expect the AI tailwind to be,' Su said. 'I know there are some uncertainties as it relates to tariffs and other things. But this is one of those areas where, from an infrastructure standpoint, there continues to be investment in AI infrastructure. And so with that, we would expect strong growth into the second half of the year.'

**Prediction: This Relentless Vanguard ETF Will Beat the S&P 500 Again in 2025**
The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (VOOG) has historically outperformed the S&P 500, with a 35.8% gain in 2024 and an average higher return since its launch in 2010. Despite a 17% decline year-to-date, driven by the recent tariffs imposed by President Trump, the ETF's top five holdings, including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon, are poised to bounce back in 2025. These companies are at the forefront of cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and are exempt from or less affected by the tariffs, making them a strong bet to beat the S&P 500 again in 2025.

**How Are 9 Out of the 11 Stock Market Sectors Outperforming the S&P 500 in 2025?**
Nine out of the 11 stock market sectors are outperforming the S&P 500 in 2025, according to the most commonly used classification system. This is because the S&P 500 is becoming more concentrated, with the top 7 companies (Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla) making up 32.6% of the index. These companies are underperforming the S&P 500 year-to-date, which is dragging down the index. Meanwhile, industry leaders in other sectors are doing well, allowing lower-weighted sectors to outperform the S&P 500. As a result, some investors may be selling out of overvalued stocks and turning to other pockets of the market for cheaper growth stocks or value and income stocks. However, experts advise against bouncing in and out of sectors or themes, and instead recommend being aware of how a handful of companies can move the S&P 500 and understanding what makes up an ETF or index fund before buying it.

**S&P 500 underperforming? Global AI-picked stocks surge 60%+ this year**
According to a Goldman Sachs research, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of European stocks hit a 35-year low compared to US stocks in early 2025. Investing.com's AI-powered team revealed a set of non-US stock strategies for 12 different markets, including Brazil, Germany, Italy, Spain, and South Korea. Members of InvestingPro who followed these strategies for under $2 per month have outperformed the US stock market, with gains of up to 96% this year. However, this does not mean investors should completely avoid the US market. Experienced investors will seek value in areas with lower valuations, leaving behind stocks with excessive exposure or high risk. Investing.com's AI model correctly predicted the decline of NVIDIA stock at the beginning of the year, allowing investors who followed its insights to gain 229.30% and avoid a 10.53% loss. The AI's ability to identify promising stocks before they become overvalued is due to its direct and recognized fundamental analysis approach, combined with advanced big data modeling and a rich history of market data.

**NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Among S&P 500 Stocks That Outperformed Bitcoin in 2024**
NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has outperformed Bitcoin in 2024, with a 1-year price performance of 99.93%. According to Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis, the company's favorable shift in expectations following Foxconn's revenue report is good news for NVIDIA. Manole Capital Management stated that NVIDIA was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. However, the article notes that while NVIDIA is a promising investment, certain AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns within a shorter time frame. Cathie Wood, founder of ARK Invest, predicts that Bitcoin will reach $1.5 million by 2030, while James Butterfill, head of research for CoinShares, estimates that Bitcoin values in 2025 might range between $80,000 and $150,000.

**Three reasons why Nvidia is underperforming the S&P 500 going into its earnings**
Nvidia (NVDA) shares have underperformed the S&P 500 by 9% in the past month, despite being the platform of choice for hyperscalers. EvercoreISI analyst Mark Lipacis points to three reasons for the weakness: 1) DeepSeek lowers AI demand, 2) DeepSeek shifts AI compute-cycles away from Nvidia GPUs, and 3) Blackwell chip delays. However, Lipacis remains bullish on Nvidia, saying 'Nvidia remains the platform of choice for hyperscalers' customers. The robustness of its software ecosystem and breadth of its development community put it 5-10 years ahead of anything else in the market.' Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy notes that DeepSeek's AI model, RI, has shattered the conventional wisdom that training amazing models was only possible for a handful of companies, saying 'What DeepSeek has done over the past few weeks is shatter that belief by saying they can train a model for $6 million.' Lipacis reiterated an Out-perform rating and $190 price target, and Bank of America's Vivek Arya has also reiterated Nvidia as his top pick for 2025.

**Prediction: This Relentless Vanguard ETF Will Crush the S&P 500 (Again) in 2025**
The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (VOOG) has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 (GSPC) since its establishment in 2010, with a total return of 35.9% in 2024 compared to the S&P 500's 25%. The ETF tracks the S&P 500 Growth index, which selects stocks based on momentum and sales growth, and currently holds 208 of the best-performing growth stocks. Top holdings such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are heavily invested in artificial intelligence (AI) and are experiencing strong growth as a result. With AI driving significant upside in America's largest tech stocks, the author predicts that the ETF will beat the index again in 2025. As the leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, Nvidia intends to dominate many subsegments of AI in the future, including autonomous vehicles and robotics.
