**US House of Representatives Introduces Bill to Repeal Inflation Reduction Act**
The US House of Representatives has introduced a bill to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides tax credits for electric vehicles. The bill, if passed, would eliminate the tax credit for electric vehicles assembled in the US and sold in the US, starting from 2027. The IRA has been a crucial factor in the growth of the US electric vehicle market, and its repeal could have significant implications for the industry. The bill's passage is uncertain, with some predicting that it will be blocked by opposition from Democrats and environmental groups. The bill's sponsors argue that the IRA's tax credits are too generous and are benefiting foreign companies, such as Hyundai and Kia, at the expense of US companies. However, others argue that the bill is a political gesture and that the IRA's tax credits have been a key factor in the growth of the US electric vehicle market. 'It was expected, but the passage is uncertain,' said Kim Pil-su, a professor at Daegu University. 'The bill's sponsors are trying to make a political statement, but the IRA's tax credits have been a crucial factor in the growth of the US electric vehicle market.'

**US House of Representatives Announces Tax Reform Plan to End Electric Vehicle Tax Credit by Next Year**
The US House of Representatives has announced a tax reform plan that will end the electric vehicle tax credit by next year. According to the Wall Street Journal, the plan aims to reduce and abolish certain provisions of the 'Inflation Reduction Act' (IRA) passed by the previous Biden administration. The tax credit for new electric vehicle purchases will end on December 31, 2025. However, manufacturers who sold fewer than 20,000 electric vehicles in the US between 2010 and 2024 will receive a one-year extension. The tax credit for commercial electric vehicles and used electric vehicles will also be provided until 2025. The IRA law had planned to maintain the tax credit for new and used electric vehicles until 2032. The tax credit for battery and renewable energy component production will also end in 2032. However, the tax credit for wind energy components will be maintained until 2027. The tax credit for renewable energy production or investment will be gradually reduced from 2029 and completely abolished in 2032. The tax credit for clean hydrogen production will end in 2026, but projects started this year will still receive benefits. The plan also prohibits tax credits for employee retention during the COVID-19 period and prevents some small businesses from avoiding state and local tax credits. The tax credit for university and foundation donations will be significantly increased. The annual tax rate for investment income generated from donations will be increased from 1.4% to a maximum of 21%. The tax rate for foundations will be increased from 1.39% to a maximum of 10%. The plan also introduces a new tax credit for tips and overtime, which will be provided until 2028. A 'MAGA account' worth $1,000 will be provided for children born between 2025 and 2028. The standard deduction and child tax credit will be temporarily increased, and the tax exemption for inheritances and family-owned businesses will be expanded. The highest tax rate will remain at 37%. If passed, it is estimated that the federal tax revenue will decrease by $490 billion. The House Ways and Means Committee will begin reviewing the tax plan on May 13 and aims to pass the bill by the end of the month, with the goal of receiving the president's signature by July 4. However, the Journal predicts that the bill may be defeated if there are some defections from the Republican Party in the House of Representatives. Some Republican lawmakers from districts where low-carbon energy projects are located are arguing that some tax credits should be maintained.

**US House Republicans to End Electric Vehicle Tax Credit a Year Early**
The US House of Representatives' Republican majority has decided to end the electric vehicle tax credit, which is based on the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a year earlier than planned. According to the Wall Street Journal, the House Ways and Means Committee included a provision in the tax bill to repeal the IRA's electric vehicle tax credit (30D) by 2027. The original deadline for the tax credit was December 31, 2022, but it was moved up to December 31, 2026. However, for electric vehicles purchased in 2026, the tax credit will be eliminated if the manufacturer has sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles in the US between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2025. The IRA allows taxpayers who purchase electric vehicles assembled in North America and meet certain battery and mineral requirements to claim a tax credit of up to $7,500. However, as President Trump is negative towards electric vehicles and needs to raise funds for his tax cuts, the Republican Party is expected to eliminate the electric vehicle tax credit, along with other clean energy initiatives from the previous Biden administration. The Republican bill also includes a provision to eliminate the '45W tax credit' for commercial electric vehicles after December 31, 2025. The '45W tax credit' is an exception that allows commercial electric vehicles, such as leased or rented vehicles, to claim the tax credit even if they do not meet the origin requirements. This exception was introduced to accommodate the requests of the Korean government and industry, but some Republicans have criticized it as a 'loophole' that goes against the intent of the law. The tax credit for used electric vehicle buyers will also be eliminated.

The original deadline for the tax credit was December 31, 2032, but the new bill advances it to December 31, 2026. Additionally, if a company sells more than 20,000 electric vehicles in the US between 2009 and 2025, their vehicles will no longer be eligible for the tax credit. The IRA allows taxpayers to claim up to $7,500 in tax credits for electric vehicles assembled in North America with key minerals and battery requirements met. However, to fund Trump's tax cuts, the Republican majority plans to repeal the electric vehicle tax credit and other clean energy initiatives from the previous Biden administration. The bill also proposes to repeal the '45W tax credit' for commercial electric vehicles after December 31, 2025. The '45W tax credit' is an exception that allows commercial electric vehicles to receive tax credits even if they do not meet the origin requirements. This decision is seen as a response to the Korean government and industry's requests, but some Republicans have criticized it as a 'loophole.' The tax credit for used electric vehicle buyers will also be repealed. The advanced manufacturing production tax credit (45X) for Korean battery companies will be phased out by 2031. The original plan was to gradually reduce the tax credit amount and phase it out by 2033, but the Republican bill will maintain it until the end of 2031. Additionally, products from prohibited foreign entities will no longer be eligible for tax credits, which is seen as a measure to prevent Chinese companies from benefiting from the tax credit.

**Energy Production, Investment Credits Phased Out in GOP Tax Bill**
House Republicans proposed phasing out clean energy business breaks and repealing electric vehicle and clean energy home improvement credits in their tax bill. The move aims to pay for extending tax cuts from the 2017 law, which is set to expire at the end of the year. The proposal targets the clean electricity production and investment credits, also known as 45Y and 48E, by phasing them out and restricting their use. This decision comes after Democrats unleashed billions of dollars in tax credits for clean energy projects in their 2022 tax-and-climate law. As one of the key provisions of the 2022 law, the credits have been a crucial incentive for clean energy investments.

**House GOP unveils bill text for slashing Biden energy tax credits**
The House GOP has unveiled a bill that would terminate and modify clean energy and manufacturing tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was passed by Democrats in 2022. The bill would eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, terminate the Clean Hydrogen Production 45V tax credit, and block wind energy from the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax. The legislation also subjects the Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits to a phase-out period and restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) criticized the bill, saying it would 'jack up prices on American families,' 'kill jobs,' and 'create chaos in the business community.'

**US House Republicans Propose Repeal of Electric Vehicle Tax Credit**
The US House of Representatives' Republican majority has proposed a bill to repeal the electric vehicle (EV) tax credit, which has benefited Korean companies such as Hyundai and Kia, by 2027. The bill, submitted on May 12, would also limit the tax credit to vehicles sold by manufacturers with cumulative sales of less than 200,000 units. This would effectively end the tax credit for most EV manufacturers, including Tesla, Ford, and General Motors, which have already exceeded the sales threshold. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) had provided a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of new EVs, but the new bill would limit this to vehicles sold by manufacturers with cumulative sales of less than 200,000 units. The '45W tax credit', which allowed for an exception to the origin requirement for commercial EVs, would also be repealed. The bill would also end the tax credit for used EV purchases and the '45X tax credit', which benefited Korean battery companies. The bill is expected to be passed by the House of Representatives by the end of the month and would then be sent to President Trump for approval.

However, to finance Trump's tax cut pledge, the Republican Party must cut other business budgets. As a result, the proposed bill is expected to eliminate not only the electric vehicle tax credit but also most of the clean energy support projects initiated by the previous Biden administration. The bill also plans to eliminate the '45W tax credit' for commercial electric vehicles after December 31, 2025. The '45W tax credit' is an exception that allows commercial electric vehicles, such as leased or rented cars, to claim the tax credit even if they do not meet the origin requirements.

**US Republicans Propose Bill to Eliminate Electric Vehicle Tax Credit**
The US House of Representatives' Republican majority has proposed a bill to eliminate the tax credit for electric vehicles and battery companies in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The bill aims to implement Donald Trump's tax cut promise. The Republican lawmakers have included a provision in the tax bill to repeal the electric vehicle tax credit (30D) in 2027, six years ahead of the original deadline of 2032. Additionally, the bill will exclude electric vehicles produced by companies that have sold over 20,000 electric vehicles in the US between 2009 and 2025 from the tax credit. The IRA allows taxpayers to claim a maximum tax credit of $7,500 for electric vehicles assembled in North America and meeting certain battery and material requirements. However, Trump's negative views on electric vehicles have led to a situation where the Republican Party must cut other business budgets to raise funds for their tax cut promise. As a result, the proposed bill is expected to eliminate not only the electric vehicle tax credit but also many of the clean energy support projects initiated by the previous Biden administration. The bill also aims to eliminate the '45W tax credit' provided for commercial electric vehicles, which was an exception to the original tax credit. This exception was made to accommodate the requests of the Korean government and industry.

**In Defense of the Consumer: A Call for Action**
Many people are struggling with the rising cost of living, including increased energy prices. According to the Federal Government, prices of goods and services will increase by 5.4% this year, while inflation will remain at least 3%. Energy prices are expected to rise by 7%. For Latinos, the situation is even more concerning, as a study by the University of Indiana found that two out of five Latinos have struggled to pay their electricity bills, and 18% have had their electricity disconnected at least once. However, solutions and benefits exist to help make life and finances brighter. Unfortunately, the administration is trying to end funding for the Home Appliance and Home Efficiency Rebate Project, but funds seem to be flowing again, benefiting low-income families. In Congress, important tax credits, such as the Home Energy Efficiency Improvement Credit (25C), are also under threat. These initiatives are part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which dedicates billions to help consumers save money on their energy bills. Despite political attacks on this law, there is growing Republican support to preserve tax credits in the manufacturing sector, which is creating good jobs for making batteries and electric vehicles. These savings initiatives should not be politicized because they benefit everyone in a non-partisan way. The 50 states, excluding South Dakota, have received approval to launch these rebate programs. Twelve states, including several with high Latino populations, have already launched their rebate programs, and 15 others have been granted funds after the November elections. These programs are extremely popular, with over 3.4 million families benefiting from the IRA in 2023, receiving $8.4 billion in tax credits to electrify and make their homes more efficient. Additionally, they promoted the creation of 142,000 jobs in the clean energy economy. In summary, rebate programs achieve: Reducing energy inflation costs. Creating local jobs. Boosting the manufacturing sector. And strengthening the national electrical grid and energy security. Consumers face significant inflationary pressure, labor market uncertainty, and the rigors of the climate crisis. The Inflation Reduction Act and its historic aid and benefits approved by Congress constitute a well-deserved relief, especially for low- and moderate-income families.

**790,000 Jobs, $160 Billion GDP: Shocking Costs Of Inflation Reduction Act Repeal**
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has attracted $600 billion in new private investment and created over 406,000 new jobs through its federal clean energy tax credits and government funding programs. However, proposals to repeal the IRA could halt this economic engine, resulting in a staggering price for America's economy and households. According to New Energy Innovation modeling, if the IRA is repealed, the United States would lose nearly 790,000 jobs and $160 billion in GDP by 2030. American households would also be forced to pay $32 billion in higher cumulative household energy bills between 2025 and 2035. Congressman Buddy Carter said, 'This is the largest investment in the state of Georgia's history, one that will diversify and expand our economy while providing strong job opportunities for Georgians today and for generations to come.' However, Trump administration proposals to repeal the IRA could cancel announced factories and expected private investment, resulting in a significant economic slowdown. As John Ketchum, CEO of NextEra, warned, 'if you take renewables and storage off the table, we're going to force electricity prices to the moon.'

**Four Paths for Inflation Reduction Act Reforms**
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has introduced new tax breaks, but many of these subsidies are more expensive than initially forecasted. Policymakers are considering repealing these subsidies to extend expiring tax cuts. However, full repeal may be difficult due to support from some Republican lawmakers. House Speaker Mike Johnson described the likely approach to IRA reform as 'somewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer.' The IRA's green credits are projected to cost $1.16 trillion from 2025 to 2034, but repealing all green energy tax credits could raise $851 billion over the same period. A more targeted approach would be to eliminate specific provisions, such as the EV tax credits, which have numerous problems, including high inframarginal payments. Repealing the tax credits for electric vehicles, refueling property, and clean fuel production, as well as the tax credits aimed at the residential sector, could raise $295 billion. Alternatively, gutting the 'Everything Bagel' approach by repealing many of the add-on subsidies attached to the clean energy provisions and leaving the core credits in place could be a more feasible option. This could involve setting up a replacement PTC with a flat rate of 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, adjusted for inflation annually. This option could raise $207 billion. A more aggressive option, featuring repeal of most of the credits in the IRA, could raise $746 billion.

**Biogas IRA Tax Credit Changes for Municipal Utilities in**
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has provided significant opportunities for municipal utilities to capitalize on biogas projects through substantial Investment Tax Credits (ITCs). Under the Section 48 tax regime, eligible biogas energy properties, including digesters and biogas cleaning equipment, have received tax credits ranging from a few hundred thousand dollars to tens of millions of dollars. However, with the transition to the new Section 48E tax regime for projects starting construction on or after January 1, 2025, the focus has shifted to electricity production and net-zero requirements. According to Baker Tilly, municipal utilities can still maximize ITCs by meeting the IRS 80/20 rule for replacement or improvements to qualifying biogas projects. The direct pay provision continues to be available for IRA ITCs, which can be seen as a reimbursable grant for municipal utilities. It is recommended to move projects forward as quickly as possible due to possible changes to the IRA in the next couple of years.

**IRA tax credit repeal would drive up electricity prices, system costs: reports**
Repealing the Inflation Reduction Act's technology-neutral tax credits for clean electricity could lead to a 7.3% increase in electricity prices for residential customers and a 10.6% increase for commercial and industrial customers by 2029, according to reports from The Brattle Group and NERA Economic Consulting. The full repeal could also reduce direct spending in the power sector by $250 billion and cause a $510 billion decline in U.S. gross domestic product through 2035. ConservAmerica President Jeff Kupfer said, 'As Congress moves forward, we want to ensure that policymakers have the benefit of real economic data about the impacts of eliminating clean energy credits.' The reports also found that wind and solar deployments would fall about 50% through 2035, and a 'shortfall of supply to meet power need' could develop, potentially holding back industrial growth.

**Final Regulations Released for the Clean Electricity Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program**
The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service have released final regulations for the Clean Electricity Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program. Introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the program allows the Secretary of the Treasury to allocate capacity limits that increase the Section 48E credit amount. The final regulations set annual capacity limits for four categories of facilities, totaling 1.8 gigawatts, and include a redistribution plan to manage unallocated capacity. According to the regulations, applications submitted within the first 30 days of each application period will be treated as simultaneous, while those submitted after will be reviewed in the order received. The regulations are effective as of January 13, 2025, but may be subject to review and overturn through the Congressional Review Act.

**Mayors across the US urge Congress not to repeal clean energy tax credits**
A letter signed by 133 local leaders from 39 states is urging Congress to protect clean energy tax credits made available to state and local governments. The tax credits, created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), have led to the creation of 750 clean energy projects, 400,000 new jobs, and over $422 billion in investments. However, the Trump administration froze funding for programs under the IRA, putting the tax credits' future in jeopardy. The letter warns that repealing or adjusting the tax credits will 'upend countless energy projects and jobs across our country, endangering millions of American jobs, increasing costs for everyday Americans, costing billions in taxpayer dollars, and potentially forcing American jobs overseas.' Kate Gallego, Phoenix's mayor, said the pause in tax credits has created uncertainty for local governments and businesses, and that without certainty, many projects can't move forward. The letter also states that repealing the tax credits would raise electric bills for Americans by roughly $489 a year and cut jobs.

**Treasury Issues Final Regulations on Technology Neutral Clean Energy Projects**
The US Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service have issued final regulations for technology-neutral tax credits for clean energy projects under Sections 45Y and 48E of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The regulations provide additional rules and guidelines for calculating a facility's greenhouse gas emissions rate and boundaries for performing lifecycle analysis. The technology-neutral production tax credit (45Y PTC) and technology-neutral investment tax credit (48E ITC) will replace many existing credits under Sections 45 and 48, and are available for facilities placed in service after December 31, 2024. The regulations also clarify the definition of 'alternative fate' and prohibit the use of book-and-claim accounting systems to establish or claim the energy attributes of fuels and feedstocks. Additionally, the regulations provide guidance on the One-Megawatt Exception, incremental cost, ownership, hydrogen energy storage property, and the 80/20 and Incremental Production Rules.

**Tech-Neutral Credits Final Regulations Released for Clean Electricity Production**
The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service have released final regulations for the Tech-Neutral Credits, a new tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The credits include the clean electricity production credit under Section 45Y (Section 45Y PTC) and the clean electricity investment credit under Section 48E (Section 48E ITC). The Section 45Y PTC is available for qualified facilities that generate electricity with a greenhouse gas emissions rate not greater than zero and are placed in service after 2024. The Section 48E ITC is available for qualified investments in qualified facilities that generate electricity with a greenhouse gas emissions rate not greater than zero and are placed in service after 2024, or energy storage technology. The Tech-Neutral Credits are subject to special phaseout rules, which begin on the later of 2032 or the calendar year in which the IRS determines that the annual GHG emissions from U.S. electricity production are 25% or less of the 2022 levels. The final regulations provide standards for an eligible metering device and definitions for related and unrelated persons. Taxpayers must own at least a fractional interest in an entire unit of a qualified facility or energy storage technology to claim the Tech-Neutral Credits. The regulations also provide rules for incremental production, the 80/20 Rule, and qualified interconnection property. Co-located qualified facilities are eligible to claim the Tech-Neutral Credits, provided the cost basis for the shared property is properly allocated in proportion to each taxpayer's ownership interest.

**US state attorneys general urge Congress to keep IRA clean energy credits**
A coalition of 17 US state attorneys general has sent a letter to Congress urging them to retain investments under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Since the IRA's passage in 2022, businesses have invested nearly $500 billion in low-carbon energy and domestic manufacturing, with private investment exceeding public spending five- to six-fold. The coalition is concerned that repealing certain tax credits, such as the Section 45X credit for advanced manufacturing, the Section 48C credit for investments in advanced energy, and the Section 48E clean electricity investment credit, could stymie important projects and leave gaps where jobs and revenue streams were expected. The letter highlights several large projects already benefiting US communities, including a $150 million investment by Siemens in a power transformer factory in North Carolina, which will create over 550 jobs, and a $1.6 billion investment by Our Next Energy in an electric vehicle battery gigafactory in Michigan, which will employ over 2,000 people by 2027. 'Our nation is strengthening domestic energy security, reducing energy costs, diversifying our domestic energy resources, rebuilding our domestic manufacturing economy, bolstering and modernizing critical infrastructure, and creating well-paying jobs while simultaneously reducing harmful pollution,' the letter said.
