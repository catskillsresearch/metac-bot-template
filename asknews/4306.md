**The moon: Why we want to go back**
NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole, called Artemis Base Camp, and launch a new space station, Gateway, into the moon's orbit. A joint China-Russia project, the International Lunar Research Station, also plans to build a moon base by 2035. The moon's resources, including water, regolith, and helium-3, make it an attractive destination for future space missions. These resources can be used to sustain lunar bases, extract minerals from asteroids, and even provide fuel for nuclear fusion power. The moon's distance from Earth also makes it an ideal location for testing technologies and equipment for future Mars missions. According to Sara Pastor, ESA's Lunar and Gateway Program Manager, 'Humans have had a continued presence in space for the past 20 years aboard the International Space Station. But the ISS is only 250 miles away in low-Earth orbit, which is as little as four hours after launching from Earth. The moon is 250,000 miles away -- about three days' spaceflight -- and a far riskier journey for astronauts.' The first research on the moon aims to make that journey safer and easier, and to determine how human activity affects the lunar environment. 'ESA is developing instruments for radiation environment measurements, drilling and in-situ sample analysis, geophysics and lunar space weather,' Pastor said. The long-term goal of building surface and orbital moon bases is to serve as a staging post for more distant space travel, and to provide a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration, as Pastor noted, 'A colony on the moon will be extremely useful and a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration.'

**American, European, and Japanese Missions to Explore the Moon**
After a half-century since the Apollo mission left footprints on the moon, the moon has re-emerged as a destination for ambitious and precise engineering. However, this time, the competition is not limited to the major powers competing to raise their flags on the moon, but also private companies, multi-national partnerships, and 'robotic scouts', all seeking to explore the moon and pave the way for human return in the future. The Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) assessment test results released by the school system show that literacy levels have improved across the board for kindergarteners, first- and second-graders in the Montgomery County Public Schools system. The DIBELS assessment consists of short tests that measure phonics, reading fluency and other literacy skills, depending on the age group. The fall 2023 DIBELS assessment results showed 49.9% of kindergarten students, 58.0% of first-graders, and 60.4% of second-grade students met or went above benchmark status. That's up from fall 2022, when results showed 47.0% of kindergarten students, 52.5% of first-graders and, 56.0% of second-graders met or went above benchmark literacy goals for their age group. The moon's surface topography makes landing on it a challenging task. The moon's gravity is weaker than Earth's, and the surface is covered with craters, mountains, and lava flows. The moon's rotation is also synchronized with its orbit around Earth, which means that the same side of the moon always faces our planet. This makes it difficult to land on the moon's surface, as the spacecraft must navigate through the moon's gravitational field and avoid obstacles such as craters and mountains. The European Space Agency (ESA) is planning to launch the Lunar Pathfinder, a small lunar satellite, to facilitate communication between future missions and Earth. The mission will be launched in 2025 and will provide a communication relay for future missions, especially those that will operate on the far side or at the poles of the moon. The US company Intuitive Machines is planning to launch the IM-3 mission in late 2025 to test new advanced tools and possibly transfer NASA experiments to the moon. The mission will be launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and will include a lunar lander and a rover. The rover will be designed to explore the moon's surface and collect samples, while the lander will provide a platform for the rover to operate from. The mission will also include a communication relay to facilitate communication between the rover and Earth. The mission is part of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon by 2024. The program includes several missions, including the IM-3 mission, which will test new technologies and provide a platform for future missions to the moon. The mission will also include a lunar lander and a rover, which will be designed to explore the moon's surface and collect samples. The rover will be equipped with advanced instruments, including a drill and a spectrometer, which will allow it to collect and analyze samples from the moon's surface. The mission will also include a communication relay to facilitate communication between the rover and Earth. The mission is expected to launch in late 2025 and will provide a significant step forward in the exploration of the moon.

**Turkey Aims to be First to Send Two Exploration Vehicles to Moon's South Pole**
Turkey aims to be the first country to send two exploration vehicles to the Moon's south pole simultaneously. The 'CHERI' vehicles, developed by ODTÜ ROMER researchers, will land on the Moon's surface in 2028 as part of China's Chang'e-8 mission. They will create a 3D map of the surface using artificial intelligence, despite the harsh conditions. ODTÜ Aviation and Space Engineering Department Professor Dr. Halil Ersin Söken said, 'Currently, there are 5 countries that can send rovers to the Moon. We aim to be the 6th country to successfully complete this mission and the first to operate two rovers simultaneously on the Moon's surface.' Rektor Prof. Dr. Ahmet Yozgatlıgil added, 'This project will enable us to establish Turkey's presence on the Moon's surface in 2028.' Meanwhile, the Turkish government has announced several other initiatives, including the digital transformation of tapu and kadastro processes, which will reduce processing times to seconds. Additionally, the Diyanet has issued a warning that kurban animals sacrificed before the Bayram namazı are invalid. The Turkish Parliament will also convene this week to elect a new Speaker and discuss the 10th Yargı Paketi. Furthermore, the government has introduced a new regulation requiring musicians and instrumentalists to obtain a professional license, and there has been an increase in interest in camping and caravaning ahead of the summer season and Bayram holiday.

**Elon Musk targets 2026 for first space mission to Mars**
Elon Musk aims to launch the first space mission to Mars by the end of 2026, but acknowledges that overcoming technological hurdles, particularly in-orbit refueling, is crucial for the long journey. A favorable planetary alignment in late 2026 provides a unique opportunity for a relatively short transit between Earth and Mars. If Starship is not ready by then, a new mission in 2028 would be targeted. The first mission would consist of -built Optimus humanoid robots. Despite failed test flights, including a fuel leak and uncontrolled spinning on the ninth test flight, Musk remains optimistic, citing each failure as valuable data for accelerated testing. NASA relies on Starship for its Artemis program, which aims to send astronauts to the moon as early as 2027, a stepping stone to possible human missions to Mars in the 2030s. Musk's ultimate vision is to launch up to 2,000 Starships every two years to establish a permanent and self-sustaining human settlement on Mars.

**White House to Nominate New NASA Administrator, Citing Trump's 'America First' Agenda**
The White House announced on Saturday that it will nominate a new candidate for NASA administrator, just days before the current nominee, billionaire Jared Isaacman, faces a Senate confirmation vote. According to White House spokesperson Liz Huston, 'It is essential that the next leader of NASA is completely aligned with President Trump's 'America First' agenda, and President Trump will announce a replacement directly soon.' Isaacman, a former Democratic donor, had found support in the space industry and Congress, but some lawmakers expressed concerns about his close ties to Elon Musk's SpaceX. Isaacman has spent an undisclosed amount of his own money on two SpaceX missions, while Shift4 Payments has provided SpaceX with $27.5 million in funding. Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet unit, is also a client. The White House's change of heart, reported earlier by Semafor, comes a day after Trump published a detailed budget plan that calls for a 25% cut in NASA's budget compared to the previous year, with significant reductions in its scientific portfolio; cuts that Isaacman has said would not be 'an optimal outcome.' Isaacman's representatives declined to comment, and Isaacman did not respond to our request for comment. Isaacman is the CEO of Shift4 Payments, which processes payments for restaurants, tourist complexes, hotels, casinos, and stadiums. During his confirmation hearing, Isaacman argued that NASA can conduct missions to the Moon and Mars 'in parallel,' walking a tightrope between the desires of Congress and the administration. 'The NASA administrator will help guide humanity to space and execute the bold mission of President Trump to plant the American flag on Mars,' said Huston. The Trump budget request described significant changes to NASA's Artemis program to return Americans to the Moon, including the gradual retirement of the Boeing Co.-built Space Launch System and its replacement with a more economical and commercially used system. Isaacman had previously criticized the SLS for being too expensive and delayed. However, when a senator asked if he would make changes to the Artemis program, Isaacman said that the SLS is the best and fastest way to get to the Moon, but doubted its long-term viability for frequent trips to the Moon and Mars. Isaacman also stated that he wanted to see NASA 'launch more telescopes, more probes, (and) more explorers,' which appears to contradict the recent budget request from Trump, which proposes canceling scientific missions and pushes for a more privately-led era of US space exploration.

**Future Lunar Landings to be Broadcast in High Definition**
The world was amazed by the images of Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969, although they were not in high definition. Now, as NASA prepares to send new astronauts to the moon with the Artemis program, they want to show everything in high definition. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the European Space Agency simulated a lunar walk in a realistic scenario at the LUNA laboratory in Germany, which mimics lunar conditions for testing equipment and procedures. They were able to capture images of the astronauts exiting the landing module, exploring their surroundings, and taking 'selfies'. The goal is to meet the high expectations of the large audience that wants to follow the mission with high-quality images.

**Improving PVT Estimation for Safe Lunar Landing Missions**
Researchers have proposed an advanced navigation architecture for safe lunar landing missions, combining multi-sensor fusion and resilient PVT techniques. The study aims to improve PVT estimation for future lunar missions, such as Artemis and Argonaut, by utilizing a navigation constellation around the Moon. The proposed architecture integrates the Visual-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithm with navigation constellation observables and additional sensor measurements to provide accurate estimates of the lander's position along its trajectory. The VBN algorithm is capable of processing vast, fully synthetic datasets to train AI-powered technologies or build high-fidelity mission DT. According to the study, the proposed architecture has shown promising results in various scenarios, including absolute and relative VBN algorithm performance, and VBN/IMU/Altimeter + 1 navigation satellite performance. The researchers believe that this advanced navigation architecture will play a crucial role in the success of future lunar missions.

**NASA Changes Artemis Promise To "Land The First Woman" On The Moon Following Trump Executive Order**
NASA has changed the goal of its Artemis program to 'land the first woman' on the Moon, removing references to 'first person of color' and 'first international partner astronaut' from its website. This change follows a Trump executive order that aims to stop diversity, equality, and inclusion initiatives. NASA has also eliminated 23 positions related to diversity and inclusion, and fired its chief scientist and chief technologist. The Artemis program has experienced delays and is now scheduled to land on the Moon in mid-2027, but many are skeptical about this date. The program has commissioned moon-lander vehicles from SpaceX and Blue Origin, but doubts are growing about their safety. NASA is currently being run by acting administrator Janet Petro, and the nominee for the position is billionaire Jared Isaacman, who has flown to space twice on privately run missions with an equal number of men and women. 'In keeping with the President's Executive Order, we're updating our language regarding plans to send crew to the lunar surface as part of NASA's Artemis campaign,' said Jimi Russell, Senior Public Affairs Officer at NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate. 'We look forward to learning more about the Trump Administration's plans for our agency and expanding exploration at the Moon and Mars for the benefit of all.'

**NASA Scraps Plan To Land 1st Woman And Person Of Colour On Moon. Here's Why**
NASA has dropped its plan to land the first woman and person of colour on the moon as part of its Artemis programme, citing US President Donald Trump's directive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices at federal agencies. The space agency has deleted the DEI promise from its 2027 Artemis mission statement, according to a report in The Guardian. NASA spokesperson Allard Beutel confirmed the development, stating that the agency was keeping in line 'with the president's executive order.' The new mission statement reads: 'With NASA's Artemis campaign, we are exploring the Moon for scientific discovery, technology advancement, and to learn how to live and work on another world as we prepare for human missions to Mars.' NASA's long-standing promise was central to its Artemis programme which hopes to send humanity back to the Moon's surface in 2027 for the first time since the Apollo mission in 1972.

**NASA's Artemis Mission: A Step Closer to Returning Humans to the Moon**
NASA is accelerating its plans to return humans to the Moon with the Artemis mission. A new video from the space agency shows the details of the mission, which will send astronauts to the Moon for the first time in over 50 years. The mission, Artemis II, will be a 10-day flight test that will not include a lunar landing, while Artemis III, scheduled for 2027, will be the first mission to land humans on the Moon. The video shows the astronauts, Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, boarding the Orion spacecraft and explaining the different phases of the mission. The Space Launch System (SLS) rocket will launch the spacecraft into space, and the Orion spacecraft will separate from the rocket after six minutes. The spacecraft will then perform a series of complex maneuvers, including a lunar flyby and a return to Earth, where the astronauts will be rescued in the Pacific Ocean. 'This is a historic moment for space exploration,' said NASA officials. 'We are one step closer to returning humans to the Moon and eventually sending them to Mars.'
