**UK Digital Banks: Starling Struggles, Monzo Rises, and Revolut Soars**
Three UK digital banks, Starling, Monzo, and Revolut, were once seen as revolutionizing the financial services industry with their cutting-edge technology, superior customer experience, and sleek mobile interfaces. However, their paths have diverged. Revolut and Monzo are experiencing record growth, while Starling is facing a financial and reputational crisis. Starling's annual results showed a significant drop in profitability, with a loss of £223 million in 2024, compared to £301 million in the previous year. The company has been hit with a £29 million fine from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for serious deficiencies in its anti-money laundering controls. Revolut, on the other hand, has surpassed 50 million customers worldwide and recorded over £1 billion in profits this year, a remarkable achievement for a company that has struggled with regulatory delays and governance issues. Monzo's customer base has grown by 31% to 9.7 million in 2024, and deposits have increased by 88% to £11.2 billion. Revolut is planning an initial public offering (IPO) of £6 billion on the London Stock Exchange, one of the most anticipated IPOs of the year in the UK.

**Russia Enters the Satellite Internet Race with 'Bureau 1440' Project**
Russia plans to create its own low-orbit satellite group to provide high-speed internet access. This ambitious task is part of the national project 'Economy of Data' and could lead to significant changes in the telecommunications market. The global race for satellite internet has been ongoing, with SpaceX leading the way with its Starlink project, which has over 4,750 operational satellites and serves over 2 million customers in 60 countries. However, Russia does not want to be left behind and has announced its own project, 'Sfera', which aims to launch a satellite group to provide connectivity across the country. The company 'IKS Holding' has already launched the first three low-orbit satellites as part of the 'Bureau 1440' project, with plans to launch 700 satellites by 2035. According to Mikhail Mishustin, the Prime Minister of Russia, the goal is to create a group that will meet the needs of fast internet not only in Russia but also in friendly countries. The project has already undergone several test launches, including a successful test of a laser communication system with a data transfer speed of up to 10 Gbps over a distance of 1,000 km. Experts note that creating a Russian analogue of Starlink is a complex and ambitious task that will require significant financial and technological resources. 'We have never had a low-orbit satellite group, which should appear by 2028... To solve this problem, which has not been solved for decades, using a low-orbit satellite group is possible,' said Denis Kuskov, general director of the analytical agency TelecomDaily. The project 'Bureau 1440' will compete with the 'Sfera' project from Roscosmos, which also aims to create a satellite group for internet access. According to Mikhail Mishustin, the goal is to increase the number of satellites in orbit by several times, which will significantly improve the quality of services for the state, citizens, and business. 'To implement the tasks set by the President, it is necessary to increase the composition of the orbital group of spacecraft by several times, which will allow significantly improving the quality of services for the state, citizens, and business,' said Mikhail Mishustin. The head of Roscosmos, Yuri Borisov, announced that the production of satellites in Russia will start in 2026, which will require 60 billion rubles. It remains to be seen whether this ambitious task will be implemented.
