**Today's Lowest Mortgage Rates by State - June 10, 2025**
The states with the lowest 30-year mortgage rates on Monday, June 10, 2025, were New York, Colorado, California, Connecticut, Washington, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, with averages ranging from 6.87% to 6.97%. In contrast, the states with the highest rates were Alaska, West Virginia, Mississippi, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Vermont, with averages between 7.05% and 7.13%. Mortgage rates vary by state due to differences in lender operations, credit scores, loan sizes, and regulations. According to Sabrina Karl, a full-time staff writer at Investopedia, 'it's always smart to shop around for your best mortgage option and compare rates regularly.' Rates on 30-year new purchase mortgages fell 2 basis points to 7.00% on Monday, a slight improvement from mid-May 2022's high of 7.15%, but still higher than the 6.50% average in March and the 5.89% two-year low in September.

**Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, June 10, 2025: Rates slip ever so slightly lower**
Mortgage interest rates have decreased slightly, with the 30-year fixed rate dropping to 6.83% and the 15-year fixed rate falling to 6.06%, according to Zillow. The decrease is attributed to bond market yields falling, which has led to a decrease in the 10-year Treasury, a benchmark for mortgage rates. Economists do not expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2025, and rates may only ease slightly lower due to the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. As a general rule, 15-year mortgage rates are lower than 30-year mortgage rates, and making extra mortgage payments on a 30-year loan can help pay off the mortgage faster and save on interest.

**Mortgage Rates Go Down Over the Last Week: Today's Mortgage Rates for June 10, 2025**
Despite forecasts of falling mortgage rates, the housing market remains unaffordable for most buyers. The average 30-year fixed rate has remained near 7% for seven months, leading to high monthly payments. The average 30-year fixed rate is 6.90% today, a decrease of -0.07% from last week. Experts recommend shopping around and comparing multiple offers to get the lowest rate. Jeb Smith, a licensed real estate agent, said, 'Some are waiting, others are getting pre-approved now so they're ready to act if rates fall.' Mortgage rates are closely tied to the bond market and are influenced by inflation, labor data, and monetary policy. According to Smith, 'Rates could fall if inflation keeps cooling and the labor market softens.' However, numerous risks could keep rates elevated, making it difficult for mortgage rates to drop below 6% without a job-loss recession. Fannie Mae expects rates around 6.1% by the end of 2025 and 5.8% by the end of 2026.

**Refi Rates Ride High: Current Refinance Rates on June 10, 2025**
Average mortgage refinance rates have been volatile between 6.5% and 7% due to concerns about inflation and economic slowdown. Despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts last year, rates remain too high for most homeowners to save money from refinancing. However, if you're looking to change the length of your loan or switch to a different type of mortgage, refinancing might still be a good option. Experts recommend shopping around and comparing multiple offers to get the lowest rate. Logan Mohtashami, lead analyst at HousingWire, suggests that homeowners who purchased property when rates were high should consider refinancing to see if it makes sense for their budget. The current average interest rate for a 30-year refinance is 6.97%, while the average 15-year fixed refinance rate is 6.29% and the average rate for a 10-year fixed refinance loan is 6.15%.

**Mortgage and refinance interest rates today for June 9, 2025: Steady on the 30-year, slightly lower on the 15-year**
According to Zillow data, the current mortgage interest rates for June 9, 2025, are steady at 6.85% for the 30-year fixed mortgage and slightly lower at 6.14% for the 15-year fixed mortgage. The 10-year Treasury yields rose more than 2.5% on Friday, which may lead to sharply higher mortgage rates in the coming days. Homebuyers can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator to estimate their monthly mortgage payment. The calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance. For a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.81% rate, the monthly payment would be about $1,798, and the total interest paid over the life of the loan would be $371,767. In contrast, a 15-year mortgage with a 6.14% rate would have a monthly payment of $2,346 and total interest paid of $146,739.

**Home Loan Rates Improve for Borrowers: Mortgage Rates for June 5, 2025**
Mortgage rates have improved for borrowers, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate at 6.90% and the average rate for a 15-year fixed mortgage at 6.09%. Despite the recent decline, experts predict that rates will remain stuck between 6.5% and 7% for the time being. The Federal Reserve is adopting a wait-and-see approach, and any changes to interest rates will depend on economic factors such as inflation, labor data, and global trade policies. Logan Mohtashami, senior analyst at HousingWire, said, 'If President Trump eases some of his aggressive tariff measures or if the labor market deteriorates, it could prompt the Fed to resume easing interest rates.' Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage, noted that 'bond yields will only drop if the rate of inflation continues to drop and the economy weakens.'

**Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, June 4, 2025: Rates drop across the board**
Mortgage interest rates have dropped across the board, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.79%, the 20-year fixed rate dropping to 6.46%, and the 15-year mortgage rate slipping to 5.94%. According to Zillow, the 15-year fixed mortgage is the best bargain, slipping below 6%. The main advantages of a 30-year fixed mortgage are lower payments and predictable monthly payments, but it comes with a higher rate and more interest paid over the life of the loan. In contrast, a 15-year fixed mortgage has lower interest rates and the potential to save hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest, but comes with higher monthly payments. Adjustable-rate mortgages offer a lower introductory rate, but come with unpredictable monthly payments and the risk of increasing rates later. To secure a low mortgage refinance rate, it's recommended to improve your credit score, lower your debt-to-income ratio, and consider refinancing into a shorter term.

**Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, June 1, 2025: The 30-year drops while the 15-year edges higher**
According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed interest rate is down seven basis points to 6.77%, while the 15-year fixed rate gained three basis points to 6.02%. The Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts 30-year rates to stay near 6.7% through September and end the year near 6.6%. To get the lowest mortgage rate, focus on improving your personal finances, such as saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down debt. When choosing a lender, consider the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR), which factors in the interest rate, discount points, and fees. The national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.77%, but rates can vary depending on the area and individual circumstances.

**Mortgage Rate Predictions for the Week of May 26- June 1, 2025**
Mortgage rates are expected to remain above 6.5% this year, according to housing market experts. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 7.02% on Tuesday, compared to 6.75% at the start of May. Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, attributes the increase to rising federal government debt levels and Moody's recent downgrading of the US credit rating. Sturtevant notes that growing uncertainty will make this a slower-than-typical spring housing market. Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage, says that financial markets hate uncertainty and that mortgage rates will remain elevated. Experts caution that higher inflation due to President Trump's tariffs could derail the Federal Reserve's anticipated rate cuts. While longer-term housing market forecasts call for a gradual decline in borrowing costs, the potential for sub-6% mortgage rates in 2025 is slim. Financial experts recommend making a homebuying budget and sticking to it, and suggest strategies for lowering individual mortgage rates, such as securing a lower mortgage rate, improving credit score, making a larger down payment, or choosing a more affordable home.

**This Week's Mortgage Rate Predictions, March 10-16, 2025**
Mortgage rates are expected to remain above 6.5% for most of 2025, according to Fannie Mae. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped from around 6.9% to around 6.6% over the last month, but a shaky economy and uncertainty regarding tariffs, trade, and government spending may keep rates stuck in the limbo. Colin Robertson, a mortgage industry expert, said that 'with uncertainty regarding tariffs, trade, and government spending, mortgage rates might be stuck in limbo.' Experts recommend building a strong credit score, saving for a bigger down payment, shopping for mortgage lenders, and considering mortgage points to negotiate a better rate. 'This is not a rosy picture,' said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's Analytics. 'When lower mortgage rates are based on an expectation of slower economic growth, that's far from a desirable economic environment,' Colyar added. The Federal Reserve's interest rate adjustments will influence the mortgage market, and experts anticipate that the Fed could resume cutting interest rates in May or June when it's clear if there is an increased risk of a job-loss recession.

**Mortgage and refinance rates for Feb. 13, 2025: Average rates steady as market reacts to new inflation data**
Mortgage rates in the US are relatively steady as of February 13, 2025, with the current average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage at 6.94% for purchase and 6.94% for refinance. This is a decrease of 2 basis points from last Thursday's average rate. The Federal Reserve's target interest rate has been left unchanged at 4.25% to 4.50%, and economists expect it to remain the same at the next policy meeting on March 18-19, 2025. The consumer price index showed a monthly increase of 0.5% in the prices average Americans pay for goods and services, up from 0.4% in December, with high food, fuel, and shelter costs driving the annual inflation rate to 3%, the highest rate since June 2024. 'We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,' said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in testimony before the Senate banking committee on February 11, 2025. 'The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid.'
