**Korea's birth crisis far from over**
South Korea's total fertility rate reached 0.82 in the first quarter of 2025, a 7.4% year-on-year increase, the highest since records began in 1981. Experts are cautiously optimistic, but warn that even if the government's target of a 1.0 fertility rate by 2030 is met, Korea would still be at the bottom globally in terms of fertility. The prolonged low birthrate has eroded the population of people capable of having children, and an increase in fertility rates may not translate into more births due to a smaller base population of parents. According to Statistics Korea, even under the agency's high-fertility projection scenario, the national population will fall to the 30-million range within 45 years. Complacency is not an option, and a fertility rate must rise to two or three children per woman to avoid a shrinking society. 'We must remember that we have merely bought a little more time to prepare for the demographic shock ahead,' said a warning from the article.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**China Advances with More Policies and Subsidies to Boost Birth Rates**
China's Premier Li announced that the government will provide subsidies for childcare services, aiming to address the high costs of education for children, a major obstacle for couples in having children. Li stated, 'We will develop vigorously integrated childcare services and kindergartens,' and 'the offer of inclusive childcare services will be increased.' The government aims to promote community support services for the elderly and strengthen care for dependents. China's population is expected to decline significantly by 2035, with over 400 million people aged 60 or older, impacting the workforce and economy. In 2024, China recorded 9.54 million births, slightly above the 9.02 million in 2023, the lowest since 1949. Experts attribute the growth in births in 2024 to families delaying their plans due to the pandemic and the 2024 being the Year of the Dragon, considered auspicious for motherhood. Proposed measures include making sex education compulsory in schools, creating services to detect fertility-related diseases in adults without children, and incorporating the HPV vaccine into the public system. Other possible proposals include expanding insurance coverage for assisted reproductive technologies, extending paternity leave, and reducing the marriage age to 18.

**China Proposes Measures to Boost Birth Rate Amid Aging Population**
China is facing a declining birth rate and rapid population aging, which may threaten its future. Chen Songxi, a member of the Chinese government's top advisory body, has proposed reducing the legal marriage age to 18 and eliminating restrictions on the number of children per couple to boost the birth rate. According to Chen, the plan aims to increase the country's birth rates and utilize its reproductive potential, which is currently facing a constant population aging and low birth rate. Chen emphasizes that the plan does not aim to force young people to get married at an earlier age, but rather aligns with international trends on minimum marriage age. The second proposal involves modifying the law to eliminate all restrictions on the number of children and establishing incentives, such as monthly subsidies and medical support, to encourage the Chinese population to have more children. Experts predict that China will implement this new package of social measures between 2025 and 2035, when the number of fertile women will stabilize between 290 million and 310 million. During this period, authorities plan to conduct population surveys to gauge public opinion on having children, which will help adjust programs to suit different social groups in the country. China's population is already facing a significant aging problem, with 15% of the population aged 65 or older in 2024, a figure expected to rise to 20% by 2031.

**China’s Fertility Services Market: Navigating Growth, Challenges, and Opportunities**
China is facing a demographic crisis with declining birth rates and an aging population, leading to an increased demand for fertility services. The Chinese government has introduced policies to make assisted reproductive technologies (ART) more accessible, including medical insurance coverage for fertility treatments and regional subsidies. However, legal restrictions remain, particularly for single women seeking egg freezing. The ART market is poised for growth, offering opportunities in medical devices, pharmaceuticals, clinical services, and research. China's fertility sector is undergoing rapid transformation as birth rates decline and demand for reproductive services rises. With infertility affecting nearly one in six couples, ART has gained traction. Government policies, such as medical insurance coverage for ART in multiple provinces and regional subsidies for IVF, are making fertility treatments more accessible. The ART services market is valued at approximately US$2.31 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow to US$3.90 billion by 2030, marking a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.8 percent between 2024 and 2030.

**China Considers Reducing Minimum Marriage Age and Eliminating Childbirth Restrictions**
China is considering reducing the minimum age for marriage and eliminating restrictions on the number of children, according to Chen Songxi, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The proposal aims to expand the fertile population base and explore China's reproductive potential, amid growing concerns about the country's aging population and low birth rate, as reported by the Global Times. Chen argued that the proposal is in line with international trends on minimum marriage age and does not aim to force young people to marry early, but rather to provide more options. The number of marriages in China has reached a record low of 6.1 million in 2024, the lowest since 1980. Chen also suggested a broader reform of the population and birth control legislation, including changing the name of the current 'Family Planning and Population Law' to 'Population and Birth Law', eliminating restrictions on the number of children, and promoting policies such as monthly subsidies and medical support for each child until a certain age. The window of opportunity for implementing these measures is between 2025 and 2035, a critical period when the number of women of childbearing age will stabilize between 290 million and 310 million, Chen said. During this time, authorities plan to conduct surveys on intentions to have children and adjust programs for different population groups. China's projected population aging is also alarming, with over 15% of the population aged 65 or older in 2024, and estimated to reach over 20% by 2031, and 29.5% by 2050, which will have a negative impact on the country's workforce and economy.

**Global Population Growth Slows Down: What's Behind the Decline?**
The world's population growth has slowed down significantly over the past few decades, according to IFLScience. The population has reached 8 billion people in 2024, but the UN predicts that the growth rate will slow down significantly in the next 60 years, adding only 2 billion people. By the 2080s, the population is expected to reach 10.3 billion, and by the end of the century, it will decrease to 10.2 billion. The probability of the population reaching its peak by 2100 is estimated to be 80%. This is largely due to a sharp decline in fertility rates. In most countries, the fertility rate is below the critical threshold of 2.1 children per woman. In fact, over 20% of countries have a 'below-replacement fertility rate', where a woman has fewer than 1.4 children. China, which was once the most populous country, is also experiencing a decline in population. According to forecasts, the population of these countries will decrease by approximately 14% from now until 2054. The decline in fertility rates can be attributed to the demographic transition phenomenon, where women have fewer children as societies become more industrialized. This is due to increased opportunities for women's career growth, leading to delayed family formation. Additionally, lower child mortality rates and reduced need for large families for agricultural work contribute to lower fertility rates. In combination with increasing life expectancy, this decline in fertility can significantly alter the demographic composition of the population, with people over 60 years old making up an increasingly large proportion. By 2070, people over 60 are expected to outnumber those under 18.

**China's Population Enters Negative Growth Phase, Facing Severe Demographic Crisis**
China's population has entered a negative growth phase, with a decline of 1.39 million people in 2024, according to official data. This is a result of a decline in birth rates and an increase in death rates. The birth rate has been declining since 2012, with a total fertility rate of 1.0 in 2023, making China one of the countries with the lowest birth rates in the world. The death rate has been increasing since the COVID-19 pandemic, with a significant increase in deaths in 2020. The population's age structure is also a major concern, with a severe shortage of young people, a shrinking labor force, and a rapidly aging population. China's population is expected to decline further, with a predicted 15% or lower proportion of 0-14 year olds by 2030, entering the category of 'super-low fertility'. The consequences of this demographic crisis will be severe, including a decline in economic growth, a shrinking labor force, and a rapidly aging population. The Chinese government's 'one-child policy' has been widely criticized for its role in creating this demographic crisis.

**China Sees Record Decline in Marriage Rates Amid Economic Uncertainty**
China has seen a record decline in marriage rates, with a 50% drop in 2024 compared to the previous year. According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, over 6.1 million young men and women registered for marriage in 2024, a decrease from 7.68 million in 2023. This decline is attributed to the high cost of childcare and education in China, as well as the economic uncertainty faced by university graduates. As Dr. Yi Fuqian, a demography expert from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said, 'This is unprecedented! Even in 2020, due to COVID, the marriage rate declined by only 12.2%.' The Chinese government has been actively promoting marriage and childbirth, but the trend is alarming, with the population expected to age rapidly in the coming decades. By 2030, it is estimated that 300 million Chinese will reach retirement age, equivalent to the entire population of the United States. In November 2024, the Chinese State Council requested local governments to allocate resources to address the population crisis and promote marriage and childbirth 'at the right age.' The data also showed that over 2.6 million men and women applied for divorce in 2024, a 1.1% increase from 2023.
