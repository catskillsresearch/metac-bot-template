**Can the Current Government Achieve a Single Digit Inflation Rate by 2026?**
Central Bank President Fatih Karahan stated that the year-on-year inflation rate is over 30%, which is a sign of a high inflation rate. This statement reminded me of the repeated claim that inflation would reach a single digit by 2026. However, Karahan also mentioned that the fight against inflation began in June 2024, which contradicts the previous claim that it started in June 2023 when Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek took office. Şimşek had previously stated in a speech in Karabük on September 30, 2024, that inflation would reach a single digit by 2026 and then transition to sustainable high growth. However, Şimşek also mentioned that the deprem (earthquake) led to increased spending, but this has largely been completed. Despite this, Şimşek claims that inflation will reach a single digit by 2026. However, this claim is not convincing, especially considering the recent decline in commodity prices, including oil. Additionally, the 19 March crisis had a significant impact on inflation, and without it, the current point would not have been reached. Now, with the 19 March crisis, the internal demand has decreased, and this will contribute to inflation. Şimşek claims that the year-end targets can be achieved, but Karahan's statement is more realistic, with economists predicting a rate of 32-33%. If they achieve this rate, it would be a significant achievement, but it would still be difficult to reach a single digit by 2026. In fact, it is unlikely that inflation will reach a single digit by 2026, and even if it does, it would be a sign of a successful economy. However, the current government's track record suggests that they will not be able to achieve this goal. Therefore, it is likely that inflation will remain high, and the government's claim that it will reach a single digit by 2026 is not convincing.

**Turkey's Inflation Rate: A Complex Issue**
Turkey's inflation rate has been high, causing prices to rise daily. To avoid buying a product at a higher price in the future, consumers are opting to purchase it as soon as possible. To combat this, the central bank can raise interest rates, allowing consumers to earn more than the inflation rate. However, high interest rates can also lead to a decrease in credit-based activities. Turkish Central Bank President Fatih Karahan stated, 'We are using all our monetary policy tools effectively to make our moves.' He also emphasized the bank's commitment to reducing inflation, saying, 'We will continue to monitor liquidity conditions closely and use liquidity management tools effectively to achieve our goal of reducing inflation.' Karahan's comments were seen as optimistic, but experts warn that reducing inflation is not solely the responsibility of the central bank. The government's policies, led by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, also play a crucial role. Erdoğan has been critical of high interest rates, saying, 'Interest rates are the cause, inflation is the result.' The central bank has increased the policy rate from 8.5% to 45%, which has helped to slow down inflation and stabilize the currency. However, this policy is not sustainable in the long term. The article also notes that the central bank has increased the money supply, with M0 increasing by 116 billion Turkish Lira in March 2025. This increase in money supply will likely lead to higher inflation in the future. The article concludes that the current policy is not a sustainable solution and that structural reforms are needed to address the underlying issues.

**'Inflation expectations require maintaining tight, decisive stance'**
Turkish Central Bank Governor Fatih Karahan stated that inflation expectations have stalled in April and remain above the bank's disinflation path, necessitating a tight and decisive monetary policy stance. The inflation rate in Türkiye dropped to 37.9% in April, down from 38.1% in March, but annual inflation exceeded 75% in May 2024. Karahan emphasized the need for caution due to high uncertainties in global trade and economic policies, and the potential effects on inflation. He noted that the bank has taken steps to increase monetary tightening and manage excess Turkish lira liquidity in the system. Karahan also attributed a positive impact of commodity prices on disinflation, as well as weakening domestic demand. However, he warned that uncertainties are higher than in the past, and the bank will continue to exhibit a cautious and tight monetary policy stance until a permanent decrease in inflation and price stability is achieved.

**Turkey's Inflation Rate Exceeds Central Bank's Expectations**
The Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) announced a 37.8% annual inflation rate for April, exceeding the Central Bank of Turkey's (MB) expectations. Despite the MB's efforts to control inflation, including increasing interest rates and requiring banks to hold a higher percentage of their deposits in Turkish Lira, the inflation rate remains high. The MB's net foreign exchange reserves have decreased by 60 billion dollars since March, and the Turkish Lira continues to appreciate against the US dollar. The business community is critical of the MB's policies, with the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) President Rifat Hisarcıklıoğlu stating that the government's approach to increasing tax revenue is 'unacceptable'. The Turkish Exporters' Assembly (TİM) President Mustafa Gültepe expressed concern that the country's exporters are losing their competitiveness due to high inflation and interest rates. The Turkish Industry and Business Association (TÜSİAD) has also criticized the government's economic policies, with its President stating that the country's economy is on the brink of collapse.

**Deputy President Yılmaz: We Will Continue to Fight Inflation with Determination**
Deputy President Yılmaz stated that Turkey will continue to fight inflation with determination. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), the annual inflation rate for April 2025 was 37.9%. However, this is a decrease of 37.6 points since June 2024, marking the beginning of the deflation process. In April, there was a significant decrease in the price increase of unprocessed food in the food group, and the rent inflation rate has been decreasing since the beginning of the year. The producer price index increased by 2.8% in April, and the annual inflation rate decreased by 35.2 points since June 2024, reaching 22.5%. The relatively low trend in producer inflation is positively affecting consumer prices. We will continue to fight inflation with determination, and with strong coordination, we will increase our relative performance in the face of increasing uncertainty in the global environment. Our goal is to grow our economy in a stable manner and increase our social welfare level in a sustainable way.' said Yılmaz.

**Turkey's April 2025 Inflation Data to be Announced on May 3, 2025**
The Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) will announce the inflation data for April 2025 on May 3, 2025, at 10:00 AM. This data will determine the rent increase rate and the 4-month inflation difference, which is crucial for calculating the July salary increase for civil servants and retirees. The TÜİK will also announce the TÜFE rate, which will provide the basis for the salary increase for civil servants and retirees. Additionally, the rent increase rate for May will be calculated based on this data. Civil servants and retirees receive an inflation difference in addition to the collective agreement increase. According to the collective agreement, civil servants and retirees will receive a 7% increase in July 2025. As of the end of March, this rate exceeded 3.83%. If the 7th period collective agreement's additional 5% is added, a total cumulative increase of 9.03% will occur. Retirees from the Social Security Institution and Bağ-Kur have already earned a 10.06% inflation difference for March 2025.

He emphasized that reducing inflation is their top priority and that they have not changed their stance on this issue. Şimşek also stated that investors are concerned about the political developments in Turkey, but they have strong support for the program. He noted that the global decrease in risk appetite is causing a decrease in foreign investment in Turkey, but the country's growth prospects are strong in the medium to long term. Şimşek also mentioned that the government is taking measures to reduce the budget and increase efficiency, and that they do not need to make any changes to the program. He expressed confidence that the net inflation rate will remain within the Central Bank's target range and that the country's economy will continue to grow.

**Turkey's central bank raises benchmark interest rate to 46 percent - Turkish Minute**
Turkey's central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate to 46 percent in response to economic pressure from protests over the arrest of İstanbul's opposition mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. The rate hike came as the Turkish lira plummeted to record lows against the dollar, with a 12 percent drop on the day of İmamoğlu's arrest and a further 4 percent decline since March 19. The central bank stated that it will maintain a tight monetary stance 'until price stability is achieved via a sustained decline in inflation,' with annual inflation targeting 24 percent by the end of 2025. According to official figures, annual inflation fell to 38.1 percent in March, its lowest level since December 2021. The central bank said it will 'prudently adjust the policy rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis with a focus on the inflation outlook.'

**Turkey's Inflation Rate Falls Below 40%, Opening Door for Interest Rate Cut**
The Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) released the inflation data for February 2025, which showed a significant decline in inflation rates. According to the data, the annual inflation rate fell to below 40%, which has opened the door for a 250 basis point interest rate cut by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB). Economists believe that the TCMB will cut the one-week repo rate by 250 basis points to 42.50%, which would be a significant move. Analysts such as Soner Gökten and Iris Cibre expect a 250 basis point interest rate cut, citing the decline in inflation rates. However, they also note that the real inflation rate for low-income and poor households remains high, at around 4-5%. Prof. Dr. Selva Demiralp believes that the TCMB will not cut interest rates at this meeting, but will instead send a signal that it is not in automatic pilot mode. Economist Öner Günçavdı expects the inflation rates to continue to decline, which would make Turkey a standout in the world in terms of its ability to grow and reduce inflation.

**Inflation is Decreasing and Will Continue to Do So, Says Hazine and Maliye Bakanı Mehmet Şimşek**
Turkey has been focusing on economic development in recent times. The cabinet and economic management, formed after the 2023 general election, aimed to reduce inflation to single-digit levels. To achieve this, various steps have been taken in monetary policy, public finance, and savings. The latest inflation data also suggests that these efforts are bearing fruit. According to TÜİK data, inflation rose by 5.03% in January, reaching 42.12% annually, which is the lowest in 19 months. The Central Bank has also set its year-end target for inflation at 24% for 2025. Hazine and Maliye Bakanı Mehmet Şimşek stated that progress has been made in the fight against inflation and that inflation is decreasing. He said, 'Inflation is decreasing and will continue to do so.' Şimşek added, 'We are making progress in the fight against inflation. Inflation is decreasing, and there is a slowdown in the rate of price increases. Therefore, January's inflation rate, although relatively high, did not leave any questions in our minds about the effectiveness of our efforts. Inflation decreased by 23 points compared to last year's January. In 2024, inflation was expected to drop to 44% by the end of the year. In 2023, it was 65%. This year, we expect inflation to drop to 24%. There is a decrease and it will continue.'

**Government Announces 2025 End-of-Year Inflation Target: What's Next for Turkey's Economy?**
Deputy Prime Minister Cevdet Yılmaz stated that the government's efforts to combat inflation are continuing with determination. He mentioned that inflation, which reached 75% in May 2024, is expected to decrease to 44% by the end of the year. Yılmaz said, 'We aim to bring inflation below 40% in the coming months and to the 20s by the end of the year.' He emphasized that a low-inflation environment is crucial for healthy and sustainable growth, and that price stability will strengthen the investment environment and increase economic predictability. Yılmaz added, 'In the past, our fastest growth periods have been when low inflation has been achieved. Therefore, reducing inflation also means making growth permanent. Inflationary periods have disrupted income distribution, while low-inflation environments have strengthened social justice and increased the standard of living. 2025 will be a turning point in the fight against inflation, and we aim to reach single-digit figures by 2026-2027.' Yılmaz also mentioned that the government is not only focusing on monetary policies, but also on fiscal discipline and structural reforms in the fight against inflation. He highlighted the country's economic achievements, including a record-high export figure of $262 billion in 2023, a significant reduction in the current account deficit, and an increase in the central bank's reserves to $167 billion.
