**Google Deepmind's Demis Hassabis Calls for International Cooperation on AI Regulation**
Demis Hassabis, the director of Google Deepmind, expressed regret over the lack of international cooperation in regulating artificial intelligence (AI), citing the difficulty of achieving this goal in the current geopolitical context. 'The most important thing is that we need international cooperation. Because this technology crosses all borders. It will be applied in all countries,' he said at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in London. Hassabis emphasized the need for a 'certain form of international cooperation or collaboration' to make sense of the widespread development and deployment of AI technologies. However, he acknowledged that this seems 'quite difficult' in the current geopolitical climate. The lack of international cooperation on AI regulation is particularly concerning given the major ethical questions raised by AI's increasing presence in various sectors, including disinformation, job impact, and loss of technological control. At the Paris AI summit in February, 58 countries, including China, France, and India, as well as the European Union and the African Union Commission, called for strengthened coordination of AI governance to avoid market concentration and make the technology more accessible. However, the United States and the United Kingdom opposed this call, advocating for limited regulation to avoid stifling the growing AI industry, which they dominate.

**Report: Pressure on Democracy and Human Rights Increasing Worldwide**
The Sivil Toplum Atlası report, released by the German-based Protestant aid organization Brot für die Welt, found that only 3.5% of the world's population lives in countries that provide citizens with freedom and protect their basic rights. The report, which evaluated 197 countries and regions, categorized countries based on their performance in areas such as freedom of expression, assembly, and the press. According to the report, 40 countries, including 12 European Union members, were classified as 'open' in terms of civil rights, while 42 countries, including 13 EU members and the US, were classified as 'restricted'. The report also identified 35 countries, including Greece, Hungary, the UK, and Ukraine, where civil rights are 'limited', and 51 countries, including Turkey, where civil rights are 'under pressure'. The report's author, Dagmar Pruin, stated that democracy and human rights are under attack worldwide, and that the rule of law, separation of powers, and protection against arbitrary state actions are increasingly threatened in many countries.

**Competitività e solidarietà per la Ue: un binomio imprescindibile**
The European Union must find a new creative momentum to overcome the current lack of trust among its citizens. According to IPSOS, 48% of the population has lost faith in the EU. To address this issue, two key points are suggested: first, the EU must regain its competitive position on a global scale, as various metrics show a slowdown in its growth since the beginning of the century. This has led to a significant gap in GDP, with the real disposable income per capita growing almost twice as much in the US compared to the EU. The main cause of this disparity is the slower growth of productivity in Europe. As Governor Fabio Panetta stated, productivity remains the central issue, which is reflected in Italy's low wages. A European pact for productivity is proposed, which is in line with the Commission's competitiveness compass. However, competitiveness must be balanced with solidarity, a value that is essential in the face of growing polarization and poverty, which can lead to social cohesion and distrust. The EU must find a balance between competitiveness and solidarity to preserve its social model, which is considered the best in the world.

**Europe Takes a Stand Against American Tech Giants**
The European Union is taking a stand against the dominance of American technology companies. Germany has proposed a 10% tax on American tech giants, which has increased tensions with the Trump administration. The EU is also investing in open-source software, digital taxes, and AI restrictions. A recent survey shows that 44% of Europeans are willing to reduce their spending on American products. The main reason is not the price, but preference. The median value of 'substitution points' among those who chose to switch due to preference was 95 out of 100. In Germany, the trend is even more pronounced, with over half of respondents either already reducing or planning to reduce their use of American products. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is facing a potential lawsuit over its use of user data for AI training without consent. The company claims it has a 'legitimate interest' under GDPR, but the data protection authorities disagree. The EU is also promoting open-source software as a way to reduce dependence on American technology. Germany's openDesk project provides modular systems for municipalities, while Switzerland has adopted a law requiring open-source software for public administration. The EU is using procurement policies to build digital sovereignty. Tyskland's culture minister, Wolfram Weimer, has proposed a 10% tax on digital services provided by large online platforms like Google and Meta. The goal is to tax income generated in Germany by companies that 'pay little in taxes, invest too little, and give too little back to society.' The plan is not yet a government policy, but it reflects a shift in attitude. Trump has warned that such a tax would trigger retaliatory tariffs. Similar taxes on digital services in France and the UK led to investigations under Section 301 and threats of economic retaliation during Trump's first term. Weimer says he is willing to take the risk, comparing Google's influence on public knowledge to a monopoly over the language itself. If a company has the power to rename geographic regions or filter political news, he argues, taxation is the least a government should do.

**The EU's Quest for Digital Sovereignty: A New Era of Independence**
The European Union is taking steps to increase its digital sovereignty and reduce its dependence on the United States. The EU is proposing a 10% tax on digital services provided by companies like Google and Meta, which would generate significant revenue for the EU. The tax is part of a broader effort to reduce the EU's dependence on US technology and data. The EU is also investing in open-source software and promoting the use of European-made products. Recent surveys show that European consumers are increasingly choosing to buy products made in the EU, with 44% of respondents in a survey by the European Central Bank saying they are willing to reduce their spending on American products. The German government is also considering a tax on Google and Meta, with the Minister of State for Culture, Wolfram Weimer, proposing a 10% tax on digital services. Weimer argues that the tax is necessary to reduce the influence of US companies on European knowledge and culture. The tax has been met with resistance from the US, with President Trump warning of retaliatory tariffs. The EU is also taking steps to reduce its dependence on US cloud services, with several governments promoting the use of open-source software and European-made products. The EU's efforts to increase its digital sovereignty are part of a broader trend of European countries seeking to reduce their dependence on the US and increase their autonomy in the digital sphere.

**EU on Track to Meet 55% Emissions Reduction Goal by 2030**
The European Union is close to achieving its ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. According to the European Commission, the current reduction is at 54%, which is a promising result. This is a significant achievement, especially considering that the EU is one of the regions that is warming the fastest. The consequences of climate change are already being felt, with extreme heatwaves, frequent floods, and wildfires becoming a regular occurrence. However, there is a sense of hope, as many EU member states have taken concrete steps to accelerate the energy transition. The EU has already reduced emissions by 37% since 1990, and in 2023, there was an additional 8% reduction. Some countries, such as Belgium, Estonia, and Poland, are still lagging behind in defining their plans, while others are pushing for a slower pace on environmental regulations due to geopolitical tensions, energy price increases, and protectionism. The European Commission, however, remains committed to its goal and is now aiming for a 90% reduction in emissions by 2040, with some flexibility in the tools used, such as carbon credits.

**European Union and Italy Regulate Artificial Intelligence**
The European Union has been a pioneer in regulating artificial intelligence (AI) with the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), which establishes harmonized rules for AI. The AI Act aims to balance innovation with the protection of fundamental rights, ensuring that AI development and use are responsible and transparent. The Italian government has also taken steps to regulate AI, with the AI Strategy for Italy and the Carta italiana para a inteligência artificial. The Italian government has also proposed a law to regulate AI, which aligns with the EU's AI Act and aims to ensure the development and use of AI are ethical, secure, and responsible. The law establishes clear criteria for identifying AI systems, categorizing them as prohibited, high-risk, limited, or minimal. The Italian law also addresses the use of AI in the justice system, defining limits and competences. The EU's AI Act and the Italian law share a fundamental objective: to establish effective control over the use of AI, particularly in the justice sector. They recognize the benefits of AI in terms of efficiency and speed, but emphasize the need to ensure that its implementation occurs within rigorous parameters, prioritizing the protection of fundamental rights and judicial security.

**EU, BC launch analysis to power Pakistani women's digital skills revolution**
The European Union Delegation to Pakistan and the British Council have launched a report titled 'Skill Gap & Market Need Analysis' to address the digital skills gap in Pakistan, particularly among women. The study, conducted by Ipsos Pakistan, identifies critical skill gaps in emerging technologies and provides a roadmap for developing inclusive, industry-aligned technical training. The report highlights that only 16% of ICT jobs in Pakistan are held by women, despite the sector's rapid growth, with exports reaching $3.2 billion in 2024 and expected revenue growth of 7.3% by 2029. The study recommends 42 courses in 20 high-tech domains, such as artificial intelligence and cloud security, where demand is high but skills are in short supply. Minister of State for Federal Education and Professional Training Wajiha Qamar said, 'The report provided the evidence we need to close the gender gap in technology and create opportunities for the women and girls of Pakistan to lead in the digital economy.' Jeroen Willems, Head of Cooperation, EU Delegation to Pakistan, added, 'By investing in women's skills, we invest in the nation's prosperity.'

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**EU Stands Firm in Trade Dispute with US, Despite Some Signs of Flexibility**
The EU is maintaining its hardline stance in the trade dispute with the US, despite some signs of flexibility. The European Union has rejected the US demand for 10% tariffs as a new minimum, and is not willing to compromise on food standards or EU digital laws. EU Commissioner Detlev Landmesser said, 'The EU is not accepting the 10% tariffs as a new minimum, and we are not willing to compromise on our standards.' The EU is sticking to its position that it is not being 'unfair' and that the US tariffs are 'completely unjustified.' The EU is seeking to remove all the tariffs and retaliatory measures imposed by the US, and is not expecting the US to completely abandon its threats. However, if the US sticks to its 10-25% tariffs, the EU will impose counter-tariffs on US goods worth over $100 billion. Additional proposals from the EU include joint purchases of chips for artificial intelligence, a joint approach to Chinese overcapacity, and increased cooperation on investment and export controls.

**Europe Must Make a Decisive Bet on New Technologies and Reforms**
The European Union must make a decisive bet on new technologies and artificial intelligence, implement reforms to strengthen its dynamism, and complete its political and military integration if it wants to regain its protagonism in the global geopolitical landscape. The European Commission warns that the next EU budget, which will reach 1 trillion euros, will require member states to meet milestones and objectives to access these funds. The EU needs to give a boost to its competitiveness to avoid being displaced to the second plane of the global economy. According to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the current EU budget was designed for a world that no longer exists. She emphasizes the need to focus efforts on issues that had been neglected, such as improving competitiveness, which will have a dedicated fund. Europe's share of the global GDP has decreased from 25% two decades ago to 15% today, while China and the US are taking center stage in the new cycle.

**EU Unveils Plan to Become a Leader in Artificial Intelligence**
The European Union has unveiled its plan to make artificial intelligence (AI) a cornerstone of European innovation, aiming to become a leader in the field alongside China and the United States. The EU wants to invest heavily in AI, building 'gigafactories' and data centers, and encouraging member states to integrate AI into their daily lives. The EU also plans to facilitate the implementation of the AI Act, a regulation that governs AI in Europe. According to Ursula von der Leyen, the EU aims to mobilize 20 billion euros in private investment to build 5 giant factories in Europe, as part of a 200 billion euro investment plan announced in February 2025. The EU also wants to triple its data center capacity on its territory within 5-7 years and expand its datasets to train AI models. The EU is also preparing the population for the emergence of AI, with 13.5% of European companies already using AI in their tools, according to EU figures. The EU wants to attract top AI talent and form future generations in AI, and is launching an AI Act Service Desk to help developers create AI tools while complying with EU regulations. 'These actions will contribute to the establishment of legal immigration channels for highly qualified non-European workers in the AI sector and should convince European AI researchers and experts to return to Europe,' the EU statement reads.

**Europe Launches Initiative to Create 'Factories of Artificial Intelligence'**
The European Union has launched an initiative to create 'factories of artificial intelligence' across the continent, with the goal of making Europe a leader in AI development and use. The initiative, led by the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, aims to create a network of AI research and development centers, known as 'fábricas de IA', in various European countries. These centers will be equipped with high-performance computing infrastructure and will focus on developing and testing AI technologies. The EU has allocated €1.5 billion for the initiative, which will be used to deploy new supercomputers optimized for AI and to improve existing ones. The first batch of fábricas de IA has been announced, with Spain, Finland, Luxembourg, Sweden, Germany, Italy, and Greece selected to host the centers. The Spanish fábrica de IA, BSC AI Factory, will be located in Barcelona and will be focused on developing AI technologies for various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and climate. The center will be equipped with a supercomputer and will provide a platform for companies and researchers to test and develop AI solutions. The EU's goal is to make AI more accessible and usable for all industries and to increase Europe's competitiveness in the field.

**EU Enhances Intelligence Capabilities with New Satellite Network**
The European Union is planning to enhance its intelligence capabilities by launching a new network of satellites to provide military intelligence, amid growing concerns about the US commitment to defending Europe, according to the Financial Times. This system aims to partially replace US capabilities, after President Donald Trump's decision to suspend intelligence sharing with Ukraine this month highlighted Europe's reliance on the US. EU Defense and Space Commissioner Andrius Kubilius told the newspaper: 'Given the changes in the geopolitical situation, the European Commission is considering expanding its capabilities in the field of satellites to improve geographic intelligence support for security.' The new satellite network will be used to detect threats, such as troop movements, and coordinate military operations. Kubilius said that the EU needs a network that complements other programs used for navigation and land monitoring. This system will require producing more up-to-date information at a faster rate than the 'Copernicus' low-orbit system, which monitors climate changes and natural disasters, but generates new images every 24 hours. Kubilius acknowledged that the project will be costly and time-consuming, and will ask member states if they want to follow a 'commercial approach' temporarily. He added: 'We aim to create a system that will be a government service for land monitoring, with high technology and high availability of data.' He explained that the system will operate in a low Earth orbit, and that these networks require dozens of satellites. He added that the best commercial systems can track targets and military spread with updates every 30 minutes. The Commission is also buying IRIS², a wide-area internet network that operates on multiple orbits in low Earth orbit. The Commission will complete this year's work on the Govsatcom program, which will link member states' systems. The Commission has not yet determined how to limit spending, but President Ursula von der Leyen said that it should be spent on European products. Kubilius said that the countries included in this scope include Norway, expressing his hope that the UK will be included. He added that Turkey 'is still under discussion'. However, he pointed out that Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who chairs the EU presidency, met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on March 13, which was 'a clear indication'. He also mentioned that the money can be used to buy weapons from Ukraine, which is half the price of Western counterparts, and added: 'It also supports the Ukrainian economy.' Kubilius explained that the plan will highlight the strategic areas in which EU member states rely heavily on the US. These areas include air transport capacity, aerial refueling, air warning and control. He also gave priority to a missile defense system, which could cost 500 billion euros.

**EU Considers Creating Own Satellite Network for Military Intelligence**
The European Union is considering creating its own satellite network for military intelligence, which would partially replace the capabilities of the US. According to European Commissioner for Defense and Space, Andrius Kubilius, in an interview with Financial Times, as reported by The Telegraph. 'Given the changes in the geopolitical situation, the European Commission is considering the possibility of expanding its satellite capabilities to improve geospatial intelligence support for security,' he said. The new network, which is still in the early stages of negotiation, would be used for threat detection, including troop movements, and for coordinating military operations. 'We aim to create a special system as a state service for Earth observation. It will have high technologies and high data availability,' Kubilius added. This move comes as the UK is reportedly considering creating an alliance with European countries to share intelligence without US restrictions. Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported that European intelligence has obtained a crucial document from Russia, compiled by a influential Russian analytical center closely tied to the FSB, which suggests that 'peaceful resolution of the crisis in Ukraine cannot happen before 2026.'

**The Degeneration of the European Union: 75 Years of Decline**
The European Union has undergone significant changes since its inception in 1950. The EU was founded by six European countries, including Germany, France, and Italy, with the goal of promoting economic and political cooperation. The first step towards a unified Europe was the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1951. This was followed by the establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957, which aimed to create a common market and customs union. Over the years, the EU has expanded to include 28 member states, with the most recent additions being Croatia in 2013 and the UK's departure in 2020. However, the EU has faced significant challenges, including the Brexit referendum, which saw the UK vote to leave the EU in 2016. According to a 2023 YouGov survey, 57% of British voters regret their decision to leave the EU, while 51% of those surveyed expressed a desire to rejoin. The EU has also struggled with issues such as climate change, technological dependence on the US, and military dependence on the US. The EU's institutions have been criticized for being out of touch with the needs of its citizens, and the bloc has been left behind in the development of new technologies such as artificial intelligence.

**EU to Invest 200 Billion Euros in Artificial Intelligence**
The European Union is set to invest 200 billion euros in artificial intelligence, according to a plan announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the AI Summit Action in Paris. The initiative, called InvestAi, will be the largest public-private partnership in the world for the development of reliable artificial intelligence. The EU executive will focus on industrial applications, with 50 billion euros in funding, in addition to the 150 billion euros of the IA Champions Initiative. The goal is to mobilize a total of 200 billion euros of investments for AI in Europe, including a new 20 billion euro European fund dedicated to 'gigafactories' of artificial intelligence. According to von der Leyen, 'artificial intelligence will improve our healthcare, stimulate our research and innovation, and strengthen our competitiveness. We want artificial intelligence to be a positive and growth force. We do it through our European approach, based on openness, cooperation, excellence, and talent. But our approach must still be strengthened. That's why, together with our member states and our partners, we will mobilize unprecedented capital through InvestAi, for European AI.' The partnership will allow all EU scientists and companies, not just the largest ones, to develop advanced large-scale models, necessary to make Europe a continent based on artificial intelligence. 61 countries, including China, France, and India, have signed a declaration for an 'open', 'inclusive', and 'ethical' AI, emphasizing the need for strengthened governance coordination and a global dialogue. The signatories have also called for avoiding 'concentration' to make this technology as accessible as possible. During the summit, the creation of an observatory on the energy impact of artificial intelligence, led by the International Energy Agency, and a coalition for sustainable AI, which aims to bring together leading companies in the sector, was announced. 'We are laying the foundations, together with innovation and acceleration, for what will become AI, the keys to trust,' said French President Emmanuel Macron at the end of the summit held at the Grand Palais in Paris. US Vice President J.D. Vance defended his country's position, warning that 'excessive regulation' of artificial intelligence 'could kill an expanding industry.' 'We will do everything to encourage AI policies that favor growth,' he said, adding that 'the United States are leaders in the field of artificial intelligence and our administration wants them to remain so.' According to European Investment Bank President Nadia Calviño, 'the EIB is intensifying its support for AI, a key driver of innovation and productivity in Europe. The EU's InvestAi fund should finance four future gigafactories of artificial intelligence across the Union. The gigafactories will be specialized in training complex and large AI models. They should have around 100,000 AI chips of the latest generation. InvestAi will include a stratified fund, with different risk and return profiles. The EU budget will reduce the risk for investment by other partners. This should not be, at least for now, new funds, but relocations: the Commission's note specifies that the initial funding of the Commission for InvestAi will come from existing EU funding programs with a digital component, such as the Digital Europe program, Horizon Europe, and InvestEU. Member states can also contribute through the programming of their cohesion funds.'

**EU Strives for Balance between Encouragement and Regulation in AI**
The European Union is making efforts to attract AI actors to its territory and is succeeding, with announced projects representing tens of billions of euros in investments. However, this is mainly to catch up with the US and China, particularly with ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The EU has had successes, such as MistraAI in France, and excellence poles in Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK, which is now outside the EU. The European Commission now wants to take it to the next level. To this end, announcements were made at the beginning of the month to attract more investors under the 'competitiveness' compass that the Union has given itself. This includes reforming the private capital market, particularly savings, to direct them more towards financing innovative sectors, first and foremost AI. The EU also wants to simplify things with the creation of a new European regime for companies, particularly interesting in the tech field, as investors often set up in several countries at once. The status of a single company will allow them to no longer juggle between the different legal regimes of member states. Finally, a European Fund for Competitiveness must be created, but its contours and financing are still to be specified. Will it be funded by member states or by new common loans at the European level? This is the question. The EU has also established an Artificial Intelligence Act, which has started to come into effect in February. It defines several levels of risk related to AI, the most serious being the use of AI for general surveillance of a population or for maintaining public order. Other sensitive uses will be subject to reinforced surveillance in a few months, as the regulation comes into effect: AI in education, for example, or in the management of human resources in companies. The rest will be subject to lighter regulation. The EU wants to send the message that it does not want to interfere with everything. It also wants to leave room for investors while protecting against the observed drifts, particularly in China concerning public order and social scoring of citizens. The European strategy aims to be balanced between incitation and regulation to allow AI to be generative, not just of content, but also of jobs.

**EU Implements Comprehensive Law Regulating Artificial Intelligence**
The European Union has implemented its first comprehensive law regulating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Although the legislative framework was approved in August 2024, the key restrictions and requirements came into force on February 2, 2025. The new rules establish clear boundaries for AI use and provide severe penalties for non-compliance. According to Tassos Stampoulidis, the EU's Head of Public Policy, 'the current implementation is just the beginning of the regulation process.' The law prohibits the use of AI technologies that pose a potential threat to human rights, including social rating systems, real-time facial recognition, and AI systems that classify people based on various characteristics. It also limits the use of manipulative AI technologies. Non-compliance with the requirements will result in significant fines, up to €35 million or 7% of a company's global annual turnover. The exact amount of the fine will depend on the nature and scope of the violation.
