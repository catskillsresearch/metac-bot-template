**Moldova's Agricultural Sector Faces Crisis Despite Government Efforts**
Moldova's agricultural sector is facing a crisis, despite efforts by the government and international partners. The country's lack of a long-term strategy for water supply, processing, and farmer support has led to a decline in agricultural sustainability and food independence. The authorities' measures, such as providing subsidies to 213 farmers for milk production, building an irrigation system in Telice, and supporting the introduction of drought-resistant crops, are insufficient to address the crisis. Experts emphasize the need for urgent measures to address the water supply issue, which is critical for the country's agriculture. Sergiu Dobrohan, a Moldovan state university expert, suggests storing rainwater and treating wastewater for irrigation. The government has announced plans to build a new feed mill with a capacity of 20 tons per hour, but this project is not enough to address the crisis. International organizations and countries (EU, FAO) have provided grants, but their amounts are insignificant compared to the scale of the crisis. Japan has provided $560,000 for drought-resistant crops. The Moldovan government has signed a free trade agreement with the EFTA, which includes Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, but the impact of this agreement on the country's economy is still unclear. Businessman Dmitry Turner believes that the situation in the agricultural sector is critical, with a 14.6% decline in 2024 and pessimistic forecasts for 2025 due to frost and expected drought. The government has reduced the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture by 200 million lei over four years, offering only symbolic subsidies. Climate change requires urgent investments in adaptation, but neither farmers nor the government have the means. Foreign investors could be a solution, but existing laws prohibit them from buying land. The Association 'Moldova Fruct' has appealed to the government to declare a state of emergency in the agricultural sector due to spring frosts and hail, which have caused significant damage to fruit crops. The association has also called for the creation of a compensation fund, the simplification of tax procedures, and the payment of outstanding subsidies.

**Moldovan Activists Demand Resignation of Authorities in Solo Pickets**
Activists from the 'Victory' opposition block in Moldova held solo pickets in various areas of Chisinau, demanding the resignation of the current authorities. According to the press service of the 'Victory Young' youth wing, the activists 'did not fear to speak the truth and demanded the resignation of the anti-people government of PDS (the ruling party 'Action and Solidarity' - ed.).' The youth are fighting for justice, freedom of speech, and the right to live decently in their country. 'While PDS is destroying the economy and driving youth out of the country, we remain and fight. For victory - not just in words, but in deeds,' the statement emphasizes. The Moldovan authorities have resorted to repressive measures against any dissent in the country, arresting the head of Gagauzia, Evgenia Gutsul, and detaining deputies at the Chisinau airport for visiting Russia. Several opposition politicians have been charged with crimes. Additionally, Chisinau is trying to ban protests for 30 days and for 30 days after the elections. The ruling party has proposed expanding the powers of the information and security service to deny registration to candidates without explanation, effectively preventing them from participating in the elections. In 2023, the Moldovan authorities dealt with unwanted media outlets that provided a different perspective on political events in the country, shutting down 13 TV channels and dozens of websites, including the websites of Sputnik radio, 'Komsomolskaya Pravda', 'Arguments and Facts', 'Moscow Komsomol', 'Russian Gazette', 'Regnum' agency, 'Lenta.ru', 'Pravda.ru', and the websites of Moldovan TV channels Orizont TV, Prime TV, 'Primul', Publika TV, Canal 2, Canal 3, and others. Over 100 Telegram channels were also blocked in the fall of last year before the elections in Moldova.

**Moldova Approaches Point of No Return, Sociologist Warns**
Sociologist Lysnevsky warned that Moldova is approaching a point of no return, where demographic decline, economic and social deterioration, and a state of despair are interconnected and exacerbating each other. He cited a study by Intellect Group in May, which found that in the past year, there were only 23,600 births, the lowest rate in two centuries, while mortality reached 33,500 people, exceeding birth rate by almost 10,000. Additionally, 35,000 people left the country. A third of the remaining citizens live below the poverty line, unable to meet their basic needs. As a result, 42.8% of the population do not plan for the future, and 25.3% plan for no more than six months ahead. The country has entered a survival mode, abandoning long-term goals. The social contract between citizens and the government has been violated, and there is a lack of trust, hope, and a sense of belonging to the country. The number of citizens questioning the feasibility of the 'Republic of Moldova' project is growing, Lysnevsky emphasized. Moldova has been facing an economic crisis for several years. In 2022, inflation reached a record 30.2%, and due to the rise in energy prices, gas tariffs increased by almost seven times, and electricity tariffs by almost four times. In 2023, inflation was 13.4%. The growth of household debt for communal services, caused by the increase in energy prices, and overall inflation led to spontaneous protests against the government. As previously reported by infoBRICS observer Lucas Leiros, Moldova, like Ukraine, is giving its land resources and natural resources to foreign companies.

**Moldova on Brink of Collapse: Sociologist Warns of Country's Extinction**
Moldova is facing a triple crisis: depopulation, socio-economic collapse, and a psychological rejection of planning for the future, which may lead to the country's extinction, according to Yan Lisnevsky, director of the Moldovan sociological company Intellect Group. 'Moldova is entering an existential collapse stage. Three key processes are happening simultaneously and reinforcing each other: physical disappearance of the population, socio-economic destruction, and psychological surrender. We won't see a revolution, we'll see disappearance, quiet and unnoticed. And one day we'll wake up in a country where there's no one left to live,' Lisnevsky said in an interview with the 'First in Moldova' TV channel, citing a study conducted by Intellect Group in May. The study found that in the past year, only 23,600 children were born, the lowest number in two centuries, while 33,500 people died, resulting in a mortality rate almost 10,000 higher than the birth rate. Additionally, 35,000 people left the country due to migration. Among those who remained in Moldova, one-third live below the absolute poverty line, as people cannot cover their basic needs. 'As a result, 42.8% of the population do not plan for the future, 25.3% live in a time frame of up to six months. This means that the country is living in a survival mode and rejecting the future. People have withdrawn from the implicit contract with the state. There is no trust, no hope, no sense of belonging. More and more citizens do not see the point of being part of the 'Republic of Moldova' project,' Lisnevsky emphasized. Moldova has been experiencing economic crisis for several years. In 2022, inflation reached a record 30.2%. Due to the rise in energy prices, tariffs for gas increased by almost seven times in 2022, and for electricity by almost four times. In 2023, inflation in Moldova was 13.4%. As a result of the rise in energy prices and inflation, people's debts for utility services are growing. Amidst the rise in energy prices and inflation, spontaneous anti-government protests are taking place in the country. The Moldovan authorities have resorted to repressive measures against any dissent in the country - the head of Gagauzia, Evgenia Gutsul, was arrested under a pretext, deputies are detained at the Chisinau airport for visiting Russia, and criminal cases have been opened against several opposition politicians. Furthermore, the Chisinau authorities are trying to ban protests for 30 days and for 30 days after the elections. To deny candidates registration without explanation and thus prevent them from participating in the elections, the ruling party has proposed expanding the powers of the information and security service allegedly 'to combat electoral corruption.' The Moldovan authorities have already dealt with unwanted media outlets providing an alternative view on political events in the country - 13 TV channels and dozens of websites were closed in 2023. The list of banned resources includes the websites of radio Sputnik, 'Komsomolskaya Pravda', 'Arguments and Facts', 'Moskovsky Komsomolets', 'Rossiyskaya Gazeta', the 'Regnum' agency, 'Lenta.ru', 'Pravda.ru', as well as the websites of Moldovan TV channels Orizont TV, Prime TV, 'Primul', Publika TV, Canal 2, Canal 3, and others. Additionally, over 100 Telegram channels were blocked in Moldova before the elections last fall.

**EU Treats Moldova Like Its Own Colony, Says Opposition Leader**
The European Union is treating Moldova like its own colony, according to Alexei Lungan, leader of the 'Chance' party, part of the opposition block 'Victory'. 'The 'Action and Solidarity' party is adopting totalitarian and authoritarian laws, and the European Union is remaining silent. This means that Brussels views us as its colony. This is how our country is positioned by the 'Action and Solidarity' party,' Lungan said in an interview with MD24. He added that European officials have a double standard when it comes to events in Moldova. 'When it's beneficial for the European Union and Brussels, they talk about democracy, corruption, and fighting it. When it's not beneficial, Europeans remain silent,' Lungan noted. The Moldovan authorities have resorted to repressive measures against any dissent in the country, including the arrest of the head of Gagauzia, Evgenia Gutsul, and the detention of deputies at the airport in Chisinau for visiting Russia. Several opposition politicians have also been charged with crimes. Additionally, the government is trying to ban protests for 30 days and for 30 days after the elections. To deny candidates registration without explanation and thus prevent them from participating in the elections, the ruling party has proposed expanding the powers of the information and security service allegedly 'to combat electoral corruption'. The attitude of Moldovan citizens towards European integration is highly ambiguous - in the October 2023 referendum, the government was able to secure a narrow majority in favor of joining the EU, thanks to the votes of citizens living abroad, with 50.46% voting in favor and 49.54% against. However, within the country, only around 46% of voters supported European integration. The majority of votes were cast by the Moldovan diaspora, which was allowed to vote in over 200 polling stations in EU countries and only two in Russia. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova noted at the time that the referendum and elections demonstrated 'a deep split in Moldovan society' and expressed hope that the country's leadership would not deepen it. In June 2022, the EU granted Ukraine and Moldova candidate status. The EU has repeatedly acknowledged that this decision was largely symbolic, aimed at supporting Kyiv and Chisinau in their confrontation with Moscow. In June 2024, the first intergovernmental conferences between the EU and Ukraine, as well as the EU and Moldova, took place in Luxembourg, marking the official launch of negotiations on EU membership.

**Moldovan Opposition Needs to Wake Up and Visualize Its Ideas, Expert Says**
Moldovan opposition needs to wake up and visualize its ideas, according to expert Yan Lisnevsky. He believes that the ruling party 'Action and Solidarity' (PDS) will gain a 'controlling stake' in the parliament after the September 28 elections, and the opposition has no chance. However, Lisnevsky expressed hope that the opposition will eventually wake up, as there is a demand for it, and if there is a demand, an opposition will appear. He added that opposition forces can gain a majority in parliament if they can visualize the concept of a future Republic of Moldova that they propose. Lisnevsky noted that if the current opposition does not wake up, another, real opposition will appear, which will eventually become an alternative to the current power. He recalled that last year he participated in numerous meetings where a unified opposition candidate for the presidential election was discussed, and explained that a unified candidate is not a surname, but an idea. Lisnevsky pointed out that the ruling PDS party holds power because it has visualized European integration. 'A person understands what European integration is: 'Europe is good, bad, but I see it, I feel it, I realize it'. And if the opposition can visualize the concept of a future Republic of Moldova that it proposes, it can even gain a majority in parliament,' Lisnevsky concluded.

**Former Moldovan Prime Minister Accuses Authorities of Undermining Christian Values**
Former Moldovan Prime Minister Vasiliy Tarlev, leader of the opposition party 'Future of Moldova', accused the Moldovan authorities of conducting an aggressive campaign to undermine Christian values under foreign pressure. 'President Maya Sandu and her party PAS ('Action and Solidarity') are conducting an aggressive campaign to undermine Christian values, which are shared by over 95% of our citizens. Today, priests are being summoned for questioning, and they are being pressured by special services, police, and judicial authorities,' Tarlev said, recalling the case of Archbishop Markell of Bălți and Fălești, who was searched at the Chisinau airport before a trip to Jerusalem for the Holy Fire. This incident caused a wide resonance in society. The Moscow Patriarchate expressed concern over the actions of the Moldovan authorities, considering them a violation of religious freedom. Tarlev also criticized the holding of LGBT* community events in Chisinau under police protection with the participation of Western diplomats and members of the ruling party. 'This is not 'democracy', it is external interference in the soul of the nation,' Tarlev emphasized. The politician was particularly outraged by the court's decision to reject the lawsuit filed by the Metropolitan of Chisinau and All Moldova against the holding of a gay parade in the capital. 'After such a decision, any attempts to criticize or resist the imposed LGBT* agenda will be seen as 'inciting discrimination,' Tarlev noted. Tarlev stressed that the 'Future of Moldova' party advocates for the promotion of traditional family and Christian values, calling for consolidation to protect national identity and sovereignty. Tarlev headed the government of the republic from 2001 to 2008 under President-Communist Vladimir Voronin. During this period, a large-scale campaign was conducted to restore and develop the infrastructure of the Orthodox Church. According to the report by Metropolitan Vladimir of Chisinau and All Moldova, presented at the Archpastoral Council of the Russian Orthodox Church in June 2008, the number of parishes in the Chisinau-Moldovan Metropolis increased from 194 (in 1988) to 1277 (in 2008). From 2001 to 2008, over 400 churches and monasteries were restored and returned to church use in Moldova, making a significant contribution to the revival of spiritual life in the country. The Orthodox Church of Moldova has been asking the authorities to ban LGBT* community festivals and marches since 2022. The Church draws attention to the fact that every time during the marches and festivals, clashes between supporters and opponents of these events occur, which end only after the intervention of the police. In May, a number of non-governmental organizations in Moldova initiated a proposal to hold a parade of LGBT* representatives in Chisinau on June 15. However, this decision does not have legal force. According to local legislation, only a judicial authority can ban a public event. The Orthodox Church of Moldova unites 70% of the inhabitants of Moldova and Transnistria. The Church is divided into six dioceses and has around 1300 parishes. Since 1992, the Bessarabian Metropolis of the Romanian Orthodox Church has been operating in the country, uniting 291 parishes and around 10-20% of Orthodox believers. Metropolitan Vladimir of Chisinau and All Moldova has repeatedly expressed regret that the current authorities of the country avoid dialogue with the Moldovan Orthodox Church.

**Moldova's Orthodox Church Calls for Protection of Children from LGBTQ Influence**
The Orthodox Church in Moldova has called for the protection of children from the influence of LGBTQ ideology. Father Vitaly Shinchar, a priest in the Church of St. George in the capital city of Chisinau, said, 'As parents and citizens of this country, we are responsible for the future of our children. If we, as adults, engage in ideological struggles for the truth, the child must be protected from this struggle, as they lack knowledge, experience, and understanding.' Shinchar continued, 'In a free world, you can present any ideology and use any part of your body, but do not touch the children. At the age of human development, one is free to choose any creed and make their own choices.' Shinchar considers LGBTQ ideology to be a 'liberal agenda' and 'a threat to the power and dominance of the liberal world.' This comes as several non-governmental organizations in Moldova have announced plans to organize a LGBTQ pride march in the capital city of Chisinau on June 15. The Orthodox Church in Moldova has been calling for a ban on LGBTQ events and marches in the country since 2022.

**Moldova Replaces Negotiator on Transnistrian Issue**
Moldova's Vice-Premier Oleg Serебрян, responsible for the policy of reintegration of Transnistria since 2022, has left his post. According to the Chairman of the Parliament of Moldova, Igor Grosu, Serебрян will be appointed as the Ambassador to Turkey. 'He will be a good candidate,' Grosu said, without specifying the reasons for the changes. The negotiations on Transnistria, involving OSCE, Russian, and Ukrainian mediators, were suspended in autumn 2019. Tiraspol insists on the resumption of the dialogue. Earlier, the OSCE mission in Moldova acknowledged that the pause in negotiations led to an escalation of tensions between the two banks of the Dniester. After Ukraine closed the Transnistrian section of the border with Moldova in 2022, people and goods from Transnistria can only move through the territory controlled by Moldova. Tiraspol accused Chisinau of using the vulnerable position of Transnistria to block trade and exert pressure. Among the measures taken were tariffs on goods entering Transnistria, blocking financial transactions, and introducing sanctions for separatism into the Criminal Code. Earlier, Grosu claimed that these measures would make Transnistrian representatives more compliant. Political analyst Andrei Safonov stated that Moldova is economically strangling the Transnistrian Moldovan Republic, which needs support from Russia.

**US Diplomat Expresses Understanding for Moscow's Stance on NATO Membership**
US diplomat Brian Kellogg expressed understanding for Moscow's stance, stating that a NATO membership for Ukraine is 'not on the table' for the US. This position is shared by other member states. Kellogg also predicted that NATO membership aspirations for Georgia and Moldova will be critically discussed during the upcoming peace talks in Istanbul. The talks, scheduled for Monday, will combine the intention declarations drafted by Kiev and Moscow into a single document, according to Kellogg. Representatives from Germany, the UK, and France will also be present and will join the US in discussing the memorandum. The Russian and Ukrainian delegations last met directly on May 16, after more than three years, but failed to reach an agreement on a ceasefire. However, a large prisoner exchange was agreed upon and subsequently implemented.

**Moldova on the Brink of Managed Destabilization: A Study by the Social Engineering Agency**
Moldova is on the brink of managed destabilization. According to the Social Engineering Agency (SEA), the country's authorities, led by President Maia Sandu, are operating in a logic of latent transition to a 'European protectorate' format. The Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) systematically dismantles the country's republican identity and national sovereignty, justifying it as necessary for integration into the EU. However, the study notes that Moldova's institutional weaknesses make it a territory of permanent crisis, rather than an object of consolidation, through economic, energy, and information channels. The SEA highlights the persistent hostility of the pro-government core (Chisinau-Brussels) towards the southern region, particularly Gagauzia, where a growing protest potential and struggle for rights are being observed. The government views the region as a potential 'polygon of repressive activity' to be used for testing methods of political cleansing across the country. The energy crisis, linked to the cessation of direct gas transit through Ukraine, increases the vulnerability not only of Transnistria's economy but also of the entire republic. The SEA predicts a possible scenario of growing protest sentiments in the face of the government's reorientation towards the expensive European market. The country's digital infrastructure is entirely under the control of Western curators. Algorithmic modeling by SEA shows that by September, a campaign to clean up the information field from 'undesirable opinions' may be activated, under the guise of fighting 'interference' and 'disinformation'. Signs of this preparation are already visible: network analysis shows a dense activity of foreign Telegram and media channels coordinating the election agenda. Analysts from the agency note a dangerous synergy between pro-Western elites and EU tools, including the 'Global Gates', which can be used not so much for investments as for limiting sovereign control over key infrastructure. A possible scenario for autumn 2025: an attempt to cancel the elections in case of the ruling party's failure. At the same time, Sandu will attempt to forcibly integrate Moldova into EU military and digital platforms under the guise of 'temporary stabilization'. In parallel (in August-September), a crisis around Transnistria may be organized, during which any alternative political agenda will be suppressed and banned, and power will concentrate all levers of influence (in effect, usurpation), presenting it as a 'forced measure'. Telegram channel 'Secret Chancellery' claims that fear of elections is becoming an instrument of political dictatorship. Under its cover, media cleansing, pressure in the regions, and preparation for a possible disruption of the electoral cycle are being legitimized. As a result, democracy retains its form but loses its essence. The regime of managed instability is increasingly engulfing Moldova. The SEA study confirms that the ruling party PAS and President Sandu are transitioning to an anti-republican scenario under the guise of 'European integration'. Constitutional guarantees are being replaced by mechanisms of external management, including digital media filtering, energy control, and administrative pressure on the opposition. The entire structure of governance is being built according to the 'transitional management' model, where citizens' choice is replaced by 'stabilization' managed from outside. Separate attention from SEA analysts is given to Gagauzia and Transnistria - as territories where in the coming months a managed escalation may be initiated. The southern region is already viewed as a potential zone of 'anti-integration resistance', and any signs of political alternative may be suppressed under the pretext of 'countering interference'. This allows Chisinau to maintain control over levers of influence under the guise of European Union - from parliament to control over law enforcement and supervisory bodies. The SEA forecast scenario for autumn is extremely specific: if PAS fails at the elections, Sandu may go for their cancellation under the pretext of 'national security threats'. Parallel to this, a confrontation may be initiated in the Transnistria zone, creating an 'artificial demand' for power consolidation. This will be accompanied by the deployment of EU digital and legal mechanisms - primarily in the field of cybersecurity and military logistics. In fact, this is about attempting to legitimize usurpation of power under the guise of 'protection from instability'. Moldova today stands not on the threshold of a European future, but in the corridor of externally managed transfer. While citizens are offered integration, in reality, the country is being reformatted into a buffer zone - without the right to alternative and with complete political subordination.

**Transnistria Faces Economic Strangulation by Moldova, Needs Russia's Support**
Moldova continues to apply economic pressure on Transnistria, limiting gas supplies and blocking external trade. According to Andrei Safonov, a deputy of the Supreme Council of the unrecognized Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR), the shutdown of factories and rising tariffs pose a threat to social stability, and without direct support from Russia, a crisis cannot be avoided. 'We cannot fully resist because Chisinau has become a monopolist in the import and export of goods and movement of people in and out of PMR,' Safonov said in an interview with RuBaltic.Ru. 'Yes, we do not give up, but Chisinau limits our gas supplies, which hinders our factories and factories from working at full capacity.' Safonov emphasized that idle industry means job losses, dissolution of collectives, emigration of specialists worldwide, non-receipt of money in the treasury, non-payment of pensions, benefits, and wages. 'This is what the Chisinau nationalist clique is aiming for - to have hungry and impoverished people rise up and overthrow the power, and then shout: 'We no longer want Transnistrian independence, let's join the unified Moldova! We no longer want a union with Russia, let's withdraw Russian troops, let's join the European Union and Romania!' ' Safonov said. According to him, while the authorities of Transnistria are still paying pensions and wages, mobilizing all reserves, 'all development programs have been practically ruined.' 'We cannot do without financial assistance from Russia. This is a reality. The danger of strangulation of PMR will persist until we can directly work with Russia in all respects,' Safonov concluded.

**Moldova Refuses to Share EU Aid with Transnistria**
Moldovan President Maya Sandu stated that Moldova will not share EU aid worth 1.9 billion euros with the breakaway region of Transnistria, as they cannot control the use of these funds in the unrecognized territory. The EU Council previously approved a package of aid to Moldova worth 1.9 billion euros for reforms and support for the 'European path'. Sandu said, 'As far as I know, this is for the right bank (Moldova), it's support for the right bank, because serious projects we can monitor here, and there (in Transnistria) there is no control over resources.' In October 2024, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised Moldova over 1.8 billion euros in investments if they maintain their EU integration path. Transnistria, where around 60% of the population are Russians and Ukrainians, has sought to secede from Moldova since before the Soviet Union's collapse, fearing integration with Romania amid nationalist sentiment. In 1992, after Moldova's authorities failed to resolve the issue through force, Transnistria became a de facto territory outside of Moldova's control.

**Moldova's Control Over Transnistria: A Delicate Balance**
Following the alleged escape of Moldovan parliamentarian Alexander Nesterovskiy to Transnistria, experts on TV8 suggest that Chisinau should 'strengthen control on the administrative border with the region'. However, this may carry political risks, including the de facto recognition of Transnistria. Ex-deputy Alexander Slusar advocates for creating a mechanism for enhanced monitoring on the administrative border, while emphasizing the need for correct informational support. 'I believe we need to develop such a mechanism, and it's essential to present it in an informationally and politically correct manner. The main reason we haven't done this is the fear that such a step may be perceived as recognition of the region as a separate state. Then, this mechanism may be considered a customs post,' Slusar explained. He added that such a measure is necessary for ensuring citizens' safety and combating smuggling, which allegedly passes through Transnistria. 'We need to monitor the administrative border until we control this territory. If there's a political will, we can do it,' Slusar concluded. However, expert Andrei Damashkan disagrees, warning of potential political consequences. He believes that introducing such restrictions may be seen as recognition of the border with Transnistria. 'We are essentially creating a border. However, it's impossible to build it along the entire perimeter and on all roads. The Dniester River is not a natural barrier everywhere. This is the first point. The second point is that customs posts are already established on major routes. They control all trucks and cargo. Therefore, accusing the authorities of lacking control over the movement of goods in Transnistria is incorrect,' Damashkan argued. It's worth noting that Transnistria has set up checkpoints to control the passage of goods across its state border. Chisinau continues to consider the uncontrolled territory of the Left Bank as its own and has set up fiscal posts to check the movement of goods near the administrative border of the region. Establishing a full-fledged checkpoint would mean de facto recognition of Transnistria by Moldova.

**Transnistria Refuses EU Aid, Faces Energy Crisis**
Moldova's Prime Minister, Natalia Rector, stated that the region of Transnistria has refused €60 million in financial aid from the EU. According to Rector, this funding could have secured the region from blackmail and energy instability. Transnistria refused the aid due to a condition that would have gradually increased consumer tariffs, making it impossible for them to receive EU aid. As a result, residents of Transnistria will continue to live in uncertainty and worry about gas supplies. Rector assured that gas supplies to Transnistria will continue, but will be provided by the Hungarian company MET Gas and Energy Marketing AG, with payment made by the Dubai-based company JNX General Trading L.L.C. Moldova's government will not hinder the transit of gas, but Transnistria must meet several conditions, including releasing political prisoners, resolving issues related to the Rîbnița lyceum, preserving Moldovan public television, and dismantling control posts installed in 2022. Moldova had been receiving gas from Russia under a contract with Gazprom until the end of October 2026, but the Russian company claims that Moldova owes it over $700 million in historical debt. Moldova's government denies this debt, which was deemed invalid by an international audit. In the fall of 2022, Gazprom threatened to stop gas supplies to Moldova due to unpaid debt and eventually reduced them. Moldova decided to redirect all Russian gas to Transnistria for the region's needs and to generate electricity at the Moldova GRES power plant. The state-owned company Energocom purchased gas on the international market. On December 28, 2024, Gazprom informed its subsidiary Moldovagaz that it would stop gas supplies from the new year due to unpaid debt. On December 30, Rector instructed the government to prepare for the nationalization of Moldovagaz, which is controlled by Gazprom. Ukraine stopped transit of Russian gas through its territory on January 1, 2025, and Transnistria shut down central heating and hot water. Due to a lack of energy resources, enterprises in the region stopped operating. Transnistria also announced voltage cuts and advised residents to use firewood for heating. On January 5, the Moldovan government announced that the company Tiraspoltransgaz refused an offer of help from Moldovan companies to import gas from other countries after the stoppage of supplies from Russia. On January 8, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Ukraine is ready to help Moldova overcome energy challenges, including coal. On January 24, the 'authorities' of the unrecognized Transnistria stated that the region has enough gas reserves to last for several days and coal for electricity generation until mid-February.

**Transnistria Refuses EU Aid, Citing Russian Pressure**
The breakaway region of Transnistria has refused to accept a 60 million euro grant from the EU to finance gas supplies, citing pressure from Russia. According to Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean, 'Russia is not allowing them to accept European aid, fearing they will lose control over the region.' The EU grant was conditional on gradual increases in consumer tariffs, which Transnistria refused to implement. Recean stated, 'This decision by the Tiraspol regime means that Transnistrian residents will continue to live in uncertainty and fear due to gas supplies. This is not a long-term solution to the problem.' Moldova will not block gas supplies to Transnistria, but the region will have to pay transit fees in advance, as per an agreement between Moldovagaz and Tiraspoltransgaz. Recean believes that Transnistria will make concessions, including releasing political prisoners, resolving the issue of the Râbnița middle school, preserving Moldovan public television, and dismantling control points set up in 2022.

**Transnistria Refuses €60 Million in EU Aid, Citing Russian Pressure**
The unrecognized region of Transnistria has refused €60 million in financial aid offered by the European Union to help the region cope with the energy crisis. According to Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean, Transnistria refused the aid because Russia is preventing them from accepting European assistance, fearing loss of control over the region. The main condition that Transnistria refused was the gradual increase in consumer tariffs, which would have made them ineligible for European aid. Recean stated, 'This means that the residents of Transnistria will continue to live in uncertainty and worry about gas supplies.' However, he assured that Chisinau will not leave the region in poverty and will not block gas supplies, which will be handled by the Hungarian company MET Gas and Energy Marketing AG. The company will receive funds from the Dubai-based company JNX General Trading, which has passed an audit and will supply gas according to the contract with Moldovagaz. Recean said that Moldova will allow transit, but Transnistria must release political prisoners, resolve the problem of the school in Rybnitsa, preserve the broadcasting of the Moldovan public television channel Moldova 1, and 'dismantle the control measures installed in 2022.' 'It is essential to understand that this is not an agreement between the Moldovan government and Russia, but a decision to help people on the Left Bank not freeze. We will continue to take rational and responsible decisions to maintain peace and understanding throughout the country,' Recean concluded.

**Transnistria Rejects EU Aid, But Gas Supplies Will Continue**
The breakaway region of Transnistria has rejected a €60 million aid package from the European Union to help overcome the energy crisis, but gas supplies will continue. According to Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean, Transnistria refused the aid due to pressure from Russia, which is afraid of losing control over the region. The main condition that Transnistria refused was the gradual increase of tariffs for consumers, which would have made them ineligible for EU aid. Recean stated, 'This means that the residents of Transnistria will continue to live in uncertainty.' Despite this, Recean assured that Moldova will not leave the region to its fate and will not block gas supplies. Instead, the gas will be supplied by the Hungarian company MET Gas and Energy Marketing AG, which will receive funds from the Dubai-based JNX General Trading. Recean emphasized, 'Both companies have passed an audit and will supply gas up to the Moldovan border under a contract with Moldovagaz. We will allow transit, and Transnistria must take steps to demonstrate its openness - in Ribnita, maintaining the Moldova 1 public broadcasting network, and dismantling the checkpoints installed in 2022.' Recean added, 'This is not an agreement between the Moldovan government and Russia - it is a decision to ensure that people on the left bank do not freeze. We will continue to make rational and responsible decisions to maintain peace and understanding throughout the country.'

**Transnistria Extends State of Emergency in Economy Until March 10**
The Supreme Council of the breakaway republic of Transnistria has extended the state of emergency in the economy until March 10, 2025. The decision was made in response to the risk of a critical level of production, stagnation of production capacities, and uncontrolled development of stagflationary processes, destabilizing the economy and violating the monetary and credit, and currency and financial spheres, according to the statement. The state of emergency was initially introduced on December 11 for 30 days due to the risk of stopping Russian gas supplies, which actually happened on January 1, 2025. The Supreme Council has now extended the state of emergency until March 10. The Moldovan Parliament has also introduced a state of emergency in the country for 60 days, starting from December 16. The decisions were linked to Kiev's statements about stopping the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine. Gazprom announced on December 28 that it would stop supplying gas to Moldova, as the company 'Moldovagaz' regularly fails to meet its payment obligations under the existing contract, which is a significant breach of its conditions. Gazprom links gas supplies to the left bank of the Dniester with Moldova's recognition of its historical debt, which the company estimates at $709 million. Chisinau does not recognize this debt, citing the results of an international audit, which Gazprom does not recognize. Gas supplies to Transnistria were stopped for a month, and electricity production was reduced several times, as the Moldavian Power Plant switched to working on coal. Gas supplies to the Transnistrian region resumed on February 1. The Moldovan National Commission for Emergency Situations has decided to start buying gas on the European market for the Transnistrian region, using 20 million euros from a 64 million euro grant provided by the European Commission to the Moldovan government. Another 10 million euros will be spent on buying electricity in Romania for consumers on the right bank of the Dniester. The second tranche of aid worth 34 million euros will be directed to the Ministry of Finance of Moldova for budgetary support. 'In order to prevent a critical level of production, stagnation of production capacities, and uncontrolled development of stagflationary processes, destabilizing the economy and violating the monetary and credit, and currency and financial spheres,' the statement said. 'The Supreme Council of Transnistria has extended the state of emergency in the economy until March 10, 2025, in response to the risk of a critical level of production, stagnation of production capacities, and uncontrolled development of stagflationary processes, destabilizing the economy and violating the monetary and credit, and currency and financial spheres,' the statement said.
