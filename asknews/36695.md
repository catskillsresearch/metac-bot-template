**21 Democrats who may try to succeed Trump in the 2028 presidential election**
The 2028 presidential election is already generating buzz, with several Democrats considering a run. Former Vice President Kamala Harris is weighing a 2026 gubernatorial campaign in California and a potential 2028 presidential bid. Other potential contenders include Pete Buttigieg, who has been active in the party and has made a high-profile stop in Iowa; Andy Beshear, the 47-year-old governor of Kentucky, who has expressed interest in running if he can unite the country; and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has co-headlined rallies with Sen. Bernie Sanders and has been floated as a potential primary challenger to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Other notable Democrats mentioned as potential contenders include Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, and Gina Raimondo, the former governor of Rhode Island. The field is wide open, and it won't be long before we see clear maneuvering from a litany of candidates.

**Trump rules out 2028 run as Republican contenders quietly position for next race**
President Donald Trump has ruled out running for a third term in 2028, stating 'I'm not looking at that' and 'I'll be a two-term president.' Despite this, Trump's 2028 flirtations have kept the spotlight on him, and potential Republican contenders are quietly positioning themselves for the next election. Vice President JD Vance appears to be the heir apparent to the 'America First' movement, but has not taken steps towards a 2028 presidential run. Other potential contenders include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Governor Ron DeSantis, Governor Glenn Youngkin, Governor Brian Kemp, Senator Ted Cruz, and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and former Vice President Mike Pence are also being considered as possible 2028 contenders.

**Can the Democrats be saved? Potential candidates for the 2028 election are emerging**
The Democratic Party is struggling to find a strong candidate for the 2028 presidential election. The party has a significant image problem, with only 27% of voters in key swing states believing that the Democrats care about their concerns. The party is plagued by internal conflicts and a lack of consistency, with some members advocating for a return to the moderate policies of the Clinton era and others pushing for a more populist, 'America first' approach. Despite this, several potential candidates are emerging, including Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, who has been praised for her pragmatic and bipartisan approach; Pete Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary, who has been positioning himself as a centrist and has been critical of the party's tendency to lecture voters; Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, who has been endorsed by former President Barack Obama and has a strong track record of winning in swing states; Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, who has been trying to distance himself from the party's image problem and has been critical of some of its more liberal policies; J.B. Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, who has been critical of President Trump and has been positioning himself as a more moderate Democrat; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young and outspoken congresswoman from New York, who has been seen as a potential leader of the party's left wing; and Kamala Harris, the former vice president, who has been sending signals that she may run again in 2028. However, it is unclear whether any of these candidates will be able to overcome the party's image problem and win the nomination.

**It's Kamala Harris's nomination to lose in 2028 -- and she's already losing it**
Despite having a wealth of advantages, Kamala Harris's team seems uncertain about her next move. Her recent reappearance in the public sphere has been unremarkable, rehashing Democratic tropes about Donald Trump and offering policy bromides. Harris's polling numbers and identity qualifications should make her a front-runner for the 2028 Democratic nomination, but she lacks strategic vision and confidence. Her team's tentative rollout has shown that she is petrified of angering or annoying anyone in her fractious party. Harris needs to establish herself independently, take risks, and show she has the political chops to run for president on her own. As Keith Naughton writes, 'The 2028 nomination is not going to be handed to her. She is going to have to work for it and show she has the political chops to run for president on her own.'

**Who Will Be the Next Republican Presidential Candidate?**
Following Donald Trump's statement that he won't seek a third term, the Republican Party is looking for a new candidate to take the reins. Fox News has identified six potential candidates, including JD Vance, Marco Rubio, Ron DeSantis, Glenn Youngkin, Brian Kemp, and Ted Cruz. Trump mentioned Vance and Rubio as possible successors in a recent interview. Vance is seen as a natural successor to Trump's 'America First' movement, while Rubio has been a high-ranking official in the Trump administration. However, the MAGA line is skeptical of Rubio's intentions. DeSantis, who lost to Trump in the 2024 Republican primary, has since repaired his relationship with Trump and has been helping him with fundraising and campaigning. However, DeSantis has been facing controversy over his disagreements with the Florida state legislature and a charity scandal involving his wife. Youngkin, a businessman who has risen through the ranks of the Republican Party, is seen as a promising candidate. Kemp, a conservative who has been praised by Trump, is also being considered. Cruz, who came in second to Trump in the 2016 Republican primary, has been a vocal critic of Trump's trade policies. Other potential candidates include Nikki Haley, who ran in the 2024 Republican primary.

**Jessica Tarlov Rattles off Brutal Trump Poll Numbers on Fox News: 'Does Not Bode Well' for Republicans**
Fox News co-host Jessica Tarlov discussed the Democratic Party's problems in the polls, but then turned the tables by highlighting unflattering numbers for President Donald Trump. According to Tarlov, Trump is underwater on several major issues, including the economy (-16), foreign policy (-14), handling tariffs (-26), and cost-of-living (-32). She also noted that the reconciliation bill, which aims to extend tax cuts while cutting Medicaid, has opposition from more senators than it can handle. Tarlov stated, 'So, if this is the big ticket item, that we're gonna give tax cuts to the wealthy and we're gonna take away food assistance and Medicaid, so we're hurting the poor to help the rich, that does not bode well for 2026 for the Republicans or for 2028.' She concluded by predicting Democratic victories in the upcoming elections.

Beshear has hosted his teenagers to teach him how to use youth slang, while Whitmer has appeared on 'Pod Save America' and discussed her recent hug with President Trump. Buttigieg has appeared on Andrew Schulz's 'Flagrant' podcast and discussed his personal life, including his experiences serving in the military and raising his biracial children.

**From the desk ofâ¦ JD Vance will be the nominee in 2028-mark my words**
Indiana Republican Sen. Jim Banks believes that JD Vance will be the Republican nominee for president in 2028. Banks, a long-time advocate for Vance, says that Vance has the skills and abilities to succeed President Trump and implement his policies. Banks predicts that Vance will win the 2028 general election if Republicans follow his prescription for lasting GOP success, which includes diminishing the influence of China, becoming a pro-worker party, pursuing peace through strength, restoring American manufacturing, and replacing wokeism with patriotism. Banks also believes that President Trump's goals are higher than securing the next Republican victory, and that he wants to diminish China and give America a better shot for the future. Banks thinks that Trump wants to keep and grow the majorities in the midterms, but what he wants more than that is to leave a lasting legacy and diminish China's influence.
