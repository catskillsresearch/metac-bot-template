**Trump Shares Baseless Conspiracy Theory: 'Biden Died in 2020 and Was Replaced by a Robot'**
Former US President Donald Trump has shared a baseless conspiracy theory that former President Joe Biden died in 2020 and was replaced by a robot. In a post on 'Truth Social', Trump, 78, claimed that his political rival, Biden, 82, was 'executed' in 2020 and replaced by a 'synthetic copy' - without the Democrats' knowledge. The post reads: 'There is no Joe Biden... He was executed in 2020.' Trump continued to claim that the 'real' Biden was replaced by 'synthetic copies and robot entities without soul or intellect', and that 'Democrats don't know the difference.' Trump's supporters quickly backed his claim, sharing satirical images of Biden, with some urging Trump to 'hunt him down.' Some commentators pointed out Biden's earlobes, claiming they were separate before 2020, but are now connected, with one even suggesting that the government broadcast a salute from Biden using artillery fire in Arlington on inauguration day. Meanwhile, critics described Trump's participation in the post as 'disturbing', according to the British Independent newspaper. Trump's wife, Melania Trump, was also the subject of similar conspiracy theories, with some claiming she was replaced by a duplicate during his first term. The White House dismissed these theories as 'unrealistic' at the time. The British newspaper reported that Trump appeared to be preoccupied with conspiracy theories throughout the weekend, including on Friday when he claimed that CBS News had deleted an interview with Stephen Colbert in 2015.

**Inauguration Ceremony of Newly Elected President Expected on 4th at National Assembly**
The inauguration ceremony of the newly elected president is expected to take place on the 4th at the National Assembly, a day after the presidential election. The ceremony will be a simple one, focusing on the president's oath, and may not include traditional elements such as the bell-ringing ceremony, military band performance, and the Speaker's procession, as the newly elected president will start their term immediately after being elected. This is because the election was held due to the impeachment of the previous president. The ceremony will likely follow the precedent set by President Moon Jae-in, who was inaugurated on May 10, 2017, without taking office as a candidate, and took the oath in a ceremony attended by over 300 dignitaries. The exact schedule and location of the ceremony will be confirmed after the election results are finalized.

**Warnock uninterested in Biden 2024 postmortem after being named in Tapper book: 'It's over'**
Georgia senator Raphael Warnock stated that he is 'absolutely' focused on the current task at hand and not on speculations about former President Joe Biden's fitness for office. Warnock was named in a book as someone who would have considered a 2024 presidential run had Biden stepped down earlier. However, Warnock shifted the conversation to Republican attempts to cut Medicaid, saying that the GOP is 'literally trying to take healthcare away from children.' He suggested allowing tax cuts to expire for those making $500,000 or more a year to prevent cutting important programs. Warnock, who is up for election in 2026, has been mentioned as a potential leading figure in the Democratic party in the years to come.

**Trump Mocks Biden, Claims He's Been Replaced by a Robot Since 2020**
US President Donald Trump mocked his Democratic opponent, former President Joe Biden, in a tweet on his Truth Social platform. Trump wrote that Biden had died in 2020 and was replaced by a robot without the Democrats' knowledge. This tweet is part of Trump's ongoing criticism of Biden's performance as President, which he has held since 2020. Recently, Biden has struggled with attention deficit, lack of focus, and awareness of his surroundings, often requiring his Vice President Kamala Harris to guide him and prevent him from making embarrassing statements in front of the media. Harris has even given Biden guidance cards to carry with him during official events to avoid embarrassing situations, especially after Biden turned 81 years old. Biden withdrew from the last presidential election as the Democratic representative two months before the US presidential election after receiving advice from Obama due to age restrictions.

**Trump backs madcap theory Joe Biden was killed and replaced with clone in 2020**
President Donald Trump has endorsed a conspiracy theory that Joe Biden was killed and replaced by a 'clone' in 2020. The theory, shared on Trump's TruthSocial site, claims that Biden was executed and replaced by a robotic entity. Trump's endorsement of the theory has sparked a social media frenzy, with over 14,000 likes from his supporters. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and Biden was inaugurated as president in January 2021 alongside Kamala Harris. This is not the first time Trump has shared unhinged conspiracy theories, having previously suggested the father of rival Republican Ted Cruz was involved in the JFK assassination and promoted the 'birther' conspiracy that falsely claimed President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.

**Surprising Candidate Emerges As Clear Democrat Frontrunner for 2028 (It’s NOT Kamala Harris Or AOC) - Conservative Angle**
A new poll has emerged showing Pete Buttigieg as the clear frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic presidential election, surpassing Kamala Harris and AOC. According to the poll, Buttigieg has 32% of the vote, with AOC at 20% and Harris at 15%. However, Buttigieg has stated that he is undecided about running for president in 2028, saying 'there are times I follow that process and decided to run, and there are times I followed that process and decided not to run — and the process can lead you to surprising places.' If Buttigieg does decide to run, he may face off against JD Vance, the current Republican frontrunner for the 2028 presidential election.

**Biden Says He Doesn't Regret Running for Re-election in 2024**
Former US President Joe Biden said he does not regret his decision to run for re-election in 2024. He also stated that at the time, there were no objections to his candidacy from the Democratic Party. When asked about concerns from Democrats about whether he should have stepped down earlier, Biden dismissed the criticism. 'Why didn't they run against me? Because I would have beaten them,' he said to journalists in New Castle, Delaware. Biden also criticized a recent book by CNN and Axios journalists about his health problems, his concealment of them, and his 'catastrophic decision to run.' He joked that those present could see that he is 'mentally impaired and can't walk.' Biden optimistically assessed his chances of recovery from aggressive prostate cancer, which was diagnosed in May 2025. He announced his candidacy for re-election in late April 2023, but his re-election was overshadowed by concerns about his age and skepticism about his ability to perform the duties of president for another four years. He withdrew his candidacy on July 21, 2024, less than a month after disastrous debates against then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The forum raised concerns about Biden's age and mental acuity, as he seemed to struggle to answer questions or remain attentive. Former Vice President Kamala Harris became a candidate for the party, but ultimately lost to Donald Trump in November 2024. Biden, who has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, said he hopes to overcome the disease - his doctors are optimistic. He told about his condition and said he is already undergoing treatment. On May 30, Biden appeared in public for the first time after his diagnosis. He visited his grandson Robert Hunter Biden II's graduation at Salisbury School in Connecticut with his family. Biden was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer on May 16. He thanked everyone who expressed support. Meanwhile, a member of the House of Representatives, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who has treated Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, said that Biden's doctor, Kevin O'Connor, either does not understand his job or lied to the American people. The lawmaker claimed that Biden may have only 12 to 18 months left to live. President of the United States Donald Trump commented on the information about Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis. He wished Biden a speedy recovery. However, less than two weeks later, Trump said he was not sorry for his 82-year-old predecessor, who had been diagnosed with cancer. He called Biden 'harsh' and urged not to pity him.

**After Selling "Trump 2028" Hats, President Vows Not to Run for Third Term**
President Trump has clarified that he will not run for a third term, stating 'I don't know if that's constitutional that they're not allowing you to do it, but there are many people selling the 2028 hat. But this is not something I'm looking to do.' Trump expressed his intention to finish his current term strong and prepare for the Republican Party's future beyond his presidency. He mentioned several potential successors, including Vice President JD Vance, who he described as 'fantastic' and 'brilliant.' Trump also believes the MAGA movement will outlast his presidency, contrasting Republican unity and talent with what he describes as Democratic 'disarray.'

**Beshear, Raimondo, Gabbard keep door open to running for president in 2028**
Several high-profile politicians have expressed interest in running for president in 2028. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said he would consider running if he felt he could unite the country. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, also a Democrat, ruled out a run, saying he is 'not running' and is focused on his work in Maryland. Former Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, said she would consider running, citing the need for introspection and a strong platform. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate, said he is not thinking about a 2028 presidential run. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who joined the Republican Party in 2024, said she would not rule out a future presidential bid. President Donald Trump has speculated about running for a third term, but said he would be a 'two-term president' and is not looking to run in 2028.

**Trump: I Will Be President for 8 Years**
US President Donald Trump said he will be president for 8 years and has not held any official meetings to discuss a path for a third term. Trump stated that he is looking to spend 4 great years and then hand over the presidency to someone, preferably a Republican. In March, White House spokesperson Caroline Leavitt said that Trump clearly stated he is not considering running for a third presidential term. Trump said, 'I'm not joking' about seeking a third term, indicating that he is considering ways to overcome a constitutional barrier that prevents him from continuing to lead the country after his second term ends in early 2029. Trump explained in a phone interview with NBC that 'there are ways to do that.' He added, 'It's too early to think about that.' The 22nd Amendment, added to the US Constitution in 1951 after President Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to four consecutive terms, states that 'no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.' When asked by NBC's Kristen Welker if one of the possible ways to get a third term is for Vice President JD Vance to run for president and then 'pass the torch' to him later, Trump said, 'Yes, that's one, but there are other options too. There are other choices.' When asked if he could reveal another option, Trump replied, 'No.' Trump also stated that he would like to continue holding 'the toughest job in the country' at the age of 82 at the end of his second term, saying, 'I love working.' He suggested that Americans may agree to let him have a third term due to his popularity.

**Barack Obama Thought Kamala Harris Would Lose to Trump, Book Reveals**
According to Fox News, former US President Barack Obama believed that Kamala Harris should not be a candidate for the 2024 US presidential election. In private conversations, Obama reportedly told allies that Harris would lose to Trump, as stated in the book 'The Battle: Inside the Most Turbulent Struggle for the White House'. Obama also thought that Harris should not be a candidate, as mentioned in the book. Despite this, Obama and his wife Michelle officially endorsed Harris' candidacy in the summer of 2024. The presidential election took place in November 2024, with Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris as the candidates. Democrat Joe Biden, who was 82 years old at the time, dropped out of the race after a poor performance in the debates with Trump. It was previously reported that Biden regrets his decision not to participate in the presidential campaign.

**Trump Claims Americans Want Him to Run for Re-election, Despite Constitutional Ban**
US President Trump stated on Monday local time that Americans want him to run for re-election, which is prohibited by the US Constitution, but he still claims it is possible. When asked about the possibility of a third term, Trump said in the Oval Office, 'People are asking me to run.' 'I don't know. I've never investigated it. They say there's a way to do it, but I don't know, and I haven't investigated it.' Trump said that competing with former President Obama for a second term would be a good thing, 'I'm happy about it.' Trump stated during an interview with NBC News on Sunday that he was serious about seeking a third term, 'I'm not joking.' Trump, 78, was the first Republican president from 2017 to 2021 and lost his re-election bid to Democrat Biden. Last year, he defeated Democrat Harris and began his second term on January 20 this year. The tradition of not seeking a third term was established by the first US President Washington in 1797, and was formally added to the US Constitution in 1951 with the 22nd Amendment, which prohibits anyone from being elected president more than twice.

**Dems planned for Biden to withdraw from presidential race, ‘die in office’ — as far back as 2023, scathing new book claims**
According to a new book, Democrats had contingency plans in place as far back as 2023 to prepare for former President Joe Biden's potential withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race or his death in office. The plans, which were made in 'hush-hush talks' by officials at the Democratic National Committee, included scenarios such as Biden stepping aside before the primaries, securing enough delegates but dropping out before the convention, or leaving a vacancy at the top of the ticket after taking the nomination. Top Dems had fretted for months that Biden, who was 82 at the time, wouldn't make it through the campaign. As one official put it, 'It shows what we had to do to prepare with the unique circumstances we had, which was an 80-plus-year-old president who was running.' Jamal Simmons, Harris' then-communications director, even prepared a 'death-pool roster' of judges who could quickly be called to swear Harris into office, if necessary. Simmons publicly suggested Biden step down from office before the inauguration, saying 'He could resign the presidency in the next 30 days, make Kamala Harris president of the United States.' Biden ultimately withdrew from the 2024 presidential race on July 21.

**2028 US Presidential Election: Top Democratic Candidates Emerge**
Despite the 2028 presidential election being relatively far away, the competition within the Democratic Party is already heating up. Several prominent leaders are seeking to strengthen their national presence and build strong support networks in preparation for the biggest race in the United States. While no official candidate has announced their candidacy yet, the actions of some political figures clearly indicate their future ambitions. Amidst the ongoing uncertainty within the party about how to deal with President Donald Trump's policies after his 2024 win, the competition between Democrats in 2028 appears more open than ever. A report by Axios highlighted the top names vying for the potential presidential race, and their political moves that may pave the way to the White House. Pete Buttigieg has shown his national ambitions clearly by running for president in 2020 while serving as the mayor of South Bend in Indiana. He served as the Transportation Secretary in President Biden's administration, where he faced numerous crises. He was considered a strong candidate for the Michigan governor or Senate race next year, but he announced his withdrawal from both races last week. Stacey Abrams has long been considered a potential Democratic presidential candidate, as she has worked to build a national network of supporters and donors over the years and has received more media attention. After Trump's 2024 win, Abrams called for a special legislative session in California to raise funds to challenge the Republican president's policies legally. Abrams has recently tried to present himself as a moderate politician to expand his base of support, and he sparked controversy when he said in a conversation with right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk that allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' and women's sports is 'extremely unfair.' Emanuel, who served as the US Ambassador to Japan during the previous Biden administration, has raised questions about his potential candidacy. Emanuel was Obama's White House Chief of Staff and has appeared in several public events warning of the need for Democrats to reassess their political strategies before the 2026 midterm elections. Emanuel joined CNN as a commentator last month and writes an article in The Washington Post. Walz announced last month that he would not run for the new Senate seat in Minnesota in 2026, leaving the door open for a potential presidential candidacy. Walz, who served as the Governor of Minnesota for two terms and was the Democratic nominee for Vice President in the 2024 presidential election, began a national tour of town halls in Republican-leaning districts. Pritzker is a wealthy businessman who has established himself as one of the symbols of 'Democratic resistance' in Illinois. He has worked to strengthen his national image in recent years and was included in unofficial lists as a potential alternative to President Biden after his poor performance in the first presidential debate last year. Whitmer is considered one of the rising stars in the Democratic Party and has presented herself as a pragmatic and moderate leader since Trump's win. She met with Trump this week to discuss issues related to jobs, tariffs, and defense investments. In recent weeks, she has praised the deployment of National Guard troops to the border to combat illegal immigration and expressed openness to imposing new tariffs to protect industry. However, she refused to join a multi-state lawsuit against Trump's attempt to ban birthright citizenship. Polis, who served as Governor of Colorado for two terms, was one of the names floated as a potential alternative to Biden in the 2024 election. Like Yoder, he has taken a centrist approach since Trump took office, saying in his address to the state that he hopes to work with Trump and Congress 'to secure the border, stop human trafficking, and prevent the flow of illegal weapons and drugs.' He supported Trump's controversial nomination of Robert Kennedy Jr. for Secretary of Health and Human Services. The list of potential candidates also includes Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, and Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy. Axios believes that Democratic leaders are divided on how to face Trump, given the party's identity crisis after the 2024 elections. This time, there is no consensus on the strategy, as Democratic leaders are taking different paths.

**Italian Government Commissions Aci, Ending Sticchi Damiani's 14-Year Presidency**
The Italian government has decided to appoint a commissioner to the Automobile Club d'Italia (Aci), ending the 14-year presidency of Angelo Sticchi Damiani. The decision was made due to a new law limiting the number of terms for public entities with a sports federation nature, such as Aci. A new president will be elected on July 9, with a second round scheduled for July 10. Before the election, Aci will be led by a commissioner appointed by the government. Tullio Del Sette, a former general of the Carabinieri, is a top contender for the role. Sticchi Damiani announced his departure in a letter on February 12, stating that the Aci assembly had convened to elect a new president. 'The Automobile Club d'Italia has convened the new electoral procedure for the election of the president for the 2025-2028 quadrennium, in accordance with article 7 of decree law 31 December 2024, n. 208', the letter read. With the appointment of the commissioner and the election already scheduled, Aci is preparing to turn the page after 14 years of Sticchi Damiani's leadership, while anticipation grows to understand the future structure of the entity and the direction of the new presidency.

**Who Will Save Democracy?**
It has been less than a month since Donald Trump was inaugurated as President of the United States, and the world is already witnessing a daily barrage of announcements that are being hammered home like a sledgehammer. The Gaza Strip? It's enough to make it a luxurious riviera by simply evacuating its inhabitants and building beautiful buildings, disregarding the most basic right of the Gazans to self-determination. International aid? It's too expensive, so it's being interrupted, and USAID is being shut down. As a result, children and the sick are dying every day. And now, Donald Trump is planning to target education by eliminating the federal ministry. He won't succeed, the rule of law exists, or so we think. It's forgetting that he has already reduced it to almost nothing. The man who called or at least allowed the invasion of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, has never had to answer to justice for this crime against democracy. He was able to run for re-election and win, largely. 'God save democracy,' proclaimed Pastor James Woody last Sunday in conclusion of the 'Robinson Talks' in Châtenay-Malabry. The theologian has brilliantly shown in his latest book, 'The Liberty and the First Kings of Israel' (Cerf, 2024), how biblical texts have laid the foundations of democracy, long before the philosophers and revolutions of the 18th century. 'A society is democratic if it recognizes itself as divided, that is, traversed by contradictions of interest, and sets as its modality to associate each citizen equally in the expression, analysis, deliberation, and arbitration of these contradictions,' wrote philosopher Paul Ricœur (in 'Ideology and Utopia,' Points, 1997), who also launched the 'Robinson Talks.' In the face of Donald Trump, who believes he was 'saved by God to restore greatness to America' - and all his illiberal clones who are multiplying everywhere in the world - it may be in these small parish circles where reflection and collective thinking flourish that Christians - let's start with the Lutheran-Reformed Protestants - will be able to affirm that they still have something to say to society and to this world.

**Milei to Return to US to Strengthen Ties with Trump Administration**
Argentine President Javier Milei is set to return to the United States before the end of the month to attend a new summit of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and meet with Elon Musk, owner of Tesla and a member of the new Republican administration. According to sources from the Presidency, Milei's visit aims to strengthen ties between his government and the Trump administration, which shares similar ideological views. While it is not confirmed whether Trump and Milei will meet during the visit, it is expected that they will at least cross paths during the CPAC event. Milei has expressed his support for Trump, and the latter has shown gestures of goodwill towards the Argentine leader, including inviting him to a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago mansion after his election and to his inauguration ceremony. Potential joint initiatives between the two governments include a free trade agreement between the US and Argentina, which Milei has repeatedly mentioned as a priority. He has said, 'Imagine how much we would have grown in those two decades if we had traded with the world's first potential power.' Another possible measure is the creation of a Conservative Nations League to counter the 'woke' ideology and the Agenda 2030. Milei has proposed this idea to Trump, as well as to other conservative leaders such as Giorgia Meloni (Italy), Benjamin Netanyahu (Israel), and Nayib Bukele (El Salvador). Additionally, a new meeting with Musk is confirmed, with whom Milei has met several times since taking office. Musk was appointed by Trump to head the Department of Government Efficiency.

**US Presidential Election 2024: How it Works**
The US presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024. The winner of the election will be determined by the Electoral College system, where the candidate who wins the most votes in a state gets all of that state's electoral votes. In most states, the candidate who wins the most votes gets all of the state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, where the electoral votes are allocated proportionally. To be eligible to vote in the US, one must be a US citizen and at least 18 years old. The candidates will finance their campaigns through donations and the 'Citizen-United-Urteil' allows for indirect campaign support with few restrictions. The election process is complex, with multiple stages, including the nomination convention, debates, and the final election. The winner of the election will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. As of now, the candidates for the election are Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, with the first debate scheduled for September 10, 2024. The election will be a crucial moment in US history, with the winner determining the course of the country's future.
