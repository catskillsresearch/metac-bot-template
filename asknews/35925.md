**Congress Is On Track To End America's Battery Boom**
The Republican-led House of Representatives has passed a bill that would end America's battery boom by eliminating tax credits for electric vehicles and battery production. According to an analysis by Princeton University's REPEAT Project, this would 'reduce annual sales of electric vehicles by roughly 40% in 2030 and end America's battery manufacturing boom.' The bill would also roll back Biden-era tailpipe emission and fuel economy rules, and revoke California's zero-emission vehicle mandate. Experts say the battery industry will be slammed on multiple fronts, with some at-risk policies supporting battery makers more directly. The tax credit for EV buyers, 30D, includes provisions that push manufacturers to onshore and friendshore battery production, but the House voted to terminate the credit at the end of 2026, six years early. According to the REPEAT Project, if the House bill becomes law and EV demand slows down, all planned U.S. battery capacity that is not up and running by the end of 2025 may not be necessary in 2030. This could result in far fewer American manufacturing jobs over time, with the International Council on Clean Transportation estimating that repealing the EV provisions in the IRA could slash U.S. battery production by roughly 75% in 2030, from the 1,050 gigawatt-hours currently planned to 250 GWh.

**Trump Tax Bill Passes House: What Clean Energy Stakeholders Need to Know**
The House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump's tax bill, which includes significant cuts to clean energy tax credits added under President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The bill now heads to the Senate, where changes may be made to lessen the impact on the clean energy sector. Key changes include: the elimination of tax credits for clean energy generation and storage facilities that start construction after 60 days after enactment or are placed in service after 2028; the elimination of tax credit transferability under Section 6418 of many IRA tax credits; and the addition of rules that eliminate credits for projects funded by entities or constructed with components from certain prohibited foreign entities, including North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran. The legacy ITC and PTC under Sections 48 and 45 remain largely unchanged, but the bill shortens the runway for geothermal heat pumps to claim the Section 48 ITC. 'It remains to be seen whether and to what extent changes made by the Senate will lessen the impact on the clean energy sector,' said a statement. 'The bill adds a complicated set of rules that eliminate credits starting next year for projects funded by entities or constructed with components from certain prohibited foreign entities,' according to the bill. 'The bill also eliminates the production tax credit for sales of electricity produced at qualified clean hydrogen facilities beginning next year,' the bill states.

**Putin Signs Law Requiring Localization of Taxi Manufacturing in Russia**
Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law requiring the localization of taxi manufacturing. The law aims to increase the use of domestically produced or significantly localized taxis in Russia. According to the law, taxis will be allowed to operate if they meet one of the following requirements: they meet the government's localization requirements for state procurements, or they were produced under a special investment contract (SPIC) between March 1, 2022, and March 1, 2025. The law will come into effect gradually, with the first stage starting on March 1, 2026. However, for certain regions, including Kaliningrad and the Siberian Federal District, the law will not come into effect until March 1, 2028, and for the Far Eastern Federal District, it will not come into effect until March 1, 2030. From January 1, 2033, the only criterion for registering a taxi will be the number of localization points. The localization points are awarded for performing technological operations in Russia. The law was initially set to come into effect earlier, but it was delayed due to criticism that it would harm the market and increase the cost of rides. The law's authors claim that it will create a significant market for domestic automakers, generating an additional 10-12 billion rubles in tax revenue. 'When we face so many sanctions, challenges, and threats, it's clear that if we don't develop our own automotive industry, no one else will,' said State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin. 'This law will create a significant market for domestic automakers, and we will stimulate both foreign and domestic suppliers to provide components and spare parts for vehicles throughout their entire lifecycle,' said Vladimir Gutenev, head of the Committee on Industry and Trade. 'This is extremely important, especially given the volatile exchange rate, and it's not just about additional taxes for local and federal budgets.'

**Vegetable Oil Industries to Have ICMS Deferred on Importation of Raw Materials Until July**
The 27th Extraordinary Meeting of the Council Deliberative of the Programs of Development of Mato Grosso (Condeprodemat) approved the deferment of ICMS on the importation of refined and semi-refined cottonseed oil for food industries benefiting from the Industrial and Commercial Development Program (Prodeic). The measure is valid until July 31 and aims to ensure the continuity of production in the face of the scarcity of raw materials in the domestic market. According to Anderson Lombardi, Secretary-Adjunct of Industry, Commerce and Programmatic Incentives, 'It is a necessary measure, as we are in the off-season and the local market does not have raw materials for the production of vegetable oil. The deferment period was defined until July 31 and was adequate so that industries do not face shutdowns.' The differential tax treatment will be valid for 60 days and adds to other measures adopted by the Government of Mato Grosso to preserve the competitiveness of local industry.

**Sugar Harvest Advances in NOA Region with 12 Operating Sugar Mills**
The 2025 sugar cane harvest in the NOA region has begun with 12 operating sugar mills. The Instituto de Promoción del Azúcar y Alcohol de Tucumán (IPAAT) has started conducting regular inspections to ensure compliance with regulations. The inspections include taking samples of molasses for analysis, controlling stock and storage, and monitoring the performance of juice presses. According to the Estación Experimental Agroindustrial Obispo Colombres (EEAOC), the total available sugar cane in Tucumán is 19.2 million tons, with 18.5 million tons available for processing after deducting 700,000 tons for seed. As of the 44th day of the harvest, 11 sugar mills have started processing, with a total of 937,408 tons of raw cane processed, representing a 41% increase compared to the same date in the previous campaign. The 2025 campaign is showing a 5% advance in relation to the estimated available raw material. In terms of sugar production, 34,274 tons of physical-crust, white, and organic sugar have been produced, while in the 2025 alcohol campaign, 16,458,335 liters have been produced in 28 days of activity. The total sugar crude produced to date represents more than 60% of the total sugar produced. This production of crude sugar in the first weeks of the 2025 harvest will be destined for the fulfillment of export contracts previously agreed upon, with delivery scheduled for July of this year. The report on the export of sugars with raw material from the 2024 harvest is still pending, but the volume of sugar exported from the 2024 harvest, up to the end of April 2025, exceeds 600,000 tons.

**IRA cuts have clean energy advocates concerned about growth of Nevada industry - The Nevada Independent**
Clean energy advocates are concerned about the growth of Nevada's industry due to the IRA cuts proposed in the House Republicans' mega budget bill. The bill would cut two key demand-side credits, phase down investment and production tax credits, and limit companies' ability to source parts or work with companies from countries deemed national security risks. Albert Gore III, president of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said that the early phasedown of the manufacturing 45X tax credit and the complete cut of the 30D consumer tax credit would significantly scale down or prevent projects from moving forward. Harry Godfrey, a managing director at Advanced Energy United, warned that the demand destruction would hamper future growth, including with announced projects. Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) said that the EV industry will continue to grow regardless of the credit, but industry insiders agreed that Nevada-made lithium may not be able to compete without the consumer tax credit.

**US House Republicans Propose Repeal of Electric Vehicle Tax Credit**
The US House of Representatives' Republican majority has proposed a bill to repeal the electric vehicle tax credit (30D) under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) by 2027. The original deadline for the tax credit was December 31, 2032, but the new bill advances it to December 31, 2026. Additionally, if a company sells more than 20,000 electric vehicles in the US between 2009 and 2025, their vehicles will no longer be eligible for the tax credit. The IRA allows taxpayers to claim up to $7,500 in tax credits for electric vehicles assembled in North America with key minerals and battery requirements met. However, to fund Trump's tax cuts, the Republican majority plans to repeal the electric vehicle tax credit and other clean energy initiatives from the previous Biden administration. The bill also proposes to repeal the '45W tax credit' for commercial electric vehicles after December 31, 2025. The '45W tax credit' is an exception that allows commercial electric vehicles to receive tax credits even if they do not meet the origin requirements. This decision is seen as a response to the Korean government and industry's requests, but some Republicans have criticized it as a 'loophole.' The tax credit for used electric vehicle buyers will also be repealed. The advanced manufacturing production tax credit (45X) for Korean battery companies will be phased out by 2031. The original plan was to gradually reduce the tax credit amount and phase it out by 2033, but the Republican bill will maintain it until the end of 2031. Additionally, products from prohibited foreign entities will no longer be eligible for tax credits, which is seen as a measure to prevent Chinese companies from benefiting from the tax credit.

**House GOP unveils bill text for slashing Biden energy tax credits**
The House GOP has unveiled a bill that would terminate and modify clean energy and manufacturing tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was passed by Democrats in 2022. The bill would eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, terminate the Clean Hydrogen Production 45V tax credit, and block wind energy from the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax. The legislation also subjects the Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits to a phase-out period and restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) criticized the bill, saying it would 'jack up prices on American families,' 'kill jobs,' and 'create chaos in the business community.'

**Energy & Sustainability Washington Update -- May 2025**
The Trump administration has made significant changes to federal energy and environmental policy, including a dramatic reduction in the federal workforce, with over 260,000 employees either dismissed, retired, or voluntarily separated. The administration has also taken steps to reshape the federal permitting landscape, including the use of emergency authorities to accelerate approvals and the addition of high-profile mining projects to the national permitting dashboard. Meanwhile, Congress has continued deliberations around potential reconciliation bills to preserve the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax rates that expire this year. Key to this will be the fate of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits, such as the 45E Investment Tax Credit (ITC), the 45Y Production Tax Credit (PTC), 45V Hydrogen Credit and the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit. Despite ideological divisions, bipartisan efforts have emerged to preserve incentives critical to domestic industry and job creation. Staff cuts have also been made at key energy agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and Department of the Interior (DOI). The administration has framed these changes as necessary efficiency measures, although clean energy advocates, industry coalitions, and public sector stakeholders have raised concerns about diminished institutional capacity and potential delays in project execution.

**Sustainability and ESG Advisory Practice Update, April 2025**
The US Congress is considering the budget reconciliation process, with Republican and Democratic members urging House leadership to maintain key federal energy tax credits. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) has been a crucial factor in private sector investments in clean energy and manufacturing projects. The Republican letter notes that maintaining current energy tax credits should be consistent with energy affordability for American families and energy dominance for America. Meanwhile, the Democratic members have urged House Speaker Mike Johnson to retain IRA federal tax credits supporting production of electric vehicles (EV), including credits for EV battery manufacturing and mining and production of critical minerals and components for EV batteries. The U.S. Executive Branch has cut funding for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which may undermine the credibility of the National Climate Assessment. President Donald Trump has signed several executive orders to bolster the American coal industry. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has declared an emergency aimed at increasing timber production on federal land. California's Extended Producer Responsibility Law implementation process has slowed, with Governor Gavin Newsom directing state regulators to restart the process for developing rules needed to implement the law. The European Commission has fined 15 car manufacturers and an industry association nearly €458 million for participating in a cartel regarding the recycling of end-of-life vehicles. The EC has proposed more flexibility on CO2 emission performance standards for car manufacturers. Germany has fined asset manager DWS Group GmbH & Co KgaA €25 million over greenwashing claims. The European Parliament has formally voted to approve the EC's 'Stop the Clock' proposal, which would postpone the application of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive by one year.

**Can the IRA manufacturing tax credit be saved?**
The 45X tax credit, a manufacturing incentive in the Inflation Reduction Act, may be spared by Republicans despite their plans for a tax cut, energy and immigration bill. The credit, which has saved companies billions, is popular among Republicans, with Rep. Bob Latta (R-Ohio) saying, 'Domestic manufacturing is a big priority for us, and it seems that particular credit is helping with that.' A growing number of Republicans are calling on leaders to spare the subsidies, including the leader of the House Conservative Climate Caucus, who specifically called out the 45X credit as one that should be spared.

**The State of Play for Energy Storage Tax Credits**
The energy storage industry has seen significant progress in 2024 and 2025, driven by the federal income tax benefits in the form of tax credits enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The IRA introduced the investment tax credit (ITC) for standalone energy storage facilities and a new 'advanced manufacturing' production tax credit for US production of clean tech equipment and critical minerals. The existing market practice for financing energy storage facilities has evolved in reaction to the act's new requirements and opportunities. The Internal Revenue Service and Treasury have released thousands of pages of guidance under the IRA, providing welcome clarity for sponsors, investors, and other stakeholders. The ITC final guidance confirms that energy storage facilities can be co-located with energy generation facilities, and the prevailing wage and apprenticeship (PWA) guidance provides rigid rules for project owners to comply with. The domestic content guidance establishes stringent rules for determining whether steel, iron, or manufactured products are produced in the United States. The ability to transfer IRA tax credits has changed the financing opportunities and structures for sponsors and investors, with tax equity remaining alive in a modified form, often referred to as a 'hybrid' structure/partnership.

**45X tax credit transfers strengthen US solar manufacturing**
The Inflation Reduction Act's 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit has helped domestic solar manufacturers build their stateside operations by maximizing manufacturing credits. Companies like Heliene and SolarEdge have sold their 45X credits to other entities, generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue. The credits are sold at a discount on the dollar to make it worthwhile for buyers, while giving sellers more liquidity in the short-term. The 45X credit has also helped companies like Schneider Electric bolster U.S. renewable energy manufacturing. While the fate of the 45X manufacturing credit is uncertain due to the new Trump presidency, tax transfer contracts have change-in-law clauses that allow parties to unwind transactions. Basis Climate's Erik Underwood believes buyers should feel comfortable purchasing tax credits this year and even begin to make plans for 2026.

**Maximize Your Section 45X Tax Credit Ahead of Tax Season**
The section 45X tax credit, introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, aims to incentivize domestic clean energy manufacturing by rewarding manufacturers for producing qualifying advanced energy components. The credit is calculated based on specific metrics, such as production volume, electrical capacity, or cost, and is fully transferable, allowing manufacturers to sell unused credits for immediate cash benefits. The program offers full credit benefits through 2029, with a phased reduction beginning in 2030. To claim the credit, manufacturers must meet the IRS's definition of 'substantial transformation,' which requires significant processing of raw materials or components to become a new and distinct product. The credit is also subject to eligibility and domestic manufacturing requirements, including the sale of manufactured products to unrelated third-parties. The IRS has emphasized rigorous oversight of tax credits like section 45X to prevent misuse, and manufacturers should carefully evaluate their processes and maintain meticulous documentation to validate their eligibility.

**Trump's Executive Order on Electric Vehicles Raises Concerns in Korea**
US President Donald Trump's executive order to abolish the electric vehicle mandate has raised concerns in the Korean electric vehicle and battery industry. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) may reduce or eliminate the tax credit for environmentally friendly cars, but some experts predict that the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (AMPC) will be maintained due to its positive impact on US investment and production. The IRA has been criticized by some Republican lawmakers, who argue that abolishing it would harm their constituents. A recent analysis by CNN found that 78% of IRA-related investments were made in Republican lawmakers' districts. The administration's limitations on executive orders have also been cited as a reason to be cautious about abolishing the IRA. The IRA's funding for electric vehicle sales and manufacturing is included in a law that cannot be repealed by the president alone. A tax advisor, Robert Mozolowski, said that the administration can temporarily suspend the payment of the tax credit, but this could lead to legal problems. Some experts predict that the Republican Party will use the budget adjustment procedure to modify the IRA. This procedure allows a simple majority of 51 votes to pass a law, bypassing the filibuster. The US is facing a challenge in the global electric vehicle market, where China and Europe are leading the way. If the US continues to hinder the adoption of electric vehicles, its domestic companies may lose their global competitiveness. China has already reached a 50% market share of new energy vehicles, and BYD is expected to become the 7th largest automaker in the world. In contrast, US automakers such as General Motors and Ford are losing their market share globally. Industry experts say that Trump's top priority is to boost US manufacturing and prevent China's advanced industry from growing, and that AMPC is a means to achieve this goal. Another expert said that it is better to prepare for various scenarios and cooperate with the government to find a solution rather than overreacting to the concerns.
