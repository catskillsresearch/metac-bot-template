**Mortgage Rate Predictions for the Week of May 26- June 1, 2025**
Mortgage rates are expected to remain above 6.5% for the foreseeable future due to uncertainty over President Trump's economic policies. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has climbed as high as 7.08%, according to Mortgage News Daily, and is closely tied to the 10-year Treasury yield. Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, notes that Treasury yields have been rising due to increasing headwinds in the economy, rising federal government debt levels, and the recent downgrading of the US's credit rating by Moody's. Sturtevant predicts that mortgage rates will likely remain near 7% or slightly higher in the near term. 'Growing uncertainty is going to make this a slower-than-typical spring housing market,' said Sturtevant. 'When people are anxious, they are less likely to make big decisions, like buying and selling a home.' Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage, agrees that financial markets hate uncertainty and that the potential for sub-6% mortgage rates in 2025 is slim. Experts caution that higher inflation due to Trump's tariffs could derail the Federal Reserve's anticipated rate cuts.

**Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, May 26, 2025: Slight changes as bond market on holiday**
According to Zillow data, the current mortgage interest rates for Memorial Day 2025 are lower. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell by three basis points to 6.89%, while the 15-year fixed interest rate crept higher by one basis point to 6.11%. With the bond market closed over the holiday weekend, rates are fluctuating slightly only in response to retail mortgage rate demand. It will be interesting to see how the bond market reacts to last week's volatility when it reopens this week. Laura Grace Tarpley, Lead Editor and Content Strategist at Mortgages, advises that mortgage refinance rates tend to be a little higher than purchase rates. She also suggests using the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment.

**US Mortgage Rates Reach Record High**
The average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage in the US reached a record high of 6.92% last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). This is the highest rate since February. Mortgage applications decreased by 5.1% compared to the previous week, with both purchase and refinance applications down 5%. The MBA's Senior Vice President, Mike Fratantoni, stated, 'There was a slowdown in the sector.' He attributed the high mortgage rates to investors' concerns about rising inflation, high deficits, and increased debt. Despite this, Fratantoni noted that purchase applications have increased by 13% on a yearly basis.

**Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, May 25, 2025: Rates remain volatile in light of mixed economic news**
Mortgage rates are mixed today, with the average 30-year fixed interest rate down three basis points to 6.91% and the 15-year fixed rate up seven basis points to 6.10%, according to Zillow. Experts advise focusing on personal finances, such as saving more, improving credit scores, or paying down debt, to get the lowest mortgage rate. When choosing a lender, consider the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR), which factors in interest rate, discount points, and fees. The national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.91%, but rates can vary by location, with averages typically higher in expensive areas and lower in less expensive ones.

**Today's mortgage interest rates fall for 30-year terms while 15-year terms remain unchanged | August 14, 2024**
Today's mortgage interest rates have fallen for 30-year terms, while 15-year terms remain unchanged. The median interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.375%, a 0.115 percentage point decrease from yesterday. The median interest rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is 5.625%, unchanged from yesterday. Factors that determine mortgage rates include credit score, debt-to-income ratio, down payment, and loan term. It's essential to compare lenders and loan offers to get the best rate. A mortgage calculator can help determine monthly payment amounts and total costs of the loan. Pros of mortgages include predictable monthly payments, potentially low interest rates, and tax benefits. However, there are also downsides, such as expensive fees and interest, long-term debt, and potential rate changes. To qualify for a mortgage, one must have steady employment and income, review assets, know their debt-to-income ratio, and have a good credit score. Refinancing a mortgage can be done to lower interest rates, change rate types, or remove private mortgage insurance (PMI).

**US Mortgage Rates Show Significant Increase in May**
According to Freddie Mac's report, the 30-year mortgage rate in the US increased to 6.86% in May. This is due in part to economic adjustments affecting the housing market, as stated by Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate rose to 6.01% from 5.92% the previous week, reaching high levels since February. Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), noted that 'sales of homes have been at 75% of pre-pandemic normal activity for the past three years.' Yun also stated that 'at a macro level, we are still in a moderate seller's market, but with the highest inventory levels in nearly five years, consumers are in a better position to negotiate better offers.' The mortgage rates have continued to rise, reaching 7% last week after Moody's Ratings announced credit rating downgrades, and are expected to continue increasing due to the 10-year Treasury bond yields, which are sensitive to the country's economic conditions amidst uncertainty over Donald Trump's trade policies.

**Fix home affordability? 39% price cuts, 2.4% mortgages, or 62% pay hikes**
According to the March homebuying report from Attom, the typical U.S. homebuyer's mortgage check has increased by 109% over the last six years, while American incomes have only risen by 29%. To close the nation's affordability gap, a 39% price cut, a 2.4% mortgage rate, or a 62% pay hike would be needed. Alternatively, a combination of these measures could be implemented. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation has been ongoing for three years, resulting in a 22% decline in home sales since 2019-22. The median selling price for March was $362,000, just 1% short of the record set in June 2024. Mortgage rates have soared to 6.7%, creating a 47% boost to a buyer's estimated house payments. As one expert noted, 'The price is wrong' when considering the nation's affordability gap.

**US Interest Rates: Waiting for the Big Turn**
The US Federal Reserve (Fed) has kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged for the third consecutive time, maintaining a target range of 4.25% to 4.50%. However, the markets are speculating about the next interest rate move, which could happen sooner than expected. The Fed is cautious due to uncertainties surrounding trade tariffs and their economic consequences. Despite this, the bond market is sending mixed signals, with 10-year US Treasury yields rising to 4.44% and 30-year bond yields reaching 4.87%. This suggests that investors believe in a longer period of high interest rates or less aggressive rate cuts. As a result, mortgage rates are increasing, with the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage rising to 6.85% and 15-year mortgage rates reaching 6.05%. Fed Governor Michael Barr warns about the inflationary effects of trade tariffs, and the next interest rate decision on June 18 will be crucial in determining the Fed's stance on this issue.

**What's happening with mortgage rates?**
The U.S. average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate remained at 6.75% for a second week, according to Freddie Mac. This is a slight improvement from last year, when rates were 30 basis points higher and purchase applications were declining. Despite this, mortgage rates have not dropped significantly, and the current benchmark interest rate remains in place. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the Fed will 'wait and see how things evolve' due to uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of President Trump's tariff policy. Economists Kara Ng and Chen Zhao suggest that mortgage rates may not be headed up, but also won't be dropping any time soon. Ng notes that affordability has marginally improved for buyers, while Zhao forecasts that there will likely be fewer 2025 rate cuts than expected, and mortgage rates should stay largely unchanged.

**Mortgage and refinance rates for Mar. 25, 2025: Average rates steady as peak spring homebuying season heats up**
The current average mortgage rates in the US are steady, with the 30-year fixed purchase rate holding at under 6.70%. Despite the peak spring homebuying season, it may not be worth holding out for more affordable borrowing costs. Instead, focus on shopping for the lowest mortgage rates you can qualify for across a range of loan types. The current average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.68% for purchase and 6.61% for refinance. Mortgage rates are determined by many factors, including inflation rates, economic conditions, and the Federal Reserve's target interest rate. Lenders also consider your personal credit score, the amount available for your down payment, and other terms of the loan. It's best to lock in a mortgage rate when you're comfortable with the overall conditions of your mortgage or home loan.

**This Week's Mortgage Rate Predictions, March 10-16, 2025**
Mortgage rates are expected to remain above 6.5% for most of 2025, according to Fannie Mae. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped from around 6.9% to around 6.6% over the last month, but a shaky economy and uncertainty regarding tariffs, trade, and government spending may keep rates stuck in the limbo. Colin Robertson, a mortgage industry expert, said that 'with uncertainty regarding tariffs, trade, and government spending, mortgage rates might be stuck in limbo.' Experts recommend building a strong credit score, saving for a bigger down payment, shopping for mortgage lenders, and considering mortgage points to negotiate a better rate. 'This is not a rosy picture,' said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's Analytics. 'When lower mortgage rates are based on an expectation of slower economic growth, that's far from a desirable economic environment,' Colyar added. The Federal Reserve's interest rate adjustments will influence the mortgage market, and experts anticipate that the Fed could resume cutting interest rates in May or June when it's clear if there is an increased risk of a job-loss recession.

**Mortgage and refinance rates today, February 25, 2025: The 30-year rate is finally under 6.5%**
Mortgage rates have dropped across the board, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.44% for the first time since mid-December. According to Zillow, this is a good time to buy a house, as interest rates are down and you can avoid the peak home-buying season in March and April. The current mortgage rates are: 30-year fixed rate: 6.44%, 15-year fixed rate: lower than 30-year fixed rate, and adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) rates have been starting higher than fixed rates recently. Mortgage rates have been trending downward since early August 2024, but the trajectory of future mortgage rates will largely depend on the Federal Reserve's decision on whether or not to cut the federal funds rate at its 2025 meetings. As a rule of thumb, 15-year mortgage rates are lower than 30-year mortgage rates, and making extra mortgage payments on a 30-year loan can help pay off the mortgage faster and ultimately pay less interest.

**Mortgage Rates Expected to Remain High in 2025**
According to Zillow, the average national mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.50%, while the average rate for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is 5.83%. Economists do not expect mortgage rates to improve significantly in 2025. The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) predicted in its February forecast that the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage would be at 6.50% by the end of the year. Fannie Mae also predicted a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of 6.60% for the fourth quarter of 2025. Therefore, if you're ready to buy now, you shouldn't wait for lower rates. 'It's unlikely that mortgage rates will drop significantly in the near future,' said a spokesperson. 'However, they may decrease slightly.' It's essential to focus on your personal finances to get the best mortgage rate. 'Saving more, improving your credit score, or paying off debt before starting to look for homes can help you get a lower mortgage rate,' said a financial expert. 'Don't wait for rates to drop; instead, work on your finances to get the best deal.'

**Average US rate on a 30-year mortgage eases to 6.87%, fourth...**
The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the US has fallen to 6.87%, its lowest level since December 26, for the fourth consecutive week. This is a positive sign for potential homebuyers as the spring homebuying season begins. However, borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages have increased to 6.09%. Mortgage rates are influenced by the bond market's reaction to the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions. Rising home prices and elevated mortgage rates have kept many prospective home shoppers on the sidelines, particularly first-time buyers. Sales of previously occupied US homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years, extending a national home sales slump that began in 2022. The latest pullback in rates echoes a decline in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans. The 10-year yield was at 4.54% in midday trading on Thursday, down from 4.79% just a few weeks ago. According to Freddie Mac, a year ago, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage was 6.77%.

**Mortgage and refinance rates for Feb. 13, 2025: Average rates steady as market reacts to new inflation data**
Mortgage rates in the US are relatively steady as of February 13, 2025, with the current average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage at 6.94% for purchase and 6.94% for refinance. This is a decrease of 2 basis points from last Thursday's average rate. The Federal Reserve's target interest rate has been left unchanged at 4.25% to 4.50%, and economists expect it to remain the same at the next policy meeting on March 18-19, 2025. The consumer price index showed a monthly increase of 0.5% in the prices average Americans pay for goods and services, up from 0.4% in December, with high food, fuel, and shelter costs driving the annual inflation rate to 3%, the highest rate since June 2024. 'We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,' said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in testimony before the Senate banking committee on February 11, 2025. 'The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid.'

**Mortgage and refinance rates today, February 1, 2025: The 30-year rate decreases for a full week**
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has decreased for a full week, with the current average rate being 6.55% according to Zillow. This is a good time to lock in an interest rate, as the rate could increase due to potential tariffs imposed by the US government. The main advantages of a 30-year fixed mortgage include lower monthly payments and predictable payments. However, the main disadvantage is higher mortgage interest, both in the short and long term. Adjustable-rate mortgages offer lower introductory rates, but the rate can increase after the intro-rate period ends, making monthly payments unpredictable. It's recommended to try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio to secure a low mortgage refinance rate.
