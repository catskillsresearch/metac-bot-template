**ANSES Confirms AUH Amount for Families with One Child in June 2025**
The ANSES has confirmed the total amount of the Asignación Universal por Hijo (AUH) for families with one child in June 2025. The AUH will increase by 2.8% next month, corresponding to the inflation rate of April, as per the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censo (INDEC). The total value of the AUH will be $109,519 per child, but beneficiaries will only receive 80% of this amount ($87,615.20), with the remaining 20% retained by ANSES and deducted in a single payment upon presentation of the Libreta AUH.

**Social Benefits Recipient Refuses Job Offers Without Consequences**
Oliver, a recipient of social benefits, has been refusing job offers for decades without facing any consequences. He claims that he cannot work due to his mental health, but instead of looking for a job, he relies on social services and government benefits. Oliver has never had a full-time job and has been living off social welfare for years. He has even been known to visit a local church for food, saying 'The church has already given enough, now it's my turn to get some noodles!' Oliver's apartment is decorated with second-hand items from China to avoid paying VAT. He believes that working has never been worth it for him, as he would not earn enough and the real profits would go to others. Despite this, Oliver wants more social benefits and supports the idea of a universal basic income. He is not alone, as another man, Olaf, has also been unemployed for 20 years.

**Man and Superman: Human History Bifurcates | Sramana Mitra**
Sramana Mitra predicts that human history will bifurcate into two distinct classes: the wealthy, powerful, and highly educated, and the useless zombie class. This is due to the automation of 60-80% of all jobs in the next 30-50 years, with technology and automation creating tremendous disruption. Mitra cites examples such as FoxConn's elimination of 60,000 jobs, replaced by robots, and the shift to online advertising, which is now 100% automated. He also mentions the potential for self-driving cars to eliminate entire professions like truck drivers and taxi drivers. Mitra warns that in a post-work world, people will have to find alternative means of creating structure and identity, and that society will be at risk of becoming uninspiring and mediocre. He also discusses the potential for a Universal Basic Income, but notes that it would be expensive to implement and may lead to a Communist-like society. Mitra concludes that Capitalism will come under tremendous duress if not an existential threat, and that we will go back to a fortune at the tip of the pyramid society, with a few thousand people controlling all the wealth in the world.

Additionally, a one-time bonus of up to $70,000 will be paid in June to those receiving contributory pensions, as well as to beneficiaries of the PUAM and non-contributory pensions. The bonus will be paid in full to those receiving a pension equal to or less than the minimum guaranteed pension. For those receiving a higher pension, a supplementary amount will be granted to reach the minimum guaranteed pension level. The ANSES also updated the income limits for accessing family allowances, with a new monthly income limit of $2,244,686. If one of the family members exceeds this limit, the family will be automatically excluded, even if the total family income does not exceed the maximum limit.

**Fortaleza Mayor Evandro Leitão Meets with Eduardo Suplicy to Discuss Universal Basic Income**
Fortaleza Mayor Evandro Leitão met with Eduardo Suplicy, a former senator and state deputy, to discuss topics such as universal basic income and progressive agendas. Suplicy presented Leitão with two books, 'Um jeito de fazer política' and 'Renda Básica: Uma proposta radical para uma Sociedade Livre e Economia Sã', and expressed his enthusiasm for the receptivity in Fortaleza to the idea of universal basic income. 'I am very happy to visit Fortaleza and the Ceará and see that there is a great receptivity here for the concepts of universal basic income. It was very positive to talk to Mayor Evandro Leitão,' Suplicy said. Suplicy explained that universal basic income is a regular and unconditional payment made to all citizens of a community, regardless of their income or employment status, to guarantee a minimum level of financial security and provide freedom to pursue education, work, or other activities. 'I am very open to implementing this purpose and I want to help you in this direction,' Suplicy said to Leitão.

**Universal Basic Income: A Powerful Tool for Development?**
The concept of a universal basic income (UBI) has been discussed by governments worldwide for years. A study in Germany, where 122 people received 1,365 dollars per month for three years, found that people did not avoid work and continued to work full-time. However, many participants felt comfortable changing jobs. They also expressed higher satisfaction with their jobs and spent more time on education. Similar results were found in a study in Kenya, where participants received payments for two to 12 years. While there was no significant decrease in labor supply, many participants left their jobs to start their own businesses or become freelancers. Some participants even pooled their resources and shared the income. Dr. Kelle Howson, a senior researcher at the Economic Justice Institute in South Africa, says that the results are not surprising. 'People will always fail to achieve their goals based on income inequality,' she says. 'We don't need more pilot programs to show that UBI does not pull people out of the labor market. Instead, it allows people to start their own initiatives and stimulate local economies.' However, some experts, such as Professor Pranab Bardhan from the University of California, Berkeley, argue that targeted support, rather than universal support, is more effective. They also point out that UBI can be expensive and may not be feasible in all countries. Dr. Howson argues that UBI is a powerful tool for development, regardless of the context. She also points out that UBI has several potential benefits, including improved mental and physical health, increased education, and increased autonomy for women. However, some experts, such as Professor Eva Vivault from the University of Toronto, argue that UBI may not be effective in high-income countries and may even lead to a 'dependency syndrome.' They also point out that UBI may not be feasible in countries with limited tax bases. Professor Flora Gill from the University of Sydney argues that UBI is not a solution to poverty and that people should be able to work if they want to. She also points out that UBI may require significant tax increases to finance. Dr. Howson argues that UBI is not a one-time payment, but a continuous investment in people's lives. She also points out that UBI can be financed through various means, including taxes, social security contributions, and even private donations.

**Universal Basic Income Does Not Lead to Reduced Work Hours, Study Finds**
A German study published on Wednesday found that people who received a universal basic income (UBI) of €1,200 per month for three years did not work less hours and reported better mental health. The study, conducted by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), involved 107 participants who received the UBI without any conditions, and 1,580 participants who did not. The results showed that the UBI recipients were more satisfied with their lives, felt more in control, and spent more time on social activities. According to the study's author, psychologist Susann Fiedler, 'The participants acted differently not because their personalities changed, but because their possibilities changed.' The study's findings are similar to a 2017-2018 study in Finland, which also found positive effects on well-being.

**Universal Basic Income Recipients Do Not Work Less, Study Finds**
A German study published on Wednesday found that people who received a universal basic income (UBI) of 1,200 euros per month for three years did not work less hours and reported better mental health. The study, which is the largest on UBI in Germany, involved 107 people who received the payments without any obligation to work, and 1,580 people who did not receive the payments. The study found that the recipients felt more satisfied with their lives and had a greater sense of control over them. They also spent more time on social activities, dedicating an average of four hours more per week than those who did not receive the payments. According to the researchers, this could be related to the extra money in their pockets. 'Social activities are often accompanied by expenses, whether it's going to restaurants, buying movie tickets or joint leisure activities,' they noted. The improvements were sustained throughout the study, but the recipients did not show changes in their political convictions or psychological traits such as risk-taking. 'The participants in the study acted differently not because their personality changed, but because their possibilities changed,' said one of the authors, psychologist Susann Fiedler of the Vienna University of Economics. The UBI, which has been debated for years in various countries, has been taken more seriously as a political proposal in recent years due to the fear of massive unemployment caused by the rise of artificial intelligence. A similar study in Finland in 2017 and 2018 also found positive effects on well-being.

**Universal basic income does not stop people working: study**
A German study published by the German Institute for Economic Research found that people paid a universal basic income (UBI) of 1,200 euros a month for three years did not work fewer hours and reported better mental health than a control group. The study, which involved 107 participants receiving the UBI and 1,580 in a control group, found that the UBI recipients also reported higher life satisfaction and a greater feeling of control over their lives. Participants receiving the UBI spent about four hours more on social activities a week on average and saved about a third of their monthly income, with those getting the money saving twice as much on average as the control group. As one of the study's authors, psychologist Susann Fiedler from the Vienna University of Economics and Business, said, 'Study participants acted differently not because their core personalities changed, but because their possibilities changed.'

**What is Universal Basic Income (UBI)?**
The Universal Basic Income (UBI) is an economic policy model that provides a regular amount of cash to all members of a society, regardless of their current income, social status, work status, or need level. The system is applied equally to everyone, without any conditions or requirements. Let's examine this policy in detail. The four main principles of UBI are: Universality Conditionality Regularity Cash payment The historical development of UBI The concept of UBI has its roots in the Enlightenment era. In the 18th century, Thomas Paine argued that landowners should pay a kind of rent to the community in exchange for the use of natural resources, and that this rent should be distributed to citizens. The potential benefits of UBI Proponents of UBI argue that it has several potential benefits: Reducing poverty Economic security Freedom in the labor market Recognizing unpaid work Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation Improving health and education outcomes Reducing bureaucracy The potential economic effects of UBI There are various theories and opinions about the macroeconomic effects of UBI implementation: Consumption and economic activity Labor market dynamics Some critics worry that people will stop working. Proponents argue that UBI gives people the power to demand better working conditions, not the luxury of not working. Studies have shown that there is usually no significant decline in labor force participation. The 'Mincome' experiment in Manitoba, Canada, found that only new mothers and young people in education showed a decrease in working hours. Wages and working conditions Inflation UBI's financing methods UBI's biggest challenge is its cost. Various financing models have been proposed: Tax reform Wealth tax: French economist Thomas Piketty has proposed a progressive wealth tax to combat increasing wealth inequality. Carbon tax: Applying a tax on polluting activities can both achieve environmental goals and generate revenue for UBI. Financial transaction tax: Applying a small tax on stock, bond, and derivative transactions can generate significant revenue. Consolidating existing programs Monetary policy Natural resource revenue Technological tax Around the world, UBI experiments and applications UBI concept has been tested in various scales and experiments around the world: Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (USA) Finland's UBI experiment (2017-2018) GiveDirectly Kenya project (2016-present) Ontario, Canada pilot project (2017-2019) Madhya Pradesh Experiment (India, 2011-2012) Stockton, California experiment (2019-2021) Criticisms and challenges of UBI The UBI concept has been criticized from various angles: Medyascope's daily e-bulletin Andaç Andaç every day First name Last name Email address KVK 01 information on commercial electronic message sending KVK 02 information on the processing of personal data in accordance with the Law No. 6698 on the Protection of Personal Data, Scope Medya Ticaret Pazarlama A.Ş.

Sign up now Cost and financial sustainability Inflationist pressures Decline in work incentives Migration and suitability criteria Replacement of existing social services Political sustainability Future perspectives and alternative models The UBI debate has led to the development of various alternative and complementary models for a more equitable distribution of income: Negative income tax Participation income Targeted basic income Asset-based policies Public employment guarantee Conclusion UBI is seen as an innovative way to ensure economic security in a world where traditional social safety nets are insufficient, technological change is transforming labor markets, and income inequality is deepening. While experiments around the world have shown promising results, the large-scale implementation of UBI is still facing significant financial, political, and practical challenges. The potential effects of UBI will depend on the economic structure of a particular society, its existing social security systems, and the chosen financing mechanisms. In the future, a full UBI may be replaced by hybrid models or more targeted approaches. However, the UBI debate has been a catalyst for rethinking social policies and designing more inclusive and fair economic systems.

**Universal basic income fails another test**
A two-year universal basic income (UBI) pilot program in Compton, California, found that while recipients' average non-housing debt balances declined by $2,190 over 18 months, the drop was not statistically significant. However, the study revealed that part-time workers reduced their labor market participation by 13 percentage points and income by $333 per month on average. The findings suggest that UBI enabled recipients to work less and did not promote entrepreneurship or education. The author argues that UBI is a bad idea as it promotes dependency and undermines the dignity of work, which should be the goal of a government safety net.

**A UBI pilot could be about to help hundreds of homeless people in Greater Manchester**
A Universal Basic Income (UBI) pilot is being proposed for Greater Manchester, which could help up to 200 young homeless people or those at risk of homelessness. The pilot would provide £1,600 a month for two years, with no conditions or strings attached. Sam Gregory, a UBI activist, believes this could be a game-changer for addressing absolute poverty and homelessness in the region. He emphasizes that UBI is not just a long-term solution, but could also provide immediate benefits for those in need. The pilot would be funded through progressive taxation, with higher taxes on the rich and corporations. Gregory sees UBI as a way to redistribute wealth and provide a 'safety floor' for those living in poverty. He also believes it could help to counteract the stigma attached to receiving benefits and provide people with the time and headspace to engage in civic and cultural life. The pilot would be a key step towards implementing a UBI nationwide, which could provide a 'parachute' to prevent people from falling into poverty. Gregory emphasizes that UBI is not a replacement for the welfare system, but rather a complement to it, providing a more effective and fair way to address poverty and inequality.

**Giving people money fails another test**
A two-year universal basic income (UBI) pilot program in Compton, California, showed mixed results. While non-housing debt declined by $2,190 over 18 months, part-time workers reduced their labor market participation by 13 percentage points and income by $333 per month on average. The study found that UBI did not enable recipients to educate themselves or start businesses, but rather increased time spent on leisure activities. The author argues that UBI has a fundamental problem: it promotes dependency and does not provide incentives for self-sufficiency, which is a key component of a government safety net.

**A four-day week? Soon, thanks to AI, we may not work at all**
As AI advances, the world of work is in a state of flux. Some companies, like JP Morgan and Amazon, are ordering staff back into the office five days a week, while others, like Citigroup, are allowing remote work. Meanwhile, Labour MPs are pushing for a four-day week to become law, and the universal basic income (UBI) movement is gaining traction. UBI, which involves a no-strings-attached payment made regularly to everyone in society, is being considered as a possible solution to the advance of AI. Proponents argue it could serve as an antidote to technology's onslaught and improve people's lives. However, there are concerns about the value of UBI and who will pay for it. As governments and employers struggle to find a solution, the future of employment remains uncertain, with some predicting widespread unemployment and others arguing that a four-day week will not be enough to safeguard against it.

**Man and Superman: Human History Bifurcates | Sramana Mitra**
Sramana Mitra predicts that human history will bifurcate into two distinct classes: the wealthy, powerful, and highly educated, and the useless zombie class. This is due to the automation of 60-80% of all jobs in the next 30-50 years, with technology and automation creating tremendous disruption. Mitra cites examples such as FoxConn's elimination of 60,000 jobs, replaced by robots, and the shift to online advertising, which is now 100% automated. He also mentions the potential for self-driving cars to eliminate entire professions like truck drivers and taxi drivers. Mitra warns that in a post-work world, people will have to find alternative means of creating structure and identity, and that society will be at risk of becoming uninspiring and mediocre. He also discusses the potential for a Universal Basic Income, but notes that it would be expensive to implement and may lead to a Communist-like society. Mitra concludes that Capitalism will come under tremendous duress if not an existential threat, and that we will go back to a fortune at the tip of the pyramid society, with a few thousand people controlling all the wealth in the world.
