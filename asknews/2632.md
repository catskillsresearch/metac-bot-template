**How Abuja's broken urban plan is failing its residents**
Abuja, Nigeria's capital city, is struggling with rapid, unregulated growth, leading to diminishing green spaces, increasing environmental hazards, and a decline in livability. The city's original master plan, designed to be a clean, healthy, and organized city, is fading. Residents are facing unbearable heat, flash floods, and a daily battle against extreme weather, poor ventilation, and overcrowded neighborhoods. Experts say the city's green area is now far less than 33%, and the population is growing fast, from 3.4 million in 2024 to over 4.2 million in 2025. The government, landlords, and developers are being blamed for the weak enforcement of Abuja's master plan, with many buildings being constructed without proper approvals. The situation reflects a global crisis in urban planning, with cities heating up at twice the global average rate due to rapid urbanization and the urban heat island effect.

**From golden to gilded age: Nigeria's economic discontent and solutions (2)**
Nigeria's economic growth has led to a widening wealth gap, with billionaires amassing fortunes at the expense of over 20 million citizens falling into poverty. The country's education system has deteriorated, with a lack of social mobility and high-paying jobs going to those with high-quality degrees. To address this, Nigeria should consider investing in infrastructure, capital formation, and self-sufficiency in producing essential goods. Additionally, the government must ensure the independence of key public institutions, including the central bank, national electoral commission, and judiciary. This will enable the country to combat inflation, maintain economic stability, and ensure transparency in the electoral process.

**Algeria Leads Africa in LNG Production, but Exports Decline**
Africa is strengthening its position in the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, with several countries accelerating their investments in export projects. Algeria stands out as one of the continent's major producers, according to a recent report. The country has a liquefaction capacity of 25.3 million tons per year, thanks to four major facilities managed by Sonatrach in Skikda and Arzew. However, Algeria's LNG exports have slightly decreased in 2024, from 9.93 million tons in the first quarter of 2023 to 8.88 million tons in the same period in 2025, due to operational constraints. Nigeria ranks second with a capacity of 22.2 million tons per year, spread across six units of the Nigeria LNG (NLNG) complex on Bonny Island. Egypt comes in third with 12.2 million tons, produced mainly by the Damiette and Idku plants. However, the country had to import 4 million tons between June 2024 and April 2025 due to a decline in local production, its first in nine years. According to energy research unit projections, Africa could account for 19% of global LNG capacities by 2050, with an estimated production of 1.004 billion tons per year. This growth will be driven by new projects in Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, and Mauritania, including the Tortue Ahmeyim field, which entered production in early 2025 and added 2.3 million tons to the continent's capacity.

**Achieving a brighter future for Nigerian children - Businessday NG**
The 2025 Children's Day theme in Nigeria emphasizes the importance of creating a safe and secure environment for children to grow and develop. However, the country faces significant challenges, including over 18 million out-of-school children, hunger, and malnutrition. Labour Party Presidential candidate Peter Obi noted that 'A Nigerian child who survives at birth is faced with hunger and malnutrition. Our nation today is home to over 18 million out-of-school children, among the highest in the world.' President Bola Tinubu has pledged to prioritize child protection under the Renewed Hope Agenda, but critics argue that the root causes of violence against children, such as poverty and hunger, must be addressed. The government has initiated a comprehensive review of the Child Rights Act and the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act, and has also introduced the National Policy on Safety, Security, and Violence-Free Schools. However, urgent steps must be taken to reduce the scourge of poverty, which affects over 11 million children in Nigeria, with one in four under the age of five stunted due to malnutrition. 'Each out-of-school child represents a dream deferred, a future endangered, and a country that is failing to uphold its most sacred responsibility,' said Peter Obi.

**Indonesia has more people than Russia, Canada, Australia & Germany put together**
According to the UN projections for 2100, Indonesia's population will surpass that of Russia, Canada, Australia, and Germany combined. In fact, Indonesia's population is almost exactly equal to the combined population of these four countries. Additionally, African countries such as Congo, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Egypt are expected to join Nigeria in the top 10 countries by population, forming more than 10% of the global population. Meanwhile, China, Russia, and Japan are expected to experience significant demographic decline, with China losing nearly half its population by the end of the century. As the author notes, 'a lot of demographic dividend is yet to be realized' in countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nigeria, which are ranked lowly in terms of GDP.

**Catalonia's Future: Preparing for a Population of 10 Million**
The Catalan government believes that the region will reach 10 million inhabitants in the near future and is preparing for the challenges that come with it. The current population of 8 million is expected to grow due to immigration, with the government projecting that the population will reach 10 million by 2052. However, some experts argue that this growth is not sustainable and that the region's infrastructure and services are not equipped to handle it. The government is planning to update the 1995 Plan Territorial General de Catalunya to address the needs of the growing population, including housing, transportation, and education. The plan aims to ensure that the region's resources are used efficiently and that the population has access to the services they need. Some experts, such as sociologist Mariña Couceiro, argue that immigration has been the driving force behind Catalonia's economic growth and that it is essential for the region's prosperity. Others, like Jaume Grau of Ecologistas en Acción, are concerned about the environmental impact of the growing population and the need for sustainable development. The government is aware of the challenges ahead and is working to address them, but the debate is ongoing and there are differing opinions on how to manage the region's growth.

**Japa: Nigeria ranks 2nd among foreigners who migrated to the UK in 2024 [See Top 5]**
According to the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS), Nigeria has emerged as the second-highest source of long-term migrants to the UK in 2024, with 120,000 individuals. The top 5 non-EU+ countries of origin are India (240,000), Nigeria (120,000), Pakistan (101,000), China (78,000), and Zimbabwe (36,000). The profile of non-EU+ migrants shows a relatively balanced gender distribution, with 52% male and 48% female, and 82% of migrants are of working age. The largest share of non-EU+ nationals, 417,000 people, migrated to the UK for work-related reasons, followed by study-related immigration, which brought in another 375,000 individuals. As stated by the ONS, these patterns reflect the UK's demand for foreign labour and its appeal as a global education hub.

**Nigeria's Growing Population Needs Industrial Solution -- Tinubu**
President Bola Tinubu has stated that Nigeria's growing population needs industrial solutions to transform it into 'demographic dividends'. He emphasized that the country cannot rely on raw produce and unprocessed minerals, but needs factories, clusters, and industrial parks to add value and drive innovation. Tinubu noted that with a projected population of 440 million by 2050, the increase could become a demographic disaster if not harnessed. He called for visionaries and entrepreneurs like Aliko Dangote and Tony Elumelu to drive industrial growth and turn the anticipated population bulge into demographic dividends. The President also highlighted the opportunities for outsourcing and industrialization, citing India's success in generating $120 billion from outsourcing last year. He emphasized the need for unity and collaboration among Nigerians to achieve shared prosperity and transform the country's young population into engines of growth.

**Japa: Nigerian Naturalizations Show Significant Growth In US Citizenship Data » News.ng**
According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, over 34,000 Nigerian nationals gained American citizenship through naturalisation between 2020 and 2022. This represents a significant growth in Nigerian naturalisations, with 8,930 Nigerians granted citizenship in 2020, 10,113 in 2021, and 15,000 in 2022. Nigeria was the predominant African nation in naturalisation statistics, representing three percent of the 248,553 African-born individuals who obtained U.S. citizenship during this period. The report highlights that Africa demonstrated the most substantial regional growth in naturalisations, registering a 40 percent increase between 2021 and 2022. Mexico maintained its leadership position with 326,237 citizens naturalised across the three years, followed by India and the Philippines. The naturalisation process grants full citizenship privileges to foreign-born individuals who meet the criteria established by the Immigration and Nationality Act, including voting privileges and eligibility for federal assistance programs. USCIS officials acknowledge that approval rates vary due to processing timelines and eligibility requirements, with some petitions facing denial due to applicant ineligibility or incomplete documentation. 'On average, African immigrants spent six years in permanent-resident status before naturalizing—one year less than the global median,' the report added.

**Feeding Nigeria's growing population: Sustainable solutions for food security and economic development - Businessday NG**
Nigeria is at a critical juncture with a population projected to surpass 400 million by 2050. The country faces a food security crisis, with millions of Nigerians facing rising food prices, supply chain disruptions, and climate change. However, the agricultural sector has the potential to drive economic growth, job creation, and global competitiveness. To achieve this, Nigeria needs to adopt sustainable solutions such as innovative farming techniques, regenerative agriculture, and value chain optimisation. The sector is dominated by smallholder farmers, who produce 90% of Nigeria's agricultural output, but face challenges such as limited mechanisation and inadequate investment. The country's agricultural trade deficit has widened, and investment in research and development is insufficient. To address these challenges, Nigeria needs to increase investment in mechanisation, research, and policy reforms, and strengthen local production to reduce import dependency. This will require strategic interventions from all stakeholders, including government, private sector, and farmers, to build a resilient and self-sufficient agricultural sector capable of feeding Nigeria's growing population sustainably.

**Africa's Urban Population to Double by 2050, Report Warns**
According to a joint report by the Club du Sahel et de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (OCDE/CSAO), the Banque africaine de développement, Cities Alliance, and Cités et Gouvernements Locaux Unis d'Afrique, the number of people living in African cities is expected to double by 2050, from 700 million to 1.4 billion. This growth will be driven by urban areas, which are expected to absorb 80% of the continent's total population growth during this period. By 2050, two-thirds of the population will live in urban areas, and Africa will have 159 cities with over one million inhabitants and 17 megacities with over 10 million inhabitants. The report notes that Nigeria is expected to have a population of 250 million urban dwellers, the fourth largest in the world, while Egypt will have 147 million urban residents, ranking among the top 10 countries globally. The report's authors warn that this rapid growth must be followed closely, as it highlights the reality of growth dynamics, infrastructure needs, and environmental pressures. They emphasize that the urban transition in Africa is both a major challenge and a unique opportunity for transformation, and that with proactive planning, effective governance, and innovative financing, African cities can become drivers of inclusive economic growth.

**Africa's Urban Population to Double by 2050: A Report**
According to a report, the urban population in Africa is expected to double by 2050, reaching 1.4 billion people, surpassing Asia as the second-largest continent in terms of urban population. Nigeria is projected to have the fourth-largest urban population in the world, with 250 million people, while Egypt will be among the top 10 countries with 147 million urban dwellers. By 2050, cities are expected to absorb 80% of the continent's total population growth, and two out of three Africans will live in urban areas. The report calls for proactive planning, effective governance, and innovative financing strategies to unlock the full potential of African cities and ensure sustainable, inclusive, and resilient growth. By acting now, the continent can set the stage for a prosperous future. This edition of the African Urban Dynamics report provides an exhaustive overview of the future urbanization dynamics of the continent, exploring the implications for planning, governance, and financing. The report presents projections and analyses to support concrete recommendations for more fruitful urban transitions.

**More than 50% of adults predicted to be obese by 2050 worldwide**
A new study published in The Lancet journal predicts that more than half of all adults worldwide will be overweight or obese by 2050, with over 57% of men and 60% of women expected to be affected. The study warns that obesity levels are accelerating rapidly, particularly in lower-income countries, but experts say that urgent action from governments can still prevent what they describe as a 'profound tragedy'. By 2050, China, India, and the USA are expected to have the largest populations of overweight or obese people, with sub-Saharan Africa's numbers projected to rise by over 250%. Nigeria is predicted to have the fourth-largest population of adults who are overweight or obese, with numbers projected to more than triple. The authors acknowledge that new weight loss medications could play a significant role in the future, but experts stress the need for immediate intervention and treatment to prevent a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems. Prof Emmanuela Gakidou said, '[Governments] can use our country-specific estimates to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment.' Dr Jessica Kerr added, 'But if we act now, preventing a complete transition to global obesity for children and adolescents is still possible.'

**More than 60% of adults and a third of children could have obesity by 2050**
A new study published in 'The Lancet' warns of the alarming growth of obesity worldwide and calls for the adoption of 'urgent measures' to address this 'unprecedented public health crisis'. According to the analysis, led by an international panel of experts, if current trends continue, more than 60% of adults and a third of children and adolescents will live with overweight or obesity by 2050. 'If no urgent actions are taken, in just a few decades there will be at least 3.8 billion adults and over 746 million children living with an unhealthy weight, which represents a serious public health problem and has enormous economic and social repercussions', say the specialists who led this analysis. The study, published on Tuesday, uses data from 204 countries and territories collected between 1990 and 2021 and projects the evolution of this indicator until 2050 using mathematical models. The results show that the number of people with overweight or obesity has doubled in the last three decades and that there are already at least 2.11 billion adults and 493 million children with a weight far above healthy thresholds. However, this is not all. The analysis reveals that 'if substantial measures are not applied to reverse this trend' these numbers will increase even more exponentially in the coming decades. 'The fact that we are living a global epidemic of overweight without precedent is a huge social failure because it shows that prevention measures are not being applied', says Emmanuela Gakidou, researcher at the University of Washington (USA) and lead author of this work, who calls on 'governments and health authorities around the world' to identify high-risk populations in their region and promote specific measures to help affected groups. According to the records, only eight countries currently concentrate more than half of the population with overweight or obesity. These are China (402 million), India (180 million), the United States (172 million), Brazil (88 million), Russia (71 million), Mexico (58 million), Indonesia (52 million) and Egypt (41 million). The projections indicate that in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, the problem could increase disproportionately due to demographic growth and changes in diet and lifestyle. In some cases, it is even expected that obesity rates could triple. For example, in Nigeria, it is estimated that by 2050 there could be 141 million adults with overweight, making it the fourth country most affected by this phenomenon. The specialists say that there are two main high-risk groups. On the one hand, children and adolescents, especially in the 5-14 age range, where obesity rates could reach 16.5% and overweight rates 12.9%. On the other hand, it also worries the incidence of this phenomenon in older people. In this sense, it is estimated that by 2050 almost a quarter of the population with obesity will be 65 years or older, which, in the words of the experts, 'will intensify the pressure on already overburdened healthcare systems' and 'could cause serious problems in low-resource countries'. 'Preventing obesity should be a priority in public policies', says Jessica Kerr, researcher at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia and co-author of this work. According to this specialist, governments should design interventions that go 'from supporting nutritious diets' and 'promoting healthy diets' to 'regulating ultra-processed foods'. 'It's not time to keep going as if nothing had happened. Many countries only have a brief window of opportunity to prevent a much larger number of people from passing from overweight to obesity', comments the researcher.

**Achieving Economic, Social Stability Through Family Planning Culture**
Nigeria is facing a significant challenge in achieving economic and social stability due to its high population growth rate. According to Dr. Ejike Orji, Chairman of the Association for the Advancement of Family Planning (AAFP), Nigeria's population may hit 450 million by 2050 if nothing is done to address the issue. The current fertility rate of 4.8% is still very high, and the country needs to achieve a fertility rate of at least 4% to support its growing population. The lack of family planning has implications for the country's population and economic growth, and access to affordable contraceptives and comprehensive family planning services can empower families to make informed decisions about their reproductive health. The AAFP is convening the eighth Nigeria Family Planning Conference in December 2024 to address the multifaceted challenges faced by households, health facilities, institutions, and the government. The conference aims to alleviate the burden on households grappling with increased financial strain and food insecurity, and to reinvigorate dialogue, reorient strategies, and galvanise collective efforts toward realising the vision of universal access to right-based quality family planning services in Nigeria.

**The Eye of Reform: A New Era of Demographic Change**
According to the UN, the world population will continue to grow, reaching 9.6 billion by 2050, but its distribution will change significantly. By 2050, Japan's population will decrease from 123 million to 105 million, while Pakistan's will increase from 255 million to 372 million, and Nigeria's will grow from 238 million to 359 million. By 2050, nearly half of the world's population will live in either the Indian subcontinent or sub-Saharan Africa. Europe will lose 40 million inhabitants and its share of the world population will decrease from 9.3% to 7.3%. Jean-Marc Daniel, an economics professor, suggests that the key challenge is to create economic solidarity mechanisms between young and old countries. He argues that old countries must save and invest in young countries, which can mobilize labor. Daniel believes that Europe should focus on partnering with India and Nigeria, rather than worrying about the US's 'disorderly' policies. He sees the recent visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to France as an opportunity for European businesses to take the lead in India.

**CISLAC expresses fears over possible population explosion in Nigeria, globally**
The Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) has expressed concerns over the rising population in Nigeria and globally. According to CISLAC, Nigeria's population is projected to reach 400 million by 2050, doubling the current estimate. The organisation cited a population survey carried out in 2023, which showed that the world population is at 8,063,848,386, a 63,843 leap from the eight billion projections released in November 2022 by the United Nations World Population Prospects. CISLAC called for massive sensitisation of the people about the impending population implosion and the need to engage in family planning, birth control, and the need for government to raise more budgetary allocation for the welfare of the teeming masses. CISLAC Project Manager, Mr. Jimoh Abubakar, said that all hands must be on deck to ensure that the danger posed by population explosion does not consume Nigeria, and that CISLAC will continue to spread the gospel that something should be done to check the expected danger.

**World Population Growth Slows Down, According to UN Report**
According to a report by the United Nations, the world's population is growing at a slower rate than previously predicted. The population is expected to reach 10.8 billion by the end of the century, 200 million fewer than previously forecast. The growth rate of the population is slowing down, with the number of people on Earth growing at its annual rate since 1950. By 2030, the population could reach 8.5 billion, and by 2050, it will reach 9.7 billion. The peak population is expected to be 10.4 billion, which will be reached in the 2080s and will remain at that level until 2100. The key factor behind this slowdown is the decrease in fertility rates, with 61 countries experiencing a decline of 1% or more in fertility rates between 2022 and 2050. Additionally, more than half of the population growth expected by 2050 will be concentrated in eight countries: Egypt, Ethiopia, India, the Philippines, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the United Republic of Tanzania. The population in the working-age group (25-64 years) has been increasing due to recent reductions in fertility rates. As a result, the population is becoming more unevenly distributed across regions, with Africa being the main driver of population growth. This growth is expected to be a challenge to sustainable development, with the population aged 65 or older increasing from 10% in 2022 to 16% in 2050, coinciding with an increase in life expectancy.
