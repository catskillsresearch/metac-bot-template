**Hurricane season is here, but FEMA's policy change could leave low-income areas less protected**
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has made a significant change to its Local Mitigation Planning Policy Guide, removing the emphasis on equity and social vulnerability in disaster mitigation planning. The new guidance, introduced by the Trump administration, focuses on public involvement in planning but strips any mention of equity, income, or social vulnerability. This change may leave low-income areas less protected from disasters, as local plans may no longer consider the needs of socially vulnerable groups. The 2023 guidance encouraged communities to consider both the highest risks and which neighborhoods would be least able to respond in a disaster and address their needs. New York City's 2024 plan, for example, included a thorough social vulnerability assessment to identify neighborhoods with high percentages of people who were living in poverty or were older, disabled or weren't fluent in English. The change raises big questions about whether residents who are least able to help themselves will be overlooked again when the next disaster strikes.

**Highways baking at 70 deg Celsius signal a red-hot summer from China to the US**
Weeks before the official start of the Northern Hemisphere's summer, signs are emerging that the coming months will be blistering in North America, Europe, and Asia. Temperatures are soaring, with road surfaces in northern China reaching 158 Farenheit (70 degrees Celsius) and temperatures in California's Central Valley reaching into the triple digits Fahrenheit. Climatologist Daniel Swain warns that the season could shatter global high-temperature records. The extreme heat threatens to tax power grids, wilt crops, and send energy prices soaring across three continents. In the US, extreme heat is expected to inflict about $200 billion in annual losses by 2030, a number that will more than double by 2050. Swain expects to see further instances of extreme to record-shattering downpours and flood events in regions prone to heavy precipitation during the warm season. The heat is also raising ocean temperatures, boosting the odds of an unusually active hurricane season. 'I'd expect to see further instances of extreme to record-shattering downpours and flood events in regions prone to heavy precipitation during the warm season,' Swain said. 'An increase in heat extremes is the most obvious symptom of climate change,' said Karen McKinnon, a professor who studies the statistics behind climate change at UCLA. 'Even seemingly small changes in temperatures of a few degrees can make summers feel substantially more extreme.'

**Hurricane Season 2025: A Test of Trump's New Order**
The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be more active than average, with 13-19 tropical storms and 6-10 hurricanes predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). However, the season will be affected by the administration of Donald Trump, who has cut funding to agencies such as NOAA and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). This has raised concerns about the availability of data and resources for disaster preparedness and response. Mario Salgado, a risk knowledge officer at the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, warned that the lack of funding could lead to fewer and lower-quality data. 'It's a job that's done with almost 120 Doppler radars, 16 environmental satellites, and what's known as hurricane hunters,' he said. Rafael Méndez Tejeda, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico, added that the NOAA's data is crucial for informing decisions on shipping, oil tankers, and airplanes. The USAID's cuts have also affected disaster preparedness initiatives in Latin America and the Caribbean, including early warning systems. 'USAID has been a very reliable source of funding for different activities of risk reduction, preparation, and response to disasters,' Salgado said. 'In the region, one of the initiatives that has been highly affected is the early warning system for all people, which is also an initiative entrusted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.' A 24-hour warning can reduce economic and subsistence losses by up to 30%, he noted. 'We are going to see a privatization of this,' Salgado warned, expressing concern that the data will no longer be available for free. 'Nobody can afford to disappear that information, but the question is whether its access will continue to be free,' he asked. 'We can give a weather forecast, but not a forecast of Trump,' Tejeda concluded.

**Atlantic hurricane season starts with nameless storm for fourth year...**
For the fourth consecutive year, the Atlantic hurricane season has started without a named storm forming before June 1. Despite predictions of slightly above-average activity, there are no immediate signs of formation. Historically, the first named storm tends to form around June 20, but this year, observers would expect it to form before that date to meet seasonal projections. The quiet start raises questions about when the first named storm will form, but the absence of early-season activity is not unprecedented. In contrast, the Eastern Pacific basin has already seen its first named storm, Alvin, and may see its second, Barbara, within the next couple of weeks. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is giving the system a medium chance of developing over the next seven days. Early tropical activity in the Pacific has little correlation with how the Atlantic season will unfold, but it can impact the basin. 'The focus will remain on what will be the catalyst that will jump-start the season and lead to the formation of Andrea,' said the FOX Forecast Center. 'Hints of development chances in the western Caribbean have been declining in the past few days as computer forecast models become more bullish on Pacific Ocean development.'

**Everything You Need to Know About the 2025 Hurricane Season: How Many Will There Be and What Will They Be Called**
The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season has officially begun on June 1 and will last until November 30. This year, conditions are expected to be above average, according to leading weather forecasts. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the State University of Colorado have predicted a significant number of storms and hurricanes. The NOAA predicts between 13 and 19 named storms, of which between 6 and 10 could become hurricanes, and of these, 3 to 5 could be major hurricanes. This evaluation reinforces the possibility of an active season, similar to previous years such as 2020 and 2021, when record levels of cyclonic activity were recorded. The practice of naming storms and hurricanes is carried out to facilitate communication and public attention. The names for the 2025 season have been designated by the World Meteorological Organization and are repeated every six years. However, if a name has been associated with a particularly severe and damaging storm, it is removed from the list. This year's list includes names that were last used in 2019. The attention is also focused on climate change, which plays a role in the intensity of storms. The New York Times reports that hurricanes have tended to be more powerful in recent decades, highlighting the importance of preparations and adequate infrastructure to mitigate potential damage. The use of names allows meteorologists and media to effectively communicate warnings and forecasts. The World Meteorological Organization establishes the list, which is rotated every six years, removing those names associated with particularly devastating storms. Due to its ability to facilitate public discussion about active storms simultaneously, the practice of naming storms has become an essential component of disaster management. For the 2025 season, the assigned names are as follows: 'Ana', 'Bill', 'Claudette', 'Danny', 'Elsa', 'Fred', 'Grace', 'Henri', 'Ida', 'Julian', 'Kate', 'Larry', 'Mindy', 'Nicholas', 'Odette', 'Peter', 'Rose', 'Sam', 'Teresa', 'Victor', 'Wanda', 'Alex', 'Bonnie', 'Colleen', 'David', 'Emily', 'Franklin', 'Gloria', 'Henriette', 'Isaias', 'Josephine', 'Karl', 'Lisa', 'Matthew', 'Nana', 'Omar', 'Paulette', 'Rene', 'Sally', 'Teddy', 'Vicky', 'Wilfred', 'Alice', 'Bert', 'Cristobal', 'Dolly', 'Ernesto', 'Florence', 'Gonzalo', 'Hanna', 'Isaias', 'Julia', 'Karl', 'Lisa', 'Matthew', 'Nana', 'Omar', 'Paulette', 'Rene', 'Sally', 'Teddy', 'Vicky', 'Wilfred', 'Alpha', 'Beta', 'Cindy', 'Dennis', 'Emily', 'Franklin', 'Gloria', 'Henri', 'Ida', 'Julian', 'Kate', 'Larry', 'Mindy', 'Nicholas', 'Odette', 'Peter', 'Rose', 'Sam', 'Teresa', 'Victor', 'Wanda', 'Alpha', 'Beta', 'Cindy', 'Dennis', 'Emily', 'Franklin', 'Gloria', 'Henri', 'Ida', 'Julian', 'Kate', 'Larry', 'Mindy', 'Nicholas', 'Odette', 'Peter', 'Rose', 'Sam', 'Teresa', 'Victor', 'Wanda'. The preparation for the hurricane season includes evaluating insurance, creating a family emergency plan, and preparing a disaster supply kit. Authorities suggest maintaining a water supply, non-perishable food, and basic survival items. It is essential to stay informed about weather advisories and know local evacuation routes to reduce the impact of possible hurricanes. 'The preparation for the hurricane season is crucial to mitigate potential damage,' said a spokesperson for the National Hurricane Center. 'It is essential to stay informed and have a plan in place to ensure the safety of yourself and your loved ones.'

**Alexandria Storm: A Sign of a Larger Threat of Extreme Weather Events**
A recent study published in the international scientific journal 'Weather and Climate Extreme' suggests that the Alexandria storm is a sign of a larger threat of extreme weather events, including the possibility of flooding by the end of this century. According to Dr. Amira Nasser, the lead researcher of the study, the storm that hit the city on Saturday is one of the most significant evidence of the acceleration of climate change. She stated, 'What we are seeing today was expected to happen after decades, but it has already begun.' The storm was not a traditional hurricane, but rather a result of a cumulonimbus cloud that caused a 'downburst', a sudden and powerful downward flow of cold air from the cloud to the ground, resulting in strong winds, heavy rain, and unseasonal frost. Dr. Nasser emphasized that these extreme weather events are no longer rare, but are happening at an increasing rate. She warned that the scientific community has been predicting that such changes would happen by 2100, but they are now expected to happen by 2050 or even 2030. The researcher also warned that the coastal regions, including Alexandria, are still at risk, despite the fact that the summer season usually reduces these threats. However, she predicted that the coming years will see an increase in these events, including severe heatwaves, which are also a manifestation of climate change. Dr. Nasser also highlighted the importance of studying and implementing adaptation measures to mitigate the impact of these events, such as building coastal barriers and artificial landfills to absorb the effects of potential disasters.

**Start your week smart: Hurricane season, NASA nomination, Pacers defeat Knicks, United Airlines, Hajj**
Hurricane season has officially begun, with 13 to 19 named storms forecasted, and three to five potentially becoming major hurricanes. However, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is facing turmoil, with hundreds of workers leaving the agency, including senior leaders, and further cuts looming. FEMA is not ready for the June 1 start to the season, according to an internal review. The National Weather Service is also struggling with staffing shortages, with meteorologists concerned that forecasts and life-saving warnings may not be issued in time. Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers defeated the New York Knicks 125-108 to win the Eastern Conference Finals and advance to the NBA Finals. The Pacers will play the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Finals, which starts Thursday. In other news, the annual Hajj is set to begin today, and a lunar lander named Resilience is scheduled to touch down on the moon on Thursday. The week wraps up with the monthly employment report for May, which showed the US economy added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April.

**2025 hurricane names include Andrea, Barry and Chantal. See the full list.**
The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to have an above-normal number of storms, with a 60% chance of 13-19 named storms, 6-10 of which are expected to be hurricanes. The list of names for this year's storms includes Andrea, Barry, and Chantal. The World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency, sets the names for the storms, and a name is retired and replaced if it is used for a storm that is extremely deadly or costly. The organization says that naming storms helps meteorologists, media, and public officials communicate easily about forecasts and warnings to help the public prepare. 'Assigning names to tropical cyclones makes tracking and discussing specific storms more straightforward, especially when multiple storms are active simultaneously,' the agency says. This year's list was last used in 2019 and will be used again in 2031. If there are more than 21 named storms in a season, names would be used from an alternate list approved by the World Meteorological Organization.

**NOAA's 2025 Atlantic hurricane season forecast predicts above-normal number of storms**
Ten days before the start of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its forecast, predicting a 60% chance of an 'above-normal' season with 13 to 19 named storms. Six to 10 of those are expected to strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become major hurricanes. NOAA acting administrator Laura Grimm and National Weather Service director Ken Graham emphasized the technological advancements that have improved forecast accuracy. 'The United States is fortunate to have the world's best scientists, meteorologists, and computer modeling experts,' said Grimm. The neutral phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle is a significant factor influencing the number of storms this season. NOAA's forecasting model, the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS), is expected to undergo an upgrade that could increase the accuracy of storm tracking by about 5%. Graham warned, 'This outlook is a call to action: be prepared. Take proactive steps now to make a plan and gather supplies to ensure you're ready before a storm threatens.' The Colorado State University research team also predicted 17 named storms, with nine expected to grow into hurricanes and three into major hurricanes, placing hurricane activity at roughly 125% of the seasonal average.

**Rochester, New York, Attracts Residents Fleeing Extreme Weather**
Rochester, New York, is attracting residents who are fleeing extreme weather conditions. Jasmin Singer and her wife, Moore Rhys, moved to Rochester from Los Angeles in 2020 after the devastating wildfires in California. Singer said, 'We were a bit obsessed with the climate.' The city's stable climate and progressive policies to combat climate change, caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline and coal, were major factors in their decision. Other industrial cities from the mid-century, such as Buffalo and Duluth, have also gained attention in recent years as climate refuges. These cities are less likely to experience extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. Rochester, with a population of 200,000, has a average annual temperature of around 10°C (50°F), and is warmer in summer and colder in winter. The city has adopted several progressive climate plans in recent years, including a goal to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. However, experts say that people rarely choose where to move based solely on climate reasons, and other factors like affordability, family ties, and job opportunities also play a role. Alex de Sherbinin, director and principal researcher at the Integrated Earth Systems Information Center at Columbia University, said, 'There hasn't been a clear signal that people are moving to climate-friendly regions or regions with abundant water resources.'

**'All kinds of nutty about climate:' Rochester draws residents fleeing extreme weather**
Rochester, New York, has become a popular destination for people fleeing extreme weather events, such as wildfires and hurricanes. The city's stable climate, progressive policies, and abundant water supply make it an attractive option for those looking to escape the impacts of climate change. While there isn't yet evidence of a large demographic shift, experts expect climate to be a major factor in migration in the coming decades. Residents like Jasmin Singer and Jon Randall, who moved to Rochester from California and the Bay Area respectively, cite climate as one of the reasons for their decision. The city has adopted several climate plans, including an initiative to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030, and offers incentives for new residents, such as up to $9,000 for homebuyers. However, climate is often just one of many factors in people's decision to move, and Rochester's affordability, family ties, and job opportunities also play a role.

**Warning of a Massive Storm: The Future of Sea Levels in the United States**
A recent report by 'Project 89%' has warned that the United States may face a massive storm in the future, similar to Hurricane Sandy, which devastated New York City in 2012. The report suggests that by 2100, sea levels could rise by up to 4 meters, flooding areas such as Ellis Island. According to the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC), sea levels are expected to rise by 0.76 meters by the 2050s and up to 3 meters by 2100. However, new evidence from the past suggests that these predictions may be too optimistic. A study by Roger Krell, a geophysicist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, suggests that the Antarctic ice sheet may have melted faster than previously thought, leading to a more rapid rise in sea levels. The study found that the 'Lorenzid' ice sheet, which was thought to have disappeared early in the last interglacial period, may have persisted for thousands of years longer than previously believed. This could have significant implications for future sea level rise. The report also highlights the importance of understanding the past to predict the future, and the need for more accurate models to predict sea level rise. The study suggests that the 'Lorenzid' ice sheet may have played a key role in the rapid melting of the Antarctic ice sheet during the last interglacial period, and that this could have significant implications for future sea level rise. The report concludes that the future is uncertain, but that it is essential to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change.

**Study: Floods to Destroy Over 80,000 Housing Units in New York by 2040**
A study by the Regional Plan Association (RPA) has revealed alarming statistics indicating that over 80,000 housing units in the New York City area are at risk of flooding in the next 15 years. The study highlights the need for zoning reforms, climate adaptation, and other measures to ensure a better future for this region, which includes three states. According to the study, many housing crises in the country are caused by restrictive zoning laws. These laws dictate the rules for land use, building types, and locations. Additionally, the increasing extreme weather events caused by global warming will exacerbate the housing crisis. When planning land use in different communities, it is crucial to consider not only how to accommodate population growth but also the climate-related risks associated with specific areas. Did you know that nearly 1 million homes and multi-family buildings in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are at risk of severe flooding? According to RPA, about 10.5% of New York City's residential land is at risk of flooding in the near future, which could lead to the loss of 82,000 housing units by 2040. This number could double by 2070. In other words, 60% of New York City's residential areas could experience losses in housing units over the next 15 years. According to the report, Rockaway, South Ozone Park, and Canarsie are the most flood-prone areas in New York City. Westchester and Long Island have lost 14,300 acres of forests since 2001, mainly due to urban sprawl, which refers to building suburbs on larger rural areas. Furthermore, New York City, Long Island, and Westchester may need an additional 1.26 million housing units by 2040. With this rate, the RPA estimates a shortage of 680,000 housing units. Therefore, the RPA proposes zoning reforms and policies to address this alarming forecast, aiming to reduce flood risks and meet the housing shortage. The RPA also suggests a more integrated approach to land use planning and political initiatives to create safe, flexible, and affordable communities.

**How local backlash is derailing Albany's clean-energy fantasies**
New York's ambitious plan to transition to an all-renewable electric grid is facing significant challenges due to local opposition and lack of transmission capacity. According to a report by the New York Affordable Clean Power Alliance, the state has 'fallen short' of its eco-friendly goals, with 'hurdles in maintaining reliability' due to 'local opposition' and 'lack of transmission capacity.' The report notes that New York towns and counties have logged at least 78 rejections or restrictions of wind and solar projects since 2015, with close to 10% of the database's 793 rejections occurring in the Empire State. Anne Reynolds, former executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, admitted in 2018 that 'people don't want to see the turbines' is a major reason for the backlash against wind energy. The state's climate plan, signed into law in 2019, requires 70% of electricity to come from renewables by 2030 and 100% zero-carbon-emission electricity by 2040, but achieving this goal is becoming increasingly unlikely due to the lack of progress in deploying renewable energy and batteries. According to the report, the New York City area will 'experience a generation shortfall starting in 2033,' driven by an increase in peak demand and the planned retirement of existing dispatchable generation. This could lead to electricity shortages and blackouts in the near future. Additionally, New York consumers are being hammered by cost increases due to the state's renewable mandates, with a proposed rate increase that will increase the cost of an average gas and electricity bill by $154 per month.

**NYC metro area could lose 80,000 homes to flooding by 2040**
A new report by the Regional Plan Association (RPA) warns that over 80,000 homes in the NYC metro area are at risk of being lost to flooding by 2040. This could exacerbate the city's housing shortage, which is projected to reach 1.2 million homes by 2040. Moses Gates, RPA's vice president for housing and neighborhood planning, said, 'You're going to need to build more housing to just replace what is lost in your own municipality.' The report highlights the need for more adaptive measures to protect at-risk communities, as current measures are 'slow, narrow in scope, and unable to deliver fundamental transformations.' Flood-prevention projects, such as the Arverne East development in the Rockaways and the Battery Coastal Resilience Project in Manhattan, are underway, but a robust plan to protect the entire city is still decades away from completion. The report recommends focusing new developments in areas with lower flood risks, modifying zoning codes, and considering alternative strategies such as 'managed retreat' and repurposing existing land.

**Flooding threatens over 80,000 homes in NYC and suburbs by 2024: Report**
A new report from the Regional Plan Association warns that up to 82,000 homes in the New York metro area could be lost to flooding by 2040, exacerbating the city's ongoing housing shortage. The report estimates that 77,300 acres of residential-zoned land may face future flooding, and the number of homes at risk could double by 2070. The study recommends urgent action, including zoning reform, resilient construction, and strategic buyouts in flood-prone areas. According to the report, the region faces a housing deficit of 680,000 units due to restrictive zoning and climate-related risks, with zoning laws allowing less than half the housing needed by 2040. 'We need to make sure homes are built to withstand flooding and storms and to buy out housing that's at the greatest risk, all while building more housing outside of flood zones,' said the Regional Plan Association.

**New York 2040: Time to reinvent. Again.**
New York City is on the cusp of a new era of growth and innovation, driven by 18 emerging arenas of competition. These arenas, identified by the McKinsey Global Institute, have the potential to unlock $29 trillion to $48 trillion in revenues by 2040, accounting for up to a third of global GDP growth in the next 15 years. The 18 arenas include e-commerce, digital ads, streaming video, cybersecurity, and breakthrough drugs for obesity and related conditions. New York City is well-positioned to lead in these arenas, with a strong talent base, deep public and private investment, and world-class research institutions. However, technological advances in these arenas may also widen existing inequalities, and addressing these disparities requires investment in education and upskilling. The city must also prioritize equitable access to emerging technologies and mitigate negative impacts on vulnerable populations. The future of New York City will be built on strategic investment, inclusion, and collaboration in these emerging arenas, which promise innovation and revolutionary productivity.

**Civilization. The last page. (49)**
According to a recent report, 2024 is the hottest year on record, with devastating floods and droughts causing widespread destruction. Within the next 20 years, parts of New York and New Jersey will become uninhabitable due to destroyed infrastructure, while Florida may see the impacts of flooding much sooner. Miami is predicted to be 60% submerged within the next 25 years, with the city being three feet underwater as soon as 2050. Louisiana is losing 8 football field lengths per month to rising seas, and New Orleans is expected to be underwater within 60 years. Water-related disasters have caused over 8,700 fatalities, displaced 40 million people, and resulted in economic losses exceeding $550 billion. The report also highlights the urgent need for replacement of old water pipes and the loss of fresh water aquifers due to salt water intrusion. Additionally, fires consumed 77,000 square kilometers in 2024, with Southern California experiencing a devastating fire that destroyed 12,000-14,000 structures and caused 39 fatalities. The initial monetary damage is estimated to exceed $80 billion, and the long-term health effects of breathing smoke containing chemicals and particulates will affect millions of people.
