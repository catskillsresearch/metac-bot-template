**Newcastle United Qualifies for Champions League, Boosting Saudi Investment Fund's Reputation**
Newcastle United, owned by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, has achieved a major success by qualifying for the Champions League for the 2025-2026 season, after finishing fifth in the English Premier League table for the 2024-2025 season with 66 points. This achievement comes after an exceptional season that saw the team's return to the top platforms, significant financial and commercial growth, and an increase in the club's reputation as one of the top European clubs under Saudi management. Newcastle qualified for the top European competition after Manchester United's 2-0 win over Aston Villa in the final round of the English Premier League, last night. This win kept Aston Villa, owned by Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris, in sixth place with the same number of points (66), but the goal difference decided the matter in favor of 'The Magpies'. Newcastle had lost its last match against Everton with a clean sheet, but it maintained its position due to its strong performance throughout the season. With this qualification, Newcastle joins Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea, and Tottenham Hotspur (Champions League winner) in the Champions League, marking a return that was long awaited after a one-year absence. According to UEFA regulations, each participating team in the group stage will receive 18.6 million euros, in addition to 2.1 million euros for each win and 700,000 euros for each draw. The club will also benefit from its share of television broadcasting revenues and European ranking, with the possibility of reaching revenues of up to 155 million euros in case of winning the title. Outside the stadium, Newcastle has experienced a significant commercial boom. According to the 'Sportico' ranking for 2025, the club has jumped 10 places globally to rank 22nd among the most valuable football clubs, with a market value of $930 million, a 33% increase compared to 2024. This success reflects the ambitious strategy led by the Saudi Public Investment Fund since its takeover of the club in October 2021. Newcastle has had a notable season on the sports side, winning the English League Cup in February 2025, achieving its first major title since 1955. Under the leadership of coach Eddie Howe, the team has regained its momentum thanks to the performance of players like Alexander Isak and Bruno Guimarães, contributing to the team's stability and European qualification. This achievement is a continuation of the club's rise since the Saudi Public Investment Fund's takeover, which has transformed Newcastle from a struggling team to a strong contender for titles. On the financial side, the club has successfully reduced its losses by 84%, from £71.8 million in 2023 to £11.1 million in 2024, thanks to a 28% increase in revenue to £320 million. This improvement came as a result of careful financial management, adhering to the profit and sustainability rules in the English Premier League, after a 2023 season that saw significant spending on signings like Sven Botman and Anthony Gordon. The Saudi Public Investment Fund's takeover of Newcastle is part of the kingdom's strategy to diversify its economy away from oil, as part of its Vision 2030. Analysts point out that Newcastle's success in qualifying for the Champions League enhances the kingdom's image as a major player in global sports investments, particularly with its ownership stakes in other clubs like Sheikh Mansour in Spain. With its return to the Champions League, Newcastle faces significant challenges to compete at the European level, particularly in the face of fierce competition from clubs like Manchester City and Bayern Munich. However, analysts believe that the financial support from the Saudi Public Investment Fund, combined with stable technical management, gives the club a chance to strengthen its squad during the summer transfer window, with names like Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Carlos Soler, according to media reports.

**English Premier League Teams with Bird Logos Soar to Success**
The English Premier League has seen several teams with bird-themed logos achieve remarkable success in the 2024-2025 season. Newcastle United, known as the 'Magpies', won the Carabao Cup, their first title in this competition and their first domestic trophy since 1954-1955. The team's nickname 'Magpies' comes from the similarity between their black and white stripes and the bird that lives in India and Britain. Liverpool, whose logo features a bird called the 'Liver Bird', a mix of the eagle and the gull, won the Premier League title this season. The team's star player Mohamed Salah's teammates were the top scorers in the Premier League, dominating all opponents and becoming heroes four games before the end of the season. Crystal Palace, who have an imperial eagle on their logo, won the FA Cup final against Manchester City 1-0, securing their first major trophy. Tottenham Hotspur, who have a cockerel on their logo, won the UEFA Europa League final against Manchester United 1-0, securing their first trophy since 2008. Chelsea, who have a winged lion on their logo, will face Real Betis in the Europa Conference League final on May 28. While the teams with bird logos have had success, it remains to be seen if the trend will continue. However, it is clear that having a bird on the logo has brought good luck in 2025, and teams like Newcastle, Liverpool, Crystal Palace, and Tottenham can attest to the fact that English football is enjoying 'Year of the Bird'.

The kit pays tribute to the club's roots with the addition of a shepherd's check pattern and subtle blue detailing. Adidas has incorporated cutting-edge fabric for the authentic version and AEROREADY technology for the replica version. The club has pledged to donate £5 to the Newcastle United Foundation with every shirt sold via their official website or store before the end of August. According to Adidas, 'Newcastle United's black and white stripes are among the most iconic designs in football.' Peter Silverstone, Newcastle's chief commercial officer, added, 'This season's kit launch is about more than just what our players wear on the pitch - it's about supporting our community.' The jersey will go on sale from May 29. Meanwhile, the club is in the process of redesigning their badge for the 2026-27 season, believing their current one is outdated.

**Newcastle fans angered after ‘leaked’ club crest redesign**
Newcastle United fans are upset after a 'leaked' club crest redesign was shared on social media. The club had emailed a survey to season ticket holders and members to gather feedback on a new crest design, but the leaked image shows a crude and blocky design that many fans are reluctant to change. The Newcastle United Supporters Trust (NUST) has expressed concern that the survey is 'framed in an incredibly leading manner' and may not accurately reflect the opinions of fans. The club's CEO, Darren Eales, was informed of the NUST's concerns in a letter, which stated that the survey does not meet the Football Association's rules for fan engagement. The leaked design was not meant to be viewed in public and may not be one of the options presented to supporters for a public vote. The club's branding team, led by Dan Ginger, prefers to update the current crest rather than make a radical redesign. However, if supporters indicate they would be open to a more radical redesign, this will also be an option presented for a public vote. As the club grows globally, they believe their crest needs to be updated to be clear and confident across all platforms. According to the club, the current crest is too complex and intricate for modern purposes and does not translate well in today's digital world.

It doesn't always translate well in today's digital world.' Fans have been asked to submit their ideas on what should stay, and a vote will follow next week. The club promises it won't be a radical overhaul, stating, 'Refine and revive is our recommended approach.'

As the club's profile continues to evolve, they want a symbol that can keep pace and show up clearly across various platforms.

The club aims to 'carry our past forward with pride' through thoughtful evolution of the crest, 'shaped by the voices of the people who love it.'

**Newcastle to scrap club crest for new version - here's what it must look like**
Newcastle United is planning to redesign their club crest for the fourth time since the 1950s. The current crest is considered too intricate and complex, with some details being too small to be seen when embroidered on club shirts. The club wants to modernize their branding to increase visibility in a crowded market and close the financial gap with the 'Big Six' Premier League clubs. However, they must consider the fanbase's feelings and avoid referencing Saudi Arabia, the club's owners. The new design should retain traditional elements such as black and white stripes, the Norman castle, and the Magpies nickname. A simple design featuring a Magpie, castle, and stripes is suggested, rather than overcomplicating the badge with unnecessary elements.

**CRAIG HOPE - Newcastle's new club badge: A betrayal or a fresh start?**
Newcastle United has announced plans to change its club crest, citing practical issues with the current design. The current crest, which has been in effect since 1988, has been criticized for its complexity and inconsistency. The club's brand team has confirmed that a new design will be introduced, with a week-long consultation with season-ticket holders and members to follow. The new crest is expected to be in use from the 2026-27 season. According to Craig Hope, 'the true brand of Newcastle United is not what rests in literal terms on your heart, but the soul that sits beneath.' He believes that a change of badge should not change much at all, and is open to the new design. 'You can change your wife, your friends and your job, but you can't change your football team,' he says.
