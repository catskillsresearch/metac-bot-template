**GWYNNE DYER: How can 'geoengineering' help save us from the climate emergency?**
According to Gwynne Dyer, 'geoengineering', or direct intervention in the atmosphere to reflect more sunlight back into space, is the 'least bad option' to hold down heat in the short term. While many people are nervous about it, Dyer believes that it could be deployed within five years if a crash program were launched. The UK, China, and India could potentially lead a group of countries to finance and direct such a program, with the developing countries also likely to collaborate due to their vulnerability to climate damage.

**Foods for Survival: Scientists Identify the Most Suitable Crops for a Global Catastrophe**
A study by a team of scientists from the University of Otago in New Zealand has identified the most suitable foods for surviving a global catastrophe. The researchers focused on finding crops that, due to their properties, could guarantee human survival in extreme climate conditions. The study, published in the journal PlosOne, examined the crops that could be most effective for feeding the population in case of global disasters, and it did so by conducting a meta-analysis of previous research on urban agriculture. The scientists found that, in normal scenarios, beans and legumes in general stand out as the most efficient crops, while in a nuclear winter, spinach and beets are the best candidates. The study reveals that the most effective crops are not necessarily those that require large areas of land or have a pleasant taste. According to the researchers, spinach and beets are the best options for facing a nuclear winter, as they are resistant plants that can withstand colder temperatures and, in most cases, do not depend on direct sunlight to grow. In a nuclear winter, the sky would be covered with a layer of smoke and ash, blocking sunlight and making photosynthesis difficult. This would have a devastating impact on conventional crops, but spinach and beets have a higher tolerance for adverse conditions. Additionally, they are plants that provide a good amount of nutrients and are relatively easy to cultivate. Their ability to grow in less fertile soils makes them a viable option in scenarios where resources are limited. The study also highlights the efficiency of crops in terms of space required. In a scenario of global disaster, such as a nuclear war or the impact of a large meteorite, the available space for cultivating food could be extremely limited. For this reason, the University of Otago team focused on finding crops that not only provide nutrients but also can grow in reduced areas. For example, beans turned out to be one of the most efficient crops in an urban environment in normal conditions. This crop only requires 292 square meters of land to feed a person for a year, making it an ideal option for areas where space is limited. However, as beans are not resistant to cold and their viability decreases in a nuclear winter. In a nuclear winter, a combination of wheat and carrots is more effective, as these plants have a higher tolerance to cold temperatures. Specifically, a mixture of 97% wheat and 3% carrots is the most efficient for this type of scenario. Wheat, being a cereal crop, provides a large amount of carbohydrates, while carrots provide essential vitamins and minerals. This type of combination is crucial because, in an apocalypse, the variety of available foods can be very limited. People may have to resort to a more monotonous diet, making nutritious options even more valuable. Additionally, both wheat and carrots have the advantage of not requiring large areas of land to cultivate them, making them a viable option even in reduced spaces. The study led by Matt Boyd not only offers an answer to the question of what foods could save us in a scenario of global catastrophe, but also opens the debate on how societies can prepare to face these challenges. Resilience, security, and the well-being of the population must be considered when making decisions about land use and food production.

**Climate Change Adds a Month of Extreme Heat to 4 Billion People, Report Finds**
A new scientific report reveals that human-induced climate change has added a full month of extreme heat to approximately 4 billion people, or 49% of the world's population, from May 2024 to May 2025. The analysis, conducted by researchers from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central, and the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre, found that 67 heatwaves occurred during this period, all of which were directly influenced by climate change. The report defines 'extreme heat' as days where temperatures exceed 90% of the values recorded at the same location between 1991 and 2020. The regions most affected by this phenomenon include the Caribbean, where the island of Aruba recorded 187 days of extreme heat, a 142-day increase from expected levels in the absence of climate change. Other regions, such as Central Asia, South Sudan, and the Mediterranean basin, also experienced unprecedented heatwaves that would not have occurred without the effects of global warming. The report highlights that climate change has doubled the number of extreme heat days in 195 countries and territories worldwide, leading to increased mortality and disease rates, crop damage, and strain on energy and healthcare systems. The researchers emphasize that heatwaves are among the most destructive natural disasters, often receiving inadequate media coverage. Professor Frederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London and a contributor to the report, stated, 'Heatwaves kill silently. People don't die in the streets, but in their homes or hospitals, and often their deaths are not linked to the heat.' The report warns that continued reliance on fossil fuels will exacerbate these phenomena, with each degree of temperature increase increasing the likelihood of more severe and prolonged heatwaves. It calls for urgent action to reduce carbon emissions and enhance climate resilience, particularly in vulnerable and fragile communities that suffer disproportionately. This report comes at a time when many countries are preparing for a summer that is expected to be one of the hottest in history, highlighting the urgent need to accelerate international efforts to combat climate change and mitigate its devastating impacts on human and environmental health.

**Climate Crisis: The True Extent of Disaster Prevention and Response**
The recent landslide in the Lötschental region of Switzerland was an environmental disaster, but not a new one. The article argues that the climate crisis is not just about the direct consequences of global warming, but also about the increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. The author claims that even if a disaster would have occurred without climate change, the crisis is still a result of human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and land drainage. The article emphasizes that disaster prevention and response require significant resources, including money, materials, and personnel. The author argues that the concept of climate adaptation is often misunderstood as being about minor adjustments, but in reality, it is a massive task that we are not even aware of the full extent of. We are still emitting CO2, and the Earth is still getting hotter. The article concludes that we need to adapt to a world that is 1.5, 2, or 3 degrees hotter, which would require a difference of hundreds of billions of euros and millions of human lives.

**Glacier Collapse: Experts Warn of 'Sneaky' Danger in the Alps**
Experts warn of a 'sneaky' danger of glacier collapses not only in Switzerland but also in other Alpine countries. Climate researcher Andrea Fischer says that natural disasters like the one in the Lötschental valley could become more frequent and devastating in the future. The Alps pose a 'sneaky danger' because, although glaciers can be observed and measured, little is known about the distribution of ice underground, making it difficult to predict when a collapse will occur. The processes in the ground are often 'unpredictable and have no warning signs'. The climate crisis is accelerating processes like ice melting, making slopes unstable, often without visible warning signs. A major problem is the lack of measurement stations and early warning systems in many areas to evacuate endangered regions in time. Fischer warns that the risk of a glacier collapse is not only present in Switzerland but also in Austria, where the risk of flood waves affecting inhabited areas is also a concern. In Austria, many towns in Tirol, Vorarlberg, and Salzburg are increasingly threatened by rockfalls, caused by thawing permafrost, unstable glaciers, and disintegrating rock masses due to the warming of the Alpine region. Fischer refers to studies showing that extreme weather events like heavy rainfall and flooding have become twice as likely due to global warming. This development poses a significant threat, particularly for mountainous regions like the Alps. 'The increase in these Alpine hazards is a clear consequence of human-made climate change,' says Tobias Hipp, an expert on climate issues at the German Alpine Association. 'The Alps are out of balance due to warming and are becoming unstable. We must assume that these events will continue to increase.'

**Alexandria Hit by Rare Storm, Highlighting Severity of Climate Change**
A severe storm hit Alexandria, Egypt, on Saturday, bringing heavy rain and snow, a rare occurrence in late spring. This highlights the severity of climate change affecting the city. According to 'climate trade', heatwaves are prolonged periods of extreme heat, often lasting several days or weeks. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reports that heatwaves have increased in frequency and intensity, and this trend is expected to continue with rising global temperatures. Human activities such as the use of electrical devices, electricity production, high-carbon industries, and chemical use, have led to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, causing a thick layer to form around the Earth, preventing heat from escaping, resulting in a significant increase in global temperatures. The increase in greenhouse gases has also caused a hole in the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation, allowing more of it to penetrate and cause further temperature increases. Despite Egypt's reputation for a mild climate, climate change has increased the frequency of heatwaves in the summer, with temperatures often reaching or exceeding 40°C. In July 2023, the UK recorded a temperature of 34°C, its highest temperature since 1911. According to 'The United Nations Environment Programme', climate change and poor land management lead to desertification, as vegetation is stripped from semi-arid regions, causing sandstorms to become more frequent and violent. These storms occur when strong winds hit barren land, lifting large amounts of sand and dust into the air, which in turn increases the speed of sand and dust particles, reaching hundreds or thousands of kilometers. According to 'National Geographic', extreme heat causes the Earth's surface to absorb more solar radiation, leading to rising hot air, which collides with a higher layer of cooler air, causing instability in the atmosphere, paving the way for thunderstorms. As the hot air continues to rise, clouds grow and spread, eventually forming ice crystals that collide and generate electrical charges, eventually releasing lightning and thunder. According to 'Environmental Defense Fund', wildfires are sudden fires that ignite in forests and grasslands, often caused by natural events like lightning or human activity, such as abandoned campfires, discarded cigarettes, and electrical equipment like power lines. The frequency of wildfires increases due to extreme heat and drought caused by climate change, as high temperatures cause more moisture to evaporate from the soil and plants, drying out trees, shrubs, and grasses, making them more prone to ignition. During droughts, stressed trees are more vulnerable to insects and diseases that can weaken or kill them, providing more fuel for wildfires.

**CIA Report Warns of Global Catastrophe by 2030: A Countdown to Disaster**
A 2003 report by the CIA, 'The 2030 Spike: Countdown to Global Catastrophe', written by Colin Mason, describes six factors that will converge in the next decade, leading to a global catastrophe. These factors include energy scarcity, demographic disparities, global poverty, climate change, food shortages, water scarcity, and international anarchy. The report proposes over 100 measures to mitigate the consequences of this crisis. According to the report, 'estimates place available petroleum resources at less than one billion barrels, and global consumption at 28 billion barrels per year, indicating depletion in as little as 34 years.' The report also cites studies by the International Water Management Institute, predicting that one billion people will face absolute water scarcity by 2025. To avoid this, the report suggests using science, particularly genetics and climatology, to address climate change, water and food scarcity. However, some measures proposed in the report are more controversial, including: diverting scientific effort from arms, space research, and 'doubtful' technologies to practical goals for humanity; establishing a global authority to define priorities and advise on implementation; forming a 'censor' body to examine new technologies and identify potential harm; creating a specialized international penal law body to prevent the application of harmful technologies; and establishing research institutes with secure funding. The report concludes that these objectives may not be achievable, but can be approached.

**Climate Crisis as a Chance for a Livable Life in Germany**
The climate crisis may seem like a catastrophe, but it also presents an opportunity for a more livable life in Germany. While it's cynical to look for the positive in a disaster, people are searching for hope in the Ukraine war, Gaza conflict, and climate crisis. The upcoming summer will be hot, with Germany experiencing approximately double the number of extreme heat days last year compared to what would have been the case without global warming. The human body is intolerant to temperatures outside its comfort zone, and heat can be deadly. However, in the midst of this crisis, societal change may become possible. As Paris shows, reducing the number of cars and increasing shade can improve life in a city. Germany can also learn from this example by implementing measures such as heat relief, bike paths, and support for thermal insulation. These ideas can be applied to both urban and rural areas, making life more livable and even more enjoyable than before the crisis. 'A huge opportunity' exists to create a better life for all.

**The Surprising Netflix Series that Represents a Part of Human History**
The Netflix series 'Vikings' has become a global phenomenon, combining real historical facts, Scandinavian legends, battles, and betrayals. The show follows the story of Ragnar Lothbrok, a Norse farmer who becomes a mythical figure after exploring new maritime routes to the west. As the series progresses, Ragnar consolidates his leadership, faces internal and external challenges, and leaves a mark on his community through alliances, conquests, and strategies that defy tradition. The show also explores the cultural clash with Christian lands, moral dilemmas of war, and the attempt to evolve a civilization accustomed to violence. With impressive battles, deep dialogue, and impeccable aesthetics, the production successfully portrays a key period in Nordic history, blending legend with real historical records. 'Vikings' has received excellent reviews and has inspired a spin-off series, 'Vikingos: Valhalla', which continues the legacy of its protagonists with a more moderate reception.

**The Inescapable Challenge of Global Risks: Embracing Uncertainty**
Fernando Mayani, a biologist from the UNAM, estimates that humans have exploited natural resources to the point where we face numerous and complex problems that threaten our existence, including environmental pollution, climate change, loss of biodiversity, depletion of natural resources, and energy crisis. Experts from various fields, such as Slavoj Žižek, a philosopher from Slovenia, agree that our irresponsibility is not a joke. Žižek states, 'The recent uncertainties about global warming -externalize- do not indicate that things are not so serious, but rather that they are even more chaotic than we thought, as natural and social factors are inextricably linked... Either we take the threat seriously and decide to adopt measures that will seem ridiculous if the catastrophe does not occur, or we do nothing and lose everything if it does occur.' Brené Brown, an American professor, warns that intolerance to uncertainty is a factor that contributes to all forms of anxiety. However, Maggie Jackson argues that anxiety can be a 'wisdom in motion', a thought that favors good judgment, flexibility, understanding, and high-flying creativity. Nathan Furr and Susannah Harmon Furr, authors of 'The upside of uncertainty', define uncertainty as the door to the world of possibilities. Jonathan Fields characterizes it as a variant of what is creative and innovative. In summary, a smart way to face the inescapable challenge of global risks (which, as we saw, have been largely created by us) is to use uncertainty to strengthen our creative vein and, in the process, regain the path of hope, which is so lacking in these troubled times.

**Scientists Prepare to Dim the Sun in Bid to Save the Earth**
Scientists are preparing experiments to 'dim' the Sun, which they claim will 'save the Earth'. The UK government is expected to give the green light to a series of solar geoengineering experiments in the coming weeks, which will investigate methods of 'dimming the Sun', including injecting aerosols into the atmosphere and illuminating clouds to reflect sunlight. The experiments will be funded by the Advanced Research and Development Agency (ARIA) to the tune of $66.5 million, making the UK one of the largest sponsors of solar geoengineering research in the world. 'The unpleasant truth is that, on our current trajectory, the likelihood of reaching several critical tipping points in the next century becomes a very real possibility. We have concluded that we critically lack real physical data to fully understand the situation,' said ARIA's program director, Mark Sims. The leading proposed method of reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth is to inject aerosols into the stratosphere, releasing massive amounts of tiny particles (usually sulfur dioxide) that would reflect some of the sunlight back into space. Another method is to illuminate marine clouds by dispersing sea salt into the atmosphere to stimulate the formation of water droplets, making the clouds denser and able to reflect more sunlight. A more marginal idea is to thin out high-altitude clouds, as they are thought to retain more heat than they reflect sunlight. While it's easy to imagine how any of these methods could end in catastrophe, especially considering the risk of distraction from the need for radical greenhouse gas reductions, scientists note that there are some real observations that confirm their potential effectiveness. Professor of atmospheric science at the University of Exeter, Jim Haywood, said that earlier (in favor of the aerosol injection theory), after massive sulfur dioxide emissions following volcanic eruptions, there was a global cooling. Similarly, the poppy clouds helped to illuminate and increase the density of clouds - which confirms the idea of cloud illumination. Additional research has shown that a sudden drop in pollution from shipping due to international regulations has led to a jump in global temperatures. However, how to interpret these data remains disputed: on the one hand, it suggests that controlled aerosol injection could really cool the planet; on the other hand, critics warn of the risk of 'termination shock' when the aerosol injection stops and the temperature suddenly rises. 'We need to consider all possible options as humanity approaches critical climate tipping points,' said Haywood. 'We cannot afford to wait and see what happens next.'

**A Terrifying Scenario: How the World Could End Before 2045**
According to scientific estimates and security studies, several scenarios are possible for the end of human civilization, including deadly pandemics, major climate disasters, economic system collapse, and a more frightening threat: a global nuclear war. If environmental, political, and economic crises continue to escalate over the next two decades, the world may find itself on the brink of collapse. Climate change, resource depletion, armed conflicts, and pandemics could combine to create a fertile ground for a catastrophic event. In this scenario, major powers would lose their ability to control, and the global system would begin to shake and eventually collapse completely, according to the Daily Mail. A nuclear war could spark a chain reaction of automatic responses that cannot be controlled. Imagine a massive cloud of smoke blocking the sun and engulfing the planet in a dark, lasting environmental disaster. A nuclear winter: an era of artificial ice. If a nuclear war were to occur, scientific estimates suggest that global temperatures could drop catastrophically, plunging the world into a nuclear winter, where agriculture would collapse, supply chains would stop, and food security, which relies on billions of people, would disappear. In such a situation, famine and extreme cold would be common enemies for those who remain alive. On the other hand, with the breakdown of global trade chains and production, the international economy could collapse completely, with banks closing, currencies becoming worthless, and communities turning to bartering or controlling resources through force. The global financial system we rely on today could become a distant memory, replaced by a constant struggle for survival. Pandemics and health collapse. In a post-catastrophe world, diseases are expected to spread rapidly, and with the destruction of medical infrastructure and air and water pollution, new diseases will emerge that are difficult to treat. Human survival would depend more on avoiding infection than adapting to economic or political situations. However, even with the bleakness of this scenario, there is still a chance to avoid the catastrophe, where countries can work on signing new agreements to limit nuclear weapons, intensify efforts to combat climate change, and rebuild international trust.

**UK to Conduct Experiment to Reflect Solar Energy Back into Space**
The UK government is planning to conduct an experiment to reflect a small portion of solar energy back into space. The project, which has been allocated £50 million, aims to mitigate the effects of global warming. According to Aria, the UK's Agency for Advanced Research and Invention, no toxic substances will be released during the experiment. Before the project is implemented, experts will assess its impact on the environment and consult with local residents. The main reason for conducting the experiment is the urgent need for real data. Professor Mark Sims, who leads the Aria program, explains that due to the current rate of global warming, irreversible climate changes may occur in the next 100 years. He emphasizes that computer models and laboratory research are important, but they cannot provide a complete picture. The agency will provide more detailed information about the experiment in the coming weeks. The UK's National Environmental Research Council (NERC) has also announced a program to study geoengineering with a budget of £10 million. Scientists will use computer models, existing data, and study natural phenomena similar to geoengineering interventions, such as volcanic eruptions or changes in shipping emissions. No outdoor experiments are planned. Geoengineering is an attempt to artificially influence the Earth's climate to stop global warming. One of the main ideas is to reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the planet by releasing tiny particles that reflect solar radiation or making clouds whiter (i.e., increasing their reflectivity) by spraying sea water over the ocean. However, scientists warn that controlling solar radiation can lead to unintended and serious consequences, such as changing the amount and distribution of rainfall, which is critical for agriculture. Previous experiments were canceled due to concerns about harming the environment. Additionally, using geoengineering may create a false sense of security, leading people to believe that the problem of fossil fuel burning, the main cause of climate change, can be ignored. Global funding for geoengineering remains modest compared to overall climate research spending - a few hundred million dollars. The US has invested the most in this area, but opposition to climate research under Donald Trump may change the situation. Therefore, the UK has a chance to take the lead in financing geoengineering projects.

**Ragnarök: Danish Researchers Find Evidence of Real Climate Catastrophe**
Danish researchers have found evidence of a real climate catastrophe that occurred over 1,500 years ago. This event may have inspired the Scandinavian myth of Ragnarök, which tells the story of the gods' demise and a series of natural disasters. As Daily Mail reports, the discovery supports the legend of Ragnarök, which has been passed down for centuries. 'The discovery of the climate catastrophe that occurred over 1,500 years ago provides a scientific basis for the legend of Ragnarök,' said a researcher, although the name of the researcher is not specified in the article.

**Iran on the Brink: A Potential War with the US and Israel**
The situation on the Middle East is nearing a critical point, with ongoing conflicts in Syria, Turkey, Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen. The 'Iranian question' is a concern for the US administration, with some sources suggesting that Washington and Tel Aviv are planning a massive strike against Tehran. If this happens, the region will be plunged into chaos, according to some analysts. A senior official in the White House has stated that the US plans to complete a military operation in Iran by the fall, if Tehran does not begin dismantling its nuclear program. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot has warned that 'war with Iran is almost inevitable' if a nuclear deal is not reached soon. Israel, which has been given a free hand by Trump, is adding fuel to the fire. Iran's military has reportedly warned potential opponents that it will retaliate with a pre-emptive strike against a joint US-British base in the Chagos Islands if necessary. This would be an attempt to keep Trump from launching a military attack on Iran. The US is seriously considering nuclear talks with Iran, according to Axios. For Russia, which has Iran as its main strategic partner in the region, a war between its ally and the West would be a 'catastrophic' event. Russia has warned that such a conflict would lead to 'irreversible catastrophe', according to The Sun. Political analyst Dmitry Rodionov believes that the situation is on the brink of disaster, with Iran's well-developed system of bunkers making it difficult for the US to inflict significant damage. Rodionov warns that Iran could retaliate with a serious attack, potentially reaching as far as the US base in San Diego. He also believes that a war would have catastrophic consequences for the global economy, including a sharp increase in oil prices and a global financial crisis. This would be a 'true Ragnarök', a scenario in which the world is plunged into chaos and destruction. Rodionov is skeptical about Trump's willingness to risk such a conflict, but believes that it is a real possibility. 'This will be a test not only for the US, but for the whole world, which will face serious shocks in politics and economics. It's hard to imagine that Trump or his team, which advocates for war, are so confident. It's unclear if they are willing to take the risk. In the current circumstances, this war will drain the US of all its strength,' Rodionov said. 'It's possible that Trump will become the one who organizes Ragnarök.'

**Scientists Warn of Three Hidden Threats to Humanity**
Scientists have identified three potential causes of a global catastrophe that seem unlikely but could lead to the extinction of the human species. The first threat is a demographic crisis, with the United Nations predicting that the global population will exceed 10 billion by 2050, leading to a severe resource shortage, famine, and subsequent collapse of civilization. The second danger lies in the development of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, which, although promising significant breakthroughs, may get out of control. As John Skelton and Craig Wheeler from the University of Texas point out, powerful gamma-ray emissions from supernovae explosions could cause significant damage to the Earth's biosphere. If such a burst were directed towards Earth, the consequences would be catastrophic. Researchers from the University of Otago have also considered the worst-case scenario of a global catastrophe - a possible nuclear winter. They believe that only five countries would be able to survive in such conditions. 'We should consider not only obvious risks but also less predictable factors to ensure our future,' says the 'MediaPotok' news outlet.

**Global warming is speeding up. Another reason to think about geoengineering**
Satellite data show that Earth's albedo, or the amount of incoming sunlight it reflects, has been dropping since the turn of the century, adding heat to the system and exacerbating global warming. This is partly due to the reduction in air pollution, specifically sulphur emissions, which have decreased by about 90% in China over the past two decades. While reducing sulphur emissions improves human health, it also lowers albedo, as sulphate particles scatter light and serve as seeds for clouds. Atmospheric scientists have long expected more warming when this offset is removed, and some, like Paul Crutzen, have suggested that deliberately adding a thin layer of sulphates to the stratosphere could provide cooling while doing less damage to human health. However, research into solar geoengineering with stratospheric aerosols remains small, and experts are leery of it due to concerns about trust in science and the potential for unintended consequences. Crutzen advocated for swift cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions to render debates about geoengineering moot, but emissions have yet to decline, and warming is speeding up. As a result, governments should urgently heed Crutzen's call for research and discuss how such powers might be used to care for the planet.

**No, we can’t geoengineer our way out of the climate crisis**
The article discusses the climate crisis and the idea of geoengineering as a solution. It argues that geoengineering is not a viable solution and will actually make the problem worse. The article cites scientific evidence that shows the Earth's temperature is rising due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide. It also notes that the natural regulating factors present on Earth, such as the ocean and forests, have been systematically removed by human activity. The article concludes that the only effective solution is to address the underlying causes of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, maintaining and restoring wild places, and transitioning to clean energy sources. It warns that geoengineering, specifically cloud seeding, will only provide a temporary fix and will ultimately lead to more severe long-term consequences.
