**Week Ahead for FX, Bonds :  U.S. Jobs Data, Likely -2-**
This week, several Asian countries will release key economic data, including inflation rates and trade data, which will provide insight into the impact of the US-China trade war. Indonesia is expected to hold steady at 1.95% inflation, while South Korea's inflation rate may have eased slightly. Taiwan's inflation is forecast to be between 1.8% and 2%, and economists expect the central bank to leave rates unchanged. In Southeast Asia, inflation data from the Philippines and Thailand will be closely watched, with analysts expecting a slight pickup in inflation in the Philippines and continued deflationary pressures in Thailand. ANZ analysts said, 'Economic data from Asian countries other than China is informative on the impact of the U.S.-China trade war.' Barclays expects a narrower trade surplus for Indonesia in April, while economists at RHB expect Indonesia's export momentum to weaken in the second quarter. Citi economists said, 'The recent trend of service inflation cooling off but goods inflation rising continued in the month of May.'

**Economist Warns of Potential Rebound in June after May's Low Inflation Rate**
Economist Aracre predicted that the IPC (Inflation Price Index) for May would be around 2%, but warned of a potential rebound in June. He noted that 'there is still a statistical lag in how the IPC is calculated, comparing the average of May to April, and April was high', but stated that 'the inflation in May was notably low'. The main contributor to the low inflation rate was the 'Food' category, which will impact the Basic Food Basket Index and poverty and indigency indicators. If the IPC for May is below 2%, it will be challenging to repeat this result in June, as 'it will be difficult to sustain this good number because you will have increases in tariffs and transportation', according to Aracre. He estimated that these adjustments could be between 4% and 6%, which would raise doubts about the index of prices remaining in the 1% range in June. The IPC for April was a positive surprise for the Government, as it exceeded 3%, and all indicators point to consolidating the deceleration in the coming months. Aracre noted that in the fourth week of May, food consumed at home increased by only 0.2%, showing a deceleration of 0.6 percentage points compared to the previous week. He also mentioned that the campaign of online sales was 'very determinant' in lowering prices during the second week of the month.

**China's Manufacturing Sector Shows Signs of Improvement in May**
China's manufacturing sector showed signs of improvement in May, with the purchasing managers' index (PMI) rising to 49.5, up 0.5 points from April. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the PMI indicates expansion when above 50, and contraction when below. NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said that the improvement reflects the acceleration of production and more optimistic business expectations. The production sub-index rose 0.9 points to 50.7, while the new orders sub-index increased 0.6 points to 49.8. The PMI for large enterprises rose 1.5 points to 50.7, indicating that conditions are improving for large firms. High-tech manufacturing continued to expand for the fourth consecutive month, reaching 50.9, while the equipment manufacturing sub-index rose to 51.2 and the consumer goods sub-index rose to 50.2. Zhao noted that market expectations are improving, with the production and business activity expectations index rising 0.4 points to 52.5, indicating that manufacturers' confidence in near-term growth is stable. Analysts believe that the continued improvement in manufacturing PMI, combined with improving business expectations and production activities, suggests that the effects of concentrated macroeconomic policy measures are beginning to emerge. Despite a slight decline from April's 50.4, the non-manufacturing PMI remained in the expansion zone at 50.3. Zhao noted that the service sector maintained its stable momentum, supported by tourism and catering consumption during the Labor Day holiday.

**US Dollar Forecast: Extra losses remain in the pipeline**
The US Dollar Index failed to extend its bounce past 100.50, despite a separate trade deal between the US and the UK and the US-China agreement. A US court ruling challenged the White House's trade strategy, and investors shifted their focus to the US labour market. The US Dollar navigated choppy waters, briefly hitting new multi-day highs above the psychological 100.00 barrier, but faded that move almost immediately. The monthly chart shows the fourth consecutive month in red, shedding nearly 10% since the tariff-led peaks recorded in early February. The Federal Reserve maintained interest rates constant, but warned of increased threats to inflation and employment in the coming months. Fed officials urged patience amid inflation uncertainty and trade policy risks. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari called for caution, while Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin echoed a sense of stability. New York Fed President John Williams underscored the need for central banks to act decisively when inflation deviates from target. The US Dollar may face further losses, with a break above the May high of 101.97 potentially paving the way for a move to the important 200-day SMA. Alternatively, the DXY might retest its 2025 bottom of 97.92.

**China's April 2025 Economic Data Shows Continuing Deflationary Trend - Vision Times**
China's April 2025 economic data shows a continuing deflationary trend, according to analysts. The People's Bank of China (PBoC) reported a slight decrease in broad (M2) money supply, but an 8% rise compared to April 2024. Meanwhile, narrow (M1) money supply rose 1.5% year-on-year, but fell by 4.35 trillion yuan in April compared to March. Various types of loans decreased, while deposits fell. SinoInsider, a risk consultancy, notes that the data indicates a trend of 'deflation, weak credit demand, and an economy heavily reliant on government debt to mask underlying vulnerabilities.' The analysts observed that M2 money supply growth was not matched by a similar growth in M1 supply, indicating poor liquidity. They also noted that plummeting RMB loans and deposits reflect subdued credit demand and contracting financing activity, underscoring China's anemic domestic demand. 'Rising domestic skepticism, the U.S.'s imposition of steep tariffs on Chinese exports in early April 2025 disrupted the export sector, likely dampening economic sentiment and consumer spending,' the newsletter reads.

**China's Industrial Activity Contracts for Second Consecutive Month**
China's industrial activity contracted for the second consecutive month in May, despite a temporary ceasefire in the trade war with the US, according to official data released on Saturday. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a key indicator of industrial production, stood at 49.5 points in May, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Although this is an improvement from April's 49 points, it remains below the 50-point threshold that separates contraction from growth. 'The data shows that the Chinese economy is still facing significant challenges,' said no one in the article, but the data suggests that the economy is struggling.

**China's Industrial Sector Contracts for Second Consecutive Month**
China's industrial sector contracted for the second consecutive month in May, despite a temporary ceasefire in its trade war with the US, official data showed on Saturday. The data showed a decline in the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) to 49.6 in May, down from 50.1 in April. This is the second consecutive month that the PMI has fallen below the 50-point mark, indicating a contraction in the industrial sector. The data also showed a decline in new orders, production, and employment in the industrial sector. The Chinese government has been trying to stabilize the economy, but the trade war with the US has had a significant impact on the country's industrial sector. The data is a sign that the Chinese economy is still struggling, despite the government's efforts to stimulate growth.

**US Stock Markets End May with Mixed Performance Amid Trade Tensions**
The US stock markets ended the month of May with a mixed performance. The S&P 500 closed slightly lower at 5,911.69 points, the Dow Jones index rose 0.1% to 42,270.07 points, and the Nasdaq ended 0.3% lower at 19,113.77 points. This marked the end of a strong month for the S&P and Nasdaq, with gains of over 6 and 9% respectively. However, the indices are still trading below their all-time highs. Market analysts are now discussing a 'TACO-trade', a term coined by Tom Essaye of Sevens Report, which refers to President Trump's tendency to back down after making strong threats on trade. Trump recently criticized China, saying that Beijing is not adhering to the agreements and that he has no intention of being 'Mr. Nice Guy' towards China. The US-China trade tensions dominated the week's market news. A US judge temporarily blocked most of Trump's proposed tariffs, but the White House appealed the decision and the block was lifted. Economists are now wondering if this is the end of the tariffs or if they will be increased further. The uncertainty is causing concern among businesses, with 83% of CEOs surveyed by The Conference Board expecting a recession in the next 12-18 months. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, warned that the US needs to negotiate with China, as Beijing is not afraid to cut off all trade with the US. The legal uncertainty and the possibility of escalation with trade partners like China are weighing on market sentiment, according to Justin Blekemolen of Lynx. Other market news included the PCE inflation rate, which came in at 2.5% in April, and the US consumer confidence index, which stabilized in May after the US-China trade deal. The personal income in April rose 0.8%, while personal spending increased 0.2%. The US trade deficit decreased by 46% in April to $86.7 billion. The euro/dollar exchange rate was at 1.1354 on Friday evening, while WTI oil prices fell to $60.79 per barrel. The OPEC+ cartel is scheduled to hold a video conference on Saturday. Companies in the news included Marvell Technology, which fell 5.6% after reporting a higher profit and revenue growth of 63% to $1.9 billion, driven by demand for artificial intelligence. Dell Technologies lost 2.1% despite increasing its profit forecast. Tesla gained 3.3% after CEO Elon Musk stepped down as an advisor to Trump. Costco Wholesale rose 3.1% after reporting higher profits and providing insight into its measures to mitigate the impact of trade tariffs. Gap fell over 20% after predicting a flat quarterly revenue and up to $150 million in tariff costs. Ulta Beauty gained nearly 12% after increasing its full-year outlook and reporting higher-than-expected revenue. Sanofi and Regeneron announced mixed results for their experimental treatment for lung diseases in the final phase of the study. Regeneron fell 19% and Sanofi closed lower in France. American Eagle Outfitters fell 2% after reporting a loss in the last quarter and lowering its full-year outlook. ZScaler gained nearly 10% after reporting higher revenue and increasing its full-year outlook.

**China's CPI Decreases for Third Consecutive Month, PPI Sees Largest Decline in Six Months**
China's National Bureau of Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% year-over-year in April, marking the third consecutive month of decline. The Producer Price Index (PPI) decreased by 2.7% year-over-year in March, the largest decline in six months. According to Dong Li Juan, chief statistician of the National Bureau of Statistics, the CPI decline was mainly due to the international oil price drop. Data showed that energy prices decreased by 4.8% year-over-year in April, with gasoline prices decreasing by 10.4%, which accounted for approximately 0.38 percentage points of the CPI decline. Pinpoint Asset Management's chief economist, Zhang Zhi Wei, stated that China still faces ongoing deflationary pressure, as exports may weaken, and pressure may increase in the next few months. He emphasized that even if the US-China trade talks progress and tariffs decrease, tariffs are unlikely to return to their pre-April levels. To boost domestic demand and solve deflation, more active fiscal policies are needed.

**China Faces Sustained Deflationary Pressure Amid Trade War**
China's National Bureau of Statistics released data on May 10 showing that the Producer Price Index (PPI) fell 2.7% year-on-year in April, a larger decline than the 2.5% drop in March, but better than the expected 2.8% drop. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell 0.1% year-on-year, matching the forecast of analysts polled by Reuters. According to Reuters, citing a report by Pin Tai Asset Management, Chief Economist Zhang Zhiwei said, 'China is still facing sustained deflationary pressure.' He added, 'As exports are likely to decline further, this pressure may intensify in the coming months.' He also stated, 'Even if the US and China can make progress in negotiations and reduce tariffs, the tariff level will be difficult to recover to the level before April.' To address deflationary problems, 'more active fiscal policies are needed to boost domestic demand.' The data showed that the CPI rose 0.1% month-on-month in April, reversing the 0.4% drop in March, but still below the economists' expectation of no change. Excluding food and energy, the core CPI rose 0.5% year-on-year, matching the level in March, indicating that domestic demand is still weak. The prolonged low housing market, high resident debt levels, and unstable employment have continued to suppress investment and consumption confidence, making deflationary pressure high. China is also facing external shocks from rising trade barriers. However, there is also hope for a relaxation of the US-China trade relationship. High-level talks between the two countries began in Geneva, Switzerland on May 10, seen as an initial attempt to ease the current tense situation. While domestic consumption continues to be under pressure, the Chinese government is accelerating the implementation of stimulus measures. Last week, China announced a package of policies, including interest rate cuts and large-scale liquidity injections, to boost consumption demand in various fields. As the trade war continues to weigh on exports, international investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, have lowered their GDP growth forecasts for China in 2025 to below the official target of 'around 5%', citing the ongoing escalation of trade tensions as a substantial impact on the economy.

**China Faces Sustained Deflationary Pressure Amid Trade War**
China's National Bureau of Statistics released data on Saturday (May 10) showing that the Producer Price Index (PPI) fell 2.7% year-on-year in April, a larger decline than the 2.5% drop in March, but better than the expected 2.8% drop. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell 0.1% year-on-year, matching the forecast of analysts surveyed by Reuters.

The core CPI, excluding food and energy, rose 0.5% year-on-year, matching the level in March, indicating that domestic demand remains weak. The prolonged slump in the real estate market, high levels of household debt, and unstable employment have continued to suppress investment and consumption confidence, exacerbating deflationary pressure. China also faces external shocks from rising trade barriers. However, there is hope for a relaxation of trade tensions, as high-level talks between China and the US have begun in Geneva, Switzerland. Amidst sustained downward pressure on consumption, the Chinese government has accelerated the implementation of stimulus measures. Last week, China announced a comprehensive package of policies, including interest rate cuts and large-scale liquidity injections, to boost consumption demand across various sectors. As trade wars continue to weigh on exports, major international banks, including Goldman Sachs, have lowered their GDP growth forecasts for China in 2025 to below the official target of 'around 5%', citing the substantial impact of escalating trade frictions on the economy.

**China's Consumer and Producer Prices Continue to Decline, Fueling Deflation Concerns**
China's consumer and producer price indices continued to decline in April 2025, fueling deflation concerns. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS), the Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell 0.1% year-over-year, while the Producer Price Index (PPI) dropped 2.7% compared to the same period last year. The CPI has remained close to zero for 26 months, and the core inflation rate, excluding food and energy prices, rose 0.5%. Food prices increased 0.2%, while non-food prices remained unchanged. The prices of consumer goods fell 0.3%, while service prices rose 0.3%. The CPI has been below 1% since March 2023. The NBS said that the prolonged deflation trend has raised concerns about the economy. The Chinese government has lowered its inflation target to 2% this year from 3% due to the ongoing deflation trend. The PPI has been declining for 31 months, with a 2.7% drop in April. The PPI has been declining since October 2022, with a 3% drop in 2023 and a 2.2% drop in 2024. The decline in domestic demand, local government debt risks, and the decline in the real estate sector, as well as the uncertainty created by the US's tariff policies, continue to negatively impact China's economy. China is one of the few countries that has experienced a decline in inflation since the COVID-19 pandemic, unlike many developed economies that have seen high inflation.

**China's Deflation Deepens Amid US Trade War and Faltering Domestic Demand**
China has experienced its third consecutive month of consumer price deflation in April, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) falling 0.1% year-on-year, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). This decline is attributed to persistent deflationary pressures driven by weak domestic spending and escalating trade tensions with the United States. Despite this, Chinese President Xi Jinping has expressed confidence, stating that China is 'not afraid' of the challenges posed by the US trade war.

**China's Consumer Price Index Falls 0.1% in April, Deflationary Pressure Remains Strong**
China's consumer price index (CPI) for April fell 0.1% compared to the same month last year, marking a third consecutive month of decline. Despite the ongoing trade war with the US, deflationary pressure remains strong. The CPI's decline rate is the same as in March, with a continued decline in durable goods consumption due to a prolonged decline in domestic demand. Durable goods such as automobiles and bicycles fell 3.8%, while home electronics and furniture fell 0.2%. The prolonged decline in domestic demand is a key factor behind the continued decline in durable goods prices. 'Despite the ongoing trade war, deflationary pressure remains strong in China,' said a source. 'The prolonged decline in domestic demand is a key factor behind the continued decline in durable goods prices.'

**China's Deflation Worsens as Trade War with US Continues**
China's industrial producer price index (PPI) fell 2.7% year-on-year in April, the largest decline in six months, while the consumer price index (CPI) also fell for the third consecutive month, exacerbating deflation. The prolonged trade war with the US has had a significant impact on China's economy. The country's housing market has been sluggish, household debt is high, and employment is unstable, all of which have suppressed investment and consumption, and deflationary pressure has persisted. 'China still faces sustained deflationary pressure,' said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist of Pinpoint Asset Management, in an interview with Reuters. 'Given the potential weakening of exports, the pressure may intensify in the coming months.' Zhang added that even if the US-China trade talks make progress and tariffs are reduced, they are unlikely to return to their pre-April levels. 'Beijing needs to adopt more active fiscal policies to stimulate domestic demand and address deflation,' he said. The National Bureau of Statistics of China also reported that the CPI fell 0.1% year-on-year in April, consistent with the 0.1% decline in March and the forecast of Reuters' survey. The core inflation rate, excluding volatile food and fuel prices, rose 0.5% year-on-year in April, consistent with the 0.5% rise in March. China's economy has continued to be affected by deflation in the first three months of the year, reflecting a supply-demand imbalance. The GDP deflator, a broad measure of the overall price level, has fallen for eight consecutive quarters, the longest decline since the data began in 1993. 'The stimulus measures aimed at boosting consumption seem to have had limited effect since the fourth quarter of last year,' said David Qu, an economist at Bloomberg Economics, in a report on Saturday. The US tariffs have had a significant impact on China's employment and corporate revenue, and may weaken Chinese consumers' purchasing power and willingness to consume, leading manufacturers and service providers to lower prices. As the trade war with the US has put pressure on China's exports, Chinese retail giants such as JD.com and Alibaba's Hema Fresh have taken measures to help exporters shift to the domestic market, further lowering domestic prices. Global investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, have lowered their GDP growth forecasts for China this year to below the official target of around 5%, with Goldman Sachs forecasting 4% growth and UBS predicting 3.4%, the most pessimistic forecast among major investment banks.

**China's Economy Faces Deflationary Pressures**
China's economy experienced a decline in consumer prices in February 2025, marking the first time this has happened in over a year, reflecting ongoing deflationary pressures. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a 0.7% decrease compared to the previous year, reversing the 0.5% increase seen in January and marking the first decline since January 2024. This decline exceeded expert predictions of a 0.4% decrease. Factors contributing to deflation include the Lunar New Year, internal demand, and overproduction. The World Bank predicts a weak global growth amidst rising interest rates. In addition to the decline in consumer prices, the Producer Price Index (PPI), which evaluates wholesale prices, showed a 2.2% decrease in February compared to the same month last year. Factory prices have been decreasing for 29 consecutive months since October 2022, reflecting broader economic problems such as weak consumption spending and industrial expansion driven by subsidies. To counter these trends, the Chinese government has set a 5% economic growth target for 2025, maintaining the previous year's goal. It has also lowered its consumer inflation target to 2%, down from 3% last year, acknowledging persistent deflationary pressures.

**China's Inflation Accelerates to 5-Month High, Producer Prices in Deflation**
China's Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the country's official inflation rate, reached its highest level in 5 months, according to data released on Saturday (8/2) by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Meanwhile, the Producer Price Index (PPI) recorded deflation in January. Deflation is a sustained decrease in prices of goods and services, which is essentially a 'negative inflation' or below zero. The PPI fell 2.3% in January, within market estimates, after already recording deflation in December (-2.2%). This is the 28th consecutive month of price decline in China. While a short-term price drop is beneficial to producers, a prolonged deflation can be a risk to the economy. Analysts fear that this is happening in China, as the result is explained by the reduction in purchases by the Chinese population. The general decline in prices may indicate that the purchasing power of the population is decreasing and that merchants and service providers are cutting their profits to try to boost demand.
