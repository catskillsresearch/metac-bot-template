**Semaglutida Reduces Cardiovascular Events in People with Obesity, Even Before Significant Weight Loss**
A new analysis of the SELECT clinical trial has revealed that semaglutida, initially approved for treating obesity, reduces severe cardiovascular events in just a few weeks, even before patients have lost significant weight. The study, presented at the 32nd European Congress on Obesity (ECO), found that administering 2.4 milligrams of semaglutida per week to adults with obesity and pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) resulted in a 37% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within the first three months of treatment. This decrease includes heart attacks, strokes, or deaths from cardiovascular causes. By six months, the risk of cardiovascular death decreased by 50% compared to the placebo group. The study's lead author, Dr. Jorge Plutzky, noted that 'the benefits were already evident in the first six months, and even before any significant weight loss and before most patients had been titrated to their full dose of 2.4 mg.' The results suggest that semaglutida's early action in reducing cardiovascular events may be independent of weight loss. Semaglutida is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that mimics the functions of natural incretins, which regulate blood glucose levels and signal satiety to the central nervous system. The study's findings have significant implications for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with obesity, which is a major cause of death worldwide. According to the study, two out of every three people with obesity die from cardiovascular causes. The results of the SELECT trial suggest that pharmacological intervention may play a complementary role to traditional strategies in preventing cardiovascular events.

**Regeneron (REGN) Phase 2 Trial Shows Promising Obesity Treatment**
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has released interim findings from its Phase 2 COURAGE study, which explores new treatment approaches for obesity. The trial examines the effects of semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, in combination with trevogrumab, with or without garetosmab. Results indicate that participants who received semaglutide paired with trevogrumab retained more lean mass while achieving greater fat reduction. However, the addition of garetosmab resulted in higher dropout rates due to side effects. The study aims to improve the quality of weight loss by preserving muscle mass while reducing fat. Analysts forecast Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' stock to reach an average price of $771.84, with a potential upside of 57.43% from the current price of $490.28.

**Interim Results from Ongoing Phase 2 COURAGE Trial Confirm Potential to Improve the Quality of Semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist)-induced Weight Loss by Preserving Lean Mass | Taiwan News | Jun. 2, 2025 19:00**
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has announced interim results from the ongoing Phase 2 COURAGE trial investigating novel combinations of semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) and trevogrumab (anti-GDF8/anti-myostatin) with or without garetosmab (anti-activin A) for the treatment of obesity. The trial demonstrated that approximately 35% of semaglutide-induced weight loss was due to loss of lean mass. Combining semaglutide with trevogrumab with or without garetosmab helped preserve lean mass while increasing loss of fat mass. The combination of semaglutide with trevogrumab was generally well-tolerated, but the triplet combination of semaglutide with both antibodies had a substantially higher rate of discontinuations due to tolerability issues and other adverse events. 'These early insights from the COURAGE trial are consistent with recently published pre-clinical data in rodents and non-human primates, and clearly establish the principle that blocking GDF8 with or without activin A can preserve muscle and further increase fat loss in patients being treated with GLP-1 therapy, thereby improving the quality of weight loss,' said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Board Co-Chair, President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. The full data set will be available later this year and will provide further insights to help optimize the dosing regimens in future trials.

**Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN) Announces Promising Interim**
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc has released interim results from its Phase 2 COURAGE trial, which combines semaglutide with muscle-preserving antibodies trevogrumab and garetosmab for obesity treatment. The trial showed that the combination therapies preserved 50%-80% of lean mass and increased fat loss compared to semaglutide alone, which led to a 35% loss of lean mass. However, the triplet therapy had a higher rate of adverse events and treatment discontinuations, with two deaths reported. The full data set is expected to be available later this year. The promising results may lead to a competitive edge over existing therapies, but the safety profile remains a concern that could impact marketability.

**Novo Nordisk Cuts Prices of Ozempic and Wegovy in Brazil Amid Competition**
Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company, has decided to reduce the prices of its Ozempic and Wegovy medications in Brazil. The prices of the semaglutide-based medications will be cut by up to R$282 per box, depending on the dosage and sales channel. The move comes amid a heated competition in the obesity and diabetes medication market, shortly after the arrival of Eli Lilly's Mounjaro in the country. According to Sandy Louren√ßo, vice-president of cardiometabolic marketing, the decision is due to the increase in production capacity and the normalization of national supply. 'The increase in production capacity has stabilized the availability of products, and we decided to act to combat the sale of irregular products,' she said. 'With the price reduction, we hope that more people will have access to innovative treatments.' The company has invested R$6.4 billion to expand its factory in Montes Claros, where it will start producing its own semaglutide-based medications from 2028. The success of diabetes and weight loss medications has transformed Novo Nordisk into one of the most valuable companies in Europe, valued at over $240 billion. However, the company is facing a new challenge: the end of the patent for Ozempic in 2026, which will allow generic versions and further pressure prices.

**Semaglutide: Reversing Fatty Liver Disease and Protecting Kidney Health - Gringo Gazette**
Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has shown promise in reversing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and protecting kidney health. Recent studies have demonstrated its potential in reducing liver inflammation and fat accumulation, as well as mitigating the risks of kidney failure and cardiovascular events. The FDA has approved semaglutide for reducing the risk of kidney disease progression in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the FDA is phasing out the allowance for compounding pharmacies to produce semaglutide, making it less accessible to those who need it. This decision has been met with criticism, particularly from those who rely on affordable access to these medications. It is essential to consider potential side effects, such as gastrointestinal symptoms and pancreatitis, and to work with a licensed doctor to ensure proper dosing and screening. 'We are lucky to have compounded GLPs still available here in Cabo San Lucas,' says the author, recommending a licensed doctor for referrals. 'The doctor I recommend here is taking very careful measures to ensure my referrals for compounded Semaglutide and Tirzepatide are being properly screened and dosed correctly.'

**Novo Nordisk's Semaglutide 25mg Oral Formulation: A Breakthrough in Obesity Treatment**
Novo Nordisk has developed a new 25mg oral formulation of semaglutide, aiming to provide personalized and accessible therapeutic options for the growing need to address obesity, which affects around 40% of the adult population in the US. According to the OASIS 4 clinical trial results, the oral formulation of semaglutide showed a significant reduction in body weight, with a mean weight loss of 13.6% in the semaglutide group compared to 2.2% in the placebo group after 64 weeks. The results also showed that 79.2% of patients treated with semaglutide achieved a weight loss of 5% or more, compared to 31.1% of patients treated with placebo. The safety profile of the oral formulation was consistent with that of GLP-1 agonists, with gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and diarrhea being the most common, but generally manageable. The clinical impact of semaglutide is significant, as obesity is a chronic, progressive, and multifactorial disease that requires long-term strategies that integrate pharmacological interventions, lifestyle changes, and, in severe cases, surgical approaches. The FDA's decision on the approval of the new oral formulation of semaglutide is expected in the fourth quarter of 2025. If approved, it would be the first oral GLP-1 agonist approved for the chronic management of weight, opening new therapeutic prospects for millions of people with obesity or overweight.

**Novo Nordisk's Semaglutide 2.4 mg: A Breakthrough in Obesity Treatment**
Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of semaglutide, stated that 'obesity is not just a number on the scale.' According to the company, semaglutide 2.4 mg is the only GLP-1-based obesity medication approved to prevent major cardiovascular events, such as heart death, heart attack, and stroke. The company commented on the results of the Surmount-5 study conducted by Lilly, which compared tirzepatide 15 mg to semaglutide 2.4 mg. The study found that the weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg was lower than that demonstrated in the Step-1 clinical trial, which showed a median weight loss of 17% and one in three participants lost 20% of their weight. Novo Nordisk also highlighted that they are currently conducting the Step Up study on a higher dose of semaglutide 7.2 mg, which showed preliminary results of a 20.7% weight loss and one in three participants losing at least a quarter of their weight, with a 'positive and comparable' safety, tolerance, and gastrointestinal side effect profile to the Step study. The company plans to submit a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 'in the second half of 2025'.

**FDA accepts filing application for oral semaglutide 25 mg, which if approved, would be the first oral GLP-1 treatment for obesity**
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted Novo Nordisk's New Drug Application (NDA) for an oral formulation of semaglutide, known as Wegovy, for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight. If approved, Wegovy would be the first oral GLP-1 treatment for obesity. According to Anna Windle, PhD, Senior Vice President, Clinical Development, Medical & Regulatory Affairs at Novo Nordisk Inc., 'We are entering a new era of obesity care where patients want individualized treatment plans that address their needs and provide choices, including oral formulations.' The FDA application is based on results from the OASIS 4 trial, which showed the efficacy and safety of once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg in 307 adults with obesity or overweight. The FDA action date to decide on the Wegovy oral formulation NDA will be in Q4 2025.

**The FDA Removes Semaglutide from the Drug Shortage List**
The FDA has removed semaglutide from its drug shortage list, stating that the current supply of the drug can meet present and future demand. The agency has set deadlines for 503A compounding pharmacies and 503B outsourcing facilities to stop compounding semaglutide injection products, citing the need to avoid unnecessary disruption to patient treatment. The FDA emphasized that the deadlines do not restrict compounding pharmacies or outsourcing facilities from compounding semaglutide injection products that are not 'essentially a copy' of an FDA-approved product, such as those with different doses or inactive ingredients. The removal of semaglutide from the drug shortage list comes as public officials raise concerns about counterfeit and illegal forms of diabetes and obesity medications entering the U.S. The FDA's action will impact the availability of compounded versions of semaglutide and health care providers should ensure they remain compliant with FDA regulations and guide their patients accordingly.

**Beyond Ozempic: New Medications for Obesity**
Beyond Ozempic: New Medications for Obesity. The semaglutide, popularly known as Ozempic, has become a cultural and commercial phenomenon. Its success has sparked debates about its use, availability, new uses, and long-term consequences. Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, sold under the names Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus, has led to other pharmaceutical companies researching similar treatments for diabetes and obesity. Lilly has developed and commercialized tirzepatida, a new medication that follows the same therapeutic line, but with small differences in its mechanism of action. Tirzepatida, sold under the names Mounjaro and Zepbound, acts on both GLP-1 and GIP receptors, mimicking the actions of the two natural incretins, controlling blood sugar and promoting weight loss. Tirzepatida has been shown to be more effective than semaglutide in reducing weight, with a 22% reduction in body weight compared to 16% for the Novo Nordisk medication. The most common side effects of both medications are similar, affecting the digestive tract and manifesting as nausea, constipation, diarrhea, and vomiting. The tirzepatida is approved and authorized by the FDA and EMA since April 2022, but has taken longer to reach Spanish pharmacies. Unlike Ozempic, it is not funded by the Spanish public system and its price can range from 270 to 350 euros. Both medications require a prescription and should only be used under the supervision of a healthcare professional. Scientists at Stanford Medicine have discovered a natural molecule that could offer an alternative to semaglutide and tirzepatida. The molecule, called BRP, has been shown to be more effective than semaglutida with fewer side effects. However, more research is needed to fully understand its effects and safety in humans.

**Iv√≠m Health Raises Alarm as FDA Deadline Threatens Obesity Treatment Access**
Iv√≠m Health is raising concerns about the impending FDA deadline that could limit access to compounded GLP-1 medications, which have been effective in reducing obesity rates. According to a recent study, the national obesity rate in the US has dropped from 46% in 2022 to 45.6% in 2023. However, the FDA's decision to declare the shortages of semaglutide and tirzepatide resolved, leaving compounding pharmacies with a 90-day grace period to cease production, could jeopardize patient access to affordable versions of these medications. Iv√≠m Health has taken action to ensure continued access to essential obesity treatments and is calling on the FDA to prioritize patient safety and reconsider its timeline. 'We stand with our patients and will continue to advocate on their behalf to ensure they have access to the treatments they need to lead healthier lives,' said Dr. Jessica Duncan, Medical Director at Ivim Health. 'Restricting access to compounded tirzepatide and semaglutide will undermine the progress we've made in reducing obesity rates.'

**New Weight Loss Medications for 2025: A Breakthrough in Obesity Treatment**
The growing global demand for weight loss medications has driven the development of a new generation of drugs that could revolutionize current treatments. By 2025, the pharmaceutical industry plans to launch innovations that not only facilitate weight reduction but also provide metabolic and cardiovascular benefits. Among the most popular treatments are Ozempic and Wegovy, based on semaglutide, which have shown positive results in appetite control and blood sugar regulation. However, their high costs, the need for weekly injections, and long-term dependence have led to the search for more efficient options. One of them is tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro and Zepbound, which showed a 20% reduction in body weight in 72 weeks in clinical trials. It acts on two key hormones: GLP-1 and GIP, optimizing fat metabolism and reducing fat accumulation around the heart. An upcoming study in 2025 will further evaluate its effects on people with obesity and diabetes. Another promising advance is retatrutide, an experimental drug that activates GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon simultaneously. In clinical studies, participants experienced a 24% average weight reduction in 11 months, surpassing tirzepatide and semaglutide. It is currently in phase III trials, with approval expected in 2026. To avoid frequent injections, Orforglipron presents itself as an oral option with daily administration. Initial studies showed a 10% weight reduction in 26 weeks, with improvements in blood pressure and lipid levels. Its approval could be given in 2026. One of the main challenges of current treatments is the rebound effect after stopping the medication. MariTide, a monthly injection, has demonstrated its ability to maintain weight loss for months after the last dose. In preliminary studies, participants reduced up to 20% of their weight in 52 weeks. Developed by Novo Nordisk, CagriSema combines semaglutide with cagrilintide, a compound that enhances the feeling of satiety. In 68-week studies, participants achieved a 23% weight reduction. Its phase III trial is expected to conclude in 2025. Beyond these medications, the industry is investigating in 2025 treatments based on synthetic amylase, a hormone that regulates sugar and appetite without affecting muscle mass. Inhibitors of cannabinoid receptors are also being studied to reduce hunger in a more natural and sustainable way.
