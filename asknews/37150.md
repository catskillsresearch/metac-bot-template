The company's Chairman, Nihat Kırmızı, stated that they are currently in the process of applying to the Capital Markets Board and plan to use the proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) for capital and digitalization. Kırmızı said, 'We are currently in the process of applying to the Capital Markets Board. We are following the market fluctuations and are working to complete the IPO process in the first half of 2026, if everything goes as planned.' He also emphasized the need for technical profitability to increase, stating that 'technical profitability is very low, and in many cases, it's even negative, but as insurance companies are also financial companies, we need to increase technical profitability to make the sector more sustainable.' Kırmızı also highlighted the importance of considering the risk premium when setting insurance prices, saying, 'for example, in car insurance, the value of the car is not taken into account, but the price is set based on the price of the car. This is not a fair approach, as the risk premium is not considered.' He also mentioned that they are offering a product that covers all types of natural disasters, including fire, and even includes health insurance for critical illnesses such as heart attacks.

**Tata Group To Launch $2 Billion IPO Of Its Electric Vehicle Arm In 2025**
The Tata Group is planning to launch a $2 billion IPO of its electric vehicle arm, Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Ltd (TPEM), in 2025. TPEM is the largest producer of electric vehicles in India, with a market share of over 80%, and has sold over 53,000 electric vehicles in FY24. According to reports, the Tata Group's overall strategy for investment monetisation is more important than the EV maker's need for funding, and the IPO is intended to monetise its investments in the electric vehicles business rather than to garner funds from the market. TPEM is valued between $9.5 and $10 billion, and the company plans to offer ten electric vehicles in its lineup over the next three to four years. This is one of several IPOs planned by the Tata Group, which has already launched five other IPOs, including Tata Technologies in November 2023.
