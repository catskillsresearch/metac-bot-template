**China's First Commercial Land-Based Modular Nuclear Reactor Set to Launch**
The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) is set to launch the Linglong-1, the world's first commercial land-based modular nuclear reactor. This compact reactor, also known as the ACP100, is designed to provide a new generation of nuclear energy that is safer, more accessible, and adaptable to various geographical and industrial contexts. The Linglong-1 is a 'bank of nuclear energy' due to its ability to provide continuous and reliable power. Unlike traditional reactors, small modular reactors (SMRs) like this one do not require large infrastructure and can be installed quickly. They are intended for use in industrial areas, mining regions, and isolated territories where energy demand is constant but logistical resources are limited. Each Linglong-1 reactor can generate 125,000 kilowatts, equivalent to approximately 1 billion kilowatt-hours per year, enough to power 526,000 homes and serve around 1 million people. The environmental impact is significant, as the reactor will reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 880,000 tons, equivalent to the ecological benefit of planting 7.5 million trees.

**Lee backs nuclear power - for now**
Presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being', but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables to supply industrial hubs and aims to phase out coal by 2040. He supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' In contrast, Lee's main rival, Kim Moon-soo, supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60% of the mix. South Korea's latest energy blueprint aims for nuclear to make up 35% of the power mix by 2038, with renewables at 29%. If elected, Lee is expected to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30% of the power mix by 2030.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**US Announces Largest 'Deployment' in History: A Global Effort to Combat Fossil Fuels**
The US has announced its largest 'deployment' in history, but it's not a military operation. Instead, it's a global effort to combat fossil fuels, led by tech giants Meta, Amazon, and Google. The companies have joined forces to promote a clean energy future, as reported by The Pulse (translated by Charter97.org). At the CERAWeek conference in Houston, the World Nuclear Association (WNA) signed an agreement to triple the world's nuclear energy production by 2050. This goal has been supported not only by IT companies but also by representatives from the aviation, maritime, oil and gas, and financial sectors. This agreement complements the promise made at the 2023 UN Climate Conference, where over 30 countries and leading financial institutions, including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, agreed to also triple nuclear energy production. The document, titled 'Commitment of Large Energy Consumers,' is the first case where representatives from other industries, aside from nuclear, have officially supported a massive expansion of the nuclear sector. Nuclear energy is a clean and reliable source of power, and it's becoming a key element in the global energy transition. According to WNA data, there are currently 439 reactors in operation worldwide, with a total capacity of 371 gigawatts. However, nuclear energy accounts for only 9% of global electricity production. Expanding these capacities is necessary not only for the environment but also for energy security, especially for countries dependent on imported fossil fuels. 'As the global economy expands, reliable, clean, and sustainable energy supply becomes essential. Nuclear energy can provide a stable energy flow. We're happy to join the joint initiative to develop nuclear energy and confirm our commitment to this direction,' said Urvvi Parekh, Meta's global energy head. Amazon and Google have already announced investments in small modular nuclear reactors (SMR) in October 2024, a technology that could reduce the cost and construction time of new reactors. In December, Meta joined the project and began considering proposals from developers to build up to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity in the US. Tech giants see nuclear energy as a necessary foundation for sustainable development and a key tool for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

**3 Stocks to Buy to Ride the Nuclear Power Renaissance | The Motley Fool**
President Trump's executive order aims to boost the nuclear energy industry, and three stocks, NuScale Power, Constellation Energy, and Cameco, are expected to benefit from the industry's renaissance. NuScale Power's small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) are a promising innovation, but execution is a risk to consider. Constellation Energy is the country's leader in producing nuclear power and is investing heavily in expanding its clean energy operations. Cameco, a uranium producer, is well-positioned to benefit from the expected increase in demand for uranium as more nuclear reactors come online. According to Reuben Gregg Brewer, 'If NuScale Power can start selling its SMRs, it has a huge opportunity ahead of it as nuclear power demand increases.' Matt DiLallo notes that Constellation Energy is 'on track to grow its adjusted operating earnings at a more than 13% compound annual rate through 2030 on a stand-alone basis.' Neha Chamaria highlights that Cameco's outlook is closely followed by the uranium and nuclear energy industry, and the company is already witnessing an uptick in long-term uranium contracting activity.

**Nuclear Power Interest Driven by Growing AI Demand**
According to a report by Gartner, the first data center powered by a small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) is expected to be operational by 2030. This data center will operate independently of the existing power grid. The demand for electricity in data centers is increasing rapidly, mainly due to the growing need for artificial intelligence (AI). As a result, interest in nuclear power is growing. A recent report by Gartner and Deloitte highlights the potential of nuclear power to alleviate the growing power shortage problem. Gartner predicts that by 2027, up to 40% of existing data centers will face 'operational constraints' due to power shortages. The agency estimates that the power required for AI servers added in 2027 will be 2.6 times the power required for AI servers added in 2023. Gartner's Bob Johnson, vice president and analyst, stated in a research report in October 2024, 'The explosive growth of hyperscale data centers is driving a surge in power demand for generative AI, which exceeds the ability of power suppliers to rapidly expand capacity. This threatens energy supply stability. As a result, new data centers for generative AI and other purposes will face obstacles from 2026.'

**The AI boom runs on oil, gas, and nuclear power**
The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads is driving a surge in electricity demand, with the International Energy Agency projecting a 115% increase in global data center electricity consumption by 2026. To meet this demand, tech giants like Amazon and Nvidia are considering all options, including oil and gas, as a short-term solution. Kevin Miller, Amazon's vice president of global data centers, said, 'To have the energy we need for the grid, it's going to take an all of the above approach for a period of time.' The nuclear sector is also seeing a resurgence, with companies like NuScale and Standard Power developing small modular reactors (SMRs) to provide power for data centers. According to Goldman Sachs, data center power demand will grow at 15% compound annual growth rate from 2023-2030, with data centers consuming 8% of total U.S. electricity output by 2030.

**Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG): One of the Best Nuclear Energy Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires**
Nuclear energy now accounts for 10% of global electricity supply and is expected to grow significantly, with over 70 GW of new nuclear capacity under construction globally. According to the International Energy Agency, nuclear energy could meet 10% of the demand for data centers by 2035. However, the construction of new nuclear projects is slow and costly, with some projects taking a decade or more to complete. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are seen as a solution, with the potential to reach 80 GW by 2040 and account for 10% of global nuclear capacity. Despite a record surge in demand, nuclear energy stocks have declined due to the declining price of uranium, which has fallen by 37% since January 2024. The decline in uranium price is attributed to increasing tensions between the US and Canada, as well as the potential lifting of sanctions on Russia.

**New nuclear power could meet 10% of projected data center demand increase by 2035: Deloitte**
According to a Deloitte report, new nuclear power capacity could meet about 10% of the projected increase in data center electricity demand by 2035. Deloitte expects data centers to consume 30% to 50% of the estimated 35 GW to 65 GW of new nuclear capacity added over the next decade. The consultancy also forecasts a 50% increase in U.S. electricity demand through 2050, driven by data center growth and transportation electrification. Deloitte's Martin Stansbury said, 'We think you're going to see people looking at existing nuclear infrastructure and adding capacity through those assets, then placing bets on technology development.' The tech-giant 'hyperscalers' driving the data center boom have already started investing in new nuclear capacity, with Microsoft and Constellation Energy announcing a 20-year power purchase agreement for the Three Mile Island plant. Deloitte noted that small modular reactors (SMRs) have a major role to play in future grid reliability and offer additional benefits for data centers, including more secure fuel forms and self-starting capabilities.

**With new subsidies, US states vie for future of small nuclear reactors**
US states are competing to build and supply the next generation of small nuclear reactors, with the federal government providing subsidies and regulatory support. The reactors, which could be operational as early as 2030, are seen as a reliable and climate-friendly source of electricity, but face public skepticism and competition from renewables. Tech giants like Amazon and Google are investing in nuclear reactors to meet their growing electricity demands. States like Tennessee, Utah, and Texas are embracing nuclear energy, with some offering millions of dollars in incentives to develop and use the reactors. However, the devices face an uncertain future, with no modular reactors currently operating in the US and a project to build the first was terminated in 2023. The US Department of Energy estimates the country will need an additional 200 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

**The Myth of the Nuclear Power Boom: A Closer Look at the Data**
The increasing demand for electricity due to artificial intelligence and data centers has led to speculation about a shift to nuclear power. However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that data centers and cryptocurrencies account for only about 2% of the world's electricity demand. The IEA also notes that the growth in electricity demand from data centers has slowed down since January 2024. According to the IEA's 2030 projections, the increase in electricity demand from data centers will be 223 TWh, while the increase from air conditioning will be 697 TWh, which is three times more. It is interesting that no one is talking about the increasing electricity demand from air conditioning, which is a major contributor to climate change. The IEA also notes that the growth in electricity demand from data centers is being driven by speculation, and that the production side is being influenced by this speculation. The US is seeing an increase in the construction of gas-fired power plants, which are cheaper and more proven than nuclear power. The US is also seeing a significant increase in solar power, with 40 GW of new solar capacity added in 2024, which is enough to generate 7% of the country's electricity. In contrast, nuclear power's share of the US electricity mix has decreased to 18.5%. The article concludes that the focus on nuclear power is a marketing ploy to sell the idea of small modular reactors, which are still in the development stage and have not yet been licensed. The article also notes that the US is not currently building any new nuclear reactors, and that the development of small modular reactors is still in its early stages. The article suggests that the focus should be on using energy more efficiently and reducing waste, rather than relying on nuclear power.

**Could Small Modular Reactors be the Solution for Data Centers?**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that data centers currently account for only 1% of global electricity consumption, but this demand is growing at a rate of +20% per year and could reach 850 TWh by 2028, representing 10% of the expected increase in total electricity consumption by 2030. In the US state of Virginia, data centers already account for 25% of electricity consumption, according to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). In Europe, their share could increase from 2% today (62 TWh) to 5% (150 TWh) by 2030. However, the concentration of this specific demand poses local and national challenges. The French newspaper LesEchos.fr suggests that Small Modular Reactors (SMR) could be the solution to overcome the congestion of electricity networks and provide in-situ production for data centers, especially in areas with network constraints. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have already chosen to partner with companies developing SMR projects to reduce their reliance on the US electricity grid. The article concludes that France, which has already committed to supporting SMR and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMR) start-ups, could marry its ambitions in innovative nuclear power with its vision for Artificial Intelligence (AI).

**11th Basic Plan for Electricity Supply Passes National Assembly Committee**
The National Assembly's Trade, Industry, and Energy Small and Medium Venture Business Committee approved the 11th Basic Plan for Electricity Supply on Feb. 19. The plan, which outlines South Korea's energy strategy from 2024 to 2038, includes the construction of two new nuclear power plants and a small modular reactor (SMR), alongside an ambitious target to increase the renewable energy share to 29.2% by 2038. The plan has been met with mixed reactions, with experts expressing concerns over the reduction in the number of new nuclear power plants and the increase in the renewable energy target. Lee Ki-bok, president of the Korean Nuclear Society, stated, 'Rapidly increasing renewable energy is not only difficult to achieve but also does not align with global trends.' The plan's focus on renewable energy expansion also raises logistical challenges, including the need for additional solar facilities and high settlement costs. However, the introduction of SMRs represents a strategic shift towards next-generation nuclear technology, offering potential benefits in terms of safety and flexibility.
