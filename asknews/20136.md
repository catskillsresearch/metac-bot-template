**TSMC Reconsiders Opening Factory in UAE Amid Security Concerns**
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is reportedly re-engaging in discussions with the United States about opening a massive factory in the United Arab Emirates. The Taiwanese chipmaker had previously explored this opportunity under the Joe Biden administration, but it did not yield significant results. With the change in administration, TSMC has decided to revisit the idea, but it is unclear whether the outcome will be different. The main concern is the potential security risks, particularly the close ties between the UAE and the Chinese government. The primary fear is that the UAE will transfer knowledge and technology to China, which could compromise the security of the semiconductor industry. As HDblog.it notes, while it is relatively easy to monitor and regulate the flow of AI hardware, the production of semiconductors is a more complex issue.

**Taiwan Under US Semiconductor Tax Shadow: Chen Xianming Predicts Trump's 'Tax-for-Order' Model**
Taiwan is still under the shadow of the US semiconductor tax, in addition to the equal tax impact. Chen Xianming, the president of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, predicts that the tax rate for mature and advanced processes will be different. He believes that Trump may adopt a 'tax-for-order' model for high-end processes, where US factories that produce more will enjoy higher tax rates or exemptions. Chen Xianming said, 'If you order more in the US, the tax benefits for importing chips from Taiwan will be higher.' He also analyzed that the tax rate for advanced processes will be easier to transfer, and if the tax rate is higher, it will have a greater impact on US manufacturers. However, Trump may hope that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) will be affected by the lower tax rate and slow down its production in the US, but through high taxes, it is impossible to accelerate TSMC's production in the US. Instead, Trump may offer incentives to encourage TSMC to set up factories in the US. Chen Xianming also pointed out that the key to mature processes is whether Taiwan and China have different tax rates, and he believes that Taiwan's tax rate will be lower than China's. If the tax rate is low enough, it will be beneficial to Taiwan, as mature processes are mainly competing with China.

**Morgan Stanley: Three Key Numbers to Watch for TSMC's Future Performance**
Morgan Stanley (大摩) has reaffirmed its target price of NT$1,288 for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and maintains a 'buy' rating, making TSMC its top pick among Chinese semiconductor stocks. However, the company suggests that investors should pay attention to three key numbers in the coming months. Firstly, TSMC's CoWoS capacity expansion in 2026, expected to be announced in July, will be an important indicator of demand for cloud AI (Artificial Intelligence) semiconductors. Secondly, if TSMC's NVL 72 server shipments in the third quarter reach 10,000 units, it will alleviate concerns about Blackwell's inventory issues. Thirdly, TSMC's expected update on its full-year revenue forecast in July will provide insight into its performance. According to Morgan Stanley, TSMC's dollar-denominated revenue growth rate is expected to reach 25-30%, but the impact of the New Taiwan Dollar's appreciation on its gross margin should be taken into account. Morgan Stanley notes that two of TSMC's major concerns (Intel partnership and AI demand) have been largely alleviated, and if the third concern (semiconductor tariffs) can be resolved, TSMC's stock price may be reevaluated. Additionally, Morgan Stanley believes that TSMC's US factory may soon raise wafer prices by at least 10% to maintain its long-term gross margin. This is in line with comments made by Micron Technology's CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, who emphasized the importance of supply chain profitability for the company's ecosystem. Morgan Stanley's investigation with other US semiconductor customers also suggests that TSMC's US factory wafer prices may indeed increase by 10%.

**TSMC Evaluates Construction of Large-Scale Semiconductor Factory in UAE**
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is reportedly evaluating the construction of a large-scale semiconductor factory in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). However, TSMC has stated that it will focus on its existing overseas expansion plans and not comment on market rumors. According to Bloomberg, TSMC has held multiple meetings with US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and officials from MGX, a company that invests in AI technology and is supervised by the UAE president's brother. The discussions centered around a 'gigafab' project, which would involve setting up six semiconductor factories. However, the timeline and capital expenditure for the project are unclear, and sources indicate that it may take several years or even longer to begin construction. The plan is reportedly contingent on the US government's attitude, as the expansion of global chip manufacturers to the Persian Gulf region could have implications for US national security and economy. TSMC spokesperson declined to comment on market rumors and stated that the company is focused on its existing expansion plans. Meanwhile, TSMC's expansion plans in the US and Japan are progressing, with the first Arizona factory producing 4-nanometer chips and the second factory expected to start production in 2028. In Japan, the first factory in Kumamoto has started production, while the second factory is expected to begin construction this year and start production by the end of 2027. Central University's Taiwan Economic Research Center executive director Wu Da-ren said that TSMC's investment in the UAE is not a good strategy, as it may not be able to produce semiconductors smoothly due to the lack of a complete semiconductor supply chain. He also pointed out that TSMC is accelerating its investment in US factories, and setting up a factory in the UAE is not easy, especially in terms of talent recruitment. If the US factories have sufficient production capacity, it's possible that chips could be exported to the UAE.
