**Spain's Proposed 37.5-Hour Workweek: What it Means for Workers**
The Spanish government has proposed a reduction in the working week to 37.5 hours, which would be implemented through a new law. According to labor lawyer Juanma Lorente, companies could apply this reduction in several ways, including reducing the working day by 30 minutes, working fewer hours in the summer months, or increasing the number of vacation days. If the law is approved, workers could receive 12 more days of vacation, bringing the total to 42 days per year. Lorente explained that this option would be calculated on an annual basis, not weekly. The government aims to implement the new law before the end of 2025, which would also include measures such as digital time control, the 'right to disconnect' outside of working hours, and stricter penalties for companies that fail to comply with the new regulations.

**Socialdemokraterna: ett fegt högerparti**
The Swedish Social Democratic Party (S) has continued to move to the right by demanding harsher punishments and more money for the military. At their recent congress in Gothenburg, they rejected a proposal to reduce the workweek to 35 hours by 2035, which was seen as a 'cowardly and watered-down' proposal by Annika Strandhäll. The party's decision to reject the proposal shows their clear shift to the right. The article argues that the party's stance on work hours is a class issue, as it affects the workers who guarantee the country's prosperity. The author notes that the party's proposal to let 'the parties' decide on work hours is unclear and may be a way to avoid making a decision. The article concludes that the party's decision is 'historical' and a clear message that work hours need to be shortened. Meanwhile, the Swedish Employers' Association (Svenskt Näringsliv) has already reduced their workweek to 32 hours. 'It was a cowardly and watered-down proposal,' Strandhäll said. 'I don't understand how it could be considered bold to implement something that has already been achieved in Denmark.'

**EU's Stagnant Economy and Lack of Global Tech Companies**
According to a recent analysis by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the European Union (EU) is lagging behind the United States in terms of economic growth, with a stagnant economy and a lack of global tech companies. The analysis compared the number of unicorns (companies with a valuation of over $10 billion) in the EU and the US, with the US having 690 unicorns (total valuation of $253 billion) compared to the EU's 107 unicorns (valuation of $33.3 billion). The WSJ attributes this to the EU's declining labor culture, with a decrease in working hours and labor productivity compared to the US. In 1999, EU labor productivity was 95% of US labor productivity, but it has now decreased to below 80%. Additionally, EU workers have shorter working hours than US workers, with an average of 30.2 hours per week in 2023 compared to 34.6 hours per week in the US. Experts predict that this situation will not change in the near future, as the EU prioritizes stability, job security, and quality of life over long working hours and risk-taking. This has led to concerns among investors about the US's continued dominance over the EU in terms of economic growth.

**Should Millennials Really Be Worried About the State of Social Security? Experts Weigh In**
Experts warn that millennials should be concerned about the future of Social Security, as the trust fund may dry up in the 2030s and benefits could be reduced by 21-22%. According to Krisstin Petersmarck, National Social Security Advisor, the number of beneficiaries is outpacing the number of workers paying into the system, and by 2040, the ratio of workers to beneficiaries is projected to drop to 2.3. Jonathan Ford Jr., a financial advisor, advises millennials to plan for retirement as if Social Security won't be around forever, and to take responsibility for their own retirement. He suggests that if necessary changes are made to preserve Social Security, it would be a bonus, and that millennials should consider early retirement or spending more during retirement. 'It is no secret that the Social Security trust fund is facing trouble,' Petersmarck wrote. 'The fact is, more people are leaving the workforce than entering it.' 'I help every one of them plan for retirement as if Social Security won't be around forever,' Ford explained. 'It's a classic case of 'plan for the worst, hope for the best.''

**Merz's Misguided Call for More Work**
Friedrich Merz has sparked a debate about the need for Germans to work more, but his analysis is flawed. He claims that the current generation is lazy and that a four-day workweek and work-life balance will not be sustainable. However, the data shows that Germans are actually working more hours than ever before, with a record number of people employed in 2024 and a significant increase in total working hours since 2019. The average working time has decreased due to more people working part-time, but this is a result of more people entering the workforce, including those with family or care responsibilities. In contrast, countries like Poland and the US have much longer working hours, which is not a new phenomenon. The real issue is that Germany's productivity has stagnated, which is a major concern for the country's future. As the population ages, Germany will need to find ways to maintain its standard of living, and increasing productivity is a key solution. Merz's proposal to work more is not a solution to the demographic crisis, but rather a distraction from the real issue of productivity. The new government's ideas to mobilize more workforce, such as tax-free overtime bonuses or reduced taxes for those who continue to work after retirement, are a step in the right direction.

**There are no boundaries left**
The author reflects on the impact of the internet on their generation, noting that they are one of the last to remember a time before widespread internet use. The author highlights the blurring of boundaries between work and personal life, citing a MISCO survey that found 88% of Maltese employees report poor mental wellness due to work. The survey also found that 57% of employees work over 40 hours a week. A MISCO director noted that employees are struggling to switch off, leading to emotional and physical health issues. The author argues that the constant expectation to be connected is creating stress and anxiety, and calls for a better work-life balance and a better machine-life balance. 'There's no point in posting photos of grass if you don't know what it smells like,' the author says, emphasizing the need to disconnect from technology and reconnect with the physical world.

**Germany's Working Hours: A Call for More Efficiency**
According to the German Federal Statistical Office, the average working hours per week in Germany are 40.2 hours for full-time jobs and 20.8 hours for part-time jobs, resulting in a total average of 34.3 hours per week. Some conservative politicians argue that this is too little. New Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated in his first government address, 'We must work more and more efficiently in this country.' This suggests that he believes the main issue is the high cost of labor in Germany.

**Is AI a Threat to Human Employment? The Truth No One Wants to Admit**
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is sparking a heated debate about its impact on human employment. While some warn of massive job losses and growing inequality, others see AI as a catalyst for innovation, creating new opportunities and enhancing human work. According to a 2023 McKinsey study, up to 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated by 2030. Real-world examples, such as tech company layoffs in 2024, suggest that AI-driven automation is already contributing to significant job cuts, with a 44% wave of job cuts reported. As AI continues to transform industries, it's essential to consider both sides of the argument and prepare for the future of work.

**Can AI save American manufacturing from collapse?**
American manufacturing is facing a severe skills gap, with over 2.1 million jobs potentially going unfilled by 2030, according to Heather Carroll, Chief Revenue Officer at Path Robotics. Carroll emphasizes that this is a 'national problem' that requires immediate attention. She believes that AI can bridge the labor gap, allowing robots to adapt and make decisions on the fly, and augment human capabilities. Carroll stresses that the problem is accelerating and that action must be taken now to avoid being left behind. She describes the current moment as a 'make or break' point for the United States in terms of skilled labor, but also sees opportunities for growth and innovation if leaders adopt AI technology now.

**Mexico Aims to Reduce Working Hours to 40 per Week by 2030**
The Mexican government has announced plans to reduce the working hours from 48 to 40 hours per week by 2030. This move is expected to improve the quality of life for employees, providing them with more time for rest and family. Eduardo Alanís, a representative of the Frente por las 40 horas de México, stated, 'Having more rest time implies better health for workers. For companies, this means less turnover, which is a positive economic factor.' However, some employers and business owners are opposed to the initiative, fearing it will lead to decreased productivity and competitiveness. Alanís countered, 'We know they have a higher level of dissemination for what they have to say, but we have data from studies in Spain that show a 53% increase in productivity per hour after reducing working hours.' He also pointed out that technology now offers tools to help workers complete their tasks in less time, and that studies have shown that employees are productive for less than 8 hours a day.

**Mexico to Gradually Reduce Working Week to 40 Hours by 2030**
The Secretary of Labor and Social Welfare, Marath Bolaños López, announced that the gradual reduction of the working week from 48 to 40 hours will begin in 2026. This decision is a response to the strong demand from Mexican workers, as stated by López. The process will involve national consultation forums from June 2 to July 7, where a proposal will be developed that takes into account the views of all stakeholders. The proposal will then be presented to Congress, which could approve it by September. The reduction will be implemented gradually, with a two-hour decrease in working hours per year, aiming to reach 40 hours by January 2030. López emphasized that the goal is to have a solid proposal that reflects the views of all parties involved, and to avoid rushing the legislative process.

**Mexico to Reduce Working Hours to 40 per Week by 2030**
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced that the working hours will be reduced from 48 to 40 hours per week. This measure will benefit millions of workers and will be implemented progressively until January 2030. Sheinbaum stated that the change will be discussed with business leaders, unions, and society to achieve a consensus on how to apply the reform fairly. 'We will sit down with everyone to see how to achieve this working hours', she said. The Secretary of Labor, Marath Bolaños, explained that several models are being analyzed, including working six days with six and a half hours each day or maintaining five days of eight hours with two mandatory breaks. Bolaños assured that this reform will not reduce workers' rights or productivity. 'We are thus attending to a historical demand of the people', he said. With this measure, Mexico joins the global trend that promotes a balance between work and personal life.

**Mexico Announces Reduction of Workweek to 40 Hours by 2030**
The Mexican government announced on May 1st, International Workers' Day, that it will gradually reduce the workweek from 48 to 40 hours by 2030. This decision was made during a meeting between President Claudia Sheinbaum and union leaders. The reduction of the workweek was one of Sheinbaum's campaign promises. According to Secretary of Labor Marath Bolaños, the reduction will be implemented through a dialogue process with employers, workers, and experts to define agreements and a consensus proposal that ensures a 'fair and effective' model. Bolaños explained that the reduction in working hours will not imply a decrease in productivity and that the goal is to 'dignify the existence' of workers by returning eight hours a week to them. 'We are convinced that putting this free time in their hands will contribute to national development, the well-being of their families, and happiness,' he added. Mexico has the highest excess of work hours in the world, with an average of 2,207 hours worked per year, according to World Population Review. Some business leaders have spoken out against the reduction of the workweek, suggesting that productivity and innovation should be increased instead.

**Mexico to Implement 40-Hour Workweek by 2030**
In celebration of Labor Day, Mexico's Secretary of Labor and Social Welfare, Marath Baruch Bolaños López, announced the gradual implementation of a 40-hour workweek in Mexico. The proposed reform aims to modify Article 123 of the Mexican Constitution to ensure workers have a maximum of 40 hours of work and two days of rest for every five days worked. By 2030, the goal is for all workers to have at least two days of rest per week. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Mexico is the second country with the most working hours in the world. The OECD measures working hours by calculating the total effective working hours per year, divided by the average annual number of employees. This includes regular hours for full-time, part-time, and annual employees, as well as overtime, whether paid or not, and additional work hours. The OECD excludes hours not worked due to holidays, paid vacations, illness, injury, temporary incapacity, maternity or paternity leave, training or education, technical or economic layoffs, strikes or labor conflicts, inclement weather, absences for compensation, and other reasons. 'The objective is to guarantee two days of rest per week by 2030,' said López. 'We want to ensure that workers have a better quality of life and can enjoy their free time.'

**Why do we work?**
Economist John Maynard Keynes predicted in 1930 that by 2030, people would only work 15 hours a week due to increased wealth and technological advancements. However, the opposite has occurred, and people are working more than ever. Researcher Prof Kevin Murphy from the University of Limerick notes that the more people earn, the less likely they are to take time off, and the reward for work becomes more work. The concept of 'enough' is also elusive, leading to the question of why people clock in and out every day. Is it for a paycheck or a sense of purpose? In a recent podcast, presenter Ella McSweeney explores this topic with Prof Murphy, discussing the challenges of work and potential solutions. As Murphy notes, 'we need to rethink our relationship with work'.

**German Employers' Association President Calls for Longer Working Hours**
Rainer Dulger, the president of the German Employers' Association, is calling for longer working hours. 'It would be good if we could move towards a 40-hour workweek for more employees,' he said to the German Press Agency in Berlin. Currently, the average weekly working hours in Germany are 34.3 hours, according to the Federal Statistical Office. Dulger noted that Germany has 46 million employees, but they do not work significantly more than they did 20 years ago, despite having fewer employees and inhabitants at the time. Dulger emphasized that Germany needs to increase its efficiency. 'We need to make work pay again, and there should be more net income from gross income,' he said. Germany is already facing a shortage of skilled workers, and with the baby boomer generation retiring in the coming years, the country will face a significant loss of employees. According to a study by the IW Institute of German Economy, nearly 20 million people will reach retirement age by 2036, and the younger generations will not be able to fill the gap.
