**Kneecap tell fans Glastonbury slot hangs in the balance after terror charge**
Irish rap trio Kneecap performed at the Wide Awake Festival in London, just days after member Liam O'Hanna was charged with a terror offence for allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag at a gig last November. The band strongly denies the charges and claims it's 'political policing'. They told the crowd that their set nearly got pulled and that their Glastonbury slot is now in jeopardy due to pressure from the police and government. Despite the controversy, fans are still supporting the band, with one fan saying, 'We were fans of Kneecap before but we've become bigger fans in the last month. I don't agree with what they said but they had the right intentions in mind and I support their cause.' The band has also announced a surprise gig at the 100 Club, which sold out in 90 seconds, and will appear before Westminster Magistrates Court on June 18.

**Kneecap say Glastonbury slot at risk after terrorism charge**
Irish rap group Kneecap claims they are being made a 'scapegoat' after one of their members, Mo Chara, was charged with a terrorism-related offence for allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag at a London gig in November 2024. The group denies the 'offence' and accuses the British establishment of 'political policing' and 'a carnival of distraction' from the real issue of genocide in Gaza. They announced a last-minute gig at the 100 Club, which sold out in 90 seconds, with Chara taking the stage with tape over his mouth in a symbolic protest. The group believes the timing of the charge is deliberate, coming just ahead of their scheduled Glastonbury appearance, and are 'vehemently defending' themselves. 'We are not the story, genocide is,' they said in a statement.

**Kneecap accuse authorities of trying to 'silence' them as member of Irish rap trio is charged with terrorism offences after 'displaying a flag in support for Hezbollah' | Daily Mail Online**
Irish rap trio Kneecap has been charged with a terrorism offence in the UK for allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag during a performance at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town last year. The group claims the charge is an attempt to 'silence' them and that it's 'political policing'. They stated, 'This is a carnival of distraction. We are not the story. Genocide is. As they profit from genocide, they use an 'anti-terror law' against us for displaying a flag thrown on stage.' Kneecap has been involved in several high-profile controversies, including calls for their Glastonbury set to be axed and being banned from concerts. The group has also been involved in a discrimination case against the former Conservative government, which they won in November 2024, receiving £14,250. They donated the money to two youth organisations in Belfast. O'Hanna is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, 18 June.

**Kneecap threaten to sue industry critics who want a Glastonbury ban**
Irish republican rap trio Kneecap have threatened to sue music industry figures who called for them to be banned from this year's Glastonbury Festival lineup. The band is currently under investigation by police after footage emerged of them shouting 'up Hezbollah, up Hamas' and 'kill your local MP' at music events in 2023 and 2024. Music agents allegedly wrote to Glastonbury founder Emily Eavis and other festival organisers, urging them to ban the group. Kneecap's lawyers have accused those behind the complaint of making 'untrue and defamatory' claims, and have demanded an 'unequivocal' apology or face high court action. The band has been dropped from several music festivals this summer, but others have stood by them, refusing to cancel their performances. Kneecap's manager has been accused of praising terror leaders and comparing Israel to the Nazis in social media posts.

**POLL: Should Kneecap be banned from performing at Glastonbury?**
The Irish republican band Kneecap is under scrutiny after making a series of political statements. A video from a November 2023 gig appears to show a band member saying, 'The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.' Another video is being assessed by the Metropolitan Police, which appears to show a band member saying 'up Hamas, up Hezbollah' at a London performance in November last year. This is a crime in the UK, as Hamas and Hezbollah are banned. The band's statements have sparked a debate about whether they should be allowed to perform at Glastonbury.

**Now Glastonbury is urged to axe rappers Kneecap who yelled Pro-Hamas slogan to cheering fans, have an army of luvvie celeb supporters and told crowd 'kill your local MP' | Daily Mail Online**
Rap group Kneecap is facing mounting pressure to be dropped from the Glastonbury festival after a video surfaced of them telling fans to 'kill your local MP' and shouting 'the only good Tory is a dead Tory'. The band's comments have been widely condemned, with the Prime Minister's official spokesman calling their lyrics 'completely unacceptable'. Kneecap's DJ Provai performs onstage at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California - April 11, 2025. The band has also been criticized for their support of Palestinian terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah, which they displayed at Coachella. The group's manager Daniel Lambert said they have received 'severe' death threats after Coachella. Kneecap has apologized to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox, saying they 'never intended to cause you hurt'. The band has also faced criticism from Tory leader Kemi Badenoch, who has called for them to face prosecution. The UK Government has condemned threatening remarks made towards any individual, and all reports of intimidation, harassment and threats are taken extremely seriously. Kneecap has been dropped from the Eden Sessions, a series of concerts held at the Eden Project in Cornwall this summer. The band's visas are understood to no longer be valid, and they are in the process of securing a new sponsor ahead of its sellout October tour in North America.
