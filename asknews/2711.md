**EU Climate Advisors Warn of Weak Climate Goal for 2040**
The European Union's (EU) climate advisors are warning that a weak climate goal for 2040 will make it difficult for the EU to achieve its goal of climate neutrality by 2050. The EU's climate goal for 2040 is currently being negotiated, and some powerful countries are pushing to lower the ambition level. Ottmar Edenhofer, chairman of the EU's climate council, says that a low goal will 'take the wind out of the transition' and make it difficult to reach the 2050 goal. The EU's climate commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, argues that flexibility is needed, including the possibility of buying climate credits from poor countries. However, this is seen as a watering down of the EU's climate goals. Jette Bredahl Jacobsen, a Danish economist and member of the EU's climate council, warns that buying climate credits will make the transition more expensive and inefficient. She also points out that the EU has a historical responsibility for climate pollution and should not lower its ambitions. The use of climate credits has also been criticized for being unreliable and even fraudulent. The EU has previously allowed companies to buy climate credits from other countries, but this has caused problems. The UN is currently working on a new set of rules to address these issues. Minister Lars Aagaard (M) wants the EU to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 90% in 2040, but will not comment on whether foreign credits should be included.

**New Energy Efficiency Requirements for Property Owners when Selling or Renting**
As of January 1, 2030, only properties that meet the minimum energy efficiency class E can be sold or newly rented. By 2033, the minimum standard will be raised to class D. This is part of the new European building directive, which aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector. According to the Spanish Real Decreto 390/2021, the implementation of this directive has been regulated, introducing an updated method for issuing energy certificates and expanding the requirements for energy efficiency for both new and existing buildings. Property owners must ensure that their property meets the required minimum standards for energy efficiency before it can be sold or rented. This particularly affects older houses that are often not well-insulated or have outdated heating systems. The new regulations will initially require investments, but will ultimately increase the value of the property in the long term. To prove compliance with the efficiency class, a current energy certificate is mandatory. Only authorized professionals such as architects, engineers, and specialized technicians can issue the energy certificate. The certificate must be presented when selling or renting the property. The energy efficiency class of the accommodation must also be clearly stated in the marketing, such as on online platforms. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in fines and the property cannot be legally rented. Additionally, the reform of the Balearic Tourism Law in 2022 brought comprehensive changes to make tourism more sustainable, reduce environmental impact, and improve living conditions on the island. By May 1, 2026, heating systems that run on heating oil or gas must be replaced with more environmentally friendly alternatives. Vacation rentals are required to install water-saving devices such as double-flush toilets and flow restrictors on water faucets. The deadline for this was May 1, 2024. The provision of single-use toilet articles is only allowed if they are provided on request and in environmentally friendly packaging.

**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**Britain to get defence boost to send message to Moscow  --  and possibly Trump**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with Starmer saying 'we have to recognise the world has changed' and 'with greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.' The Government will accept all 62 recommendations made in the strategic defence review, including building new nuclear-powered attack submarines and creating an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defence Secretary John Healey said the changes would send 'a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and even 3% falls short of what some leaders in NATO think is needed to deter Russia from future attacks on its neighbors.

**UK PM: We can't ignore Russian threat**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that Britain cannot ignore the threat posed by Russia, citing the conflict in Ukraine as an example. The UK will increase military spending to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. This move is part of a broader effort to deter Russia and bolster Europe's defenses. NATO chief Mark Rutte is expected to discuss a commitment to spend at least 3.5 percent of GDP on defense at an upcoming meeting. Robert Jenrick, a Conservative Party spokesman, called for the government to be more ambitious and raise spending to 3 percent of national income by 2029, stating, 'We think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation.'

**EU on Track to Meet 55% Emissions Reduction Goal by 2030**
The European Union is close to achieving its ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. According to the European Commission, the current reduction is at 54%, which is a promising result. This is a significant achievement, especially considering that the EU is one of the regions that is warming the fastest. The consequences of climate change are already being felt, with extreme heatwaves, frequent floods, and wildfires becoming a regular occurrence. However, there is a sense of hope, as many EU member states have taken concrete steps to accelerate the energy transition. The EU has already reduced emissions by 37% since 1990, and in 2023, there was an additional 8% reduction. Some countries, such as Belgium, Estonia, and Poland, are still lagging behind in defining their plans, while others are pushing for a slower pace on environmental regulations due to geopolitical tensions, energy price increases, and protectionism. The European Commission, however, remains committed to its goal and is now aiming for a 90% reduction in emissions by 2040, with some flexibility in the tools used, such as carbon credits.

**EU Adopts White Book of Security: A New Era for European Defense?**
European politicians have adopted the White Book of Security, which includes two sections on cooperation between Ukraine and the EU, including the creation of a joint military-industrial complex and the accumulation of 800 billion euros by 2030 for defense purposes. However, according to political scientist Oleksiy Buriachenko, the EU's bureaucratic nature is a significant obstacle. Buriachenko noted that the EU was not created as a security union, but rather as an economically horizontal confederation. He emphasized that the EU should not try to solve all of Ukraine's security and arms supply issues, as this is not its purpose. Instead, the EU should focus on its own security, which should be guaranteed by the US through NATO. Buriachenko believes that the EU has finally realized that a reset in relations with the US is inevitable. He warned that the EU's attempt to scale up arms production will require significant state orders, which may come at the expense of other programs, such as migrant support or social welfare. 'This is money that needs to be taken from somewhere,' Buriachenko said. 'For example, from programs supporting migrants, social or humanitarian spheres. If this is done, right-wing and ultra-right forces will immediately start playing on the fact that Russia is not their threat.' Buriachenko emphasized that Ukraine and Europe need to find a common system of coordinates and come to a realization that only together can they guarantee their own security without a third player. He suggested that the 'Coalition of the Willing' format, which includes countries such as the UK, Norway, and Turkey, could become a united Europe, and NATO could transform into the EU's army.

**2026 Budget to Focus on Supporting Families and Countering War Effects**
The 2026 budget will focus on supporting families with children, youth, and retirees, according to Minister for Economy Márton Nagy. The budget aims to counter the negative effects of the war in Hungary's neighborhood and ensure the security of every Hungarian family, allowing them to take another step forward. Key measures for next year include 'Europe's largest family tax relief program', doubling the family allowance for children and the income tax exemption for mothers of two children under 40 years old. Additionally, the budget will maintain the reduction of ancillary costs, guarantee the payment of the 13th month's pension, protect jobs, and create new ones. The budget for 2026 is also a budget for wage increases, with expected GDP growth of 4.1%, an inflation rate of 3.6%, and a deficit of 3.7% of GDP. The minister emphasized that the main question for 2026 is to prevent the accelerated EU membership of Ukraine, which would also threaten the planned tax relief. He also mentioned that the minimum wage will increase by 13% in January 2026 and that six months of allowances for law enforcement and defense will be included in the budget. The government is working to make the Hungarian economy grow as quickly as possible; price increases will be fought, and margin reductions have been introduced. Banks, insurance companies, and telecommunications companies have voluntarily limited the prices of services. Furthermore, negotiations have been initiated to reduce the prices of non-subsidized medicines.

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**Avoid Paying the Mandatory Waste Fee in 2025: Deadline is Tomorrow**
The deadline to apply for a 100% reduction in the waste management fee is tomorrow, April 15th. To be eligible, individuals must be in a situation of economic vulnerability and be beneficiaries of the Ingreso Mínimo Vital (Minimum Vital Income) or Renta Mínima de Inserción (Minimum Insertion Income). Each municipality is responsible for determining which individuals are exempt from paying the fee. The European Union has set targets for waste recycling, including recycling 55% of waste by 2025 and 65% by 2035. The Spanish government has not yet implemented the system of deposit, return, and refund for bottles, which is expected to be introduced in two years. According to the EU, member states must make efforts to recycle 70% of ferrous metals and glass waste, 65% of packaging, 75% of paper and cardboard, 50% of plastic and aluminum waste, and 25% of wood waste by 2025.

**Merz appears on Miosga's talk show, discusses recent interview and coalition agreement**
Friedrich Merz, the likely next Chancellor, appeared on Caren Miosga's talk show, where he was questioned about his recent interview in Bild am Sonntag, in which he expressed skepticism about a minimum wage of 15 euros by 2026 and a tax cut for small and medium-sized incomes. Merz responded calmly, stating that these measures were not agreed upon. Miosga also brought up Merz's low personal approval ratings and the fact that his party's popularity has decreased since winning the election. Merz attributed this to his own mistakes, including his decision to vote with the AfD and his efforts to win over the Greens. He also expressed his willingness to show emotion as Chancellor, which may not be well-received by all in his party. Merz was generally calm and composed during the interview, only becoming slightly defensive when discussing the criticism of the coalition agreement from the business community. He stated that the agreement's economic package could be improved, but overall, he was satisfied with the coalition's decisions. Merz also discussed the topic of migration, stating that the coalition agreement includes a provision for the closure of the borders, and that other EU countries do not need to take back refugees. He refused to provide a specific number for the number of refugees that Germany can accommodate. Merz also discussed the topic of pensions, stating that the current pension level is only guaranteed until 2031, after which it will need to be adjusted. He also mentioned the need for reforms in the areas of health and care. Overall, Merz appeared to be in a conciliatory mood during the interview, even when discussing his potential rival, Markus Söder.

**Merz: Income Tax Reduction 'Not Fixed', New Minimum Wage 'Not as Agreed'**
Friedrich Merz, the likely next German Chancellor, has cast doubt on the planned reduction of income tax for small and medium incomes. 'No, it's not fixed', Merz said to BILD am SONNTAG. 'We would have liked to have agreed on this in the coalition with the Social Democrats from the start. There was a disagreement about it, so we left it open.' Merz added that the income tax reduction is still planned, but only if the public budget allows it. Merz also criticized the lack of necessary reforms in the past 30 years, including the pension insurance, health insurance, and care insurance. He mentioned that the coalition agreement includes a 'rent guarantee' that will only be valid until 2031. Merz also mentioned that the coalition will prioritize a better border control, more deportations, and the abolition of the Supply Chain Act. However, the coalition agreement still needs to be signed by the CDU, CSU, and SPD, and the internal approval process is ongoing.

**Livre Proposes 1 Billion Euros for Public Housing and 1,250 Euros Minimum Wage by 2029**
The Livre party proposes creating a fund to finance public housing policies, allocating 1 billion euros annually for public housing and aiming to reach 600,000 homes by 2040. They also propose increasing the National Minimum Wage to 1,250 euros by 2029 and introducing a 'herança social' (social inheritance) system, where each child born in Portugal would receive a sum of money, around 5,000 euros, when they turn 18, based on their parents' income. The fund would be financed through taxes on corporate profits, increased taxation on high-value properties, and Orçamento do Estado funds. The party also proposes to revoke the current guarantee for the purchase of the first home and to introduce a 'Ajuda de Casa' program, which would finance up to 30% of the market value of the property through a capital own loan. 'To prevent incentives for real estate speculation, the cost of housing should not exceed the average value per square meter in the corresponding municipality and the type of property should be in line with the composition of the family unit,' the proposal reads.

**Key Points in the Coalition Agreement: From Taxes to Corona**
The new coalition government plans to abolish the German Supply Chain Act and replace it with the EU Supply Chain Directive with minimal bureaucracy. The government aims to reduce the number of federal employees by 8% in four years, except for security agencies. The number of federal representatives will be halved, and €1 billion will be saved through reduced funding for international organizations. Municipalities with excessive debt will receive €250 million per year from the federal government to help with debt relief. The government will also maintain the policy of rejecting asylum applications at the EU's external borders. The coalition plans to reverse the accelerated naturalization policy for highly integrated immigrants, and the waiting period for regular naturalization will remain at five years. Refugees with limited protection status will be prohibited from bringing family members to Germany for two years. The government will also abolish the heating law and introduce a new building energy law that is 'more open to technology, flexible, and simple.' Energy-intensive companies will be exempt from the industrial electricity price. The retirement age will be set at 48% by 2031, and the costs will be covered by the federal budget. The mother's pension will be increased to three pension points for all, regardless of the birth year of the children, and will be funded by the tax office. The conditions for the current basic income guarantee will be tightened, including participation obligations in the sense of the principle of 'support and encourage.' In extreme cases, a 'complete benefit withdrawal' may be possible if people repeatedly refuse suitable work. The benefit will be renamed 'basic security for job seekers.' The government plans to introduce a weekly framework for working hours instead of the traditional eight-hour day. A minimum wage of €15 per hour is expected for next year. The BAföG will be increased next year, and the living costs allowance for students who no longer live with their parents will be increased from €380 to €440 per month. The coalition plans to introduce a nationwide obligation for language and development tests for four-year-olds due to poor reading, writing, and math skills. The government wants to introduce a 'voluntary-based military service model' for the Bundeswehr, including a military census and military surveillance. A National Security Council will be established to gather information on crisis situations and enable faster decision-making. Telecommunications providers will be required to store IP addresses for possible investigations for three months. The coalition plans to increase the child benefit, both the minimum and maximum rates, and to create a statutory entitlement to maternity protection for self-employed women who give birth to a child. In small shops, customers will be able to pay without cash, with at least one digital payment option available. The obligation to issue cash receipts will be abolished. The legalization of cannabis for adults will be reviewed, but the outcome is open. The government will establish an inquiry committee to review the state's measures against the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Minimum Vital Income: What You Need to Know**
The Minimum Vital Income (IMV) is a Social Security benefit that guarantees a minimum income to those who are economically vulnerable. According to the Ministry of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration, the IMV aims to 'prevent the risk of poverty and social exclusion of people who live alone or are part of a household and lack economic resources to cover their basic needs.' In February, the IMV reached 688,007 households, including 119,112 single-parent households, with 2,090,000 people living in them, 867,256 of whom are minors. The average monthly benefit is 511.2 euros per household, but the amount varies depending on the number of people in the household and if any member has a disability. For an individual beneficiary, the guaranteed income is 7,905.72 euros per year, or 658.81 euros per month. For a household, the guaranteed income increases by 30% for each additional member up to a maximum of five, so the guaranteed income of a household with five or more members is 17,392.68 euros per year, or 1,449.39 euros per month. Beneficiaries of the IMV have rights and obligations, including presenting their tax return. The Social Security department reminds that both beneficiaries and household members must present their tax return, regardless of their income level. 'The IMV is an exempt income and most beneficiaries will not have to include it in their tax return, but they must present one,' they say. The amounts that must be declared as income from work will be those that exceed 12,600 euros (1.5 times the Public Indicator of Multiple Effects Rent, IPREM). If, in addition to the IMV, other aids to vulnerable groups such as the minimum income for insertion, guaranteed rents, and similar aids from autonomous communities and municipalities are received, only the excess must be declared and taxed.

**EU Reforms Driving License Rules to Improve Road Safety**
The European Union has agreed to introduce a digital driving license, accessible on a smartphone, by the end of 2030. The new rules also include a mandatory medical examination for drivers over 65 years old, or an auto-evaluation system, depending on the country. A two-year probationary period will be introduced for new drivers, with stricter rules and increased sanctions for serious offenses, such as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The minimum age for obtaining a heavy goods vehicle license will be lowered from 21 to 18 years old, and for bus drivers from 24 to 21 years old, provided they have a professional aptitude certificate. Additionally, the suspension of a driver's license will now be valid across the entire EU, not just in the country where the offense occurred. This reform aims to improve road safety and combat the impunity of drivers responsible for serious accidents, as stated by Matteo Ricci, European deputy and rapporteur of the text, 'By introducing clearer and more opportune criteria for the suspension of driving privileges in the event of serious offenses, this measure protects not only responsible drivers, but also the entire population.'

**PSC and Comuns' proposals on guaranteed income overcome total amendments in Parliament**
The proposals of law from the PSC and the Comuns on the guaranteed income have overcome the total amendments in the Parliament. The PSC's Mónica Ríos said, 'Our group works for social justice' and thanked the Comuns for their willingness to work together. The two proposals will be processed in a joint committee. The socialist initiative proposes a new redaction of the law to make it 'clearer and easier to interpret and apply'. It also aligns with some of the improvements suggested by the 2023 Commission on Govern of the Guaranteed Income of Citizenship. The text proposes that the income be complementary with other aids, such as housing benefits and the minimum vital income, and its total compatibility with work incomes, and creates also a complementary benefit of fifty euros per children under 18 years. Additionally, the text proposes measures to modernize and speed up the administrative processing of the benefit, incorporates a periodic review of the amount of the aid and establishes preventive and corrective measures for possible abuses. Nuria Lozano, from the Comuns, defended that the guaranteed income has to be 'the instrument' to eradicate poverty, especially child poverty. She also defended the 'coexistence' with the minimum vital income. The initiative of the group of Jéssica Albiach also wants to modify the 2017 law, and like the PSC's, proposes the compatibility of the guaranteed income with the perception of other aids and the elimination of administrative burdens. On the other hand, it proposes introducing a complementary economic benefit of 200 euros per child, and adds another for single-parent families or with members in a situation of disability of a complementary amount of 22% and another to face expenses derived from the cost of housing. In contrast, Laure Vega, from the CUP, argued that they have presented a total amendment to reject the 'patchwork policy' and defended a universal basic income.

**Union and SPD Agree on Key Points in Coalition Negotiations**
The Union and SPD have agreed on several key points in their coalition negotiations. The new citizenship law will retain the current rules, including shortened waiting periods for naturalization and the 'Doppelpass' for non-EU citizens. Rejections at the border will be allowed, but only in consultation with neighboring countries, and only where there are stationary border controls. The coalition also plans to reform the income tax, with a focus on relieving the 'breite Mittelschicht' (broad middle class). Zuschläge for overtime work will be made tax-free, and the minimum wage will be set by an independent commission, which will take into account both tariff developments and 60% of the median gross wage of full-time employees. The goal is to reach a minimum wage of 15 euros by 2026. The Bürgergeld system will be overhauled, with a focus on a basic security for job seekers. Friedrich Merz said, 'We will redesign the current Bürgergeld system to a basic security for job seekers.' The Umsatzsteuer for food in the gastronomy sector will be reduced to 7% permanently. The Stromsteuer will be reduced to the EU minimum, resulting in a minimum of 5 cents per kilowatt hour in savings. The Übertragungsnetzentgelte will be halved. A new 'Kaufanreiz' (purchase incentive) will be introduced to boost the sale of electric cars. The Agrardiesel-Vergünstigungen (agricultural diesel subsidies) will be reinstated. The Deutschlandticket (Germany ticket) for buses and trains will be continued beyond the end of the year.

**Rivalutazione pensioni minime 2025: pochi euro in più**
The Italian Constitutional Court has confirmed the legitimacy of the measures introduced in the 2023 Budget Law, which provide for a differentiated increase in pensions. According to the Court, the mechanism of reduction of the perequation for higher pensions is not unreasonable, as it protects the lowest pensions. The increase in the minimum pension in 2025 will be +2.2%, resulting in an increase of 13.27 euros, bringing the total amount to 616.67 euros per month. The increase will be applied to the monthly amount in payment, determined by the existing legislation before the entry into force of Law n. 197/2022. The benefit is independent of the pensioner's income and applies to both integrated and non-integrated pensions within the established threshold. The government may adopt further interventions on pensions, provided that the full protection of the lowest pensions is guaranteed.
