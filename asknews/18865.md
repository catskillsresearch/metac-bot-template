**Russia Demands Ukraine Withdraw Troops Before Complete Ceasefire**
Russia has requested that Ukraine withdraw its troops from the four oblasts (administrative regions) that Moscow claims as annexed before any complete ceasefire, according to a Russian memorandum transmitted to Kiev on Monday (2) and published by Russian news agencies. The document, delivered to Ukraine during negotiations in Istanbul, demands the 'total withdrawal' of Ukrainian troops from the partially occupied oblasts of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east, as well as Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south, before the 'implementation of a 30-day ceasefire'. The memorandum, which also outlines Russia's demands for the end of the conflict in Ukraine, calls for the 'international legal recognition' of these oblasts and the Crimean Peninsula, annexed in 2014, as Russian territories. It also demands the lifting of economic sanctions and that Ukraine renounce its demand for Russian reparations, which launched an offensive against its neighbor in February 2022. The document mentions Ukraine's 'neutrality' and requests that it abandon its aspiration to join NATO, while limiting the size of the Ukrainian army. It also calls for an end to Western arms deliveries to Kiev and the end of intelligence sharing, as well as a ban on the deployment of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Furthermore, the document requests that Ukraine release 'political prisoners, both military and civilian, and commit to respecting the rights, freedoms, and interests of Russian speakers' in its territory. Echoing Moscow's declared desire to 'denazify' its neighbor, the document foresees the dissolution of 'Ukrainian nationalist groups' within the Armed Forces. These demands have been rejected by Ukraine on several occasions in the past.

**Russia Demands Ukraine Withdraw Troops Before Comprehensive Ceasefire**
Russia has demanded that Ukraine withdraw its troops from four regions it has annexed before a comprehensive ceasefire can be implemented. According to a Russian memo sent to Kiev on Monday and published by Russian news agencies, Moscow is calling for a 'complete withdrawal' of Ukrainian forces from the partially occupied regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east, and from the regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south, before a 30-day ceasefire can be implemented. 'No ceasefire can be implemented without the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the occupied territories,' the memo stated. Russia's demand has been met with skepticism by Ukraine, which has accused Russia of attempting to dictate the terms of a ceasefire.

**Russian Memorandum on Ukraine Conflict Proposes Two Ceasefire Options**
The Russian government has released a full text of a memorandum on the Ukraine conflict, proposing two options for a ceasefire. The first option involves the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions. The second option includes a ban on the redeployment of troops, an end to mobilization, and a halt to foreign military aid to Ukraine, followed by demobilization and the exclusion of foreign military presence. According to the memorandum, these measures would help to establish a lasting peace in Ukraine. As stated in the document, 'the implementation of these measures will create a solid foundation for the establishment of a lasting peace in Ukraine, based on the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the non-use of force.'

**Russian and Ukrainian Officials Meet in Istanbul for New Talks on Conflict**
Russian and Ukrainian officials are set to meet in Istanbul on Monday for new direct talks on the conflict sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The two sides will present their 'vision' for a resolution to the conflict, a prospect that seems distant. Here are their official positions before this meeting, mediated by Turkey. Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained maximalist demands since the invasion began. He insists that the resolution process must address the 'deep-seated' causes of the conflict, primarily Ukraine's desire to join NATO, which Moscow considers an existential threat to its borders. Russia claims the annexation of four regions in southern and eastern Ukraine (Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia) and the Crimean Peninsula, annexed in 2014. Putin has justified the February 2022 offensive as a means to 'protect' Russian-speaking populations in eastern Ukraine and 'denazify' a country he accuses of being under the control of hostile Western powers. Moscow demands an end to Western arms deliveries and the removal of Ukrainian ultranationalist groups. Putin has also suggested a 'transitional administration' for Ukraine under the auspices of the UN, which would involve the departure of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky is not considered legitimate by Putin, who argues that his five-year term expired in May 2024, despite the impossibility of holding elections due to the war. In Ukraine, the question of territorial concessions is highly divisive, with the population having made enormous human sacrifices and suffered significant material destruction since 2014 to preserve its established borders. Zelensky has suggested possible 'exchanges' of territories with Moscow regarding areas held by Kyiv in the Russian region of Kursk, but Ukrainian forces were eventually pushed out by Russia in late April. The question remains as to what concessions might be possible between Kyiv and Moscow, as Ukraine continues to demand the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian troops from its territory. This includes the contentious issue of Crimea. Zelensky publicly supports the idea that Kyiv will not give up this Ukrainian-majority Russian-speaking peninsula, annexed by Moscow in 2014, as it is explicitly stated in the Ukrainian Constitution that it is part of Ukraine's territory. More broadly, Zelensky calls on his allies to provide 'security guarantees' to Ukraine to deter Russia from invading again after a peace agreement is reached. In this context, Kyiv's main request is to join NATO, a possibility categorically rejected by Moscow and also excluded by US President Donald Trump. As an alternative, Ukraine has discussed with Europeans the creation of a Western military contingent that could be deployed in the country, with the support of NATO, in the event of a peace agreement. This option is also firmly rejected by Moscow. To initiate a diplomatic process to resolve the conflict, Kyiv has been calling for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire for several weeks, as requested by the Trump administration and Europeans. Putin has consistently rejected Kyiv's and its allies' demands for a ceasefire, believing that it would allow Ukrainian forces, struggling on the front, to rearm with Western support.

**Ukraine Publishes Peace Proposals, Including Ceasefire and Prisoner Exchange**
Ukraine has published its peace proposals, which include a ceasefire for at least 30 days, monitored by third-party countries under US leadership. The proposals also include a prisoner exchange based on the 'everyone for everyone' principle. The text does not impose any restrictions on the number of troops or their deployment, and allows for the presence of foreign troops on Ukrainian territory. The document suggests that only territorial issues should be discussed after a complete ceasefire. The international community does not recognize Russia's jurisdiction over the territories Ukraine lost since 2014. Ukraine also proposes to gradually lift sanctions on Russia, but only after full compensation is paid. The meeting between the two leaders is seen as a condition for the final peace agreement. Russia has not yet published its proposals. The Russian Foreign Ministry has emphasized Ukraine's neutrality and its exclusion from international organizations, as well as the recognition of the Russian language. Russia also insists on the recognition of Moscow's control over the annexed Crimea and the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions. The talks between the two delegations are scheduled to take place in Istanbul on June 2. Ukraine has strengthened its position by launching drone attacks on Russian airbases on June 1. Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's defense minister, said, 'We are ready to negotiate, but we will not compromise on our principles.' Marko Rubio, a US senator, said, 'We will continue to negotiate until a lasting peace is achieved.' The prospects for progress in the talks are uncertain, with experts saying that the two sides are still far apart.

**Ukraine's Peace Proposals: A Path to Ending the Conflict**
Reuters has obtained the full text of Ukraine's peace proposals, which will be presented to Russia in talks in Istanbul on June 2. The document includes five sections: 'Key principles of the agreement and negotiation process', 'Next step - ceasefire and meeting of leaders', 'Ceasefire', 'Measures to build trust', and 'Meeting of leaders'. The first section outlines the principles of negotiations, including a full and unconditional ceasefire on land, sea, and air for at least 30 days, with monitoring by the US and third countries. The document also proposes a prisoner exchange in the format 'all for all'. Ukraine is willing to give up its neutrality and allow the country to join the EU and NATO, without restrictions on the size and deployment of its army, and with the presence of foreign troops on its territory. Territorial issues will only be discussed after a complete ceasefire. The international community will not recognize Russian jurisdiction over Ukrainian territories lost since February 2014. Ukraine also proposes a phased lifting of sanctions on Russia, with the possibility of their reinstatement, and the freezing of Russian sovereign assets until full repayment of reparations. A meeting of leaders is seen as a condition for agreeing on key points of a final peace settlement. Russia has not disclosed its own proposals, but has mentioned Ukraine's neutrality and non-alignment, as well as the repeal of laws on the use of the Russian language. Russia also insists on recognition of its control over annexed Crimea and occupied territories in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions. Talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations are scheduled for June 2 in Istanbul. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that Ukraine will participate in the meeting. The Russian delegation has reportedly arrived in Turkey for the talks.

**Rogov Reports Opening of New Front Line in Zaporizhzhia Region**
The liberation of the villages of Zelenoe Pole and Novopol in the western part of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) will allow for the opening of a new front line in the liberation of the occupied part of the Zaporizhzhia region, said Vladimir Rogov, chairman of the commission of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation on issues of sovereignty and co-chair of the coordination council on the integration of new regions. 'The liberation of Zelenoe Pole and Novopol is an important tactical success of our army, which will allow us to create a foothold for the advance and liberation of the northern part of the Zaporizhzhia region, which is still occupied by Ukrainian forces,' Rogov said. According to him, if previously Russian forces advanced in the Zaporizhzhia region only from the south, now a new front line opens up from the east. 'This will allow us to significantly increase the pressure on the Ukrainian forces in the direction of Gulyaypole,' Rogov said. The Zaporizhzhia region is a Russian region located in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. It became part of Russia after the referendum in September 2022. Kiev does not recognize the results of the referendum and continues to shell the territory. Currently, more than 70% of the Zaporizhzhia region is under Russian control, while the rest, including the regional center, the city of Zaporizhzhia, is held by Ukrainian forces. Since March 2023, the administrative center of the region has been temporarily located in the city of Melitopol.

**Russia's Broader Territorial Ambitions in Ukraine Exceed Four Annexed Regions**
Russia continues to demonstrate broad territorial ambitions towards Ukraine, exceeding the four already illegally annexed regions. According to a report by the Institute for the Study of War, the Kremlin plans to annex at least five more Ukrainian regions, including Dnepropetrovsk, Sumy, Kharkov, Odessa, and Nikolaev. These plans are being discussed in the Kremlin, despite Russia still not having full control over the regions that were formally annexed in 2022, including Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. 'Public statements by Russian officials continue to demonstrate that Russia has broader territorial goals in Ukraine beyond the four regions that Russia has illegally declared annexed,' the ISW report states. One key indicator of these ambitions was a statement by the head of the Russian State Duma's Committee on Defense, Andrei Kartapolov. On May 31, he publicly stated that Ukraine risks losing major regional centers if it does not agree to a peaceful settlement. He mentioned Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, Sumy, Kharkov, Odessa, and Nikolaev. 'Kartapolov's statements demonstrate that Russia continues to count on a protracted war, in which gradual advances on the battlefield can eventually translate into political gains. Vladimir Putin is still acting in the 'theory of creeping victory,' which involves occupying Ukrainian territories in small steps, without sudden breakthroughs, but with gradual shifts in the front line,' the analysts added. Previously, experts reported that Russia lacks the strength to capture Sumy, but may attempt to do so. According to Russian representatives, control over the city would allegedly allow them to prevent Ukrainian artillery and drone attacks on Russian territory.

**Russia's Broader Territorial Ambitions in Ukraine: A Threat to the Region**
Russia continues to demonstrate broad territorial ambitions towards Ukraine, extending far beyond the four already illegally annexed regions. According to a report by the Institute for the Study of War, the Kremlin plans to annex at least five more Ukrainian regions, including Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, Kharkiv, Odessa, and Mykolaiv. These plans are being discussed in the Kremlin despite Russia still not having full control over the regions that were formally annexed in 2022, including Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.

**ISW Analyzes Russian Plans to Expand Foothold Near Liman**
Analysts from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) have identified possible plans by Russian forces to advance around the Liman region in Donetsk Oblast. According to ISW, Russian forces have recently made advances to the southeast of New (west of Novoluhivka), and Ukrainian military analyst Konstantin Mashovets stated on March 31 that Russian forces had advanced to the southern outskirts of Katerynivka (northwest of Novoluhivka). 'It appears that Russian forces are using a significant advantage in manpower to advance in this area.' Additionally, the occupiers may be attempting to combine these footholds to create a stable salient to support attacks to the southeast of Bovvaya. The Russian military command may try to outflank Ukrainian defenses in these settlements, forcing Ukrainian forces to retreat and allowing Russian forces to advance east of Bovvaya and into its territory in the coming months. They may try to advance on Karlivka from the side of New and on Drobysheve from the side of Koldozy, trying to create defensible positions on the Karlivka-Shandrigolove-Drobysheve line (on the eastern bank of the Oskil River). Russian forces may try to use such progress along the Oskil River to challenge Ukrainian positions in Liman from the northeast. At the same time, they may try to activate offensive actions near Tor (east of Liman) to press on Liman from the east. Russian forces are trying to capture the last 1% of Luhansk Oblast (approximately 266 square kilometers) since the end of November 2024. For the first time, Russian forces captured the entire Luhansk Oblast on July 3, 2022, but later Ukrainian forces pushed the Russian army back. Experts note that the Kremlin likely wants to use the repeated capture and retention of Luhansk Oblast to gain leverage during negotiations on a ceasefire and future peace talks. Key ISW conclusions for April 1: Russian forces continue to shell Ukrainian energy infrastructure amid ongoing negotiations on the details of the ceasefire agreement and strikes on energy infrastructure, suggesting that Russia may be using ambiguous or incomplete ceasefire conditions to attack Ukrainian energy infrastructure with artillery of shorter range, but not with longer-range cruise missiles or FPV drones. High-ranking Russian officials continue to repeat Russia's demands regarding the removal of 'root causes' of the war in Ukraine as a precondition for signing a peace agreement - a reference to Russia's initial war demands that directly contradict US President Donald Trump's goal of achieving a lasting peace in Ukraine. Russian forces are expanding their foothold northeast of Liman as part of mutually reinforcing efforts to create conditions for the capture of Bovvaya and Liman in the coming months. Russian forces may use their expanded foothold northeast of Liman to support the capture of Bovvaya or Liman in the coming months. Russian forces may also use their foothold northeast of Liman to capture the remaining 1% of Luhansk Oblast under Ukrainian control and complete Russia's long-standing goal of capturing the entire Luhansk Oblast. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on April 1 to increase the official salaries of Russian governors from January 2026, aligning them with the salaries of Russian vice-premiers. Recently, Russian forces have advanced in Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts, as well as on the Liman, Pokrovsk, and Kurovsk directions.

**TEXT-Ukraine peace deal proposals set out by US at talks in Paris**
US envoy Steve Witkoff presented a set of proposals to end Russia's war in Ukraine at talks in Paris on April 17. The proposals include a permanent ceasefire, a robust security guarantee for Ukraine, and recognition of Russian control over certain territories. The US would provide de jure recognition of Russian control over Crimea and de facto recognition of Russian control over parts of Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Kherson. Ukraine would regain control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and the Kakhovka Dam, as well as territory in Kharkiv Oblast. The US and Ukraine would also implement economic cooperation and remove sanctions on Russia. According to the proposals, Ukraine would not seek to join NATO, but could pursue EU membership.

**Kremlin Demands Full Control Over Occupied Regions in Ukraine**
The US is reportedly planning to freeze the front lines to end the Ukraine war, but Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskow says Russia wants to fully control the occupied regions. According to Axios, the US plan would give Russia its current gains, including the annexed Crimea, as well as most of the Luhansk Oblast, large parts of Donetsk, and significant parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. However, the Kremlin is not satisfied with this proposal. Peskow stated, 'There are four regions that are in our constitution. The Ukrainian army must lay down its arms and withdraw. If it does this, the military operations will be immediately stopped.' These regions include Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, which Russia has partially occupied. Peskow emphasized, 'These regions are all four in our constitution as an integral part of Russia.' Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and declared the four Ukrainian regions as its own in 2022 after disputed referendums. However, Russia does not fully control any of the regions except Crimea. Peskow asked, 'What prevents Ukraine from militarily withdrawing from these four regions and stopping the fight?' The Kremlin has also agreed with a statement by US President Donald Trump that Ukraine lost Crimea years ago. Peskow said, 'This is completely in line with our understanding, which we have been saying for a long time.' Trump wrote on his online platform Truth Social that Crimea has been 'lost for years' and that Ukraine's reclamation of it is 'no longer even discussed.'

**France and UK Open to Ukrainian Territory Losses in Exchange for Security Guarantees**
According to The Wall Street Journal, France and the UK are open to a scenario where Ukraine loses territories de facto in exchange for guarantees of security. This model is reminiscent of the Korean War ceasefire in 1953. The proposal to officially recognize Russia's control over Crimea and four other occupied regions as de facto has caused concern in both Kyiv and European allies. The US is waiting for Ukraine's response to the 'final offer' made by Trump, which includes: de jure recognition of US control over Crimea; de facto recognition of Russia's occupation of parts of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions; a promise that Ukraine will not join NATO, but can join the European Union; lifting of sanctions against Russia since 2014; and expanded economic cooperation with the US in the energy and industrial sectors. 'We are not ready to recognize the annexation of Crimea as a fait accompli,' said a spokesperson for the Ukrainian government.

**UK and France Consider Territory Exchange for Security Guarantees**
According to a person familiar with the negotiations, British and French officials are open to a scenario where Ukraine accepts the current control lines in exchange for security guarantees and economic support. However, France and the UK would prefer an agreement that only acknowledges the de facto control of territories seized by Russia in Ukraine, similar to the ceasefire that ended the Korean War. The US had previously proposed a seven-point plan to resolve the conflict, which includes de facto recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, but this would only be recognized by the US. A ceasefire would freeze the front line, allowing Putin to maintain control over most of the occupied territories, including Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions. However, these territories would not be recognized by Russia. Additionally, control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant would be transferred to the US. As one person said, 'It was a great day' for Ukraine, but the details of the plan are still unclear.

**UK and France Open to Ukraine Recognizing Loss of Territories to Russia**
According to the Wall Street Journal, British and French officials are open to the scenario where Ukraine recognizes the loss of territories to Russia. The officials stated, 'British and French officials are open to the scenario in which Ukraine agrees to lose control over some territories... in exchange for security guarantees and economic support.' The UK and France prefer a deal where Ukraine recognizes the loss of territories 'de facto' rather than 'de jure'. This comes after the US reportedly told Ukraine that it expects concessions, including Ukraine's withdrawal from NATO, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis. The US may also recognize Crimea as Russian and offer to take control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The referendums on joining Russia in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions were held on September 23-27, 2022, with over 90% of voters in each region supporting the move. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the agreements on September 30, 2022, and has repeatedly stated that the issue of Crimea is closed.

**Ukraine Considers Giving Up 20% of Territory in Peace Agreement**
Ukraine is reportedly willing to give up 20% of its territory in a peace agreement, but only if it is considered a 'de facto' recognition of Russian occupation, not a 'de jure' one. According to The New York Post, citing sources, Ukraine is concerned about the terms of the agreement, particularly the role of European forces in the country. A high-ranking official from the White House explained, 'De facto means we acknowledge that the Russians have occupied this land, but we don't say that [Ukraine] is going to give it up forever... De jure means we acknowledge that [the Russians] are taking this land, and we'll never see it again.' The proposal may also include the recognition of the US of Ukrainian Crimea as Russian territory. The details of the plan are still unclear, and both Ukraine and Russia are reviewing the possible conditions and denying reports that they are likely to sign an agreement to prevent the US from withdrawing from the negotiations. As of April 2025, Russia controls approximately 20% of Ukraine's territory, including almost the entire Luhansk region, about 75% of the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions, as well as Crimea, which was occupied in 2014.

According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the US administration has proposed a new peace plan for Ukraine, which includes de facto recognition of Crimea's annexation by Russia in 2014 and removing the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO. The US administration does not recognize Russian control over Donetsk, Luhansk, Herson, and Zaporijya, but does not require the withdrawal of Russian troops from these areas. As stated by the US administration, 'The plan is aimed at bringing an end to the conflict and providing a path forward for Ukraine.' However, it is unclear whether this plan will be accepted by Ukraine and other international parties.

**Kellogg: Russia Won't Give Up Control Over Occupied Ukrainian Territories**
US Special Representative for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, believes that the most challenging aspect of achieving a peace agreement will be the issue of occupied Ukrainian territories. According to him, Russia will not give up control over the occupied territories, but they are not legally part of Russia. 'We need to distinguish between de facto and de jure. De facto means they physically occupied the territory and won't leave it. But de jure, we can't say they fully annexed it. We still need to have these discussions,' Kellogg said on Fox News on March 26. He also stated that neither side's demands will be fully met, so it's essential to find an acceptable solution for both. 'We will likely see Ukraine losing some territory in the agreement, but it won't be a recognition of that loss,' Kellogg added. Since 2014, Russia has annexed Crimea and partially controls Donbas. In September 2022, Russia declared the annexation of Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions, but these territories are not fully under its control. Ukraine and the international community do not recognize these territories as Russian.

**US Experts Believe De Facto Recognition of Russian Control Over Ukrainian Territories Possible**
US experts believe that the US may de facto recognize the control of Russia over the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, as well as the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, during the Ukraine negotiations. According to Vladimir Zharkhin, a deputy director of the Institute of CIS Countries, 'there will be a certain agreement on de facto recognition.' However, he doubts that the US will officially recognize these territories as part of Russia. Zharkhin noted that 'in the international law context, countries like the Baltic states have had de facto recognition for over 50 years.' He also mentioned that the US has had diplomatic relations with the Baltic states despite not officially recognizing them as part of the Soviet Union. The expert believes that the US may follow a similar approach with Russia. The status of Crimea and the port of Odessa will also be discussed during the negotiations. Zharkhin expressed confidence that the question of control over the port of Odessa 'will definitely be raised' during the negotiations. However, he noted that the level of control may vary and is not a 'red line' for the US team. The expert emphasized that the negotiations will involve 'a lot of work, but not an easy one' and that the teams are working on it in Saudi Arabia. Another expert, Andrei Koshkin, believes that the US sees the need to recognize Crimea as part of Russia, but Russia will not agree to other conditions. He noted that much will become clear after the work of expert groups in Saudi Arabia. Koshkin also mentioned that Europe and Ukraine will 'always try to provoke' the process of negotiations, 'either by not going along with Russia or by simply disrupting the negotiations.' He emphasized that the negotiations will be 'difficult' and there is no certainty that 'everyone is in full readiness to satisfy Russia's requests.'
