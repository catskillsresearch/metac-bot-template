**Cuba's Judo Decline Continues: No Medals in Budapest 2025**
Cuba's decline in judo continues: no medals in Budapest 2025. The country's delegation failed to reach the podium in the World Championship in Budapest, Hungary, and finished in 24th place among 93 countries. This is the third consecutive World Championship without medals, a trend that worries the Cuban sports community. The country's top hopes for a medal were Andy Granda (+100 kg) and Jonathan Loynaz (+100 kg), but they were both eliminated in their first matches. Granda was defeated by Serbian Kokauri Ushangi in just over 30 seconds, while Loynaz lost to Chipriote Giannis Antoniou. Cuba's Deyanara Curbelo (78 kg) also fell to Japanese Mao Arai, the tournament's sub-champion. Japan dominated the medal count with 6 gold, 4 silver, and 4 bronze medals, while Russia, competing without a flag, won 3 titles. Cuba's result represents a sustained decline. In the last five World Championships, only Granda's gold medal in 2022 prevented a complete void. Since 1987, there has always been at least one medal in these events. The question remains: should a nation with such a rich tradition settle for these results? The answer is clear: no. A deep review, a renewed strategy, and political and sporting will are needed to recover the lost path.

However, the US is welcoming Canadian visitors, with states like Vermont and New York offering 'Canadians only' deals. International travel is also being affected by escalating disputes, with nonstop flights between Hong Kong and London now two hours longer. On a more positive note, a preschool exchange program is allowing Australian families to experience Japanese culture firsthand, and a viral video has prompted a mass cleanup of caves near China's 'Avatar' mountains.

**Enhanced Games and Maccabiah Games: Controversy and New Records**
The Enhanced Games, a new multisport event, has been announced by Aron D'Souza, founder of Enhanced Games. The event will take place in 2026 in Las Vegas and will include competitions in swimming, athletics, and weightlifting. The event will allow the use of substances banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) code, but will also admit athletes who respect the anti-doping regulations. The event has already attracted controversy, with World Aquatics threatening sanctions against athletes who participate. Kristian Gkolomeev, a Greek swimmer, has already won $1 million for breaking a 'non-enhanced' record while wearing a polyurethane swimsuit. The Maccabiah Games, also known as the 'Jewish Olympics', have been postponed to 2026 due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. The event, which involves around 10,000 athletes from 80 countries, is the second-largest international multisport event. Swimming Australia has announced a team of 21 athletes (Australia A) for the TYR Pro Championships 2025, which will take place in Irvine, California from August 5-8. The team includes two Olympic champions from Paris (Ben Armbruster and Se-Bom Lee) and young emerging athletes, with the goal of preparing the next generation for the Commonwealth Games 2026 and Los Angeles 2028. Ralf Tribuntsov, an Estonian swimmer, has set two new national records in the 100m freestyle and 50m backstroke events at the Estonian Championships in Tartu. Tribuntsov, a 30-year-old former USC Trojan, has dominated the 100m freestyle event with a time of 49.39, breaking his own personal record of 49.88 set in 2013 and surpassing the national record held by Daniel Zaitsev (49.44 since 2019).

**Norway leads the way in 2025 winter sports world championships medals**
Norway is leading the way in the 2025 winter sports world championships, having won 43 medals and 17 gold medals in Olympic program events. With five events remaining, Norway's current totals cannot be surpassed by any other country. If they repeat their results at the 2026 Milan Cortina Games, they will break their own Winter Olympic records for most medals won (39) and gold medals won (16). However, Norway's team at the Winter Olympics will look different, as three Norwegian superstars - biathlete Johannes Thingnes Bø, cross-country skier Therese Johaug, and Nordic combined skier Jarl Magnus Riiber - have announced their retirement. The U.S. is currently second behind Norway in gold medals, benefiting from home ice advantage at the World Bobsled and Skeleton Championships and the World Figure Skating Championships. However, top U.S. athletes Mikaela Shiffrin, Jordan Stolz, and Kristen Santos-Griswold have had limited success this year due to injuries and health issues.
