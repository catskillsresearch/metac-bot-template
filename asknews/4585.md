**Can AMD Stock Turn a $25,000 Investment Into $1 Million by the Time You Retire?**
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has had a sluggish start to 2025, but its long-term prospects in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market are promising. Analysts at Allied Market Research forecast the AI chip market to reach $383.7 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate of 38.2% since 2023. AMD has recently announced a $10 billion collaboration with Humain to build the world's most open, scalable, resilient, and cost-efficient AI infrastructure. The company's quarterly earnings report showed a 36% increase in sales, and its new Instinct MI325X chips have been doing well. To reach a $1 million value from a $25,000 investment, AMD would need to rise to 40 times its original value, requiring an average annual return of 12.6% to 15.4% depending on the number of years until retirement.

**The Future of Investment: A Shift Towards Digitalization and Thematic Investing**
The global investment landscape is shifting, with real estate leading the way. According to recent data, real estate accounts for 48.7% of global investments, followed by bonds (17%) and stocks (15.9%). Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies, despite their recent surge, make up only 0.5% of global investments. However, cryptocurrencies have delivered the highest returns in recent years, with a 1196% increase in value since December 2018. In contrast, real estate has grown by 22.5% between 2019-2022, while bonds and stocks have grown by 29.4% and 66%, respectively, between 2018-2025. Gold has delivered the highest returns among traditional assets, with a 167% increase in value between 2018-2025. The future of investment is uncertain, with economic and geopolitical changes, technological advancements, and demographic shifts expected to impact investment preferences. As a result, traditional investment instruments such as real estate, bonds, stocks, and gold are undergoing significant changes. For example, real estate is becoming increasingly digitalized, with the use of blockchain technology allowing for the tokenization of properties, making it easier for investors to purchase small shares of properties. This could lead to increased liquidity and appeal to younger investors. However, the demand for housing may decline in aging countries, while it may remain strong in younger countries with high birth rates and urbanization. According to a report by HardMan&Well, the global real estate market is expected to grow by 10.1% annually until 2030. The report also suggests that the demand for bonds may decline in the future due to increasing government debt and credit rating downgrades. The stock market, on the other hand, remains attractive to long-term investors, with the S&P 500 index delivering an average annual return of 10.33% since 1957. The report also highlights the potential for thematic investments, such as artificial intelligence and electric vehicles, to deliver high returns in the future. Finally, the report notes that the global population's increasing interest in cryptocurrencies, with over 560 million people using them worldwide, could lead to a significant increase in their market value, from 3.6 trillion dollars to 12 trillion dollars by 2030 and 50 trillion dollars by 2050.

**2025: A Year of Transition for Your Investments**
Despite a complex environment, 2024 was a good year for investors, thanks to a slowdown in inflation, rising global stock markets, and good returns on savings accounts and term deposits. However, the real estate sector was the hardest hit, due to high mortgage interest rates, a lack of confidence among buyers, and a lack of structural reforms. In 2025, investors will need to keep a close eye on interest rates, which will be a key indicator of the economic, market, and credit situation. As the European and American central banks have been lowering interest rates since last summer, this should theoretically favor riskier assets over short-term guaranteed investments. However, other factors such as Donald Trump's international policy and the French government's domestic budget will also play a decisive role in the coming months. As always when there are many uncertainties, it is essential to return to the fundamentals and use common sense. Be wary of overly enticing marketing speeches. Many actors, eager to attract new investors, point to the low returns on the Livret A savings account, suggesting that it would be better to invest in life insurance or rental property. However, this is not accurate, as these investments have different objectives. A well-balanced portfolio should include a precautionary savings component placed on liquid assets such as savings accounts, medium- to long-term investments in stocks and real estate, and diversified assets as a final touch. Ultimately, everything depends on individual life goals, risk appetite, and financial resources. With these factors in mind, approach 2025 as a year of transition. While short-term investments should see their returns gradually decrease, there are still opportunities to consider at the beginning of the year. Unlike last year, it will be necessary to look out for promotional offers or accept immobilizing one's savings for a longer period. In the life insurance sector, the euro-denominated fund should still offer attractive returns, with sometimes bonuses for new investors. In real estate, 2025 should be a transitional year, with the hope of a timid restart. Finally, in the stock market, the market is polarized between expensive but promising markets on one side, and, on the other, discounted but poorly positioned markets for benefiting from global growth. Again, to gain clarity, it will be necessary to wait for adjustments to occur.

**M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?**
The M&A market in 2024 showed moderate returns, with global deal value up 12% to $3.4 trillion. Despite challenges, significant tailwinds are at play, and a strong upward pull is expected to swing the balance toward improved global M&A returns in 2025. The US economy is expected to grow at 2.1% this year, and the Federal Reserve expects the economy to grow at 2.5% in 2024. The US Federal Reserve expects the economy to grow at 2.1 percent this year, down from GDP growth of 2.5 percent in 2024. The value of deals worth over $25 million in the Americas grew 12% to $1.8 trillion, and deal volume increased 9% to 2,763 deals. Average deal size grew to $648 million in 2024, from $631 million in 2023. The European Union reined in inflation after it peaked at 10% in late 2022, but other risks remain on the upswing, as geopolitical tensions remain inflamed and as the bloc's two largest economies -- Germany and France -- face fresh political turmoil. The value of deals over $25 million in EMEA jumped 15% in 2024 to $845 million, and PE firms began to reinvest, accounting for 29% of M&A value in the region, up from 25% a year earlier. Average deal value also rose 8% in EMEA in 2024 to $413 million, and the number of announced deals increased 7% in 2024 to 2,044. Overall deal value in the APAC region rose 10% in 2024 to $797 billion but remained below prepandemic levels. The M&A market in 2025 is expected to be influenced by various factors, including geopolitical instability, changes in trade policies, decisions of central bankers and regulators, and the growth of private equity.

**S&P 500 Expected to See Significant Growth, Analysts Optimistic**
Goldman Sachs estimates that the S&P 500 index will have an annual average return of three percent between 2024 and 2034, but after adjusting for inflation, the real return is expected to be around one percent. This could lead to a massive influx of money from Wall Street to the bond market. For example, long-term US government bonds currently offer a risk-free return of around four and a half percent before inflation. Pål Ringholm, a soon-to-be investment director at Formue, notes that US government bonds can continue to rise. He also suggests that Donald Trump's promises of new tax cuts and continued budget deficits could further increase US inflation and bond yields. Barclays' stock market forecast for 2025 is based on historical data from a single month and lacks fundamental time series analysis. However, the optimistic outlook is supported by a group of positive analysts. Financial Times recently reported that analyst optimism is rare, citing that it has not been this high since 2022. Analysts expect companies listed on the S&P 500 index to have a net result that is 11.4 percent higher this quarter than in the first quarter of 2024. The growth is expected to be widespread across various sectors.
