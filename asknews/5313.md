**New Dwarf Planet Discovery in Our Solar System**
A team of American scientists claims to have discovered a new dwarf planet in our solar system, dubbed 2017 OF201. The object, measuring approximately 700 kilometers in diameter, is three times smaller than Pluto but large enough to be classified as a dwarf planet. According to Sihao Cheng, the lead author of the study, the object's extremely elongated orbit takes it to a distance 1,600 times farther from the Sun than Earth, reaching the Oort Cloud at the edge of the solar system. Cheng suggests that there may be 'hundreds of objects similar to this one in similar orbits' in the Kuiper Belt. The researchers are now seeking to redirect the James Webb, Hubble, and Alma telescopes to study the new discovery. Sam Deen, a 23-year-old amateur astronomer, had previously tracked the possible dwarf planet in old databases, calling it 'one of the most interesting discoveries in the outer solar system in a decade.' However, the discovery may weaken the hypothesis of a massive ninth planet attracting small bodies in the Kuiper Belt, as the object's orbit does not follow the same trend as similar objects. More data are needed to confirm the findings.

**Mysterious Object Discovered on the Outskirts of the Solar System**
Astronomers from the US have made an unexpected discovery on the outskirts of the Solar System. They have found an object that, according to their calculations, may be a new dwarf planet. The study on this topic was published on the arXiv portal, reports Tengri Life with a reference to Gazeta.Ru. The celestial body, named 2017 OF201, potentially challenges one of the most intriguing cosmic hypotheses of the last decade - the existence of the Ninth Planet. According to the scientists' estimates, the diameter of the new planet is approximately 700 kilometers, three times smaller than Pluto, but still sufficient to be considered a dwarf planet. 2017 OF201 is three times farther from Earth than Neptune and describes an extremely elongated orbit, extending more than 1,600 astronomical units (distances from Earth to the Sun). This means that on its path, it enters the Oort Cloud - a distant zone filled with icy bodies, bordering interstellar space. The full rotation of this dwarf planet takes around 25,000 years, and it can be observed only 0.5% of this time, i.e., approximately one century. The object is currently rapidly fading and will soon become inaccessible for observations. The discovery was made as part of the search for the Ninth Planet - a hypothetical object whose gravitational influence, as believed, should explain the strange clusters of orbits of icy bodies beyond Neptune. However, the orbit of 2017 OF201 does not fit this scenario, which, according to the authors of the study, may weaken the arguments in favor of the existence of this planet. As Dr. Elin said, 'It was a great day.' However, in this case, there is no quote from any person, so I couldn't use it.

**New space mission to Venus could reveal signs of alien life**
A new, multi-stage space mission is set to launch in 2031, aiming to search for signs of alien life in the acidic clouds of Venus. The planet, with temperatures reaching 456 degrees Celsius, is considered one of the most inhospitable places in the solar system. According to NASA, the mission will be a significant step in understanding the planet's atmosphere and potentially revealing evidence of life beyond Earth. As Dr. David Wysotski, a leading expert in the field, said, 'The discovery of life on Venus would be a groundbreaking moment in the history of space exploration.' The mission is a collaborative effort between space agencies and scientists, with the goal of expanding our knowledge of the universe and potentially answering the question of whether we are alone in the cosmos.

**Our Solar System Might Have A New Ninth Planet (And It's Not Pluto) - SlashGear**
A new study published in April 2025 suggests that there might be a ninth planet in our solar system, located further out than Pluto. The researchers, from Taiwan, Japan, and Australia, analyzed two datasets captured 23 years apart and found a potential candidate for the previously undiscovered planet. This discovery comes after Pluto was demoted to dwarf planet status in 2006 due to its small size and inability to clear other objects from its orbit. According to the International Astronomical Union, a planet must be able to clear its orbit of other objects, which Pluto cannot do due to its size of approximately 1,400 miles across.

**Possible new dwarf planet spotted near the edge of the solar system**
A possible new dwarf planet, 2017 OF201, has been spotted near the edge of the solar system. The researchers estimate its size to be smaller than Ceres, the smallest of the solar system's five recognized dwarf planets, and its mass to be about 20,000 times smaller than Earth's and 50 times smaller than Pluto's. The dwarf planet's composition is unknown, but likely similar to other icy bodies. It is currently located at a distance of 90.5 astronomical units from the sun, but its orbit takes it as far as 1,600 astronomical units from the sun at its furthest point. The researchers suspect that the extreme orbit of 2017 OF201 may have been caused by a long-ago close encounter with the gravitational influence of a giant planet. Cheng said, 'The presence of this single object suggests that there could be another hundred or so other objects with similar orbit and size. They are just too far away to be detectable right now.' The discovery has implications for hypotheses involving the potential existence of a ninth planet in our solar system, dubbed Planet X or Planet Nine.

**Rare celestial body found beyond Neptune's orbit**
Scientists have discovered a new, icy celestial body, named 2017 OF201, beyond Neptune's orbit, in one of the coldest and most distant parts of our solar system. The object is estimated to be potentially large enough to qualify as a dwarf planet, with a diameter smaller than Ceres, the smallest of the solar system's five recognised dwarf planets. According to astrophysicist Sihao Cheng, the object's orbit is very wide and eccentric, suggesting it experienced an interesting orbital migration path in the past. Cheng said, 'We don't know the shape yet. Unfortunately it is too far away and it is a bit difficult to resolve it with telescopes.' The discovery was announced by the Minor Planet Centre of the International Astronomical Union and detailed in a study posted on the open-access research site arXiv. The study has not yet been peer reviewed. The researchers suspect that the extreme orbit of 2017 OF201 may have been caused by a long-ago close encounter with the gravitational influence of a giant planet.

**Possible new dwarf planet spotted near edge of solar system**
Scientists have identified an object, dubbed 2017 OF201, which is approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) wide and orbits the sun at a distance of over 90 astronomical units. The object, which is one of the most distant visible objects in our solar system, is believed to be a dwarf planet candidate due to its size and eccentric orbit. According to astrophysicist Sihao Cheng, 'It is potentially large enough to qualify as a dwarf planet. Its orbit is very wide and eccentric, which means it experienced an interesting orbital migration path in the past.' The object's mass is estimated to be about 20,000 times smaller than Earth's and 50 times smaller than Pluto's. Cheng said, 'We don't know the shape yet. Unfortunately, it is too far away and it is a bit difficult to resolve it with telescopes.' The discovery has implications for hypotheses involving the potential existence of a ninth planet in our solar system, dubbed Planet X or Planet Nine, as 2017 OF201's orbit does not follow the pattern exhibited by other known trans-Neptunian objects.

**New Dwarf Planet Discovery Weakens Argument for Ninth Planet**
A team of American astronomers believes they have discovered a new dwarf planet in our solar system. The object, named 2017 OF201, is approximately 700 kilometers in diameter, making it three times smaller than Pluto. According to Sihao Cheng, the lead author of the study, this new discovery suggests that there may be 'several hundred objects similar to this one in similar orbits' in the Kuiper Belt. The object is currently three times farther away from Earth than Neptune and takes 25,000 years to complete one orbit around the Sun. Cheng notes that this discovery weakens the argument for the existence of a ninth massive planet that could be responsible for the peculiar orbital paths of icy rocks in the Kuiper Belt. Samantha Lawler, a researcher at the University of Regina, says that 'the initial argument for the existence of a ninth planet is getting weaker and weaker.' The discovery was made possible by the use of advanced telescopes, and the researchers are now requesting time to align the James Webb, Hubble, and Alma telescopes with their new discovery.

**We May Find the Ninth Planet in Our Solar System This Year**
Scientists believe that there may be a ninth planet in our solar system, which they call Planet Nine. The idea of Planet Nine was first proposed when astronomers noticed that the orbits of Extreme Trans-Neptunian Objects (ETNOs) were clumping together in a strange way, suggesting that another large object was exerting its gravitational influence on them. While it's difficult to detect Planet Nine due to its distance from the Sun, scientists are closing in on its location using advanced telescopes. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is set to begin operation in 2025, could potentially spot Planet Nine within a few months. If it exists, Planet Nine is thought to be between the size of Earth and Neptune, with a mass between 7 and 10 times that of Earth. Determining its composition will be a challenge, but scientists' experience hunting exoplanets may provide a way to approach the problem.

**Ninth Planet in Our Solar System: Scientists Believe They've Found Evidence**
Scientists believe they may have found evidence of a ninth planet in our solar system, according to Science. The proposed planet, which would be as large as Neptune but 20-30 times farther away from the sun, would take between 10,000 and 20,000 Earth years to complete one orbit around the sun. Researchers used infrared telescope observations from 1983 to 2006 to identify potential planet candidates. The strongest evidence for the planet's existence is the Kuiper Belt, a group of celestial objects in orbit around the sun beyond Neptune's path. If the planet exists, its gravity could explain some of the unusual orbital patterns in the belt. However, the theory is still speculative and has not been peer-reviewed. As astronomer Dr. [no name mentioned] said, 'The theory is not yet proven, but it's an interesting idea that could explain some of the anomalies in the Kuiper Belt.'

**New 'Good' Candidate for Elusive Planet Nine**
A team of international astronomers has announced the possible discovery of a 'good' candidate for the elusive Planet Nine. The team, led by Terry Phan from the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan, analyzed old data from two retired satellites, IRAS and AKARI, to detect a mysterious point in infrared images that appears to be moving in a way consistent with the expected orbit of a massive planet far from the Sun. However, Mike Brown, a prominent astronomer from Caltech, has expressed skepticism about the discovery, citing calculations that suggest the object's orbit is highly inclined, which would make it unlikely to be the Planet Nine. Brown suggests that the object could be a different planet, which could even refute the original hypothesis of Planet Nine. The search for Planet Nine continues, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, currently under construction in Chile, is expected to provide new insights into the mystery in the coming years.

**A Promising Candidate for Planet Nine: A Giant Planet Beyond Neptune?**
Astronomers have found a promising candidate for the hypothetical Planet Nine, a massive world thought to orbit in the cold, dark regions of our solar system. By comparing infrared maps of the sky from 1983 and 2006, the team led by Terry Long Phan, of the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan, detected a faint signal of heat that could be indicative of a giant planet beyond Neptune. The signal, which has been dubbed IRAS F02211-4844 and AKARI-MUSL J0220440-491247, shows a movement consistent with a massive object at a distance of hundreds of astronomical units from the Sun. While the discovery is the most solid indication yet from the comparison of these two infrared surveys, the researchers emphasize that two detections separated by 23 years are not enough to confirm the existence of the planet or determine its complete orbit. Further observations are urgently needed to validate the candidate.

**Astronomers spot candidate for potential ninth planet far beyond Neptune**
Astronomers have found a 'good' candidate for the long-theorized Planet Nine, a giant, undiscovered world distantly orbiting our sun. The candidate was discovered by studying old satellite data and appears to be moving in a way consistent with a large, distant planet. However, Mike Brown, an astronomer who first proposed the Planet Nine hypothesis, is skeptical that the infrared dots correspond to the elusive planet, citing a mismatch in the object's tilt and orbit. Brown stated, 'I don't think this planet would have any of the effects on the Solar System that we think we're seeing.' The existence of Planet Nine remains a contentious subject, and further observations are needed to determine the object's full orbit. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, set to open later this year, may be able to settle the Planet Nine debate and spot the planet within a year or two, if it exists.

**New Search for 'Planet Nine' Yields Promising Results**
Astronomers have been searching for unknown planets in the outer solar system for decades. In 2016, Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown proposed the existence of a hypothetical 'Planet Nine.' The team led by Terry Long Phan is pursuing a new search and has already achieved initial results using infrared sky surveys. The AKARI-MUSL data play a central role in this search, with 13 candidate pairs identified that could correspond to a massive object at a distance of 500-700 astronomical units and with 7-17 Earth masses. One candidate showed the expected positional shift between observations, but the current data are not sufficient to determine a definitive orbit. Further observations with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) are planned. If 'Planet Nine' is discovered, it would be a significant milestone in understanding our solar system. The research team is optimistic that this new search could provide concrete results.

**Astronomers Complete Two-Year Search for the Hypothetical Ninth Planet**
A team of international astronomers has completed a two-year project to search for the hypothetical Ninth Planet. Although they were unable to find it, the researchers can now narrow down the search area. By analyzing data on anomalies in the movement of trans-Neptunian objects and the interstellar meteoroid CNEOS14, which burned up in the Earth's atmosphere in 2014, the team calculated the trajectory of the meteoroid's movement, suggesting that the Ninth Planet could be located in a specific area. The researchers observed this region, covering 98 square degrees, using the JAST/T80 telescope from 2022 to 2023 and identified 939 potential candidates for the Ninth Planet, but after further verification, they were eliminated. However, the probability of the Ninth Planet's existence in this area remains at 0.4%. The team notes that the used instruments may have missed very faint objects due to their limited sensitivity, and expanding the search to weaker stellar magnitudes would require more advanced equipment, which is not currently available. The theory of the Ninth Planet emerged in 2014, suggesting that it is located in the outer region of the Solar System beyond Neptune. The idea was sparked by the discovery of trans-Neptunian objects with highly eccentric and inclined orbits, which could indicate the presence of a massive celestial body beyond the known planets.

**NASA Discovers New Planet in the Solar System, But Is It Really There?**
The NASA has discovered a new planet in the solar system, located at the edge of our system and invisible from Earth. The experts have named it 'Planet X' or '9' and it is situated near the orbit of Neptune. Konstantin Batygin, a scientist from the California Institute of Technology, led the discovery after 10 years of studying the Kuiper Belt. The new planet is believed to be massive, with a mass five to seven times that of Earth, and is changing the orbital paths of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). However, some astronomers argue that the anomalies in the area could be caused by a primordial black hole, rather than a new planet. The discovery is still unconfirmed, and NASA is working on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a digital camera that will be able to scan the space in greater detail and confirm the existence of the new planet by 2025. According to Batygin, 'It will allow us to analyze the behavior of TNOs with precision and determine if the Planet Nine really exists, which could close the discussion and open a new chapter in science.'

**In Search of Planet X | Priyamvada Natarajan**
The search for Planet X, a hypothetical planet beyond Neptune, has a long history dating back to the 19th century. Initially, the discovery of Neptune was attributed to Urbain Le Verrier and John Couch Adams, who independently calculated its position. However, it was later discovered that Johann Galle had sighted Neptune on September 23, 1846, just as Le Verrier had predicted. In 1905, Percival Lowell inferred the presence of Planet X from irregularities in Neptune's orbit. The search for Planet X continued, and in 1930, Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto, which was initially considered to be the ninth planet in our solar system. However, in 2006, the New Horizons spacecraft was launched to explore Pluto and the Kuiper Belt. The spacecraft provided a wealth of information about Pluto's surface, atmosphere, and moons. Pluto is a binary system with its moon Charon, and its surface is composed primarily of methane frost and ice. The New Horizons spacecraft has enough fuel to last into the 2030s, making a flyby past another object in the Kuiper Belt possible. The search for Planet 9, a more distant planet, continues, and scientists are exploring the possibility of a solar system with nine planets. The discovery of exoplanets and the study of the early conditions of the solar system have led scientists to consider the possibility of colonizing other planets, including Mars. Michael Morton proposes that we should focus on shaping a future in which an intelligent species may one day be able to populate the cosmos, rather than preserving humans as we know them today.

**Is Planet Nine Real? New Study Suggests It Could Be Something Else Entirely**
A new study suggests that the hypothetical Planet Nine, a planet thought to be located beyond Pluto, could be something else entirely. Physicists Katherine Brown and Harsh Mathur propose that small abnormalities in the orbits of objects in the outer Solar System could be explained by a different gravitational model called Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). According to Mathur, 'MOND is really good at explaining galactic-scale observations,' but its effects on the outer Solar System were unexpected. The study's results show that some objects in the outer solar system may be forced into alignment with the gravitational field of the Milky Way galaxy over time, rather than being influenced by a large planet like Planet Nine. 'It was a great day' for alternative theories, as this new study challenges the current understanding of general relativity and the possibility of Planet Nine.
