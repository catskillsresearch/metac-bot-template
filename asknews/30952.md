**Markets Pause As Fed Policy Becomes A Hindrance To Growth**
The US markets have paused after a recent rise, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials experiencing a flat week. The pause is attributed to the Federal Reserve's (Fed) decision to hold interest rates constant, citing increased uncertainty about the economic outlook. The leading indicators, such as the FIBER Leading Indicator series and the Conference Board's Leading Economic Indicators, are showing signs of a slowing economy. The US consumer is also showing signs of caution, with revolving credit balances falling and consumers expecting to struggle with debt payments. However, recent trends in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate are hopeful, with the year/year CPI inflation rate falling to 2.41% in March. It is expected that the 12-month inflation rate will reach the Fed's 2% goal sometime in Q3 or Q4. The tariffs have put a scare into consumers regarding inflation, but the data suggests that the economy may face a bout of deflation, especially since the Fed's monetary policy has become a hindrance to economic growth.

**Inflation up 1.97% in first four months of 2025**
According to the Department of Statistics, the general consumer price index (inflation) rose to 112.39 points during the first four months of 2025, marking a 1.97 percent increase compared to 110.21 points during the same period in 2024. The main contributors to the increase were personal effects (19.01 percent), tobacco and cigarettes (12.65 percent), tea, coffee, and cocoa (5.73 percent), fruits and nuts (5.52 percent), and spices, food additives, and other foods (5.38 percent). On a monthly basis, inflation for April 2025 rose by 1.83 percent, reaching 112.53 points, compared to 110.50 points in April 2024. Certain categories registered a decline, including household appliances (3.04 percent), furniture and bedding (2.71 percent), dried and canned vegetables, pulses and legumes (1.91 percent), and fish and seafood (1.65 percent).

**US Consumer Price Index May Accelerate Upward Due to Tariff Costs**
The US consumer price index (CPI) in March showed a 0.1% increase, the smallest in nine months, but April's data may accelerate upward due to many companies trying to pass on higher tariff costs to consumers. According to a survey by Bloomberg, the core CPI is expected to rise 0.3% in April, excluding volatile food and energy prices, higher than the 0.1% increase in March. Although the impact of tariff increases on consumer prices may be limited in the short term, many economists expect this effect to become more apparent over time, which may explain why consumers are increasingly worried about inflation, the economy, and the job market. The April retail sales data, to be released on Thursday, is expected to be flat or slightly changed, compared to the 1.3% growth in March, reflecting some consumer concerns. Companies are caught in a dilemma, trying to pass on higher tariff costs to consumers through price increases, but also worried that this may lead to a decline in sales. However, due to the Trump administration's temporary suspension of certain tariffs to facilitate trade negotiations, some companies may delay price increases. Bloomberg analysts said, 'Although most tariff costs are borne by the US, why is consumer price inflation still so mild? We believe it is because demand is slowing down, and retailers find it difficult to pass on higher costs without causing a sharp decline in demand, although they will still try to do so. If this effect continues, the net inflationary impact of tariffs may be smaller than generally thought.' Meanwhile, recent surveys of manufacturers and service providers show that input costs are rising, which may force them to adjust prices. The US government will release the April producer price index (PPI) on Thursday, which will reveal the pressure on selling costs. The Federal Reserve (Fed) said in May that the risk of inflation and unemployment rising simultaneously due to trade policies has increased.

**Consumer Confidence Falls for Sixth Consecutive Month in April**
The Consumer Confidence Index (ENCO) reported a monthly decline of 0.6 points in April 2025, placing the index at 45.3 units, its lowest level in almost two years, since May 2023. This decline represents the sixth consecutive monthly drop in consumer confidence. Annually, there was a decrease of 2.2 points compared to April 2024, with four months of interannual contractions and the worst annual variation since November 2022. All components of the indicator showed reductions in April. Notably, the component measuring the 'current possibilities of households to acquire durable goods' fell by 1.1 points, its largest monthly decrease since March 2023. Additionally, the component evaluating 'expectations about the country's economic situation in a year' decreased by 0.9 points. The components assessing the 'country's economic situation in the present' and the 'future situation of the household' also fell by 0.7 and 0.2 points, respectively. The 'current economic situation of the household' also showed a slight decrease of 0.2 points. This increase in consumer pessimism is linked to the global uncertainty derived from the commercial war, which could directly impact employment and prices in Mexico. However, this negative trend is not new. The weakening of consumer confidence has accumulated half a year of consecutive monthly declines, parallel to the cooling of national economic activity, reflected in a strong deceleration in the generation of formal employment during the first months of 2025.

**US CPI Expected to Accelerate in April Amid Tariff Price Transfer**
The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to accelerate in April, after a 9-month low in March. Many companies are trying to pass on the costs of tariffs to consumers, which could lead to a general increase in prices. According to a Bloomberg economist survey, the core CPI, excluding food and energy, is expected to rise 0.3% in April, up from 0.1% in March. While the April CPI report shows that the impact of tariff price transfer is still limited, many economists expect this effect to become more pronounced over time. As a result, consumers are not only concerned about inflation, but also about the overall economy and the job market. The US retail sales data, to be released on May 15, may reflect these concerns. After a strong 1.5% increase in March, retail sales are expected to remain flat in April, due to a decline in auto sales. Some companies may delay price increases due to the Trump administration's temporary suspension of some tariffs and its efforts to negotiate a trade agreement with individual countries. However, recent surveys of manufacturers and service providers suggest that they may be forced to adjust prices due to rising input costs. The April Producer Price Index (PPI) report, to be released on May 15, will provide insight into the changes in wholesale costs. The CPI and retail sales data are among the key economic indicators to be released this week, along with the initial value of the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for May and the number of unemployment insurance applications. Additionally, the number of US housing starts in April and industrial production will be released, as well as comments from US financial authorities, including a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Powell on May 15 on the review of monetary policy.

**April Inflation Data Likely Will Show Some Tariff-Related Price Gains**
Economists expect April's inflation data to show a 0.3% month-over-month increase, following a 0.1% decline in March. The consumer price index is expected to remain steady at 2.4% year-over-year. However, the cooling inflation trend is thought to have slowed in April due to the impact of previously announced tariffs on U.S. imports. According to economists, the Trump administration's tariff regime could lead to more inflation, despite negotiations this past weekend that may mitigate the effects of higher tariffs on Chinese goods.

**US Inflation Expected to Slow Down in April, but Core Rate May Reflect Tariffs**
The inflation rate in the US is expected to slow down in April, but the core rate may reflect the impact of tariffs. According to the Cleveland Federal Reserve's high-frequency model, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to slow down to 2.3% annual rate in April, after reaching 2.4% in March. The core CPI is expected to maintain a 2.8% increase in the same period. Despite the tariffs, the inflation rate still seems to be a more immediate threat than a sudden slowdown in the economy. Other factors, such as the 2.7% monthly increase in used vehicle prices from Manheim in April, also deserve attention. Economic disconnections are accumulating, such as the disconnect between gasoline prices and oil prices, which remain relatively stable despite geopolitical tensions. Relatively robust labor market conditions and a decrease in initial jobless claims to 228,000 for the week ended May 3, suggest that consumer weakness may be overstated. The Redbook retail sales index has shown consistent expansion in recent weeks, indicating that consumption may not be slowing down as much as expected.

**Bill Wood: New year, same economic worries**
Bill Wood, in his first column for 2025, discusses the ongoing economic worry of inflation. Despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to lower interest rates and the 'soft landing' being proclaimed, price increases remain the predominant economic story. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December 2024 increased 0.4 percent from November, and 2.9 percent for the year as a whole, which is above the Fed's target of 2 percent. The monthly numbers show an accelerating rate of change, with a 0.2 percent increase in October, 0.3 percent in November, and 0.4 percent in December. Energy prices are particularly concerning, with many subcategories experiencing stronger-than-desired price increases in the fourth quarter.

**US Inflation Rate Reaches 2.9% in December 2024**
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the US rose for the third consecutive month, according to official figures released today, which were in line with expectations. The CPI, a measure of inflation, increased to 2.9% in the 12 months ended in December, slightly above the 2.7% of November, as indicated by the Department of Labor. The result is in line with expectations from economists consulted by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal. The increase is largely due to an increase in energy prices. The Federal Reserve, the US central bank, has reduced its interest rates by one percentage point since September and is closely monitoring the labor market and inflation. Its two mandates are to achieve full employment and control inflation. The recent increase in prices increases the expectation that it will maintain interest rates at current levels in its monetary policy meeting at the end of the month. The good news for the Fed is that the underlying annual inflation rate, excluding volatile food and energy prices, was lower than expected, at 3.2% last month, a slight decline from November. In a month-to-month comparison, prices rose 0.4% between November and December, and 0.2% if food and energy are excluded.

**US Inflation Rises to 2.9% in 12 Months Ending in December**
The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose for the third consecutive month, reaching 2.9% in the 12 months ending in December, according to official numbers released on Wednesday (15). This is slightly above the 2.7% in November, as reported by the Department of Labor. The increase is largely due to rising energy prices. The Federal Reserve, the US central bank, has cut interest rates by one percentage point since September and is closely monitoring the labor market and inflation. Its two goals are to achieve full employment and control price increases. The recent price hike increases expectations that interest rates will be maintained at current levels at the monetary policy meeting at the end of the month. The good news for the Fed is that the underlying annual inflation rate, excluding volatile food and energy prices, was 3.2% in the previous month, below expectations, a slight decline from November. 'This decline in underlying inflation is a relief, even if it remains well above the Fed's 2% target,' said Jochen Stanzl, CMC Markets analyst, in a note. 'The data reinforces the market's view that the Fed will not make many rate cuts in 2025, mainly because the labor market situation does not raise concerns.' 'The inflation data today confirms that the Fed is right to be cautious with its monetary policy,' he added. The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rates in its last three meetings. Reducing rates makes credit cheaper, freeing up consumption and investment, which fuels economic dynamics. With a strong labor market, the need for new rate cuts in a context of growing inflation is reduced. The market expects the Fed to stop cutting rates, mainly to avoid overheating the economy. Futures operators give the Fed 97% chances of keeping rates in the 4.25-4.50% range in its meeting on January 28 and 29.

**US Consumer Price Index (CPI) Rises 2.9% in December, Third Consecutive Month of Acceleration**
The US Labor Department released the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December 2024, which showed a 2.9% increase compared to the same month last year. This marks the third consecutive month of acceleration in inflation. The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its policy interest rate for the time being. Market expectations were for a 2.8-2.9% increase, and while the 0.4% increase from the previous month was slightly lower than expected, it still shows a strong upward trend, following the 2.7% increase in November. As one market analyst noted, 'The CPI has been steadily increasing, and it's likely that the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor the situation closely.'

**Dec CPI rises a touch above expectations, keeps Fed on track By Reuters**
The US consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4% in November, exceeding the expected 0.3% increase. The 12-month CPI advanced 2.9%, in line with estimates. Energy costs rose 4.3% for the month, but are down 3.9% from a year ago. Economists, including Brian Jacobsen, Peter Cardillo, and Oliver Purche, believe that the report does not significantly change the outlook for inflation or the Federal Reserve's cautious stance. According to Peter Cardillo, 'The top line is a little disappointing, but I think that may have been due to food prices.' Oliver Purche added, 'I think the market reaction is a pivot back to the Fed can lower rates if it wants to, as opposed to being boxed in a corner where higher inflation would keep them from acting.'

**US consumer prices rose for third-straight month to 2.9% in December**
US consumer prices rose 0.4% in December, marking the third-straight month of increases, with the consumer price index (CPI) reaching 2.9% in the 12 months through December. This is slightly higher than the 2.7% increase in November and aligns with the Federal Reserve's projections for fewer interest rate cuts this year. The resilient economy, threat of broad tariffs, and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants have led the US central bank to project a shallower rate-cut path this year. Excluding food and energy components, the core CPI increased 0.2% in December, while the core CPI rose 3.2% in the 12 months through December. Economists are divided on whether the central bank will reduce borrowing costs again before the second half of the year, with Goldman Sachs expecting two rate cuts this year and Bank of America Securities believing the Fed's easing cycle is over.

US consumer prices rose 0.4% in December, marking the third straight month of increases, with the consumer price index (CPI) reaching 2.9% in the 12 months through December. This is slightly higher than the 2.7% increase in November and aligns with the Federal Reserve's projection for fewer interest rate cuts this year. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.3% and rising 2.9% year on year. The resilient economy, threat of broad tariffs on imports, and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants are expected to lead to a shallower rate-cut path this year. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased 0.2% in December, with the so-called core CPI rising 3.2% in the 12 months through December. Goldman Sachs expects two rate cuts in 2025, while Bank of America Securities believes the Fed's easing cycle is over.

**Dec CPI rises a touch above expectations, keeps Fed on track**
The US consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4% in November, exceeding economists' expectations of a 0.3% increase. The 12-month CPI advanced 2.9%, in line with estimates. Energy costs rose 4.3% for the month, but are down 3.9% from a year ago. Economists Brian Jacobsen and Peter Cardillo noted that while core inflation was slightly lower, consumers are not seeing relief at the pump. Oliver Purche said the market reaction is a pivot back to the Fed being able to lower rates if it wants to, citing a 'Goldilocks scenario' of strong corporate earnings, a resilient economy, and lower inflation.
