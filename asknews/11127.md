**Taiwanese Progressive Party Chairman Warns of 'Ostrich-Like' Mentality Amid China's Military Threats**
Taiwanese Progressive Party Chairman Wang Hsing-huan warned that Taiwan cannot afford to be in a ' ostrich-like' mentality, ignoring the possibility of war. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently stated that China's military action against Taiwan 'may be imminent' and urged allies in the Indo-Pacific region to increase their defense budgets to deter China. Wang pointed out that various US think tanks, frontline Indo-Pacific commanders, and naval combat forces have warned that China will launch an invasion of Taiwan in 2027. China has also set a goal of 'winning a local war' by 2027. Wang emphasized that China's ideal script for invading Taiwan is to 'encircle and blockade' the island, creating pressure on Taiwanese society through localized military actions, and then using pro-China parties in Taiwan to advocate for 'peace talks' and shape international opinion to accept unification. He stated, 'Those who advocate for peace talks are Taiwan's enemies.' To counter China's military threats, Wang suggested that Taiwan must strengthen its military deterrent, solidify its alliances with Indo-Pacific nations, and cultivate an 'unyielding resistance spirit' to prevent China from launching an invasion. 'If China expects a blockade to lead to a long-term war and international sanctions, it will be hesitant to launch an invasion,' Wang said.

**China rejects US defence chief's warnings on Taiwan invasion threat**
China has rejected US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's warnings about the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, calling them 'groundless accusations'. Hegseth had warned that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan 'would result in devastating consequences'. China's National Defence University vice president, Hu Gangfeng, said the accusations were 'nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region'. Australia's Defence Minister, Richard Marles, pointed out that China's largest conventional military build-up since World War II is happening without strategic reassurance and without a clear strategic intent. Australia is increasing its defence spending, aiming to reach 2.33 per cent of GDP by 2033-34, and is on track to receive eight new nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS agreement.

**China 'rehearsing' invasion of Taiwan, warns US**
US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth warned that China is 'rehearsing for the real deal' and building capabilities to invade Taiwan, according to a report by the Eurasian Times. Hegseth stated that the Chinese military is preparing to use force to alter the regional balance of power, with Taiwan at the center of its ambitions. The US has vowed to deter aggression by communist China and will continue to maintain a presence in the Indo-Pacific region. Hegseth accused China of endangering lives through cyberattacks, harassing neighboring countries, and illegally militarising disputed territories in the South China Sea. China has vowed to merge Taiwan with the mainland, by force if necessary, and has intensified large-scale military drills around the island. The US has launched a trade war with China, restricted Beijing's access to key artificial intelligence technologies, and bolstered military cooperation with allies like the Philippines.

**US Warns of Dire Consequences if China Attacks Taiwan in 2027**
US Defense Secretary Preet Hagseth has warned that China's plans to attack Taiwan in 2027 will have dire consequences for the Indo-Pacific region and the world. Speaking at the Singapore Dialogue, Hagseth said, 'There is no reason to sugarcoat the situation.' He added that the threat from China's intentions in the region is increasing continuously. 'China is preparing for an attack on Taiwan in 2027, but there will be severe consequences for the region and the world,' Hagseth said. The US defense secretary emphasized that the situation in the region requires a clear and direct approach, rather than sugarcoating the facts.

**US Defense Secretary Announces China's Planned Invasion of Taiwan**
US Defense Secretary Pita Hegset announced that China will invade Taiwan within two years. He stated, 'The Chinese People's Liberation Army has been instructed to reach the capacity to invade Taiwan by 2027. They are building the necessary military power, training every day, and conducting realistic exercises.' Hegset warned that any Chinese annexation attempt could have devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific region and the world. 'The threat posed by China is real and could become a reality very soon. We hope it doesn't, but it certainly could.' he said. Chinese Military Academy Vice President Hu Gangfeng responded to Hegset's allegations, saying, 'We do not accept any baseless accusations against China. These accusations are fabrications, distorted facts, and claims made by those who are directly responsible for the crime.' Hegset made these comments in Singapore, where he met with US military personnel and participated in a training session.

**US Warns of Devastating Consequences if China Attempts to Conquer Taiwan**
US Defense Secretary Hegseth warned that there would be 'devastating consequences' for the region and the world if China were to attempt to 'conquer' Taiwan. He stated this at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a prestigious security forum in Asia. Hegseth also mentioned that it is public knowledge that Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered his military to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027. However, he added that President Donald Trump has also stated that China will not invade Taiwan under his supervision. Hegseth's goal is to prevent war, make its costs too high, and make peace the only option.

**US Warns of Imminent Chinese Attack on Taiwan, Urges Clear Military Commitment**
The United States has warned that China is preparing for an imminent attack on Taiwan, which could rewrite the geopolitical balance in the Asia-Pacific region. According to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, China is 'clearly preparing to use military force to alter the balance of power' in the region. Hegseth added that Beijing is 'clearly and credibly preparing to use military force to alter the balance of power' in the region. Taiwan, which has been independent since 1949, has developed a democratic system and a distinct national identity, but is not recognized as a sovereign state by most of the international community due to Chinese pressure. China considers Taiwan a rebellious province to be 'reunified' with the mainland, even with the use of force if necessary. In recent years, Beijing has intensified military pressure on the island, fueling regional tensions. The US has removed the phrase stating that it 'does not support Taiwan's independence' from its official website, and the G7 declaration omitted the traditional reference to respecting the 'one-China policy'. These signals have been interpreted by Beijing as a gradual departure from the US's 'strategic ambiguity', which has avoided explicit commitment to defending Taiwan for decades. 'If Beijing believes that a clear US commitment to Taiwan is imminent but not yet explicit, it may perceive a limited window of time to act,' warn Pentagon analysts. China has been working for years to prepare for a potential military attack on Taiwan. The modernization of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is focused on the ability to fight and win a war against Taiwan, even in the presence of US intervention. Recent exercises show a high degree of interoperability between naval, air, and missile forces, with the addition of new technologies that could allow the cutting of underwater cables and the blockade of the island's communications. 'China is normalizing PLA activities around Taiwan, including joint patrols and simulations of naval blockades,' observe Taiwanese sources. These operations, apparently part of a 'gray zone' strategy, exert constant pressure on Taipei, which risks responding militarily, fueling an escalation difficult to control. The emerging Chinese doctrine seems to be oriented towards rapid action, capable of conquering Taiwan and imposing its supremacy in the air and sea space before the US can react effectively. This approach also aims to deter Washington from intervening, creating a fait accompli difficult to reverse without significant political and military consequences. 'A potential Chinese landing on Taiwan would transform the US task from preventing an invasion to liberating the island,' emphasize Pentagon officials. The rapid Chinese mobilization, masked by normal military operations, could go unnoticed until the actual attack, making US strategic ambiguity a less effective deterrent. If the US wants to deter a Chinese attack and ensure Taiwan's security, it must go beyond its current ambiguity and clearly state its military commitment. Such a step, however, carries the risk of an immediate reaction from Beijing. According to experts, an effective deterrent requires clarity and credibility. China is rapidly closing the military gap, and soon may believe that an attack is not only possible but also winning. The strategic balance is shifting, and with it, the risk of a large-scale conflict in the heart of Asia is growing.

**US Warns Allies of China's Growing Threat: 'Invading Taiwan in 2027'**
US Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, has warned allies not to 'look away' from the 'imminent risk' posed by China, which is investing in high-level nuclear arms and armament technology to 'invade Taiwan in 2027'. Hegseth has reiterated that China's attempts to conquer Taiwan 'by force' would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. China has warned the US that military aid to Taiwan increases the 'risk of conflict'. Hegseth has called for increased defense spending 'to prevent war, make the cost too high, and peace the only option'. Analysts interpret this as a signal from Washington to increase arms sales in Asia. Hegseth has also highlighted the 'risk' of economic dependence on China, which 'deepens its malign influence' globally. This comes as tensions rise, with China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, not attending the Singapore meeting, and instead sending a delegation from the National Defense University.

**China's Potential Invasion of Taiwan: A Study of the First Battle**
A recent study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) suggests that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could be met with a strong resistance from the Taiwanese military and potentially even direct US military intervention. The study, which involved 24 war game simulations with former Pentagon officials and US administration members, found that the Chinese invasion could falter quickly if the Taiwanese military holds strong and the US intervenes militarily. The US is working to strengthen its military presence in the South China Sea, with Japan willing to play a key role in supporting the effort, even without using US bases on its territory. The US has announced billions of dollars in military aid, which is expected to focus on long-range cruise missiles that could counter Chinese naval advances. However, in the event of a war, it is not the F-35 fighter jets or B-52 bombers that will be the decisive factor, but rather the US Navy's Virginia-class submarines, which can launch long-range attacks from beneath the surface without being detected by enemy defenses. According to the study, there is also a possibility that Taiwan could surrender before US reinforcements arrive, which would allow China to formally annex the island and strengthen its military presence, while the US would suffer a significant strategic loss. Despite some weaknesses in the Taiwanese military, its resilience is a crucial factor in buying time for US intervention. However, sending US troops to the battlefield or sea would be a highly sensitive decision, requiring a convincing justification to the American people and its political institutions.

**US Think Tank Warns of Nuclear War if China Invades Taiwan in 2030**
A recent report by the Atlantic Council, a US think tank, has warned that if China were to invade Taiwan in 2030, the Korean Peninsula could become a second battlefield, and a nuclear war may be unavoidable. The report, titled 'Guardian Tiger II', simulated a hypothetical scenario in which China launches a large-scale conventional war against Taiwan, leading to a US-China confrontation. According to the report, North Korea would play a significant role in this conflict, with China and North Korea sharing intelligence and North Korea launching short-range ballistic missiles at US military bases in South Korea. The report warns that the conflict could escalate into a nuclear war, with China using nuclear weapons to cut off Taiwan's external aid and then invoking a military alliance treaty with North Korea to justify its intervention in the Korean Peninsula. The report also suggests that the US may struggle to make a quick decision on whether to use nuclear force in response to North Korea's provocations, given the complexity of the situation. Experts are calling for the US to reorganize its command and control systems in the Indo-Pacific region and to engage in regular trilateral security talks with South Korea and Japan to address the synchronized threats from China and North Korea.

**US Warns of Potential Attack on Mainland if China Invades Taiwan**
A US Air Force colonel, Doug Wickert, has warned that China's military power is growing rapidly and that if a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, US military bases on the mainland could be attacked. Wickert said that the US should prepare for a large-scale war, as the community near Edwards Air Force Base in California could face significant destruction if China attacks Taiwan. He noted that the production of advanced US warplanes, such as the B-21 'Raider', which is manufactured in the nearby Northrop Grumman factory, could be a target for China. Wickert stated, 'If this war happens, it will happen here, and the war will affect us here. That's why we're having this conversation... The more prepared we are, the more likely we are to change Xi's calculations.' He also mentioned that cyber attacks could disrupt power supplies and other countries' infrastructure. Other US officials have previously stated that they believe China's leader, Xi Jinping, has ordered his military to prepare for an invasion of Taiwan by 2027. The US government has identified deterring China as its top priority, and has prepared for a long-term war. A senior US military officer told Reuters that 'if China attacks Taiwan and we decide to intervene, this war is unlikely to end quickly.' The US is rebuilding runways in the Philippines and the western Pacific, and plans to disperse a small number of aircraft to multiple locations to maximize survivability.

**US Military May Suffer Significant Losses in Taiwan Invasion, CSIS Report Suggests**
A recent report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) suggests that if the US military intervenes in a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, it may suffer significant losses, including at least 2 aircraft carriers, 30 ships, and over 250 aircraft, but still fail to prevent China's military unification. The report, which was published on April 10, 2025, states that China's military has made significant progress in modernizing its forces, and its 'anti-intervention/area denial' capabilities in the Western Pacific have become a 'substantial threat' to US military operations in the region. 'Earth Village's Story', a international columnist for Tencent News, analyzed the report and concluded that the main reason for the US military's potential defeat is China's rapid advancement in military technology, including its Dongfeng series of missiles, hypersonic weapons, and cruise missiles, which can precisely attack US aircraft carriers. Additionally, China's development of its own BeiDou navigation system and stealth unmanned reconnaissance aircraft has allowed it to maintain some degree of accurate striking capability even if the US closes its satellites. 'Earth Village's Story' also pointed out that although the US has 11 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and a strong aircraft carrier strike group, China may be able to launch precise attacks on US bases and supply lines in the Western Pacific, weakening US military capabilities and ultimately achieving its goal of annexing Taiwan. Furthermore, 'Earth Village's Story' denied the possibility of Taiwan emulating Ukraine's model of prolonged resistance, citing the limited logistical and defensive capabilities of Taiwan and the inability of Western countries, including the US, to provide sustained military aid to Taiwan after the outbreak of war. However, 'Earth Village's Story' also acknowledged that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would have severe consequences for the global economy, including the loss of Taiwan's semiconductor supply, which would have a profound impact on the world economy. 'Earth Village's Story' emphasized that although China has a 'decisive advantage', it may still suffer significant losses and face difficulties in governing Taiwan after the war.

**China May Attempt to Invade Taiwan Within 6 Months: US Media Report**
According to a report by 1945, a US media outlet, China may attempt to invade Taiwan within the next 6 months. Retired US Army Captain Chuck DeVore analyzed that China's invasion of Taiwan may have three scenarios: gradual blockade, lightning strike, and all-out war. DeVore explained that the first scenario is that China's navy will 'like a steel rope' completely block Taiwan. Since 90% of Taiwan's food and all natural gas are transported by ship, if this lifeline is cut off, Taiwan will face months of food shortages. The second scenario is that China will launch a large-scale missile attack to destroy Taiwan's defense systems and overload its Patriot and other missile defense systems. Beijing's 'patriotic hackers' will destroy Taiwan's power grid and close its internet and phone networks. Meanwhile, 100,000 Chinese troops will land on Taiwan's beaches. DeVore said that considering Taiwan's 12-hour time difference with Washington, all of this will happen 'before the US wakes up.' Therefore, China's goal is 'to capture Taipei in a few days and show the world a fait accompli.' The third scenario is considered the end of the world, DeVore said that China will first try to invade Taiwan, then destroy the US and its allies' defense capabilities. Missile attacks will not only destroy Taiwan's military bases, but also destroy all US bases in Japan, Guam, and the Philippines. When Asia is in chaos, Beijing's over 2 million eligible men will sneak into the US under the Biden administration's open border agreement and start a joint attack with Mexican drug cartels. DeVore believes that for China, launching a war of unlimited scope will divert US attention, giving China time to invade Taiwan and test the determination of the alliance. However, this is a high-risk gamble, especially if it is discovered before it is launched. The US may also use the exposure of the event to spark a global backlash, strengthen its global leadership, and punish China economically.

**China's Taiwan Invasion: A Catastrophic Outcome?**
Dmitry Alperovich, author of the book 'World on the Brink: How America Can Win the 21st-Century Competition with China', believes that China's recent military exercises near Taiwan are a warning to the island and a demonstration of Beijing's resolve to prevent Taiwan's independence. Alperovich predicts that China will launch a full-scale invasion of Taiwan between 2028 and 2032, which would be the most complex military operation in human history. He notes that the US has a secret document that identifies China as the main threat to the country and recommends increasing pressure on Taiwan to increase its defense spending. Alperovich also believes that the US will eventually have to intervene in a conflict between China and Taiwan, which could lead to a catastrophic outcome, including the loss of tens of thousands of American soldiers and the risk of nuclear escalation. He also thinks that Russia will not directly intervene in the conflict, but will act as an opportunist, taking advantage of the situation to further its own interests. Alperovich concludes that Taiwan has the potential to defend itself against a Chinese invasion, but its military is not yet prepared for such a scenario.

**US Must Be Ready for a 2027 Chinese Invasion of Taiwan, Warns Rep. Scott Perry**
US Representative Scott Perry warns that the US must take China's plan to invade Taiwan by 2027 as a 'realistic threat' and take action to counter it. This warning echoes the recent statement by Anthony J. Cotton, commander of the US Strategic Command, who pointed out that Chinese President Xi Jinping has set a goal of invading Taiwan by 2027, and has increased investment in nuclear missile launch equipment and related infrastructure. Perry, a member of the House Intelligence Committee and a retired Army colonel, emphasized that the US must take this threat seriously and prepare for a possible attack, rather than assuming that China is unable or unwilling to carry out the plan. He stated, 'We must treat this as real in everything we do, everything we say, every decision we make.' Perry also stressed that the US cannot sit idly by while China uses propaganda and coercion to force the world to accept the idea that Taiwan belongs to China, and must instead stand up for Taiwan's sovereignty and international participation.

**Taiwan's military exercises to focus on invasion preparation**
Taiwan's military is conducting exercises focused on preparing for a potential invasion by China in 2027, a deadline previously mentioned by security experts and military officials. Former US Navy admiral Philip Davidson warned that China could attempt to invade Taiwan by 2027, while Chinese President Xi Jinping has reportedly instructed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to be prepared for an invasion by then. However, Su Tzu-yun, a fellow at the Institute for National Defence and Security Research, noted that there is no clear indication a formal decision has been made to resort to force by then. Security analysts worldwide have urged their governments to prepare for a possible conflict, and the Han Kuang exercises' focus on 2027 is a logical response to these concerns, according to Su. 'It could create a perfect storm,' he said, 'if Xi seeks a fourth term, he may take military risks to justify his leadership.' The defence ministry's 'immediate response drills' were specifically designed to deter China from 'turning exercises into war,' Su added. 'The principle of risk control was followed,' he said. 'It is normal to use timelines as a reference for defence strategy,' Su noted. 'The US military must be prepared for contingencies before then,' said former US Indo-Pacific commander John Aquilino. 'China is accelerating its military expansion, particularly in dual-use shipyards and nuclear weapons launch platforms,' said US Air Force Strategic Commander General Anthony Cotton. 'These developments align with preparations to have the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027,' he added. 'The US should expedite its own military production in response,' Cotton said. 'It is a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and his ambition,' said former CIA director William Burns, describing Xi's directive to the PLA. 'China is accelerating its military expansion,' Burns added. 'It will continue efforts to weaken US influence in the Indo-Pacific,' said Davidson. 'Whether or not China launches an invasion in 2027, it will continue efforts to weaken US influence in the Indo-Pacific,' he added. 'Alternative deadlines have been proposed, including 2035 and 2049, both of which mark major PLA anniversaries,' Su noted. 'However, if Xi seeks a fourth term, he may take military risks to justify his leadership,' he warned.

**Taiwan Warns of Potential Chinese Invasion in 2027**
Taiwan has announced that China may invade the island in 2027, citing a document released by the Taiwanese government to inform lawmakers about future military exercises. The document mentions that China's Communist Party is preparing its army to invade Taiwan and occupy it in 2027. According to the authors of the publication, the year 2027 is not mentioned in any publicly available documents containing plans for previous large-scale military exercises over the past 10 years. '2027 is a potential date for a Chinese attack that could be a way to overcome the opposition in the Taiwanese parliament, where opposition parties deny plans for military spending,' said Jack Chen, director of the Formosa Defense Vision human rights group. He added that it could force the opposition in parliament to feel that increasing the military budget is a pressing need. One of the markers of China's readiness to attack Taiwan is the Chinese leader Xi Jinping's demand to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to 'become modern' by 2027 and a world-class army by 2047. Additionally, US officials have warned Taiwan about the threat of invasion in 2027, when China plans to increase the number of fighter jets, warships, and double its stockpiles of conventional ballistic and cruise missiles. 'Chinese troops are demonstratively conducting aggressive military exercises around Taiwan, and the official rhetoric of Beijing consists of threats against the island,' the authors of the publication added.

**How China is secretly preparing for an invasion of Taiwan**
China is secretly preparing for an invasion of Taiwan, with President Xi Jinping aiming to be in a position to invade by 2027. The US is trying to ramp up its semiconductor chip production, but current projections suggest it won't be anywhere close to self-sufficiency before the end of this decade. China's aggressive shipbuilding strategy and provocative incursions into Taiwan shipping lanes and airspace point to an imminent invasion. The US has not ruled out military action, but so far is confining itself to demands of safe conduct for Taiwan's politicians, journalists and leading businessmen, who are under mass arrest. Japan has offered support to Taiwan, and a hastily assembled task force has set sail from Yokosuka Naval Base. The invasion of Taiwan has now become full-blown war between Japan and China, with the US launching a missile attack on Chinese transport ships in the Taiwan Strait. China has responded with a hypersonic missile attack on the US fleet, badly damaging one Constellation class frigate defending the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt. President Xi has threatened to use a nuclear warhead if the US does not withdraw its Navy, and the situation has escalated into a global conflict.
