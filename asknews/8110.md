**Trump's Visit to Saudi Arabia: Will it Mark a New Era of Normalization with Israel?**
US President Donald Trump is expected to visit Saudi Arabia as part of a tour of three Gulf countries (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE). The visit will focus on economic cooperation, investments, arms sales, and artificial intelligence. Trump is expected to sign deals worth over $100 billion, including the sale of F-35 fighter jets to the Saudi air force. The visit is seen as a priority for Trump's administration to strengthen the strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia. Trump has expressed his confidence that Saudi Arabia will join the Abraham Accords, a normalization agreement between Israel and several Arab countries. However, the Saudi government has stated that normalization with Israel is conditional on progress in the Palestinian issue, including recognition of a Palestinian state. The current tensions in the region, particularly due to the war in Gaza, may hinder any progress in this direction. Nevertheless, there are indications of a growing cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Israel, particularly in the field of defense. The Saudi government has been easing its diplomatic restrictions with Israel in recent years, although it has not yet announced full normalization of relations. The upcoming visit of Trump to Saudi Arabia may see direct discussions on normalization, in the context of pushing the 'Deal of the Century' American initiative. The current regional situation, particularly the Iranian threat and its allies in the region, may push Saudi Arabia to take stronger steps towards military cooperation with Israel to secure its interests. Normalization may include enhanced cooperation in regional security, with the fight against the Houthis in Yemen being a key priority. Saudi Arabia, under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is seeking to achieve its Vision 2030, a ambitious plan to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil. One of the key pillars of this vision is to achieve regional stability, where Saudi Arabia seeks to resolve the issues that may hinder the development of the region economically. Saudi Arabia has started this path since five years ago, seeking to calm tensions in Yemen, and in March 2023, the kingdom signed a historic agreement with Iran with Chinese mediation, reflecting a strategic shift towards regional stability. The March 2023 agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran was a major step towards easing tensions between the two countries, which had been strained for decades due to regional competition and proxy wars in several areas such as Yemen, Iraq, and Syria. The signing of the agreement under Chinese auspices represents a significant shift in Saudi policy, which had previously relied on the US to counter Iranian expansion in the region. This agreement contributes to improving the security and economic situation within the kingdom, and enhances the chances of investments and reduces tensions that may affect the plans of Vision 2030. In this context, Saudi Arabia may consider normalization with Israel as a key step towards strengthening its relationship with the United States. Since the signing of the Abraham Accords between Israel and Arab countries such as the UAE and Bahrain under American pressure, Saudi Arabia has found itself in a position that may require rapprochement with Tel Aviv to ensure the strengthening of the strategic alliance with Washington. Normalization with Israel may be seen as a way for Saudi Arabia to document its security relationship with the United States, which remains a key ally in the face of regional challenges. This move may enhance cooperation in technological, defense, and economic fields, in line with the goals of Vision 2030. On the other hand, normalization with Israel may be seen as a 'concession' by Saudi Arabia to the US, as American pressure on the kingdom to reach normalization agreements with Israel increases, especially in the face of the geostrategic changes in the region. This may strengthen the alliance between Saudi Arabia and the US, at a time when security challenges from Iran are increasing, and also enhance Saudi Arabia's ability to attract Western investments and advanced technology within the framework of Vision 2030.

**A Change in the Middle East: Israel's Response to Hamas and the Consequences**
The 19 months since October 7, 2023, have marked a significant change in the Middle East. Prior to that date, the region was characterized by a state of military silence, with Israel's security forces relying on a theory that terrorism was afraid of a strong Israeli military response and therefore would not act against Israel. However, Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, Syrians, and Iraqis were not part of this theory. They were all receiving Iranian arms and funding, preparing for the 'D-Day' invasion of Israel, which would be complemented by Iran's acquisition of atomic weapons. However, the silence had a deceptive quality, as not all participants knew the hidden rules of the game, and some acted independently, sometimes hindering the planned development. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia, the most Western countries in the Gulf, saw the silence as an opportunity to develop their countries peacefully, taking advantage of the enormous income from oil before the world stopped needing it. They sought good relations with the State of Israel as a key to fortifying their peaceful plans. The UAE and Bahrain were the first to take this path. Saudi Arabia, the most representative country of the Muslim world, took its time, but its leaders were already expressing their intention to normalize relations with Israel. The public expressions of Saudi Arabia sparked fear in Iran and its allies, who would lose all excuses for not normalizing relations with Israel, including the lack of a solution to the Palestinian problem. This fear led Hamas to act on October 7, 2023, knowing that a strong Israeli military response would automatically lead to a unified anti-Israel position from the Arab and Muslim world, weakening the normalization process. The event on October 7, 2023, was a miracle for Israel, as the 'daydream' in which the Israeli leadership was enveloped exploded with the death of 1400 people and the kidnapping (by Hamas) of 255 living and dead Israelis. Hamas 'got drunk' with the success of October 7, 2023, and Muslim multitudes saw with their own eyes (with the help of Hamas videos) how 'the Jews' were humiliated and defeated. There were massive demonstrations of support for Hamas in Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Lebanon, and other Arab countries. Israel, confused, began to correct the situation on October 7, 2023, while thinking about how to react to the Hamas invasion. Recovering the invaded territory was relatively easy, but recovering the hostages was a difficult task that would prolong the military victory against Hamas. However, the Israeli people reacted almost homogeneously, supporting the government and the army. The young generation of Israelis 'roared' their desire to participate in the effort to restore national pride lost by Hamas. Since that crucial moment, Hamas has counted its enormous losses, but not only Hamas...also Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Syrians who saw the disaster of their army, the Houthis who are bombed again and again, and even Iran, whose installations were bombed not less than twice. Not only did the Israeli people demand action, but the army itself recovered and demonstrated its military quality throughout the Middle East. Along with the gradual recovery of the hostages (almost 200 of the original 255), the death of 60,000 Palestinians (a considerable part of them Hamas terrorists), the death of the Hezbollah military leadership in Lebanon, and thousands of Hezbollah terrorists, Israel has established its troops in the south of that country, in the northwest of Syria, and, of course, in the Gaza Strip itself, which has been destroyed to the point of being uninhabitable for its own population. The Israeli response is not yet over...but we are on the way to it...The Hamas issue is in its final stages...the Houthis are on their way...and, of course...Iran...whose dying gasps are heard from a distance...before receiving the final blow to its Atomic Plan...But the most significant thing is the change in the bitter consciousness of the Israeli population that there is no need to wait for peace in the Western sense of the word...and the most that can be expected is that the Muslim and Arab enemy will respect us for our military strength and resilience.

**Trump and the Gulf Allies' Pressure on Netanyahu to Prevent a War on Gaza and Iran**
As the 600-day war on Gaza continues, it has become the longest war by the Israeli occupation. The failure of the regular armies to achieve their goals against armed groups is evident. The Israeli army, one of the strongest in the region, has failed to achieve 'complete victory' as claimed by Netanyahu, who has failed to achieve his war goals. The war has become a stalemate with no end in sight, and the 90th day of the blockade on Gaza has deepened the division and conflict within the Palestinian factions. The recent performance of the Israeli team, such as their 4-2 victory against Atl√©tico Madrid, which secured their place in the Champions League semi-finals, contrasts with the unreliable Wi-Fi in the press area of Signal Iduna Park during the game, which failed every two minutes. The Israeli government has announced the prevention of a delegation of foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, Jordan, Qatar, and Turkey from entering Ramallah to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. It is clear that the pressure from Trump and his Gulf allies is ongoing to prevent Netanyahu from sabotaging the Gaza ceasefire and nuclear talks with Iran, and to serve our common interests, not Netanyahu's. The concerns today are that Netanyahu will escape and mix the cards to prevent the nuclear agreement with Iran, leading to a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, which will eliminate the chances of reaching a nuclear agreement sought by President Trump through five rounds of negotiations and the sixth has not been scheduled by Oman mediation. In the time when President Trump prefers to give diplomacy a chance to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear program and reduce tensions and avoid a war that no one wants, as explained by the Gulf leaders to President Trump during his Gulf visit, it seems that Netanyahu is determined to achieve his dream of destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities and striking its facilities, which he has been pursuing for decades with the American-Israeli lobby. Especially since the Israeli intelligence assessment sees that the window of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons is approaching and Iran can acquire a nuclear bomb within months, despite the fatwa by Imam Khamenei prohibiting the acquisition of nuclear weapons, but the fatwa may change - 'necessity justifies the prohibited.' Therefore, we understand the Gulf concern about the wrong calculations and Netanyahu's recklessness. According to Reuters and the American website Axios, which is close to the American and Israeli institutions, the Saudi Defense Minister has conveyed a message to the Iranian leadership to Ayatollah Khamenei on April 17, warning that failure to reach a nuclear agreement with the United States (five indirect negotiations between the Iranian and American sides mediated by Oman) will expose Iran to an Israeli attack!! The Israeli media has reported that the opposition leaders, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and President of the UAE Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, who met with President Trump during his Gulf visit, have rejected any Israeli military action against Iran and are concerned that their countries will be exposed to an Iranian attack if Israel launches a strike on Iran!! Despite Trump's warning to Netanyahu not to launch a military strike against Iran, especially since the chances of reaching a nuclear agreement with Iran are very close to avoiding escalation in the region and the fall of bombs in the Middle East, Netanyahu continues to exert pressure and leak scenarios of a military strike. The goal of Israel is to neutralize the Gaza front by accepting Weitzman's proposal with Hamas for a 60-day ceasefire and prisoner exchange and the introduction of aid. Despite not meeting Hamas's conditions: a complete ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and guarantees against the resumption of the war on Gaza, Hamas is under great pressure to accept the proposal. The Israeli Chief of Staff, Zamir, is pressuring Hamas with a psychological war, claiming that an agreement has been reached with Hamas, allowing Israel to focus on facing Iran. It is clear that the pressure from Trump on Netanyahu and his government, with the continued support of the Gulf allies, is ongoing to prevent Netanyahu from sabotaging the Gaza ceasefire and nuclear talks with Iran, and to serve our common interests, not Netanyahu's and his extremists!!

**Reuters articles**
The White House has sent Iran a 'detailed and acceptable proposal' for a nuclear deal, with US President Trump saying 'it's in their best interest to accept it.' Iran's Foreign Ministry has received the offer and will respond within 30 days. Meanwhile, the US is pushing the UN nuclear watchdog to declare Iran in breach of its duties, which would likely enrage the Islamic Republic and complicate its nuclear talks. In other news, Turkey has ordered the detention of dozens of opposition officials in a crackdown, while the West is pushing for a declaration that Iran is violating its non-proliferation obligations. Iran has protested an Austrian intelligence report that says its nuclear program is 'well-advanced,' and has summoned a British diplomat over the arrest of its nationals in the UK. The US has terminated $60 million in Harvard grants, citing the university's failure to address antisemitism, and has warned Iran that it will risk war with Israel if it doesn't reach an agreement with the US. Saudi Arabia has warned Iran to reach an agreement with the US or risk war with Israel, and the US has announced a $10 billion Qatari investment in a US military base in the region. The US has also downgraded its bombers deployed in the Middle East, citing lower tensions with Houthis and Iran.

**Saudi Arabia Warns Iran of Israeli Strikes and War in Secret Message**
Saudi Arabia's Defense Minister, Khalid bin Salman, delivered a secret message to Iran's leadership, warning them that they must take US President Donald Trump's offer to negotiate a new nuclear deal 'seriously' as it represents a way to avoid the risk of war with Israel or Israeli strikes. According to Reuters, citing sources close to the Saudi government and Iranian officials, King Salman bin Abdulaziz sent his son Khalid bin Salman to Tehran with a warning addressed to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The meeting, which took place on April 17 at the presidential complex, was attended by President Ebrahim Raisi, Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri, and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. While the media covered Khalid bin Salman's visit, the content of the secret message had not been previously reported. The message included a warning to Iranian officials that Trump is not patient with prolonged negotiations, according to the sources. Khalid bin Salman told a group of Iranian officials that the Trump team wants to reach an agreement quickly and that the diplomatic window will close soon, saying it would be better to reach an agreement with the US rather than facing the risk of an Israeli attack if the talks collapse, according to Reuters. In the meeting, Raisi replied that Iran wants an agreement to ease economic pressure by lifting Western sanctions, according to the sources. The sources added that the Saudis assured the Iranians that they want to avoid war, as war and confrontation with Iran would have negative consequences for them and their economic ambitions. However, the Iranian officials expressed concern over Trump's 'unpredictable' approach in the negotiations, which has shifted from allowing limited uranium enrichment to demanding the complete dismantling of Iran's uranium enrichment program. Khalid bin Salman also assured Tehran that Riyadh 'will not allow the US or Israel to use its territory or airspace in any potential military operation against Iran,' according to the sources. One Iranian source told Reuters that Raisi emphasized Iran's commitment to reaching an agreement, but that Iran is not willing to sacrifice its nuclear program for a deal that Trump wants. The Iranian government did not respond to a request for comment before the report was published, but after publication, the Foreign Ministry's spokesperson, Saeed Khatibzadeh, 'categorically denied' the Reuters report, according to the Iranian semi-official news agency Fars. The Saudi government also did not respond to a request for comment.

**US and Saudi Arabia Expected to Discuss Nuclear Deal During Trump's Visit**
The US and Saudi Arabia are expected to discuss a nuclear deal during Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia next month. The deal aims to help Saudi Arabia build a commercial nuclear industry. Saudi Arabia, a global oil giant, is seeking to diversify its economy and develop its mining and metal processing sectors, including its uranium reserves, which are used as fuel for nuclear reactors. The US is eager to provide technological assistance to Saudi Arabia in its pursuit of building nuclear reactors, which would be a boon for American companies. Internationally, there is support for the US efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia, as the Saudis may turn to China and Russia for help in developing their nuclear industry, with less guarantees. As Hassan Al-Hassan, a prominent fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain, said, 'If the US does not provide these assistance, someone else will.' The US is seeking big talks with Saudi Arabia on this condition, especially since the US administration is eager to make this nuclear deal happen. Previously, the US had demanded that Saudi Arabia normalize its relations with Israel as a condition for progress in nuclear cooperation talks. However, this demand has been dropped, and the US is now focused on reaching a deal with Saudi Arabia. The US and Saudi Arabia are on the verge of signing a strategic agreement that includes cooperation in various energy fields, including civilian nuclear technology. The agreement is expected to include joint projects in renewable energy, enabling Saudi Arabia to move forward with its peaceful nuclear project, and promoting clean energy investments. It will also involve the exchange of technology through various partnerships.

**Saudi Arabia Warns Iran: Accept Nuclear Deal or Face Israeli Strike**

**Saudi-US Nuclear Deal: A New Era of Cooperation?**
According to sources, the US has dropped the condition of normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel as a prerequisite for progress in nuclear cooperation talks with the kingdom. This comes ahead of a visit by US President Donald Trump to the region, including Saudi Arabia, without intending to visit Israel, which has sparked widespread Israeli concern about 'American surprise policy'. The sources said that the US dropping the normalization condition is seen as a 'big concession' by Washington, especially after the previous US administration's hardline stance, which linked nuclear cooperation with Saudi Arabia to normalization and a defense treaty. Saudi Arabia aims to develop a civilian nuclear program as part of its Vision 2030, to diversify energy sources and reduce dependence on oil. However, the US still requires Saudi Arabia to sign the 123 agreement, under the US Atomic Energy Act, which prohibits local uranium enrichment. The US also seeks to ensure that the Saudi nuclear program is not used for military purposes. The Saudi economy has not been immune to US efforts, with Saudi Arabia planning to invest billions of dollars in the US, up to $1 trillion to support the American economy. The kingdom sees this as a boost to economic relations between the two countries. However, the Saudi conditions for starting the project have not stopped at US demands. The kingdom wants to enrich uranium locally, which raises international and American concerns about nuclear proliferation in the region. Saudi Arabia also wants US security guarantees before moving forward with any agreement, including a defense treaty. The kingdom had dropped its efforts to sign a defense treaty with the US last year in exchange for normalization with Israel, and announced that it is moving towards a 'more modest' agreement on military cooperation between the two countries. The obstacle to normalization and signing the Abraham Accords with Israel, from the Saudi perspective, is the failure to establish a Palestinian state, which has been exacerbated by the recent war in Gaza, increasing the complexity of the issue. These rapid developments have caused concern in Israel, with Israeli media labeling them as 'surprise policy' of President Trump, which has been mostly related to US cooperation with Saudi Arabia without normalization with Israel. This surprise has united the Israeli government and opposition, with opposition leader Yair Lapid calling for not staying silent about the negotiations, which could lead to a 'nuclear arms race in the region'. Despite the US dropping the normalization condition, an agreement between Saudi Arabia and the US is still far off, with challenges related to local enrichment and security guarantees, until all eyes are turned to the region with anticipation for what Trump has announced as 'pleasant surprises' in the near future.

**US Drops Requirement for Saudi Arabia to Normalize Relations with Israel for Nuclear Deal**
The US no longer requires Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel as a condition for progress in negotiations on civil nuclear cooperation, according to Reuters citing sources. In August 2023, Washington and Riyadh agreed on a plan to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. However, negotiations were frozen after the start of the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas in October 2023. 'The United States no longer requires Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel as a condition for progress in negotiations on civil nuclear cooperation,' the statement said. However, according to the source, there is still a long way to go before the agreement is reached, even without the requirement for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel. One of the obstacles to the deal is the US Atomic Energy Act, which allows cooperation with other countries in developing peaceful nuclear potential, but contains non-proliferation criteria, including restrictions on uranium enrichment. The source added that one of the discussed ways to resolve this disagreement is to allow only American personnel to access the uranium enrichment facility on Saudi Arabian territory. The US began the process of normalizing relations between Israel and Arab countries in 2020, when the 'Abraham Accords' were signed with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Sudan. However, Sudan only verbally supported the agreements in 2021 due to internal disagreements between the government and the military, preventing full cooperation.

**Gaza Foils the Romance: The Saudi-Israeli Normalization Deal on Hold**
The relationship between Saudi Arabia and Israel is in a state of 'forbidden love', amidst regional events that have turned the tables on the parties involved. Before October 7th, the indicators were clear: a normalization deal between Riyadh and Tel Aviv was closer than ever. However, the Gaza bloodshed changed the equation, turning the normalization project into a 'diplomatic corpse' on hold. The Israeli massacres in the Gaza Strip and daily violations against Palestinians have brought the Arab street back to the forefront, forcing Saudi Arabia to hesitate in making a decision, fearing a wave of popular anger that could jeopardize its 'Vision 2030'. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has chosen to ease tensions with Iran through political channels, making the Iranian threat, which was previously a reason for rapprochement with Israel, less pressing. As a result, one of the key pillars that justified the normalization process has collapsed. From the Israeli side, things are not better. Israel is more radical, more preoccupied with its internal security, and less open to discussing issues like the two-state solution or the transfer of East Jerusalem, making the deal, which was described as 'historic', vulnerable to freezing or even collapse. The voices in the Saudi street opposing any rapprochement with the occupation have dominated social media, amidst intense pressure on the Saudi leadership after the disturbing images from Gaza, which coincided with unofficial Israeli-Gulf meetings. As the political landscape has turned into an open field for changes, many questions remain unanswered: Will bin Salman dare to ignore the popular mood? Can Netanyahu move forward with normalization while his government continues to crush Palestinians? Or was it all just a 'passing infatuation' that was abandoned before being officially announced? In the end, Palestine remains the knot of the Middle East, and normalization remains a dream that is still 'hanging by a broken plane wing' due to the blood of Gaza and the pulse of the people.

**Saudi-US Alliance May Lead to Nuclear Deal, Sparking Israeli Concerns**
Saudi Arabia's recent announcement of its intention to develop a nuclear program, including uranium enrichment and production of 'yellow cake', has raised concerns among Israel and the international community about the region becoming a nuclear competition arena, especially with the escalation of talks about potential Saudi-US negotiations that could allow the kingdom to access advanced nuclear technology. According to Channel 12, one of 'Israel's worst nightmares' may come true through an unexpected alliance between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and US President Donald Trump, amid Saudi Arabia's sharp condemnation of Israeli policies, with Riyadh condemning Tel Aviv five times in just one week, abandoning traditional diplomatic language. The strongest condemnation came after the Israeli attack on the 'Mamdaani Hospital' in Gaza, which the Saudi Foreign Ministry described as 'the heinous crime', expressing its rejection of 'the blatant violations of international law'. Despite bin Salman's speech two years ago about a 'historic agreement' to normalize relations with Israel, the recent Saudi statements on the war on Gaza indicate a fundamental shift. According to Channel 12, Riyadh has become linking any future agreement with Washington to a basic condition: establishing a Palestinian state or a clear roadmap for it, which is confirmed by King Salman and his crown prince openly, contrary to previous practices. In a surprise that sparked Israeli panic, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that the Trump administration is holding talks with Saudi Arabia to enable it to access American nuclear technology, including local uranium enrichment. He explained: 'The details have not been determined yet, but it is possible, and it may include enrichment within Saudi Arabia'. This statement is seen in Israel as a blow to its security strategy, where the military institution has warned that allowing Saudi Arabia to enrich uranium would open the door for Iran to enhance its nuclear program under the pretext of 'double standards', and it would weaken the Israeli argument against Tehran. The report notes that the Biden administration had required linking any defensive or nuclear agreement with Riyadh to normalization with Israel, but the Trump administration seems ready to bypass this condition. The Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid expressed his concern, calling on Netanyahu to pressure Washington to prevent the deal. A document revealed by the New York Times shows that Trump prevented an Israeli attack planned against Iran, which strengthened Saudi Arabia's new direction. With the decline of the likelihood of a military confrontation with Tehran, Riyadh no longer sees normalization with Israel as a priority, especially in light of the ongoing war on Gaza. Riyadh is preparing to receive Trump, where a comprehensive deal is expected to be discussed, including a nuclear agreement and Saudi investments in the US worth $600 billion. According to Channel 12, this deal 'will change the face of the Middle East', but it may pass without any concessions to Israel, which faces increasing isolation with its focus on the Gaza prisoners' crisis.

**Saudi Arabia's Calculations on Normalizing Relations with Israel**
According to 'The Hill', despite the Trump administration's clear priority on normalizing relations with Israel, the calculations for Saudi Arabia are more complex. Despite the promise of economic and security incentives, the reality is that Saudi Arabia may not see significant gains from joining the Abraham Accords at this time. The kingdom already has the ability to access the US market and can follow its economic diversification plan in Vision 2030 without establishing formal diplomatic relations with Israel. The more important issue is the current weakness of Iran, which raises the question of whether Saudi Arabia should make a significant geostrategic shift without knowing how US policy will be towards Tehran first. The potential reaction of Arab and Muslim populations on a wider scale, due to the importance of Saudi Arabia's religious and cultural significance, poses a significant risk unless a clear path is established regarding the Palestinian state. The economic argument in favor of normalization is less convincing than some may think. Proponents point to increased foreign direct investment and expanded trade partnerships as benefits of joining the accords, but Saudi Arabia is already well-integrated into the global markets, with foreign direct investment increasing by 37% to over $4 billion in 2024. The kingdom's economic transformation is largely self-driven, with the Public Investment Fund injecting billions of dollars into US technology, entertainment, and infrastructure, securing profitable partnerships with Western companies. China has also invested heavily in Saudi Arabia, helping the kingdom to advance its ambitious economic agenda. On the security front, some argue that normalizing relations with Israel would help to solidify the anti-Iran alliance, enhance intelligence sharing and military coordination, but Iran is no longer the existential threat it once was. After being crippled by sanctions, internal turmoil, and regional setbacks, Tehran is no longer in a position to launch the aggressive campaigns that defined its foreign policy in the past. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia remains cautious about Washington's shift in policy towards Iran. The Obama administration sought diplomacy, leading to the 2015 nuclear deal, while Trump took a hardline stance, withdrawing from the deal and reimposing sanctions. The Biden administration has signaled openness to engagement, creating more uncertainty. With Trump's return to office, he may attempt to negotiate a separate deal with Iran, which could undermine Saudi interests. In the absence of a long-term US strategy, Riyadh is justified in hesitating before making irreversible commitments. Beyond economics and security, Saudi Arabia's unique religious and cultural position makes normalization a riskier path than it was for Bahrain or the UAE. As the custodian of the two holiest sites in Islam, Mecca and Medina, Saudi Arabia is closely tied to the Arab and Muslim world. The kingdom's identity and influence depend on its role as the heart of the Islamic world. Palestine remains a highly emotional and political issue in the region, and normalization without a clear path for a Palestinian state could spark widespread outrage. Tourism is another factor. Saudi Arabia welcomes millions of Muslim pilgrims for the Hajj and Umrah every year, with many of these visitors coming from countries where public opinion is strongly pro-Palestinian. Saudi Arabia's swift rejection of Trump's idea shows its reluctance to compromise on what it considers a vital Arab and Islamic issue. By delaying normalization, Riyadh maintains its influence. The kingdom can stand firm to secure greater concessions, whether in the form of security guarantees, advanced weaponry, or tangible political commitments on Palestine. If Washington wants Riyadh to sign on, it must be prepared to offer more. Just as the US prioritizes its 'America First' approach, Saudi Arabia is deeply committed to its 'Saudi Arabia First' strategy.'

**Saudi Arabia and Israel: A Strategic Partnership in the Making**
Saudi Arabia and Israel share strategic interests, such as economic cooperation and the challenge of Iran, despite the agreement facilitated by China between Saudi Arabia and Tehran in March 2023. Normalizing relations between Riyadh and Jerusalem could set an example for other Gulf monarchies. However, the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, triggered the war in Gaza and shifted the diplomatic recognition between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Mohamed Bin Salman (MBS), Saudi Arabia's crown prince, said before the attack that 'we are getting closer every day' and after it, that 'it's off the table.' The Saudi prince wants to complete his 'Vision 2030' project successfully, modernizing the economy, opening up society to new trends, and incorporating women into the workforce. MBS also aims to become king as soon as possible, even before his father's death in 2025, and wants to do so with maximum political legitimacy. Saudi Arabia wants to improve its relations with the United States, its main security guarantor and ally. The normalization with Jerusalem is not an end in itself for Riyadh, but a means to achieve its goals from the US. China is the explanation behind this transaction between Saudi Arabia and the US on Israel. Washington is very concerned about Beijing's relations with Riyadh and the growing influence of Chinese diplomacy in Arab Gulf monarchies in technology, economy, and security. The US needs to 'disentangle' China from the Middle East, the Gulf, and Saudi Arabia in particular. The understanding offered by the US to MBS seeks to reduce China's preeminence in some strategic areas for the Saudis, such as 5G, artificial intelligence, or defense. MBS could not sign the recognition of Israel before the Gaza war ended. The Saudi prince had designed an alternative plan that consisted of separating his treaty with Washington on nuclear development, security, and arms supply from the normalization with Israel. Jerusalem seeks this understanding with Riyadh because it would not only formalize the tacit and discreet cooperation between the two countries in recent years, but also change Israel's situation in the region and the world spectacularly. The RAS is the most important Arab country in the world, has one of the most thriving economies in the Middle East, and is the custodian of two sacred places of Islam, Mecca and Medina, its cradle and center, respectively. Israel would open the door to understanding with other Muslim countries by formalizing its relationship with the RAS, either in the Gulf or in Asia, where it is already negotiating with Indonesia under the radar, the country with the largest Muslim population in the world. Iran would be harmed by an agreement between Riyadh and Jerusalem, although it is naive to think that the RAS would join Israel in a war against Tehran, despite the discreet help the RAS provided to neutralize the Iranian attack on Israeli territory in April 2024. Arab countries in the region deal with Israel only to cover their risks with Iran. What the RAS needs to normalize its relations with Israel is for the release of Israeli hostages in the hands of Hamas and a ceasefire in Gaza to have continuity with the end of the war and the design of a reconstruction plan for the Strip. The source of legitimacy that MBS seeks for his reign is to become the savior of the Palestinians and initiate a process towards the creation of a Palestinian state. The path will be slow and partial, although optimism has grown with the winning card of President Donald J. Trump, who knows the region and its main players well. MBS needs a hug from Trump, not a punch from Biden, and hopes for an invitation to Washington or for Trump to visit Jerusalem and Riyadh, as long as there are reasons to justify it.

**Netanyahu Links Normalization with Saudi Arabia to Iran's Nuclear Program**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that reaching an agreement to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia is contingent upon Israel confirming that Iran does not possess nuclear weapons. This condition is part of Israel's strategy to reconfigure the Middle East's alliance map, according to the Hebrew website 'Wint'. Netanyahu explained in an interview with American network 'Fox News' that normalization with Riyadh will become possible 'when the change in the Middle East is completed, and when Israel cuts off the Iranian axis more than it has done so far'. He also mentioned that he discussed this issue during his last meeting in Washington with US President Donald Trump, where preventing Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons was a central topic. Netanyahu added that eliminating Hamas and depriving Iran of developing its nuclear program will be crucial factors in achieving a normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region.

**US-Saudi ties: Stalemate sustains (Opinion) - Social News XYZ**
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent visit to Saudi Arabia aimed to restore strained relations between the two countries. However, the visit seemed to be an effort from the US President to cajole America's one-time ally, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, to improve ties with the US. The Saudis want guarantees that the US will stand with them in the face of any threat from Iran, as well as an increase in their nuclear capability and no American interference in human rights issues. They also want to be designated as a Major Defence Partner (MDP) of the US and have Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty extended to Saudi Arabia. However, these demands may backfire due to the trust deficit between the US lawmakers and leaders. The article suggests that the Saudis could be better served by moving unilaterally to normalise ties with Israel, which may lead to a favourable response from the Americans and address the goodwill deficit at the Capitol Hill.
