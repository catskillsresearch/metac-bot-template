More than 13.5 million people have already voted for objects of improvement that will be updated in 2026, said Vladimir Yakushev, secretary of the General Council of 'United Russia'. The voting, organized by the party together with the Ministry of Construction of Russia, will last until June 12. Over 6,000 objects from more than 1,600 municipalities have been put up for discussion. 'Residents of Kemerovo region, St. Petersburg, Khanty-Mansiysk, Bashkiria, Buryatia, Crimea, Mari El, Sverdlovsk and Tula regions, Sakhalin, Chechnya, Perm Krai actively vote,' Yakushev said. 'I would like to note that high engagement of residents in the procedure of selecting objects of improvement is shown by the front-line Belgorod and Kursk regions,' he added. According to Yakushev, the project 'Comfortable Urban Environment' was created based on the 'City Environment' project of the United Russia party, and its implementation is one of the provisions of the party's people's program. 'Together, we have already managed to improve over 110,000 public and yard territories, of which 72,000 are yards. Also, ten contests of the best projects for creating a comfortable urban environment have been held. And in total, about 40 million citizens have participated in the project over five years,' Yakushev said. In the implementation of the events to form a comfortable urban environment, more than 1,500 municipalities in 88 subjects of Russia and the city of Baykonur participate every year. The organizers of the project plan to improve 30,000 public territories from 2025 to 2030. In 2024, 17.2 million people participated in the all-Russian voting, 3 million more than the previous year. Almost 96,000 people are residents of the Donetsk People's Republic, the Luhansk People's Republic, and the Zaporizhzhia region. For the first time, residents of the Kherson region and the city of Baykonur joined the voting. 214,800 volunteers participated in the organization of the voting. Residents of Russia chose objects of improvement from a large list, which included 5,400 territories from more than 1,500 municipalities. From 2025, the 'Comfortable Urban Environment' program will continue to be implemented as part of the new national project 'Infrastructure for Life',

**Balochistan Engages Religious Scholars To Promote ‘Family Planning’ Efforts - Daily Parliament Times**
The Balochistan government has launched a new initiative to promote family planning efforts by engaging 150 religious scholars across 31 districts. These scholars, designated as Family Planning Assistants, receive honorariums and Islamic literature emphasizing the Islamic legitimacy of responsible family planning, reproductive health, parental responsibility, and child welfare. Maulana Mula Dad, one of the scholars, says, 'We deliver our message through the lens of Islamic values – that every individual is entitled to a healthy life, proper education, and financial stability.' The initiative aims to promote healthier families and create a sustainable balance between population growth and available resources. The province's population has grown from 1.2 million in the early 1950s to 14.8 million in 2023, with an annual growth rate of 3.2%. If this trajectory persists, the population could double by 2045, placing unsustainable pressure on employment, housing, education, and healthcare services. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns that if growth remains above 2%, the province will require 6.5 million new employment opportunities, one million homes, and over 7,000 educational institutions by 2040.

**Indigenous Communities in Venezuela Elect Representatives to National Assembly**
Indigenous communities in Venezuela began voting on Sunday to elect their three representatives to the National Assembly, a process that will allow them to complete the 285 seats in the Legislature. This is the first time the vote is being held in the Guayana Esequiba territory, considered by Caracas as the 24th state. According to Minister of Indigenous Peoples Clara Vidal, 'This is a reassertion that we, the indigenous peoples and communities, choose our own leaders and leaders, who will be at the forefront of this great responsibility.' Vidal added that the vote is an exercise of empowerment. The three representatives will be elected for the period 2026-2031. The vote is also being held in nine regions of the country, including the states of Anzoátegui, Amazonas, and Zulia. A total of 6,451 indigenous representatives are participating in the vote, representing 169,451 indigenous people from 3,952 communities. The vote is a result of the Organic Law for the Defense of Guayana Esequiba, which was promulgated in April 2024 after the referendum on the Esequibo in December 2023.

**Trump's 2024 Victory Could Pave the Way for National Popular Vote**
Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US presidential election could be a turning point for the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, a plan to abolish the Electoral College and have the president elected by national popular vote. The compact has been gaining support, with 17 states and the District of Columbia having adopted it, and several more considering it. Patrick Rosenstiel, a leading advisor to the compact, said, 'It's only a matter of time' before the plan is implemented. The compact would require states with a total of 270 electoral votes to adopt it, and would give their electoral votes to the candidate who wins the most popular votes nationwide. Critics argue that the plan is unconstitutional and could lead to a constitutional crisis. However, Rosenstiel believes that the plan would make every American voter and every voting district politically relevant, and would lead to a more stable and democratic system. 'If we have a system where every American voter and every voting district is politically relevant, we will be better at living with results,' he said. 'And honestly, our institutions will maintain the credibility they should have.'

**More than half of young people will face health problems by 2030**
A new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, more than 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity and overweight have increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The document also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. In 2016, fewer than 1,000 adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, but by 2021, the number had already exceeded 1.1 billion. Another concerning aspect is the role that climate change and technology will play. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with an average annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. According to UN estimates, by 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24. This generation faces a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.

**US and Mexico's Efforts to Curb Migration Flows**
According to the US Customs and Border Protection, since the executive order in June 2024, there has been a significant and continuous decrease in illegal border crossings, with a drop of over 55% in encounters at ports of entry along the southwest border. In September 2023, 218,763 people were arrested at the southern border, while in September 2024, the number dropped to 53,858, less than a quarter of the previous year. Since June, the US has tripled the percentage of foreigners processed through Expedited Removal. By the end of September, over 160,000 people had been returned to more than 145 countries. In total, in the 2024 fiscal year, 271,484 people were deported from 192 countries, of which 261,116 were Latin Americans. Luis Enrique Calva Sánchez, a researcher at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte, explains that behind these numbers are international government efforts: 'Various countries, not just the US, have implemented measures to curb migration flows. For example, in Panama, the number of irregular entries through the Darien jungle decreased by 41%, from 520,082 to 302,203 people.' Abbdel Camargo Martínez notes that attempts to curb migration flows have been carried out throughout the region in 2024: 'There is a local, regional, and continental explanation, not just in the US-Mexico border. There are concrete actions in Central America and South America, particularly in the Darien Tap, that are reducing the number of people arriving at the Mexico-US border and, therefore, the number of detentions.' The researcher at the Colegio de la Frontera Sur (ECOSUR) also points to 'US initiatives to intervene in countries in Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala, and the pressures that also fell on Mexico to control the flow.' Calva warns that while the actions implemented by various countries, such as the US, Mexico, and Panama, 'appear to be effective in curbing the mobility of migrant people, they also generate significant risks to their security and well-being.' He also emphasizes that 'these strategies do not address the structural causes that drive migration. The long-term solution lies in addressing the factors that force people to migrate, rather than focusing solely on restrictive measures.'

**What to know about the US Senate's effort to block vehicle-emission rules in California**
The US Senate is expected to vote on a measure to block California's rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The rule, which requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, has been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and is supported by several states, including New York, Colorado, and New Mexico. However, Senate Majority Leader John Thune argues that the rule is an 'improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority' and would 'endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation's energy supply.' California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state air regulators say the measure is illegal and will likely sue if it advances. The Biden administration restored California's ability to enforce its standards in 2022, and the state has set a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2045. However, the state remains far short of what is eventually needed, with only about 84,000 public electric vehicle chargers in the state, but needing 1.2 million by 2030 to support the EV transition.

**Legal immigration is protecting blue state electoral power**
The 2030 congressional reapportionment could be a disaster for Democrats, with reliably Democratic states losing 13 congressional seats. However, mass immigration under Biden's policies has helped to pad these losses, with blue states gaining 1.7 million immigrants between 2020 and 2024. This influx of immigrants has helped to protect some of the electoral losses for Democrats, depriving red states of their rightful representation. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, the foreign-born population in the United States grew by over 5 million people, hitting a record-breaking 15.6%. Republicans must advocate for limiting both legal and illegal immigration to give proper representation to citizens and create an Electoral College and Congress based on where citizens actually live. A majority of people want fewer foreigners coming into the country, with 55% wanting immigration decreased and 42% wanting legal immigration cut in half or more.

**Democrats need to get to grips with 2030 census reality**
The 2030 census is expected to give the GOP an easier path to control Congress, as Southern states are gaining seats while blue states are losing them. This could make it harder for Democrats to win the 270 electoral votes needed to win presidential elections. The Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin is cautioning party members to be 'caught flat-footed' during future elections and is urging them to invest time, energy, and money in building infrastructure and having conversations with voters. Martin also announced a new state plan, 'Organize Everywhere, Win Anywhere', which will allot $17,500 to state officials in blue states and $22,500 to state parties in red states. William Frey, a demographer, cautioned that the population growth in the South may slow down in the second half of the decade, and that voters moving to the South may not vote the same way as existing residents. Democrats have made some inroads in North Carolina, but still face challenges in other Southern states, including Texas and Florida. The party is refocusing on an economic message to counter Trump's appeal and is urging its members to organize in rural communities and give voters a sense of what they would do to improve their lives.

**Britain hosts key nations to coordinate fight against people smugglers**
Britain will host a meeting of over 40 countries and organisations, including the US, France, and Vietnam, to coordinate efforts to combat people smuggling and illegal migration. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will address the Organised Immigration Crime (OIC) Summit, stating that the 'vile trade' exploits institutional cracks and profits from political inaction. Starmer aims to 'smash the gangs' behind the crossings and has ditched the previous government's policy to deter migrants by deporting them to Rwanda. According to British government data, more than 36,800 people made the crossing in 2024, a 25% increase from the previous year, and over 6,600 people have crossed successfully so far in 2025. Starmer will emphasize the need to combine resources, share intelligence, and tackle the problem upstream at every step of the people smuggling routes.

**Israel and US Activate Voluntary Relocation Initiative for Gaza Residents**
As the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip continues to deteriorate, a new project is gaining attention: the possibility for Gaza residents to voluntarily relocate to other countries. A joint initiative between Israel and the United States aims to facilitate this relocalization. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz proposed the creation of a dedicated migration bureau, which will coordinate the procedures of civilians wishing to leave the Gaza Strip. This structure will depend directly on the Ministry of Defense and will ensure safe and secure departures, in cooperation with international organizations. The project is part of a strategic vision supported by the American administration, which seeks to offer a humanitarian alternative to civilian populations while reducing security tensions. The bureau will coordinate with all involved ministries, organize secure exit routes, provide necessary infrastructure for land, sea, or air travel, and ensure the protection of civilians during their transit. A shared desire to leave among Gaza residents A recent survey shows a deep sense of unease and widespread frustration, fueled by extremely precarious living conditions since the start of the war on October 7, 2023. The survey indicates that 75% of residents suffer from electricity and fuel shortages, 73% lack food, and over 60% face difficulties accessing medical care and education. Nearly two-thirds of respondents believe their quality of life was better before the war, and 37% have still not been able to return to their homes. Various destinations, clear motivations The motivations expressed by respondents are telling: 79% seek to ensure a better future for their families, 79% want to live in a safer environment, and 74% hope to find better job opportunities. Between divergent projects and concrete initiatives Meanwhile, Israel continues to announce clear measures in response to the Hamas's persistent refusal to release hostages. Israel Katz recently stated that the Israeli army would take control of new areas in Gaza to establish permanent security zones, adding: 'The more the Hamas insists, the more it will lose territory.'

**You'll Love How the Map Is Changing to Boost the GOP**
According to The American Redistricting Project (ARP), the 2020 census undercounts in Florida and Texas will be corrected in the 2030 census, resulting in a gain of four seats each for these states. Florida will gain one-third more representation, while Texas will gain more than half a million people. Arizona is the only swing state to gain a seat. Illinois, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin will lose one seat each, while New York is projected to lose two seats. California is expected to lose three seats, with the ARP estimating that the state's progressive governance is causing population loss. The author notes that the Democrats' lack of registration efforts in Florida and Texas, combined with low morale and a tanking approval rating, may hinder their chances in the 2032 election.

**Peru's Constitutional Commission Approves Single Voting Card for 2026 Elections: Risks and Challenges Ahead**
The Peruvian Constitutional Commission has approved the use of a single voting card for the 2026 elections, which aims to simplify the electoral process and avoid confusion among voters. However, this decision has raised concerns about the complexity of the elections, with 42 registered parties and 32 in the process of registration, which could increase to 50. This would result in over 10,400 candidates for the presidency, Congress, and Andean Parliament. According to Roberto Burneo, president of the National Electoral Jury (JNE), 'The design of the voting card belongs to the ONPE, which has the specialization and experience to define it. [...] On what basis do congressmen say that a voting card will facilitate [the elections] and do not accept what the specialized authorities say?' Tuesta, a member of the JNE, also warned that the process will be even more complex due to the elimination of the Primary, Open, Simultaneous, and Obligatory (PASO) elections, which would have reduced the number of parties in the contest. He also pointed out that there will be two ways to elect the Senate (by national list and by constituency), and the restoration of preferential voting, as well as the lack of clarity about the future of the Andean Parliament. 'There is no way to make it simple for the ONPE or for the citizen. [...] The risk is high because we have many elections, many decisions, many parties, many candidates. This has never been seen. It is by decision of the Congress alone,' he warned. The ONPE will have to reinforce the training of polling station members, sensitize citizens to vote early, and coordinate a greater electoral logistics. This becomes even more challenging after the inclusion of members of the Armed Forces and the National Police in the electoral roll, which will require greater security in polling stations. According to Guevara, 'Perhaps the current situation, with the complexity of the voting card, will end up demotivating the voter and leading them not to vote.' The ONPE also anticipates 25,000 acts with arithmetic errors for 2026. The fatigue of polling station members can lead to errors. Guevara suggests modifying the Law of Political Organizations and relaxing the grounds for the loss of registration of parties, allowing recently registered parties to abstain from participating in their first electoral process.

**ONPE Announces Plans for 2026 Elections with Five Simultaneous Processes**
The National Office of Electoral Processes (ONPE) has begun planning the 2026 general elections, which will be held simultaneously with four other processes. It is expected that more than 27 million Peruvians will participate in the elections, which will have two voting cards. This is in compliance with Law No. 32166, which aims to ensure the participation of the Armed Forces and the National Police. The ONPE also plans to install more than 93,000 voting tables in over 11,000 locations, and enable voting tables in over 3,000 populated centers to ensure access to voting for more than 2 million citizens in remote areas. Additionally, 126 Decentralized Electoral Process Offices (ODPE) will be created to coordinate logistical efforts across the country. The electoral body has also established the participation of around 300,000 citizens as poll workers, who will receive economic compensation for their service. Furthermore, the Technological Solution for Electoral Scrutiny (STAE) will be implemented, which will facilitate vote counting in Lima and Callao, improving the speed and accuracy of the process. As part of its commitment to transparency, the ONPE will launch an IT audit to review the technological solutions used in the electoral process. This system will ensure the security, integrity, and efficiency of vote counting, guaranteeing that the elections are transparent and reliable.

**Arizona voters caught up in state’s citizenship-proof error could see their registrations canceled**
A legislative proposal, House Bill 2038, aims to address the issue of 200,000 Arizona residents who were never asked to provide proof of citizenship when they registered to vote. GOP state Rep. Alex Kolodin's proposal would require these voters to provide proof within 35 days, and if they fail, their status would be put in limbo. If they attempt to vote while in limbo status, they would have until 7 p.m. on Election Day to provide the citizenship proof for their ballots to be counted. However, if recorders still don't have the proof after the next general election in 2026, they must cancel the voter's registration. Voting rights groups, including All Voting is Local Action, have objected to the proposal, saying the voters should still be eligible to vote in federal elections. Arizona requires proof of citizenship to register to vote in state and local elections, but not for federal elections. The county recorders need a resolution soon, as some counties have already started sending notices to affected voters.

**Italian Demographic Crisis: Proposals for Support to Fertility**
The Italian demographic crisis continues to worsen: by 2040, the population over 68 will increase by 3.6 million, while the number of single people or couples without children will reach six million. The constant decline in births, the decrease in marriages, and an index of fertility stuck at 1.2 make an urgent and shared intervention necessary to ensure the well-being of families and the reconciliation between work life and parental responsibilities. Alfonso Luzzi, president of Movimento Cristiano Lavoratori (Mcl), proposed recognizing the possibility of using a contributory figure commensurate to a full-time work schedule for a maximum period of two years to the parent who requests part-time voluntary work. Luzzi emphasized that this measure can represent an immediate improvement within the reform of the pension system, removing obstacles that often penalize young women in the labor market and favoring greater flexibility in parental leave. Other proposals include the 'family factor fiscal' and the German 'splitting' model, which provides an equitable taxation system based on the composition of the family nucleus, and the creation of an Agency for Fertility, which would coordinate services for families and promote a sustainable and inclusive future.
