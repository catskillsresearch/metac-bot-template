**Trump gives clemency to over 20 people, including political allies**
President Trump granted clemency to over 20 people, including political allies, reality TV stars, and a Louisiana rapper. The decision was influenced by White House pardon czar Alice Marie Johnson and Department of Justice Pardon Attorney Ed Martin. Johnson wrote, 'Today 26 deserving individuals were granted clemencies and pardons. Each one represents a story of redemption, rehabilitation, and resilience. Their second chance is a second shot at life.' Critics have questioned the motives behind the president's 'unprecedented' pardons and its projected impact on the criminal justice system. Some notable recipients include Imaad Zuberi, a businessman convicted of obstructing an investigation into Trump's inaugural committee; former Rep. Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty to tax fraud and perjury; and reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of bank fraud and tax evasion. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for more information on the individuals.

**Trump Gives Clemency to More Than Two Dozen, Including Political Allies**
On May 28, 2025, President Trump granted clemency to more than two dozen individuals, including those who have expressed political support or echoed the president's claims of being unfairly targeted. According to the New York Times, the pardons and commutations were part of a 'blitz' of clemency decisions. The recipients of the clemency included political allies of the president. As reported by the New York Times, the clemency decisions were made without a clear plan for who would grow the US food, with the president stating 'There is just flat out nobody to work'.

**Rapper NBA YoungBoy, Ex-Chicago Gang Leader Win Trump Clemency**
President Donald Trump is offering clemency to a diverse group of individuals, including NBA YoungBoy, a rap artist, Larry Hoover, the co-founder of the Gangster Disciples street gang, and Michael 'Harry O' Harris, a music executive who helped found Death Row Records. Harris was previously commuted by Trump in 2021. The president is also pardoning two former Republican political figures, John G. Rowland and Michael Grimm, as well as several others, including Tanner Mansell and John Moore, who were convicted of stealing fish in federal waters. Trump has granted pardons or commutations to about 1,600 people since retaking office in January, more than six times the total for his entire first term. 'The president has come to the aid of political supporters and donors, prominent business leaders convicted of white collar crimes and even reality television stars,' said a White House official. 'He has often expressed sympathy for others caught in the judicial system -- particularly political allies and those supportive of the administration's priorities.'

**Trump liberally doles out pardons and commutations in clemency spree, signals possibly more to come**
President Trump has granted clemency to 12 individuals, including a former Congressman and three-term Connecticut governor, and commuted the sentence of three more people. The pardons and commutations coincide with the installation of Ed Martin as the Justice Department's new pardon attorney. Critics have pointed out that most of the recipients are vocal Trump supporters, and some have raised concerns about the ethics and legality of the pardons. However, Trump defenders have noted that President Biden also issued a slew of controversial clemency actions before leaving office. Trump has signaled that more pardons could be coming, including a possible pardon for two men convicted of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

**Trump Revives Push To Make Federal Workers At-Will: 'One Misstep And You Could Be Gone,' Warns SSA Veteran**
The Trump administration has revived efforts to reclassify federal employees as at-will workers, stripping job protections that career civil servants currently enjoy. The proposed Office of Personnel Management rule would make government workers easier to fire, similar to Corporate America standards. According to the proposed OPM rule, 'This will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process.' A 30-year SSA veteran warned, 'Since you are a political appointee, you could also just be let go with little or no protection. So one misstep and you could be gone.' The measure was introduced during Trump's first term and has garnered over 16,000 public comments, with the comment period extended until June 7.

**So far, virtually no acknowledgement of Pride month by federal gov't**
In a stark departure from previous years, there has been virtually no acknowledgment of Pride month by federal government agencies in 2025, despite limited and localized observances by some organizations. This comes after several policy changes under President Donald Trump's second term, including executive orders narrowing the definition of gender and banning diversity, equity, and inclusion activities. According to The Washington Post, WorldPride organizers face challenges in planning festivities in D.C. due to the government's targeting of transgender rights and cuts to HIV prevention programs. Trump has promised 'NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA' at the Kennedy Center, and is set to preside over a military parade on June 14, which will feature 6,600 soldiers and 150 military vehicles.

**Trump Grants Clemency to Convicted Individuals, Including Chrisley, Walczak, and Jenkins**
US President Trump has granted clemency to several individuals convicted of crimes, including Chrisley, Walczak, and Jenkins. Chrisley, a couple convicted of fraud and tax evasion, had built their media fortune on the myth of the perfect Southern family, but were hiding a scheme of falsifying financial statements and using stolen money to pay for luxury expenses. Todd Chrisley was serving a 12-year sentence in a Florida prison, while Julie Chrisley was serving a 7-year sentence in a federal medical center in Kentucky. Trump called his daughter, Savannah Chrisley, to inform her that her parents had been granted clemency. The call was recorded and posted on social media by Trump's advisor, Margo Martin. The Chrisleys had worked with Trump's team for months to secure the pardon. Paul Walczak, a former Florida nursing home executive, was convicted of embezzling over $10 million from employees' salaries between 2016 and 2019. He used the money to pay for luxury items, including a $2 million yacht. Walczak was sentenced to 18 months in prison and a $4.4 million fine, but was granted a full and unconditional pardon by Trump after his mother, Elizabeth Fago, attended a high-profile fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. Scott Howard Jenkins, a former sheriff in Virginia, was convicted of accepting over $75,000 in bribes in exchange for naming civilians as deputy sheriffs. He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison, but Trump claimed he was a victim of an overzealous Department of Justice and did not deserve to spend a single day in jail.

**Trump wants to end birthright citizenship. How many people would that impact?**
President Trump's executive order aims to restrict birthright citizenship, which would require at least one parent to be a U.S. citizen or have permanent residency. According to estimates, ending birthright citizenship would result in 255,000 children being born in the U.S. without citizenship each year, and increase the number of unauthorized migrants by 2.7 million by 2045 and 5.4 million by 2075. The Pew Research Center found that 4.4 million U.S.-born children under 18 live with an unauthorized immigrant parent. The foreign-born population in the U.S. has increased from 4.7% in 1970 to 13.9% in 2022, with 22.8 million foreign-born, non-U.S. citizens living in the country. The Trump administration is trying to convince the Supreme Court to let it enforce the executive order, despite multiple lower courts ruling it unconstitutional. The justices are expected to rule by the end of June.

**US Military to Expel 1,000 Transgender Soldiers Following Trump's Executive Order**
The US military will 'immediately' begin the process of expelling around 1,000 transgender soldiers, forcing those who do not leave voluntarily to be discharged by the start of June. This decision comes after President Donald Trump's executive order in January, which banned transgender individuals from serving in the military. The Pentagon has stated that it will start the process of removing the soldiers, citing the executive order. Approximately 1,000 soldiers who have identified as transgender will be affected, according to Defense Department spokesperson Sean Parnell. 'At the end of the eligibility period for self-identification, military departments will initiate involuntary separation procedures,' reads a memo from Secretary Pete Hegseth. Trump's executive order stated that 'expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot meet the rigorous standards necessary for military service.' The Pentagon followed up with a memo in late February, stating that it would remove transgender soldiers from the military unless they obtained a case-by-case waiver, as well as preventing transgender individuals from enlisting. Trump has also abolished the Digital Equity Act, a law passed by the Biden administration to provide digital services to low-income communities, calling it 'racist' and 'illegal'.

**Where Trump's campaign promises stand at 100 days**
President Trump has made progress on some of his 2024 campaign promises, but others remain unfulfilled. He has delivered on promises such as granting clemency to 1,500 defendants convicted of crimes related to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack, and withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement. However, other promises, such as negotiating an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, remain unfulfilled. Trump has also used executive orders to delay or circumvent laws, such as the TikTok ban and the IVF treatment mandate. Some promises, such as eliminating the Department of Education and eliminating federal income taxes on tips, will require an act of Congress. Trump's executive orders have been met with legal challenges, including the birthright citizenship order, which has been blocked by federal courts. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on the order in May.

**Denmark Passes Abortion Law, Ukraine President Cuts Short Visit, Trump Signs Executive Order**
The Danish parliament has passed a law to increase the abortion limit from 12 to 18 weeks. The new law was passed with a majority of 74 to 29. The law will come into effect on June 1, 2025. Health Minister Sophie Løhde has stated that she does not support further expansion of the abortion limit. Meanwhile, a 29-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly scamming over 200,000 kroner from people by pretending to be a police officer. The man is also suspected of database fraud. In other news, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyj, has cut short his visit to South Africa after a Russian attack in Kyiv killed nine people and injured 80. Zelenskyj has asked Ukraine's defense minister to request support from partners to strengthen the country's air defense. A 34-year-old man from Vejle has been arrested for attempting to stab a 66-year-old man with an unknown object. The two men knew each other and had a disagreement. The 66-year-old man was not seriously injured. In the United States, President Donald Trump has signed an executive order requiring universities to disclose the source and purpose of foreign donations. The order aims to strengthen the enforcement of existing laws. Trump has also frozen two large donations to Harvard University, citing a lack of compliance with his administration's demands.

**Gov. Wes Moore signs new bills into law. Here's what will change.**
Maryland Governor Wes Moore signed over 140 bills into law, including the Expungement Reform Act of 2025, which will allow individuals to have their criminal records expunged upon completion of their sentence and rehabilitation requirements. This expansion builds upon an executive clemency order issued by Moore last June, which pardoned 175,000 convictions related to cannabis possession. The removal of the wait time for expunging records will take effect on October 1, according to Moore. 'This is a major step forward in our efforts to reform the justice system and provide a second chance to those who have made mistakes,' Moore said. The bills also focus on protection for federal employees facing job losses under the Trump administration. 'We are committed to supporting our federal employees and ensuring they have the resources they need to succeed,' said Moore. 'This legislation is a critical step in that effort.'

**4/20 Is No Celebration for Thousands -- Trump Can Change That | Common Dreams**
While thousands of people celebrate 4/20, a day synonymous with cannabis consumption, many others are reminded of an unjust system that has yet to make amends. Despite 41 states having some form of legal cannabis, tens of thousands remain imprisoned for cannabis-related offenses. President Donald Trump has the opportunity to pardon every individual imprisoned for cannabis at the federal level, as well as reschedule cannabis, which would boost the industry and ease the burden on law enforcement and the judicial system. Trump has shown support for cannabis reform in the past, and both granting clemency and rescheduling cannabis would be immensely popular decisions. According to a YouGov poll, 70% of Americans support clearing criminal records for past non-violent marijuana-related convictions, and an American Civil Liberties Union poll found that 84% of registered voters support the release of people serving time for crimes that are no longer considered illegal. 'This is a moral and economic outrage that demands an immediate solution,' said the article, emphasizing the need for Trump to take bold action and right the wrongs of the past. 'President Trump has a penchant for bold action and the power to turn 4/20 into a day for real celebration through cannabis clemency and rescheduling,' the article added.

**Trump's Executive Order on Birthright Citizenship Sparks Debate**
US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to restrict birthright citizenship, which could affect the scope of executive power in the future. The order aims to prevent children of undocumented immigrants born in the US from automatically becoming citizens. Critics argue that this move violates the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the US. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on the order on May 15, 2025, and a decision is expected by the end of June or early July. Some analysts fear that if the order is upheld, it could give the President more power in the future, challenging the balance of power in the US government. A CNN poll shows that 56% of Americans oppose the elimination of birthright citizenship, while 41% support it. The idea of supporting the elimination of citizenship for children born in the US has decreased over the years, with only 4 in 10 Americans supporting the order. Democrats are more opposed to the order, with 51% against it, while 31% of Republicans support it.

**US Department of Homeland Security to Review Social Media Accounts of Immigration Applicants**
The US Department of Homeland Security plans to review social media accounts of individuals applying for citizenship, residency, or asylum in the country. According to the agency, this move is necessary to comply with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, which requires a unified set of standards for evaluating applicants and gathering necessary information to thoroughly investigate individuals and ensure their eligibility or ineligibility. This decision will affect approximately 3.5 million people living in the US with pending immigration cases, including asylum applications, green card requests, or US citizenship applications. The agency will use social media data to assess the eligibility of applicants and determine if they pose a threat to national security or public safety. The administration has not provided further details on the implications for other services or benefits. The public is invited to submit comments until May 5, 2025, before the order takes effect. The decision will be made by a discretionary authority, who will determine the applicant's eligibility based on their social media presence, according to Trump's executive order. The order states that if an individual's social media posts 'undermine fundamental constitutional rights such as freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion protected by the First Amendment, or promote violent sectarianism or the overthrow of American culture, or express a desire to replace it, or provide aid or support to foreign terrorists,' they will be denied the application. This move is a fulfillment of Trump's campaign promise to expand the scrutiny and investigation of immigrants, both new and existing, during his second presidential term. The executive order reinstates the unified standards for investigation and scrutiny that were in place on January 19, 2021, and applies them to any foreigner seeking a visa or immigration benefit of any kind.

**For Many Biden Clemency Grantees, Freedom Is On Hold**
When President Joe Biden granted clemency to 2,500 people in his final days in office, many were overjoyed, including James Kirby Burks' family. However, the joy was short-lived as Burks, who has been in federal prison for 32 years, was not released immediately. He is one of the nearly 700 clemency recipients whom Biden specified couldn't be released until July. Burks' sister, Robin Davis, expressed frustration, saying, 'It's comforting to know her brother will no longer live the rest of his life inside prison walls, but still, there was something that felt inherently unfair about watching other clemency and pardon recipients, especially those who President Donald Trump pardoned for their participation in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, get out immediately.' Experts say that the delay in the release of Biden's clemency recipients is due to the staggered release structure, which was adopted relatively recently during the Obama administration and then mimicked in Biden's term. The BOP is currently experiencing an upheaval, with Director Colette Peters resigning and several senior leaders departing. The agency's Facebook post on Jan. 21, announcing the release of all 211 individuals convicted for Jan. 6 activities within 24 hours of Trump's pardon action, has raised questions about the fairness of the process. 'It's like, 'OK, do you need institutional time or do you not? And for whom?'' said MiAngel Cody, founder of the Decarceration Collective. 'Other inmates that were granted this wonderful pardon are home and some are en route. Why isn't my brother one of those?' Davis asked. 'They are playing God with his life. You stripped him from everything, just being a human being, and now you're dangling it right in front of him.'

**Trump hands himself vital World Cup role with US set to host**
President Donald Trump has appointed himself as the chair of a White House Task Force for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which the US will co-host with Canada and Mexico. Trump signed an executive order to establish the task force, which will oversee preparations for the event. The task force will be comprised of Trump's cabinet and key government officials, and will work with federal agencies to plan and execute the World Cup. Trump also confirmed that he plans to attend one or more of the matches being held in the US, and will likely present the World Cup trophy to the winners. 'We're going to do a fantastic job in making you at home,' Trump said to FIFA's head Gianni Infantino, who was present at the Oval Office. 'The World Cup is much, much, much bigger - and it's in the whole country,' Trump said, teasing Infantino about which is bigger - the World Cup or the Olympics. Trump also joked about the current tumult over tariffs between the US and its co-hosts, saying 'It makes it much more exciting.' The 2026 World Cup will begin in June 2026 and will feature 48 teams playing 104 matches in 16 different host cities across the US, Canada, and Mexico.
