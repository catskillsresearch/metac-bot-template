**Britain is getting a defence boost aimed at sending a message to Moscow, and to Trump**
The UK government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has announced a significant boost to military spending to send a message to Moscow and Washington. The plans include building new nuclear-powered attack submarines, increasing conventional weapons stockpiles, and investing in the nuclear arsenal. Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send 'a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. The government aims to hit 2.5% of national income on defence spending by 2027 and 3% by 2034, although the Treasury is yet to confirm where the funds will come from. NATO chief Mark Rutte has called for member countries to spend at least 3.5% of GDP on defence to deter Russia from future attacks.

**UK PM: We can't ignore Russian threat**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that Britain cannot ignore the threat posed by Russia, citing the conflict in Ukraine as an example. The UK will increase military spending to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. This move is part of a broader effort to deter Russia and bolster Europe's defenses. NATO chief Mark Rutte is expected to discuss a commitment to spend at least 3.5 percent of GDP on defense at an upcoming meeting. Robert Jenrick, a Conservative Party spokesman, called for the government to be more ambitious and raise spending to 3 percent of national income by 2029, stating, 'We think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation.'

**Britain is getting a defense boost aimed at sending a message to...**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with Starmer saying 'we have to recognize the world has changed' and 'with greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.' The government will also build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send 'a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. Healey also stated that plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 are 'on track' and that there's 'no doubt' it will hit 3% before 2034. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks.

**Upcoming budget must address inequality**
Bangladesh's per capita income has reached $2,820, the highest in the country's history, but this growth has not been equally shared. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the top 10% of the population holds 40% of the country's total income, while the bottom 50% holds only 19.05%. The Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, has reached an all-time high of 0.499. The country's wealth inequality has also increased, with the wealthiest 10% controlling 58.5% of the country's total wealth. To address this issue, the government needs to rationalize and expand the social safety net programmes, expand the direct tax base, and introduce wealth and property taxes. Additionally, investments in universal education, healthcare, and rural development must be prioritized, and corruption must be tackled effectively. As the author notes, 'Inequality is not just an economic issue, it's a political and social one. It determines who gets access to opportunity, who benefits from public services, and whose voices are heard in the policy process.'

**UK to send message to Moscow as it outlines higher defence spending**
The UK is set to increase its defence spending by the largest amount since the end of the Cold War, with plans to reach 3% of its GDP by the next parliament, according to Defence Secretary John Healey. Healey said, 'We are sending a message to Moscow that we are committed to our defence and security.' The UK aims to spend 2.5% of its national income on defence by 2027, and Healey is confident that this target will be met. The government will respond to a strategic defence review on Monday, which is expected to make recommendations on how to deal with emerging threats. The review will reportedly commit £1.5 billion to build six new factories to make munitions and revive the UK's industrial base. Healey said, 'There is no doubt that we will hit 3% by the 2030s.'

**US Treasury Secretary Confident US Will Never Default on Debt**
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the US government will never default on its debt, despite the lack of a decision on raising its debt ceiling. 'The United States will never default, this will never happen', he said in an interview with CBS News. Bessent added that the US authorities 'are on a warning path and will not hit a wall'. According to the International Monetary Fund's calculations, the US government debt will increase to 122.5% of GDP by 2025 and continue to rise, reaching 128.2% by 2030. Earlier, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the country's government debt is on an 'unsustainable trajectory', but has not yet reached an unacceptable level, and it is unknown when this threshold will be crossed.

**The U.K. seeks to send a message to Moscow as it outlines higher defense spending**
The U.K. is set to increase its defense spending by 13 billion pounds ($17 billion) per year, aiming to reach 2.5% of national income by 2027 and 3% by the early 2030s. This move is seen as a message to Moscow, according to British Defense Secretary John Healey. The increase in spending will transform the country's military, which has been in decline for decades. Healey stated, 'This is a message to Moscow,' and 'This is Britain standing behind, making our armed forces stronger but making our industrial base stronger, and this is part of our readiness to fight, if required.' The U.K. has been compelled to review its defense spending since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Additionally, the government will establish a cyber command to counter state-linked cyber attacks, which have targeted the U.K.'s defense over the last two years. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary for the Conservative Party, welcomed the pledge but expressed skepticism about the Treasury's ability to deliver, calling for more ambitious spending targets.

**Trump's Cuts to USAID Will Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under the age of five. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.'

**9.5% of Georgia's Population Lived in Absolute Poverty in 2024**
According to a report, in 2024, 9.5% of Georgia's population lived in absolute poverty. The poverty rate was higher in rural areas (12%) compared to urban areas (7.8%). The report also noted that the poverty rate decreased by 1.6 percentage points in urban areas and 3.7 percentage points in rural areas. The highest poverty rate was among people under 18 years old (12.1%), despite a 4% decrease from the previous year. On the other hand, the lowest poverty rate was among people over 65 years old (6.7%), which can be attributed to the stability of their pensions. Men were more likely to live in poverty than women (9.8% vs 9%). The report also showed a slight improvement in income inequality. In 2024, the percentage of the population living below 60% of the median consumption decreased by 0.9 percentage points to 18.9%, and the percentage of those living below 40% of the median level decreased by 0.7 percentage points to 6.7%. The Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, decreased by 0.02 to 0.35 (based on total income and resources). However, the coefficient remained unchanged at 0.36 and 0.40 based on total consumption and overall expenses, respectively.

**Russia Aims to Reduce Poverty Rate Below 5% by 2036**
Russian Vice-Premier Tatyana Golikova announced plans to reduce the country's poverty rate below 5% by 2036. Golikova stated, 'Further reduction of this indicator, and by 2030 it needs to be reduced below 7%, and by 2036 - below 5%, will require from us very targeted, precise, and comprehensive work. The lower we need to reduce this indicator, the more precise our measures should be and the more targeted they should be.' The focus of this work will be on increasing the income of large families, with the first step being the introduction of a family tax allowance for parents of two or more children from 2026. Golikova emphasized that the President's task is not only to reduce poverty, but also to reduce the gap in income inequality. She noted that the Gini coefficient (a measure of the degree of unevenness in the distribution of income among the population) should decrease, 'especially in the first and second deciles, which characterize the well-being and well-being of families with the lowest income, that is, 20% of the population with the lowest incomes.' Labor income plays a key role in reducing poverty, Golikova said. 'And here, 2024 showed quite serious indicators of growth in real income of the population. Real income of the population, preliminary data, grew by 8.4%', she said. Golikova also presented preliminary data from Rosstat on the growth of real monetary income in 2024, with the top performers being the Kalmykia, Adygea, Orlov, Smolensk, and Chelyabinsk regions. 'These are good achievements, but, of course, there is still something to strive for', Golikova said.

**Income Inequality in Russia Reaches Three-Year High**
According to Rosstat, the level of income inequality in Russia has increased in 2024. The Gini coefficient, which measures the degree of unevenness in income distribution, rose to 0.408 compared to 0.405 the previous year. This indicator is almost at the level of 2021, when the index was 0.409. The increase in the coefficient indicates a strengthening of the imbalance in income distribution between different social groups of the population. Analysts link the change in the indicator to a number of socio-economic factors, including inflationary pressure, reduced access to credit, and the growth of household expenses, writes RBC. As previously reported, the demand for workers on the labor market in Russia has begun to decline. Expert Badalov also commented on the Central Bank's statement regarding the possible increase in the key interest rate.

**Russia's Wealth Gap Widens as Incomes of the Affluent Outpace Those of the Less Affluent**
According to Rosstat, the gap between the rich and the poor in Russia has widened in 2024. The incomes of the wealthy grew at a faster pace than those of the less affluent, reports RBC, citing Rosstat data. The Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, increased to 0.408 in 2024 from 0.405 in 2023 (or 40.8% from 40.5% in percentage terms). President Vladimir Putin's May 2024 decree stated that the Gini coefficient should decrease to 0.37 (equivalent to 37%) by 2030 and to 0.33 by 2036. The real incomes of the top 10% of Russians increased by 10% in the 4th quarter of 2024, averaging 240,519 rubles per month. In contrast, the monthly average income of the 10% least affluent Russians grew by 6.5%, reaching 14,479 rubles. The real average monthly income of the entire population increased by 8.9% in 2024, reaching 77,679 rubles.

**Rosstat: Income Inequality in Russia Increases in 2024**
According to Rosstat, the level of income inequality in Russia increased in 2024, with the Gini coefficient rising from 40.5 to 40.8 percent. This is approximately the same level as in 2021, before sanctions were imposed. The highest level of this indicator in the last 10 years was recorded in 2018, at 41.1 percent. The coefficient had been decreasing, reaching a minimum of 39.8 percent in 2022, but increased again to 40.5 percent in 2023. Rosstat reports that at the end of last year, the incomes of the wealthiest Russians began to grow more rapidly than before, significantly outpacing the growth of incomes for other groups. Despite inflation, prices for medicines, chicken eggs, and household appliances decreased in Russia in 2024. Overall, prices for goods and services in Russia have increased by 700 percent, or eight times, since the start of the 21st century.

**Rosstat Reports Increase in Income Inequality in Russia**
According to Rosstat, the level of inequality in Russia has increased again in 2024. The Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, rose to 0.408 in 2024, compared to 0.405 in 2023. The coefficient of variation, which measures the gap between the highest and lowest incomes, also increased to 15.1 in 2024, compared to 14.8 in the previous year. Both indicators of inequality in 2024 are roughly in line with the pre-sanctions level of 2021. President Putin has set a goal to reduce the Gini coefficient to 0.37 by 2030 and to 0.33 by 2036. He noted that inequality is one of the leading problems of modern times, generating social tension and political instability, as he said, 'It is one of the most pressing problems of our time, which generates social tension and political instability.'

**Income inequality in Russia increases, with the wealthy growing faster than the poor**
According to the 'Vedomosti' analysis of the 'Rosstat' report, the income of the 10% wealthiest Russians grew by 10% in real terms in the 4th quarter of 2024 (to 240.5 thousand rubles on average), while the monthly average income of the 10% least well-off Russians increased by 6.5% (to 14.4 thousand rubles). Overall, the average monthly monetary income of the entire population in real terms increased by 8.9% in 2024 (to 77.6 thousand rubles). The situation where the income of the wealthy grew faster than that of the poor was also observed in the 4th quarter of 2023 (growth of 7.9% vs. 5.8% respectively). However, in 2022, it was the opposite - then the income of the poor grew faster (1.8%) than that of the wealthy (0.3%). The data also show that at the end of last year, the income of the 10% most well-off Russians was 16.6 times higher than that of the 10% least well-off. As noted by 'Vedomosti', the gap has increased compared to the same period in 2023 - then it was 16.07 times. The wealthy Russians saw the most significant growth in property income (47.84% compared to the same period in 2023). The least well-off Russians have very little savings, so their income growth occurred mainly due to wages and social benefits, which are indexed to inflation or the growth of the living wage, noted by the junior researcher at the Center 'INSAP' RANHIGS Alexandra Osavolyuk. According to RBC, by the end of 2024, the indicator showing the uneven distribution of income among the population (the Gini coefficient) increased in Russia to 0.408 against 0.405 in 2023 (or from 40.5% to 40.8% in percentage terms). In the presidential decree of Vladimir Putin from May 2024, it is stated that the Gini coefficient should decrease to 0.37 (equivalent to 37%) by 2030 and to 0.33 by 2036. The growth of inequality is likely due to the return of the pre-pandemic trend, expressed by Marina Karceva, deputy director of the Institute of Social Analysis and Forecasting IPPEI RANHIGS. According to her, the situation was influenced by the end of the pandemic and the adaptation of the economy to new socio-economic conditions. As previously reported, the head of the center for financial analysis of Sberbank, Mikhail Matovnikov, said that the savings of Russians on deposits have reached such a sum that at current interest rates, it is possible to buy all the construction of housing in the country on annual interest income.

**Income Inequality in Russia Increases in 2024**
According to Rosstat, the level of income inequality in Russia has increased in 2024, with the Gini coefficient rising to 0.408 from 0.405 in 2023. The gap between the 10% of the population with the highest incomes and the 10% with the lowest incomes has also increased, from 14.8 times in 2023 to 15.1 times in 2024. This level of inequality is similar to that of 2021, before the sanctions were imposed. The government has set a goal to reduce the Gini coefficient to 0.37 by 2030 and to 0.33 by 2036. Experts attribute the increase in inequality to the return to pre-pandemic trends, as well as the impact of high interest rates, which have benefited the wealthy. The current situation, where the poverty rate has decreased to 8.5%, has also contributed to the increase in inequality. According to experts, the level of inequality may continue to rise in 2025, but may stabilize at the 2021 level. The introduction of a progressive tax system in 2025 may help to reduce inequality, but the impact is still uncertain.

**Commentary: Budget 2025 shifts the focus from short-term wage support to long-term skills investment**
Singapore's Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, fell to a record low of 0.365 in 2024, thanks to sustained policies aimed at reducing income inequality. However, while government transfers provide essential financial relief, they do not foster long-term economic mobility. To address this, Budget 2025 has introduced measures to enhance workforce support, including the expansion of the Workfare Skills Support (WSS) scheme. The revised scheme provides lower-wage workers with monthly training allowances, with part-time trainees receiving S$300 and full-time participants receiving up to 50% of their average income. This policy shift towards incentivising skill acquisition is a crucial step towards equipping lower-wage workers with the tools for upward mobility and long-term financial stability, according to the government. 'By shifting the focus towards incentivising skill acquisition, this policy takes a crucial step towards equipping lower-wage workers with the tools for upward mobility and long-term financial stability,' said the government.

**Household incomes rise in 2024; resident households received more support from govt schemes**
According to the Singapore Department of Statistics (SingStat), the median household income from work in Singapore grew to $11,297 in 2024, a 3.9% increase in nominal terms and 1.4% in real terms. This is the highest level in 25 years after accounting for government assistance and taxes. The Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, fell to 0.364 in 2024, the lowest level since 2000. SingStat also reported that resident households received an average of $7,825 per household member from government schemes in 2024, a 21.5% increase from 2023. 'This was due to measures rolled out in 2024 to support households in areas such as cost-of-living, retirement and healthcare needs,' said SingStat. Households across most income deciles saw increases in average household income from work per household member after adjusting for inflation.

**World Bank: Tax reforms will help reduce inequality in Malaysia**
The World Bank has released a report stating that Malaysia needs tax reforms to reduce inequality and raise additional revenues. The report, titled 'A Fresh Take on Reducing Inequality and Enhancing Mobility in Malaysia', suggests that Malaysia's public revenues lag behind those of upper middle-income countries and high-income countries. 'Malaysia's revenues not only lag the revenues of upper middle-income countries and high income country peers but also the low middle income country average,' the report said. The World Bank recommends making the personal income tax (PIT) more progressive and tackling inequality at the top of the income distribution. It estimates that lowering taxable income thresholds and applying higher rates at the upper income brackets could increase PIT revenue by up to RM2.8 billion in 2024. The report also notes that Malaysia needs to increase its public spending beyond the current level to achieve high-income country goals by investing in capital and productivity, allowing wages to be improved. 'Malaysia is expected to become a high-income country by 2028-2030, but less than half of its people are projected to have incomes above the HIC cut-off because incomes are unevenly distributed,' the report said. According to the World Bank, income inequality in Malaysia trended down between 1970 and 2022, but the decline has stalled in recent years. The Gini index, which measures inequality, fell from 45 in 2004 to 40 by 2014, but remained at that level through 2019 and declined slightly to 39 in 2022. 'While this is not insignificant, Malaysia's Gini remains higher than that seen for the advanced economies that it wishes to emulate,' the World Bank said.
