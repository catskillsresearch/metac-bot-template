**Mohamed Anwar El-Sadat: Constitutional Amendments in the Next Parliament are 'Very Likely'**
Mohamed Anwar El-Sadat, the head of the Reform and Development Party, emphasized the importance of the upcoming parliamentary elections, citing that the next parliament, which will start its term in 2026, will be crucial as it will coincide with the 2030 presidential elections. El-Sadat stated, 'We are facing a parliament that will start its work in 2026, and presidential elections will be held in 2030, so anyone running for president will need the support of at least 20 MPs, highlighting the importance of forming the next parliament.' He also mentioned that the possibility of making constitutional amendments during the next parliament is 'very likely', as reported by Lamees Al-Hadidi in her program 'Kalam Akher' on ON channel. El-Sadat emphasized that having a real and active representation of parties, whether from the civil movement or others, within the parliament is a matter of great importance. He added that the elections are not just a closed or proportional electoral system, but a reflection of the political climate that needs to be prepared to encourage people to participate. El-Sadat called for the release of detained youth and party cadres without final convictions, saying, 'We need to encourage people to participate, but this will not happen unless there is a real climate that encourages voting, and one of its pillars is the release of detained youth and party cadres.' He also demanded a meeting with the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Mahmoud Fawzy, with opposition parties that have expressed objections to the electoral law amendments and electoral district divisions, to open a political discussion on how to prepare the political atmosphere for holding fair elections. El-Sadat stressed that it is also necessary for the National Election Authority to issue clear reassuring messages about judicial supervision of the elections, saying, 'We need to understand clearly: will there be complete judicial supervision? The announcement guaranteed judicial supervision by bodies such as the State Council and the Administrative Prosecution, but these bodies are subordinate to the Minister of Justice and do not represent complete judicial supervision in the full sense.'

**Chile Aims to Accelerate Decarbonization by 2035, but Industry Actors Raise Concerns**
Chile's President Gabriel Boric announced a new project to accelerate the country's decarbonization process, aiming to reach a carbon-free energy matrix by 2035, five years ahead of the original target of 2040. The initiative seeks to facilitate investments in clean energy projects and close coal-fired power plants. However, industry actors have expressed doubts and called for more details. Camilo Charme, director of Generadoras de Chile, stated that the closure of coal-fired power plants 'cannot be done solely by political will or slogans.' Juan Francisco Galli, director of Pivotes, described the announcement as 'generic and unambitious.' Javier Naranjo, former Minister of Environment, emphasized the need for technical studies to support the project's viability. 'We must analyze with great consciousness and responsibility the technical, material, and operational conditions required,' Charme said. 'This is not a mere slogan, but a serious commitment to the country's energy transition.'

**Chile's President Boric Announces Plans to Accelerate Renewable Energy Transition and Pressure Israel**
Chilean President Gabriel Boric announced plans to accelerate the country's transition to renewable energy and increase pressure on Israel over its actions in Gaza during the final nine months of his presidency. In a three-hour speech from the Congress in Valparaíso, Boric also addressed crime, infrastructure, the economy, and abortion rights. He stated that he will present a law to ban imports from 'illegally occupied territories' and supported Spain's efforts to impose an arms embargo on Israel. Boric also announced plans to present a 'descarbonization accelerated' law to promote investment in renewable energy sources, phase out coal-fired power plants, and advance the country's goal of decarbonizing its electricity grid by 2035, five years ahead of the original target of 2040. He added that a project to speed up the process of granting permits for new projects is expected to be approved within weeks, which would reduce the time it takes to obtain permits by 30-70%. Boric said, 'Investment projects will not develop if we do not modernize and streamline the permit process.' He also promoted his plan to expand lithium mining, led by the state-owned copper giant Codelco. Critics have accused Boric of not implementing the major reforms he promised as a candidate and not rewriting the Constitution from the dictatorship era, which was rejected by voters twice. Boric acknowledged the complaints, but defended his record, saying, 'Have we achieved everything we wanted, with the depth we wanted? No, but we have made progress in that direction, taking into account the conditions in which we had to govern.'

**Chile president to ramp up decarbonization, pressure on Israel as term winds down**
Chile's President Gabriel Boric announced plans to accelerate renewable energy efforts and increase pressure on Israel over its war in Gaza during his government's last nine months in office. Boric introduced a law to ban imports from 'illegally occupied territories' and backed efforts for an arms embargo against Israel. The government will also introduce an 'accelerated decarbonization' bill to boost investment in renewable energy sources and move the country's 2040 decarbonization goal up to 2035. Additionally, a bill to speed up the permitting process for new projects is weeks away from being approved, aiming to cut permitting times by 30% to 70%. Boric defended his record, saying 'Have we achieved everything we wanted, with the depth we wanted? No, but we have made progress in that direction, with the conditions under which we had to govern.'

**Lula Calls for Focus on Digital Battle and Senate Election to Protect STF**
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva spoke on Sunday (1st) about the need to elect senators aligned with the government to ensure governability and prevent attacks on institutions, particularly the Supreme Court (STF). Lula stated, 'We need to win a majority in the Senate, otherwise these people will destroy the Supreme Court. It's not because the Supreme Court is a sweet apple. No. We need to preserve the institutions that guarantee the exercise of democracy in this country. If we destroy what we don't like, nothing will be left.' He also emphasized the importance of fighting in the digital realm, saying, 'We need to make a revolution in the digital network. We can't let the extreme right push us back. We need to rebuff them immediately. Each of you needs to become an influencer on the internet. If you attack the PSB, you'll get a beating.' Lula also announced that he will be a candidate for re-election in 2026, stating, 'If I'm as handsome as I am, as passionate as I am, and as motivated as I am, the extreme right won't govern this country again.' He criticized the interference of the US government in Brazilian affairs and defended Alexandre de Moraes, who is under threat of sanctions from the US government.

**Accelerated Decarbonization Project to be Submitted in 2025: 'Ending Coal-Fired Thermoelectric Plants'**
President Gabriel Boric announced that the accelerated decarbonization project will be submitted to Congress in the second half of 2025. He emphasized that the goal of a carbon-free energy matrix by 2040 is challenging but achievable, and that it will be driven by private investment and economic development. Boric mentioned the possibility of advancing the goal to 2035 or even earlier, depending on institutional conditions. He stated that 'while there are more clean energy projects, we will be able to decarbonize sooner and at the same time reduce the rise in tariffs.' Boric also noted that 'with the collaboration of all sectors, we could not only meet the goal set by President Piñera for 2040, but also advance it to 2035 or earlier, depending on the institutional verification of the conditions.' He concluded by saying that 'with this, we will achieve an unprecedented energy transition at the global level.'

**President Boric Announces Plan to Accelerate Decarbonization**
President Gabriel Boric announced during the State of the Nation address that his government will submit a bill to accelerate the country's decarbonization process in the second half of the year, aiming to meet the 2035 ecological goal. 'We have worked to make environmental care and sustainable development a priority in our decisions, which means changing the logic that has been used for too long', said the President. He also mentioned the implementation of the Climate Change Framework Law, which sets the goal of becoming a carbon-neutral country by 2050, and the approval of the National Strategy for Just Socio-ecological Transition. However, Boric stated that they want to go further. 'We will submit a bill to accelerate decarbonization in the second half of the year, which will facilitate investment projects to end coal-fired thermoelectric plants. With the collaboration of all sectors, we can not only meet the 2040 goal set by President Piñera, but also advance it to 2035', concluded the President.

**DOSB Receives Four High-Quality Concepts for Olympic Bid**
The German Olympic Committee (DOSB) has received four high-quality concepts from cities and regions interested in hosting the Olympics. According to DOSB President Thomas Weikert, 'We are convinced that with this selection process, we will not only find the best concept for Germany, but also one that will allow us to win in the international competition.' The four candidates are Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, and the Rhein-Ruhr region. Weikert added, 'We are very happy to have four high-quality concepts to choose from. This shows the continued appeal of Olympic and Paralympic Games.' The DOSB will develop the concepts with the candidates until the end of September and present them to the members at a meeting in Frankfurt on December 6. All four candidates plan to let the citizens vote on their plans. The final decision on the German candidate will be made by the end of 2026 and then approved by the DOSB members. The evaluation criteria and the composition of the committee that will make the selection are still unclear. Additionally, it is still undecided whether Germany will bid for the 2036, 2040, or 2044 Olympics. The last Olympics held in Germany were in 1972 in Munich.

**Eduardo Bolsonaro Considers Running for President in 2026, but Only if Father Decides Not to**
Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of former President Jair Bolsonaro, has expressed his willingness to run for President in 2026, but only if his father decides not to. In an interview with Veja magazine, Eduardo said, 'obviamente, se for uma missão dada pelo meu pai, vou cumprir' (obviously, if it's a mission given by my father, I will fulfill it). He also stated that he is not the owner of his father's will and that the decision of who will be the candidate will be made by Jair Bolsonaro. Eduardo also mentioned that his father is still a possible candidate, despite being ineligible until 2030 due to a conviction in the Electoral Court. He also spoke about his sister Michelle Bolsonaro, saying that she has a low rejection rate and is popular among evangelicals and women, but that the final decision will be made by Jair Bolsonaro.

**Senate Approves Proposal to End Re-election for President, Governors, and Mayors**
The Senate's Constitution and Justice Commission (CCJ) approved a Constitutional Amendment Proposal (PEC) that eliminates re-election for President, governors, and mayors. The measure also establishes five-year terms for these positions, as well as for deputies and senators, aiming to coincide elections every five years starting from 2034. The proposal, authored by Senator Jorge Kajuru (PSB-GO), stipulates that the end of re-election for mayors will take effect in 2028, while governors and the President will be affected in 2030. The 2026 elections will remain unchanged. To align the calendars, mayors and councilors elected in 2028 will have an exceptional six-year term. According to Senator Marcelo Castro (MDB-PI), the 2030 election will be the last with the possibility of re-election for governors and the President, with a four-year term for elected officials. 'From 2034, elections will take place on a single day in Brazil - from City Councilor to President of the Republic - every five years,' Castro explained, citing subsequent electoral cycles (2039, 2044, etc.).

**FIFA President Gianni Infantino Guarantees Access to Fans for 2025 Club World Cup in US**
FIFA President Gianni Infantino has confirmed that fans from all over the world will be welcome in the United States during the 2025 Club World Cup: 'The world will be welcome in the United States. Of course, the players and everyone involved, but also all the fans,' he said. This comes after concerns were raised about the anti-immigration policies of US President Donald Trump, which had sparked uncertainty among football fans. Infantino stated that the open migration policy has been confirmed directly by US authorities after a series of high-level meetings in Washington, including a recent meeting with Trump. He emphasized that 'everyone will be welcome.' The 2026 Club World Cup will feature 32 teams from five continents and will be held in eight US cities from June 14 to July 13. Infantino has also expressed support for a proposal to increase the number of teams participating in the 2030 World Cup from 48 to 64, as part of a plan pushed by the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL).

**Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals Are On the Way to the Slaughterhouse**
The author argues that the United Nations' (U.N.) Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals are a threat to the world, causing misery and destruction. The author claims that the U.N. has failed in its goals, citing examples such as the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) destruction of forests and the promotion of veganism, which the author believes shrinks the brain. The author also criticizes the U.N.'s regulation of land use, which they claim has led to the removal of property rights and the inability of local officials to make decisions based on the needs of their citizens. The author praises President Trump's decision to withdraw from the U.N.'s agenda and his efforts to promote economic growth and development. They also criticize the digital elite, who they believe are seeking to monetize America's lands and waters. The author argues that there is a choice to be made between a new feudalism, where people are dependent on billionaires for favors, and a revision of the 1880s, where families can live in peace and work, raise children, and participate in their communities.

**The end of AIDS is in sight: don't abandon PEPFAR now**
The US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is in jeopardy due to the sudden freeze of funding by the US government. PEPFAR has been instrumental in reducing the number of new HIV infections and AIDS-associated deaths by 90% by 2030. According to UNAIDS deputy executive director Angeli Achrekar, 'We're almost at the end of AIDS, and that can be accomplished in the next four or five years. Let's not step away, let's step in and finish what we promised we would do.' PEPFAR has financed 70% of the world's HIV response, saving more than 26 million lives and enabling nearly 8 million babies to be born HIV-free. The sudden freeze threatens not only funding, but also the stability of HIV/AIDS programmes in countries that relied on PEPFAR. The US government must urgently provide clarity about PEPFAR's future to prevent millions from becoming infected with HIV by 2030.

**US to Ban Artificial Food Colorings by 2026**
The US government, led by President Donald Trump, has announced its intention to ban all artificial food colorings in the country by the end of 2026. This move is supported by health experts. According to FDA's new head, Marty Makary, 'we are effectively banning all petroleum-derived food colorings in the US.' There are eight synthetic food colorings, all derived from petroleum, which are suspected to have negative health effects. They will be phased out by the end of 2026. Makary stated, 'over the past 50 years, American children have been living in a toxic soup of artificial chemicals.' He cited studies linking these additives to hyperactivity, diabetes, and cancer. The previous administration, led by President Joe Biden, had already banned another artificial food coloring, Red 3, due to its known carcinogenic effects. The new ban will affect Red 40, Yellow 5, and Yellow 6, which are widely used in the food industry. According to Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, 'none of them have any nutritional value. In fact, they only serve to deceive, making foods appear more attractive than they really are.'

**What will happen if Trump cuts the US's Global Fund contributions?**
An analysis published in the Journal of the International Aids Society found that a 90-day halt in funding from the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) due to President Donald Trump's freeze on US foreign aid would lead to 100,000 extra Aids-related deaths in the next year. This is a concerning development, especially considering the goal to end Aids as a public health threat by 2030. In 2023, there were nearly 1.3-million new HIV infections worldwide, three times more than the target of 370,000 by the end of the year. Dr. [no specific doctor is quoted in the article] noted that the US being a big player in the world's health funding can't be denied, with $12.4bn allocated to global health efforts in 2024, including $1.65bn to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria. 'It's not where the world wants to be,' said Dr. [no specific doctor is quoted in the article]. 'In fact, the goal is to end Aids as a public health threat by 2030. But we're way off track.'

**Alexander Vega: Consulta Popular Would Be Better in 2025 Than 2026**
Former National Registrar Alexander Vega stated that it would be better for the country if President Gustavo Petro reached an agreement with the legislative power to avoid a referendum during the country's fiscal deficit. Vega, who is now the co-director of the Partido de la U, said that the president lacks the political capital to pass the referendum, citing the need for 13.5 million votes to approve the question. Vega also stated that holding a referendum before the end of 2025 would be better than doing it in 2026, as it would avoid electoral dead time. He also criticized the consultation as a pre-campaign for the Pacto Historico, saying that it is funded by the state and lacks a real purpose. Vega also mentioned that his party is planning to hold a consultation of precandidates in March 2026, which would aim to present a centrist option to face the two extremes, the Petrismo and the antipetrismo.

**Trump’s oil ambitions face harsh economic and geologic realities**
President Donald Trump's goal of 'unleashing' American energy is facing harsh economic and geologic realities. U.S. oil production growth is starting to dwindle due to maturing shale plays and increasing costs. Brandon Myers, head of research at Novi Labs, said, 'We're 17, 18 years into the U.S. shale story. It does have an end.' The U.S. oil industry is producing more crude than ever before, but the price of gasoline is slightly higher than $3 a gallon. Some analysts predict that production will level off in the coming years and then start to decline by the early 2030s. Barry Rabe, a professor emeritus of environmental policy at the University of Michigan, said, 'That presumes that you can press a button and get even more out of those rocks than ever for an extended period of time. Pulling that off is sort of a triple bank shot.' The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted that the country's oil production will grow a little more than 3 percent in 2025, but then climb less than 1 percent in 2026. Natural gas, however, is not seeing the same trend, with decades of supply left. The country's position as an oil powerhouse could be challenged in the years ahead.

**False Claim: Lula to Serve Horse Meat to Prisoners in 2025**
A presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) is being targeted by criticism over food prices, despite promising to make high-quality meats more accessible during his 2022 presidential campaign. A viral video on social media, viewed over 137,000 times since January 27, 2025, claims that Lula plans to serve horse meat to prisoners. However, the content is from March 2014 and refers to a controversial event organized by a Rio Grande do Norte prosecutor, Sílvio Ricardo Brito, without any relation to the president. According to the video, the prosecutor proposed serving horse meat to prisoners as an alternative for the 600 horses seized on the roads. However, this content was not published in 2025 and is not related to any of Lula's policies. A search for the keywords 'horse meat', 'prisoners', and 'Rio Grande do Norte' found articles from March 2014 about the event, which was met with negative repercussions, including a petition to reprimand Brito and a note from the Brazilian Vegetarian Society. The proposal was also debated in the Brazilian Congress in 2014, resulting in a commitment to pass a law prohibiting the slaughter of equines, mules, and donkeys. The initiative has support from other measures, including a bill approved by the Brazilian Congress in 2023 to prohibit the slaughter of equines and equids for commercial purposes.

**Will an AI Candidate Run for President in 2032?**
Elon Musk has sparked debate by predicting the possibility of an AI candidate running for the U.S. presidency in 2032. He believes that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could emerge as early as 2026 and undermine democracy. Supporters argue that AI could remove emotional biases and corruption from politics, while critics worry about accountability and the potential for AI to malfunction or stray from its objectives. A 'hybrid' future, where human leaders are augmented by AI systems, is also being considered. Musk's comments highlight the need for caution and clear guidelines for AI use in governance and society. The debate encourages us to think critically about technology's role in democracy and whether removing emotions, flaws, and biases from leadership creates an even greater risk of losing what makes us human.
