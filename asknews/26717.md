**NovoCure's Tumor Treating Fields Boost One-Year And Pain-Free Survival In Pancreatic Cancer Trial - NovoCure (NASDAQ:NVCR), Zai Lab (NASDAQ:ZLAB)**
NovoCure and Zai Lab revealed additional data from the Phase 3 PANOVA-3 trial of Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy for pancreatic cancer. The trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in median overall survival (mOS) for patients treated with TTFields. Patients treated with TTFields therapy concomitantly with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel had an mOS of 16.2 months compared to 14.2 months for patients treated with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone. TTFields therapy also demonstrated improvement in one-year and pain-free survival rates, with a statistically significant 7.9% improvement in one-year survival rate and a 6.1-month extension in pain-free survival. The therapy was well-tolerated, with mild to moderate skin adverse events being the most common device-related adverse events. 'This is a statistically significant 2.0-month improvement in median overall survival and a statistically significant 6.1-month extension in pain-free survival,' said the study. 'These results demonstrate the potential of TTFields therapy to improve outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer.'

**Spanish Government Agrees to Extend Life of Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant**
The Spanish government has agreed to extend the life of the Almaraz nuclear power plant in Cáceres for three years if the companies that own it, Endesa, Iberdrola, and Naturgy, request it. According to Gil Rosiña, the spokesperson for the PSOE in Extremadura, the minister for Ecological Transition, Sara Aagesen, informed the regional leader of the party, Miguel Ángel Gallardo, of her intention to accept the extension over the weekend. The companies have agreed to present a formal request to the government in the near future, with the CEO of Endesa, José Bogas, stating that a three-year extension would not be a 'radical change' and that there is consensus among the three owners. The president of Naturgy, Francisco Reynés, has also expressed support for the extension, suggesting that it would be a 'tregua' or a temporary reprieve from the planned closure in 2027 and 2028. However, the deputy of Unidas de Extremadura, Joaquín Macías, has criticized the possible extension as a 'tomadura de pelo' or a joke.

**Commission Approves Extension of Deadline for Donations to Health Programs**
The Commission for the Defense of the Rights of People with Disabilities in the Chamber of Deputies approved a bill that extends the deadline for deducting donations to two health programs from the Income Tax (IR). The programs, created by Law 12.715/12, can receive resources from individuals until 2025 and from companies until 2026. If the proposal becomes law, donations and sponsorships can be deducted from the IR until 2029, respecting the 1% limit of the tax due. According to the rapporteur, Dr. Francisco (PT-PI), the approved text recognizes the importance of these programs, but adapts the proposal to the current Law of Directives for the Budget (LDO), which limits the duration of tax benefits to five years. Sergio Souza (MDB-PR) stated, 'The prorogation until the year 2029 represents a technically adequate and legally viable solution, at the same time ensuring legal security and predictability for the institutions that depend on this financing mechanism.'

**One-time therapy may be 'transformative option´ for treating deadly...**
A groundbreaking one-time treatment, lifileucel, has shown promising results in treating advanced melanoma, with almost one in five patients surviving for five years after receiving the treatment. The trial, led by Dr. Andrew Furness, found that tumours shrunk in 79.3% of patients, and 19.7% of patients were still alive with no new or delayed side effects at a five-year follow-up. Dr. Furness said, 'Results from this trial have shown that TIL therapy may change the outlook for people with advanced melanoma.' The treatment, which harnesses a patient's own immune system to fight the disease, is not yet approved for use in the UK, but was given the green light by the US FDA in February 2024. 'We're continuing our research into the use of TIL therapy, as well as other forms of cellular therapy, across a broader spectrum of cancers,' Dr. Furness added. Cancer patient Zoe Phillips, 46, who took part in the trial, said, 'Before coming to The Royal Marsden I was told that I would probably die, so hearing that my treatment had been successful was amazing, I was over the moon.'

**Treatment switching guided by liquid biopsy results improves outcomes in advanced breast cancer**
A large clinical trial, SERENA-6, has found that using liquid biopsy blood tests to detect treatment-resistance mutations in advanced breast cancer patients, followed by a switch to a new treatment, significantly extends the period of tumor control compared to standard care. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that patients who switched to the new treatment, camizestrant, had a longer period of tumor non-progression (16.0 months vs. 9.2 months) and a longer time to deterioration in their overall health status and quality of life (23.0 months vs. 6.4 months). Dr. Massimo Cristofanilli, study co-author, said, 'The main message here is that liquid biopsy technology allows us to intervene sooner when the tumor burden is lower and the chance of a good outcome is higher.' The study enrolled 315 patients and was conducted at multiple medical centers worldwide.

**Breakthrough Immunotherapy Extends Lives of Cancer Patients by 40%**
A groundbreaking immunotherapy treatment using 'Car T-cell' cells has been shown to extend the lives of cancer patients by 40% compared to traditional treatments. This revolutionary treatment, which involves modifying the patient's immune cells to attack tumors, has been hailed as a major breakthrough in combating solid tumors, such as stomach, breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer, which account for 90% of cancer cases. In a clinical trial conducted in China, over 100 patients with advanced stomach or gastroesophageal cancer were randomly assigned to receive either the immunotherapy or standard treatments. The results, published in The Lancet and presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco) in Chicago, showed that patients who received the immunotherapy lived for an average of 7.9 months after randomization, compared to 5.5 months for those who received standard treatment. The immunotherapy group also experienced a median period of 3.3 months without disease progression, compared to 1.8 months for the other group. The researchers from Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute described the results as a significant and notable improvement in survival rates, noting that this treatment could represent a paradigm shift in caring for patients who have exhausted traditional treatment options. Dr. Carl June, a leading expert in this field from the University of Pennsylvania, called the study a 'historic achievement' in treating solid tumors. In a related development, another study from the University of Pennsylvania, to be presented at the conference, showed that immunotherapy can reduce brain tumors in patients with glioblastoma, a aggressive form of brain cancer, boosting hopes for extending their lives. The treatment involves engineering the patient's T-cells to recognize and destroy cancer cells more effectively, where these cells are modified in the lab and then returned to the patient's bloodstream. Although this treatment has previously shown success in treating blood cancers, the new results demonstrate its potential in tackling solid tumors. Experts in Chicago expressed optimism that this treatment could revolutionize the treatment of solid tumors, citing its previous successes with blood cancers. Dr. John Hanin from the Dutch Cancer Institute noted that these results represent a new generation of treatments, while Dr. Catherine Elliott from the UK's Cancer Research Institute said that this step is encouraging, but emphasized the need for wider trials to confirm the efficacy before widespread adoption.

**‘Groundbreaking’ cancer therapy boosts survival by 40% in landmark study**
A landmark study has shown that CAR-T cell therapy can boost survival rates for patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer by 40%. The research, presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology's annual conference, found that patients who received CAR-T therapy lived on average 7.9 months, compared to 5.5 months with standard care. Dr Carl June called the findings 'groundbreaking', while Dr Jason Luke described them as 'exciting'. However, Dr Jennifer Eads noted that the therapy only extended survival by around two months and that ways to lower the cost of CAR-T therapy will need to be found in order to make it widely available.

**Breakthrough cancer drug doubles survival in trial - Business Telegraph**
A clinical trial has shown that an immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab, doubles the length of time patients with advanced head and neck cancer are cancer-free, from around 2.5 years to five years. The trial, involving over 350 patients, found that those given the drug before and after surgery had a 10% lower risk of their cancer returning elsewhere in the body after three years. Laura Marston, a 45-year-old from Derbyshire, was one of the patients in the trial and says she is 'amazed she's still here' after being given a 30% chance of survival six years ago. She received the immunotherapy before and after surgery, which helped her body learn to attack the cancer if it returned. Prof Kevin Harrington, who led the trial in the UK, says the results are 'really exciting' and that the treatment could 'change the world' for patients with this difficult-to-treat cancer. The researchers are now calling for the treatment to be made available on the NHS.

**New Treatment for Aggressive Breast Cancer Achieves Astonishing 100% Survival Rate**
A new pre-surgery treatment strategy for inherited breast cancer has achieved a 100% survival rate in a clinical trial led by Cambridge researchers. The treatment involves a combination of chemotherapy and a targeted cancer drug, olaparib, given 48 hours apart. This approach has shown to be more effective than the current standard of care, with 100% of patients surviving three years after surgery, compared to 88% in the control arm. The findings have the potential to be applied to other cancers caused by faulty copies of BRCA genes, such as ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. Professor Jean Abraham said, 'It is rare to have a 100% survival rate in a study like this and for these aggressive types of cancer. We’re incredibly excited about the potential of this new approach, as it’s crucial that we find a way to treat and hopefully cure patients who are diagnosed with BRCA1 and BRCA2-related cancers.'

**AI Demands Radical Changes for Young Adults**
The AI (Assurance Invalidité) in Switzerland is facing alarming numbers. Two-thirds of young adults (18-24 years old) receiving AI benefits are due to mental health issues, affecting 7,399 individuals. Thomas Pfiffner, vice-president of the AI offices, proposes radical changes, including not offering AI benefits to those under 30 years old. Instead, a lower indemnity would be provided, linked to conditions such as insertion measures or therapeutic treatments. Pfiffner explains, 'From the AI side, it would be a big difference compared to the rent: we would keep the file open and continue to accompany this person in the context of an active follow-up.' This would allow for active reintegration into the workforce. Additionally, AI plans to introduce limited-time benefits, currently, AI benefits are paid for life, which complicates returning to active life, according to Pfiffner. He suggests a three-year limitation, which could change the attitude of insured individuals. These proposals will be submitted to the Federal Council for a future revision of AI, with a first discussion expected before the summer break. AI hopes these measures will reduce the growing number of young beneficiaries.

**Automatische Vertragsverlängerung - neue Rechtslage**
A new law has been introduced in 2022 to prevent companies from taking advantage of consumers with long-term contracts. The law states that consumers have a 4-week notice period, instead of 12 months or years, to cancel contracts. This applies to all contracts, except for insurance contracts which have special regulations. Automatic contract extensions are allowed if they are specified in the general terms and conditions (AGB), but the extension can only last for one year and the consumer must agree to it. The notice period for cancellation cannot exceed one month. This law also applies to online press portals like openPR.

**The Rise of Radical Longevity: A New Frontier in Health Management**
The trend of 'radical longevity' is emerging as a new direction in health management, following the current focus on 'slow aging'. Experts are optimistic about the potential of radical longevity, which involves using technology to extend human lifespan. The concept of radical longevity is gaining attention worldwide, with researchers exploring gene editing, stem cell technology, and cell reprogramming to reverse aging. Japanese scientist Shinya Yamanaka, who won the Nobel Prize in 2012 for his work on induced pluripotent stem cells, is a pioneer in this field. His team has successfully reprogrammed cells to remove signs of aging in animal experiments. Clinical trials for treating age-related macular degeneration are underway. Another key technology in radical longevity is telomere extension, which has shown promise in animal studies by increasing lifespan by an average of 13%. A small molecule drug called Telomir-1, which aims to extend telomeres, is expected to enter clinical trials later this year. Major tech companies, including Amazon and Google, are also investing in radical longevity research. Amazon's Altos Labs is developing technology to reverse aging, while Google's Calico is using AI and big data to study biological data related to aging. Other companies, such as Unity Biotechnology and Retro Bioscience, are also working on cell reprogramming and senolytic therapies. According to futurist Peter Diamandis, radical longevity could become a reality within the next 10-15 years.

**A New Era In Systemic Therapies, Pembrolizumab for High Risk Non-Muscle Invasive BCG-Refractory Patients - Arjun Balar**
Arjun Balar discussed the new era of systemic therapies for high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. He highlighted the issue of patients being terrified of having their bladder removed due to the long-term consequences on quality of life. Balar mentioned that a 2013 workshop defined the appropriate trial design for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, including benchmarks for efficacy endpoints. He also discussed the importance of defining BCG unresponsive bladder cancer, which was previously not well-defined. The trial Keynote-057 was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in patients with BCG unresponsive carcinoma in situ with or without papillary tumors. The results showed that patients who received pembrolizumab had a median duration of response of 16 months, with some patients experiencing complete responses lasting two years or longer. Balar emphasized that systemic immunotherapy can lead to durable complete responses in the bladder, eliminating the need for radical cystectomy. 'Most patients are terrified of having their bladder removed because of the long-term consequences in terms of impact on the quality of life,' Balar said. 'Also, the short-term issues related to the morbidity of the surgery and sometimes mortality as well.'

**Mum given weeks to live in race against time to secure life-extending treatment**
Jane Loftus, a 62-year-old Scottish mother of two, has been given weeks to live after being diagnosed with Stage 4 Pancreatic Cancer. Despite a five-month misdiagnosis, Jane has responded well to chemotherapy and is now in a race against time to secure life-extending treatment called Histotripsy, which could add up to ten years to her life. However, her insurance has refused to pay for the treatment, leaving her with a £46,000 bill. A GoFundMe has been set up to help cover the cost, which has already raised £12,000. Jane said, 'I hope that Histotripsy will give me longer in this world. There could be a cure in ten years. I just need to get there.' Her two sons, Jason and Michael, have been instrumental in her fight against cancer, and she credits them with helping her to stay strong. Jane added, 'My sons are the reason I'm still here. They built me back up after I dropped to just seven stone. I'm still fighting because of them.'

**The Ethics of Life Extension: A Complex Question**
The author reflects on the possibility of life extension technologies becoming available in the near future (10-20 years). He considers the technical aspects of such technologies, which would allow people to undergo therapy to prolong their life for an extended period. However, the author emphasizes that the main challenge lies in the moral and ethical aspects of using such technologies, particularly the question of whether individuals want to extend their life and, if so, for how long. He presents several factors that could influence a person's decision, including personal life, professional life, financial security, and social environment. The author also references various studies and films that explore the complexities of life extension and the human desire to live longer. He concludes by inviting readers to participate in an online poll and discuss the topic in the comments.

**Oncological Oblivion Law: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers**
The Spanish Ministry of Health has created a document with frequently asked questions and answers about the oncological oblivion law, which aims to end the discrimination faced by cancer patients when contracting services such as insurance or mortgages. The law, which came into effect five years after the completion of radical treatment, excludes patients with chronic conditions that will not disappear, but includes those who are free of the disease, even if they take medication for life. The document clarifies that patients who suffer a relapse after contracting a policy do not have to declare it, but the insurer may oppose the renewal in certain cases. It also states that patients with cancer can now contract insurance without retroactive effect, and that the premiums for renewable temporary insurance policies should not take into account the cancer. The document also addresses questions about the treatment of sequelae, the elimination of medical data from company databases, and the obligation to inform about a cancer that has been overcome for more than 5 years. Mónica García, the Minister of Health, explained that the document will be 'alive and constantly evolving' as new doubts arise. 'It is a debt pending with the associations that have been claiming the need to elaborate this document of frequent questions and answers,' she said. 'We have created a working group with the General Directorate of Insurance, the General Directorate of Consumption and the Spanish Agency for Data Protection to elaborate this document.'

**Clarification on the Right to Oncological Oblivion in Spain**
The Spanish Ministry of Health has created a document to clarify the 'right to oncological oblivion', which allows people who have completed cancer treatment five years before contracting a life insurance or financial product to not declare the disease. The document answers several questions, including: if a person suffers a relapse after contracting a life insurance, they do not have to declare it, but the insurer may oppose the renewal of the contract; if a person has had cancer more than five years ago but has medical sequelae, they should declare them before contracting a life insurance; if a person was denied a life insurance before the right to oncological oblivion came into effect, they can now contract it, but without retroactive effect; if a person has difficulty contracting life insurance, they should file a complaint with the General Directorate of Insurance and Pension Funds; it is not obligatory to declare a cancer that has been overcome more than five years ago, but it is recommended to do so for a renewable temporary insurance contract; if a person was granted a mortgage, life insurance, etc. and omitted that they were or had been an oncological patient, the bank or insurance company could now cancel the mortgage, credit, etc. even if they now meet the 5-year criterion from the 'radical treatment' without any relapse.

**Frequently Asked Questions about the Right to Oncological Oblivion**
The Spanish Ministry of Health, the General Directorate of Insurance, the Directorate General of Consumption, and the Spanish Data Protection Agency have created a document with frequently asked questions about the application of the right to oncological oblivion. This right, approved by the Government almost two years ago, guarantees that cancer survivors have equal access to insurance and banking products. The document clarifies that the right to oncological oblivion applies to any type of insurance where the policyholder is a consumer. It is not mandatory to disclose cancer that has been overcome more than 5 years ago, but it is recommended to do so when renewing a temporary insurance contract. If a policyholder omits information about their cancer, the insurer can cancel the contract. Patients can request the deletion of their medical data from the companies' databases under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The 5-year period for the application of the right to oncological oblivion starts from the date of completion of the 'radical treatment', which includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other therapies applied alone or in combination. The right does not apply to patients with chronic diseases that are controlled, but it does apply to patients who are free of the disease, even if they take medication for life. If a policyholder suffers a relapse after contracting a policy, they are not obligated to declare it, but the insurer can oppose the renewal of the contract in certain cases. The document also clarifies how to treat the consequences of cancer in the contracting of insurance, and how to request insurance in a retroactive manner or modify the conditions of existing policies.
