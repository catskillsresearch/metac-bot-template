**Rebuilding Democracy: A Call to Action**
The author reflects on the recent changes to the Mexican judiciary, stating that the independence and honor of the Supreme Court of Justice have been compromised. The author argues that the new system will be controlled by an elite that will prioritize their own interests over those of the people. The author suggests that the opposition must take action to rebuild democracy, starting with the 2027 elections, where they can potentially increase their power in Congress and the states. The author emphasizes the importance of concrete actions and solutions, rather than just criticizing the current system. The author also notes that the opposition must recognize their past mistakes and engage in honest and serious dialogue with the public. Ultimately, the author believes that rebuilding democracy is possible, but it requires effort and commitment from the opposition and the public. 'El pesimismo conduce a la debilidad, el optimismo al poder' (Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power), as William James said.

**Mutualists to Receive Overpaid IRPF in Single Payment**
The Spanish Congress has unblocked the legal reform that will allow retired mutualists to claim their overpaid IRPF in a single payment in 2025. The new text is expected to be approved by the parliamentary commission in mid-June. This modification, backed by the lower chamber, will enable the Tax Agency to make fiscal refunds to people who paid more in mutualities before joining the Social Security system, as recognized by the Supreme Court. The change, introduced as an amendment by the PSOE in the law on civil liability and motor vehicle insurance, adds a final provision to the text on motor insurance to reform the procedure followed by the Tax Agency to determine the grounds for and, if applicable, practice refunds related to the jurisprudence established by the Supreme Court on IRPF for mutualists. Specifically, the measure refers to unexpired periods from 2019 and earlier, as well as from 2020 to 2022. The Tax Agency will now calculate the refund automatically using Renta Web, if it has the necessary information to do so, to minimize taxation on pensions for retirement or disability.

**Milei Postpones Supreme Court Reform Until After October Elections**
Before the Senate debate on the expansion of the Supreme Court of Justice, President Javier Milei assured a legislator that reforming the highest court is not on his agenda. He stated that it is more likely that the topic will be put on hold until after the October legislative elections, speculating that La Libertad Avanza and its allies might gain enough seats to surpass the kirchnerismo and achieve a new majority. Milei said, 'It is not in my agenda to advance with changes in the Supreme Court until after the October elections.'

**A New Era for Mexico's Judiciary: Change and Challenges Ahead**
A new chapter in the history of justice in Mexico is being written, as citizens will be able to vote for their preferred candidates for the country's judiciary. The departure of experienced jurists and the arrival of new ones has sparked debate and controversy. The outgoing ministers, including Margarita Ríos Farjat, Norma Lucía Piña Hernández, and others, are being replaced by new candidates. As the author notes, 'the spirit of Montesquieu has left the Supreme Court of Justice to witness this change.' The new judges will be sworn in by September, and their decisions will be a test of the new judiciary. The author, an attorney and activist, believes that the change is necessary and that 'excellent profiles with preparation and genuine interest in changing the paradigm of justice' will emerge. However, he also notes that the departure of experienced jurists will be missed, and that the new judges will face challenges in upholding the Constitution and the rule of law.

**BREAKING: Nigerian Supreme Court Staff Union Says It Won't Join Lower Courts In Nationwide Strike Over Wage Demands**
The Supreme Court chapter of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) has announced that it will not join the nationwide strike initiated by its colleagues in lower courts. The decision was made after an emergency meeting, where the chapter stated that the unique circumstances of the Supreme Court and its ongoing engagements make it impractical to participate in the strike. The chapter commended the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Hon. Justice Kudirat Motonmori Olatukunbo Kekere-Ekun, for her efforts to resolve outstanding financial obligations to judiciary workers. 'The executives of the Staff Union came to conclusion after careful assessment of the issues, and subsequent efforts of the Hon., the CJN to resolve every outstanding, accruing to judiciary staff,' it said. The chapter argued that joining the strike would disregard the CJN's determined efforts and could undermine the progress that has been made so far. It further explained that the welfare of Supreme Court staff remains a top priority and that the chapter's current approach -- marked by ongoing dialogue and cooperation with the relevant authorities -- would better serve the long-term interests of staff. 'Therefore, joining the proposed strike will amount to misplacement priority and neglect from the Supreme Court staff,' it said.

**La Jornada: New SCJN to Operate with Rules Making it a Strictly Constitutional Control Court**
The new Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) will operate under rules that make it a strictly constitutional control court. The court will be reconfigured with a new structure and functioning, and will have faculties that will be different from the previous ones. The plenary session of the court will be composed of nine ministers, elected for the first time by popular vote, who will take office on September 1st. The ministers will serve for 12 years, down from 15 years previously. The new scheme also establishes that the court will be predominantly female, with five women and four men. Additionally, the minimum number of votes required to declare the unconstitutionality of laws will be reduced from eight to six. The head of the court will no longer have a decisive vote in case of a tie. The presidential term in the highest court will also change, from four years to two years, and will be renewed in a rotational manner, based on the number of votes obtained by each candidate in the election. As stated by the article, 'the presidency will fall to the one who obtains the highest vote count.'

**The U.S. Supreme Court Could Realistically End Cannabis Prohibition in the Near Future**
The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently rejected a lawsuit by Massachusetts-based cannabis businesses seeking to overturn the federal ban on marijuana. However, the plaintiffs' attorney, Jonathan Schiller, said they will seek Supreme Court review. Justice Clarence Thomas has expressed skepticism about the federal government's approach to marijuana policy, and some legal experts believe the case has a realistic chance of being taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Court takes up the case, the three liberal justices may side with Justice Thomas in ending prohibition, potentially ending the federal ban on personal freedom grounds. A decision could be expected by mid-2026, potentially making it a key issue for the midterm elections.

**US Supreme Court Allows Trump to Revoke Residency Permits of 500,000 Migrants**
The US Supreme Court has ruled that Donald Trump can revoke the residency permits of approximately 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The court's decision does not provide a justification. The affected migrants now face deportation. In a dissenting opinion, Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor warned of 'devastating consequences' for the affected foreigners, stating that their lives would be 'turned upside down' while their court cases are still ongoing. The US government had appealed to the Supreme Court after a lower court blocked the revocation of the CHNV program, which was introduced by Trump's predecessor Joe Biden in December 2022 and expanded in January 2023. The program, named after the first letters of the English names of the four countries, allowed up to 30,000 people from these countries to enter the US and receive a two-year residency permit each month. Trump had campaigned on a promise to take a hardline stance against illegal immigration and deport millions of undocumented immigrants.

**Supreme Court Proposes Changes to Punishment for Narcotics Possession**
The Supreme Court has proposed changes to the punishment for possession of narcotics without the intention of selling them. According to 'Kommerstant', the proposed amendments to the Criminal Code, which were submitted to the Supreme Court's plenum, suggest that those found guilty should be sent for treatment for narcotics addiction and not be deprived of their freedom. The proposed amendments would exclude imprisonment from the following articles: Acquisition, possession of narcotics without the intention of selling them - part 1 of article 228 of the Criminal Code; Counterfeiting prescriptions for narcotics - article 233 of the Criminal Code; Cultivation of narcotic plants - part 1 of article 231 of the Criminal Code. Currently, the maximum punishment for these articles is up to three years of imprisonment. The amendments also suggest reducing the maximum terms for part 2 of article 228 of the Criminal Code from ten to five years, and for part 3 of article 228 of the Criminal Code from 15 to ten years. The Supreme Court notes that over the past 20 years, changes in the legislation have been aimed at strengthening responsibility for the illegal circulation of narcotics, but an analysis of judicial practice shows the need for 'a more balanced approach by the legislator in choosing measures of responsibility for such acts, if they are not related to the sale of narcotics.' Additionally, the Supreme Court emphasizes that those who commit such crimes are those who need rehabilitation, i.e., their illness is a factor that forces them to violate the law, as stated by the Supreme Court. 'The analysis of judicial practice shows that the majority of those who commit such crimes are those who need rehabilitation, and their illness is a factor that forces them to violate the law,' said the Supreme Court. 'Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the circumstances of the case and to choose a more humane approach to punishment, which would take into account the need for treatment and rehabilitation of the person who committed the crime.'

**Powell Survives Removal Threat, Two Other Threats Remain**
The US Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the threat to the Federal Reserve, which was surrounding Jerome Powell, by ruling that the majority of its members will keep Gwen Wilcox, who was fired by Trump from the National Labor Relations Board in January without cause, out of her position until the case is heard in lower courts. The court indicated that it was leaning towards overturning a 90-year-old precedent that requires Congress to create positions in similar boards, where officials are protected from dismissal, except in cases of serious misconduct. However, they are employees of a 'quasi-public entity with a unique structure', and therefore different rules apply. This is bad news for Wilcox and other officials fired by Trump, but good news for Powell and other Federal Reserve officials. Powell praised American universities, describing them as 'a vital national asset', at a time when they are under attack from the current administration. He called on Princeton University graduates to fight for the defense of American democracy. Powell said, 'When you look back after 50 years, you will want to know that you did everything in your power to preserve and strengthen our democracy, and to get closer to the timeless principles that the founders established.' Only two threats remain out of three, and the jobs of Federal Reserve officials may be safe, but their reputation still depends on their response to threats of tariffs and budget, which surround the American economy. However, it is worth noting how market expectations and analysts' expectations about monetary policy have changed during the past month. In early May, the dominance was of recession risks resulting from tariffs. There were concerns that sharp increases in tariffs would lead to a severe slowdown in the US economy, which would force the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy even if inflation rises. If we draw the future interest rate forecasts for the market by the end of 2025 and the end of 2026, it becomes clear that during May, there was an increase in the understanding that the US Federal Reserve will want to wait and observe before changing interest rates. Everyone knew that inflation would rise, due to the large increases in gas and electricity prices in February, in addition to specific tax increases such as vehicle registration fees, and the possibility of rising air ticket prices, due to the delay of Easter in 2025. Most of the increase in the overall inflation rate can be attributed to the rise in gas and electricity prices, vehicle registration fees, and a 27% increase in air ticket prices, all of which are one-time price fluctuations.

According to demographic data and assuming above-average access to healthcare, the expected death dates of US Supreme Court Justices are: ... (list of justices not provided in the article, but implied to be known by the author). The conservative majority is likely to remain until at least 2035, and possibly until 2050, as the three Trump nominees are expected to serve until then. To retain a majority until 2050, the GOP only needs to appoint two of the five vacancies expected to arise before then.

**"Supreme Court Is Chief Justice-Centric, Needs To Change": Justice Abhay Oka**
Supreme Court judge AS Oka, who retired on Friday, has called for reform in the court, stating that it is 'Chief Justice-centric' and needs to change. Oka observed that High Courts function more democratically than the Supreme Court, which he believes is due to the Supreme Court's reliance on the Chief Justice of India. He expressed hope that the new Chief Justice, BR Gavai, will bring about this change, saying, 'You will see this change with the new CJI.' Oka noted that High Courts operate through committees, whereas the Supreme Court is heavily influenced by the Chief Justice.

**Proposal to Expand the Supreme Court from 5 to 7 Members**
Senators Ariel Lijo and Manuel García-Mansilla are proposing to expand the Supreme Court from 5 to 7 members. This would limit the number of judges of the same sex to 5. Specifically, Romero suggests modifying article 21 of the Decree Law N° 1285/58, stating that 'The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation will be composed of seven (7) judges, of which no more than five (5) of its members will be of the same sex.' This change aims to increase the court's legitimacy, representation, and federalism, as well as provide real equal opportunities between men and women. Romero stated, 'Promoting a more extensive Supreme Court, guaranteeing suitability and equal representation, is the axis of this project.'

**The Supreme Court that is leaving: A shift towards a Tribunal of legality**
The current Supreme Court is facing a significant change. The new Court will be less powerful and less relevant than its predecessor, which was established after the transition to democracy in the 1990s. The previous Court was a Constitutional Tribunal, but the new one will be more like a Tribunal of legality. The reform of Article 105 of the Constitution, which allowed the Court to resolve conflicts between the powers of the Union and between different levels of government, is being restricted. This means that the new Court will have less work and less relevance, and will be dominated by the ruling party. The author notes that the election of 2027 could change the composition of Congress and allow for the promotion of actions of unconstitutionality, but for now, the Court's powers are being diminished. The new Court will be marked by its reduced powers and limited ability to enforce the rules of a system of checks and balances that is currently weak and limited.

**Trump vs. the Supreme Court: A Changing Landscape**
In the United States, a significant change is expected in the Supreme Court with the upcoming presidential election. Donald Trump, the former president, is facing multiple lawsuits, including Trump v. Anderson and Trump v. United States. The Supreme Court is expected to undergo significant changes, with 15 new judges to be appointed by the Congress. According to Alexis Colón, a lawyer and columnist, 'The upcoming changes in the Supreme Court will have a significant impact on the country's laws and the rights of citizens.' The change in the court's composition is expected to affect various areas of law, including constitutional rights, free speech, and due process. Trump's lawyers are facing criticism for their handling of the cases, with some calling for 'sanciones' or sanctions against them. The Supreme Court's decision will have far-reaching implications for the country's governance and the rule of law.

**Analysis: WI Congressional Maps Unlikely To Change**
A recent legal memo from the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty (WILL) argues that the Wisconsin Supreme Court is unlikely to change the state's congressional maps before the 2026 elections. The memo, written by deputy counsel Lucas Vebber, points out that any effort to reconfigure the maps would face 'significant practical and legal problems' in both state and federal court. Vebber notes that the court's decision to adopt Governor Tony Evers' map proposal in 2022, which was chosen from four submissions, would need to be reversed, and that at least three justices who adopted the map would need to reverse their decision to decline to reopen the case last year. The memo also highlights the potential conflict of interest of Justice Susan Crawford, who appeared at a donor advisory Zoom session promoting the idea that electing her would help Democrats take back the House. Vebber argues that there is no 'obvious basis' for bringing back the case, and that any effort by the Wisconsin Supreme Court to change the maps would likely be blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 2023 that state courts may not unconstitutionally intrude upon the role specifically reserved to the state legislature. 'This is not the slam dunk that it was made out to be by partisans in this political contest,' Vebber said. 'Any effort by the Wisconsin Supreme Court to throw out the Governor Evers map it adopted just three years ago (and declined to revisit just last year), would almost certainly fall within what the United States Supreme Court's warned state courts could not do,' he added.

**Halfway to the 2030 census, the Supreme Court is still dealing with lawsuits over the last one - World News**
The United States is halfway to the next census, but the Supreme Court is still dealing with lawsuits from the last one. The court is taking up a challenge to Louisiana's congressional map, which was drawn to include two majority Black districts for the first time. The justices must decide whether the new map was driven by politics or race. The court's conservative majority has previously ruled that partisan gerrymandering cases do not belong in federal courts, and some justices have suggested that racial gerrymandering cases should also be removed from federal jurisdiction. However, the court does not have to touch this issue to resolve the Louisiana case. A Black Democrat, Cleo Fields, won the new district in the 2024 election, which has a 55% Black voter population. The state has also changed its election process to partisan primary elections in the spring, followed by a November showdown between the party nominees.

**Senate GOP Proposes Constitutional Amendment To Limit Size Of Supreme Court**
Republicans in the U.S. Senate have proposed a constitutional amendment, the Keep Nine Amendment, to prevent federal lawmakers from increasing the number of justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. The amendment comes after Democrats proposed measures to boost the number of justices and enforce ethics standards. Republicans argue that efforts to regulate the court are unconstitutional and motivated by partisan animus. The current limit of nine justices was established by the Judiciary Act of 1869 and has not changed since then. Amending the U.S. Constitution is difficult, requiring a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress or by two-thirds of states participating in a special constitutional convention, and then ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the states. Sen. Chuck Grassley said, 'The Court is a co-equal branch of government, and our Keep Nine Amendment will ensure that it remains independent from political pressure.' Co-sponsor Sen. Ted Cruz said the amendment is needed to check Democrats' 'efforts to undermine the integrity of the Court.' Democrats have proposed several bills to expand the court, including Sen. Ron Wyden's legislation to add six justices and Sen. Ed Markey's legislation to raise the cap on justices to 13.
