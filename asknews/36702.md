**Lula Trails in Second Round of 2026 Presidential Election, Poll Shows**
According to a recent opinion poll by Instituto Paraná Pesquisas, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) would struggle to win re-election in a second round of the 2026 presidential election, even against Michelle Bolsonaro and Tarcísio de Freitas. However, Lula would win against Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of former President Jair Bolsonaro. In a hypothetical first round, 37.2% of voters would choose Jair Bolsonaro, while 32.8% would prefer Lula to remain in office. In a second round, Michelle Bolsonaro would win with 44.4% of the votes, followed by Tarcísio de Freitas with 43.6%. Lula would only win re-election against Eduardo Bolsonaro, with 41.6% of the votes to Eduardo's 39.1%.

**Evo Morales Maintains 'Hope' for Candidacy; Pact of Unity Ratifies**
Evo Morales, the former president of Bolivia, expressed 'a small hope' that his candidacy for the upcoming presidential elections will be registered. The Pact of Unity, an alliance close to Morales, has reaffirmed his candidacy as 'a symbol of unity' and demanded the holding of plural elections. Morales stated that the undecided vote in the polls confirms that he 'remains first' in the electoral preference. He also mentioned that he is the 'most hated' politician because he has always been against imperialism. Morales lamented that many of his former allies have abandoned him and do not even answer his calls. According to Morales, the 27% of undecided, null, and blank votes in the polls is equivalent to 21% of the vote for him. He cited a Unitel poll that shows him leading in the elections, even in a poll by El Deber. 'The others are looking for flaws, like Evo cannot be a candidate, that is not closed yet; there is a small hope', Morales said. The Pact of Unity has also demanded the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) to hold plural elections where all political actors can participate.

**Bolivia's Presidential Election: A Challenge for the Left**
The first presidential election poll in Bolivia has been released, showing two right-wing candidates in the lead. Doria Medina has 24% and Tuto Quiroga has 22%, while Andrónico Rodriguez, the president of the Senate, has 14%. The election is seen as a challenge for the left, as the candidates from the right have been campaigning for a while, unlike the left-wing candidates who were announced recently. The election outcome will depend on the support or neutrality of Evo Morales, a former president who is still popular among the people. Meanwhile, protests have been taking place in Bolivia and Argentina, with supporters of Evo Morales and Cristina Kirchner, respectively, demanding their right to participate in the election. In the Equador, President Daniel Noboa has announced the opening of new mining concessions, which has raised concerns about environmental degradation and the impact on indigenous communities.

**Morales seeks re-election defying constitution and criminal charges**
Former Bolivian president Evo Morales is seeking re-election despite being barred by the courts and facing criminal charges. The move has sparked violence and unrest, with at least four first responders killed and over 300 people injured. Morales' supporters, including coca farmers, are protecting him from the police and military, who are trying to execute a warrant for his arrest on charges of human trafficking involving a minor. Morales claims to have won a previous election 'marred by accusations of fraud', and has been a divisive figure in Bolivian politics. His return from exile has created a 'bitter' rivalry with his former allies, and has exacerbated the country's economic crisis. 'We will win,' Morales said, but economic analyst Gonzano Chávez Alvarez believes 'Morales wants to enter the elections at all costs, and he won't succeed.'

**Evo Morales Criticizes Government, Abandons Candidacy Pursuit**
Evo Morales, the former president of Bolivia, has released a video criticizing the current government's economic crisis and stating that he will no longer pursue his candidacy, which is prohibited by two constitutional sentences. Morales assures that he will support the popular majorities and will not continue to promote measures of pressure to register his candidacy. He says, 'This is just another moment in our long history. We will meet again, organize, and fight together. With our hearts, in our conquest of the past, but with our minds and eyes on the future.' Morales also blames the current government, led by Luis Arce, for the economic crisis, stating that Arce 'destroyed the national economy.' Morales also accused the government of deviating from the process of change initiated during his administration. He says, 'The President in his first and only term, went from 55% to 1%, not because of Evo, but because he strayed from the process, the popular mandate, and the people.' Morales' decision marks a change in his strategy, as he had previously insisted on maintaining protests and blockades to achieve his habilitation as a candidate for the 2025 general elections.

**Escalating Conflict in Gaza, Bolivian Presidential Election Takes Shape, and Far-Right on the Rise in Europe**
The conflict in Gaza is escalating, with Israel's new approach focusing on territorial occupation. In Bolivia, the presidential election is taking shape, with Evo Morales' candidacy rejected by the electoral authorities. Meanwhile, in Europe, the far-right is on the rise, but the center-right is still competitive. In Portugal, the center-right won, while in Poland, there will be a runoff between the liberal Rafal Trzaskowski and the conservative Karol Nawrocki. In Romania, the liberal Nicusor Dan won, putting a stop to the far-right's advance. The program also discussed Bolivia's national team, which has been a source of unity in the country's tumultuous politics. The team's success has contributed to calming the atmosphere in a country plagued by political unrest.

**Evo Morales Vows to Continue Fight for Presidential Candidacy Despite Disqualification**
Former Bolivian President Evo Morales stated that he will not abandon his fight to be a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections on August 17, despite being disqualified. Morales said, 'We cannot lose hope, the only battle is the one that is abandoned, and we are not going to abandon it.' He emphasized that his political movement, Evo es Pueblo, 'comes from humble people.' Morales had meetings with his supporters in Cochabamba, his main stronghold, to discuss his future and was told by his leaders to 'continue the fight.' Morales' supporters had been blocking roads since June 2 to demand his candidacy and other demands, resulting in the deaths of six people, including three police officers and a civilian. Morales warned that if a right-wing candidate wins the election, they will have to 'see if they can handle it.' He also stated that his movement will defend Bolivia's resources and sovereignty.

**Evo Morales Labels Andrónico Rodríguez an 'Improvised Candidate', Warns of Right-Wing Victory**
Evo Morales, the former president and cocalero leader, has described senator Andrónico Rodríguez as an 'improvised candidate' and warned that, with this scenario, the right could win in the upcoming August 17 elections. Morales stated, 'Before Andrónico Rodríguez's candidacy is confirmed, the entire campaign is already financed by the government. Everything is set up for him. I don't understand how some colleagues, knowing he is an improvised candidate and backed by the government, still join him.' Morales also questioned the 'popular block', which includes Rodríguez, and warned, 'At this rate, the right will win, although I don't think it will happen in the first round.' Morales is also running in the election, but in recent days, it has been reported that the evismo movement is seeking alliances with parties authorized to participate in the August 17 presidential elections.

**Bolivia Poll: Opposition Vote May Surpass Left-Wing Vote for First Time in 20 Years**
A recent poll in Bolivia shows that the opposition vote may surpass the left-wing vote for the first time in two decades. The poll, conducted by ContactMedia Comunicaciones for the newspaper El Deber, shows that Samuel Doria Medina and Jorge Quiroga are the favorites to win the election with 24.02% and 22.07% of the vote respectively. Andrónico Rodríguez, the senator from the ruling MAS party, comes in third with 14.69%. The MAS party, which has been the dominant force in Bolivian politics for the past 20 years, is in seventh place with only 1.69% of the vote. The poll also shows that 42% of respondents have not yet decided who to vote for. The election is scheduled for August 17, 2024, and 7.5 million Bolivians are expected to cast their ballots. According to Manuel Suárez, a political analyst, 'for the first time in 20 years, an option different and opposed to MAS can win the elections (...) undoubtedly there is a change, it remains to be seen who will be the elected president.'

**Bolivia 2025 Elections: Who’s Running and What You Need to Know**
Bolivia's presidential election on August 17 is expected to go to a second round due to fragmentation among candidates on both the left and right. According to a recent Ipsos Ciesmori poll, no single candidate has more than a fifth of the vote. Politics professor Diego Von Vacano said, 'There's a mirror image on the left and right of fragmentation into three or four main candidates. Then there will probably be a second round of one left versus one right-wing candidate.' The candidates include Samuel Doria Medina, Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, Andrónico Rodríguez, Eduardo del Castillo, Eva Copa, and Manfred Reyes Villa, among others. Notable absentees from the list include former President Evo Morales and current President Luis Arce, who are both barred from running due to term limits. Morales's supporters blocked roads in protest, resulting in the deaths of five people, including four police officers and one civilian.

**Manfred Reyes Villa Criticizes Unitel Poll: 'The Most Ridiculous Polls We Have Ever Seen'**
Manfred Reyes Villa, the mayor of Cochabamba and presidential candidate for APB-Súmate, dismissed the first opinion poll by Unitel, which places him in fourth place in national electoral preference. He referred to it as 'the most ridiculous polls we have ever seen'. The poll, conducted by Ipsos Ciesmori for Unitel, shows Samuel Doria Medina, candidate for Alianza Unidad, in first place with 19.1% of the vote. Reyes Villa stated that he has just begun his campaign and that each political group has its own polls, which he cannot comment on. However, he believes there is a 'big difference' between the Ipsos Ciesmori poll and his own. 'I would love to comment on my polls, but I'm not allowed to by law,' he said. 'But it will become clear as we progress in the campaign, we still have about 80 days left.'

**Second Round 2025: Until What Date Could the Results be Challenged?**
The National Electoral Council (CNE) has declared Daniel Noboa the winner of the presidential election's second round, held on April 13. Noboa leads Luisa González by 1.1 million votes, according to 99.57% of the counted acts. Despite international electoral observation missions validating the results, the Correísmo movement has refused to accept the outcome, accusing fraud and requesting the opening of voting booths and a recount of votes. According to the electoral calendar, the Movement for Citizen Revolution (RC5) can file several resources to challenge the results, starting on April 24. Between April 25-26, they can object to the numerical results, and the CNE must resolve these objections between April 27-29. On May 1-2, the organization can impugn the results before the CNE, and a resolution must be issued between May 3-5. Between May 7-9, a subjective resource can be filed before the Electoral Contention Tribunal (TCE), and these impugnations will be processed between May 10-17. Due to the possibility of these instances being applied, the delivery of credentials to the president and vice-president may occur between April 30 and May 22. Daniel Noboa will be sworn in for his first four-year term on May 24.

**Bolivia Sets General Elections for August 17**
The Bolivian Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) has set the general elections for August 17, with a possible second round on October 19. The elections are marked by significant political agitation, including the lack of unity among the left and the attempts of former President Evo Morales to return to power. The parties have until April 12 to submit their financial reports and balance sheets to be eligible to present their candidates, who cannot submit their candidacies later than May 19. The electoral campaign will take place from May 19 to August 13. The TSE has informed that 34 countries have been considered for voting abroad, although the situation of other countries with smaller Bolivian communities is still being evaluated. The estimated cost of the electoral period is $100 million. The TSE has announced that it will provide a detailed electoral calendar next week, according to the Bolivian newspaper 'La Razón'. These new elections follow several months of intense political tension, particularly within the Movement for Socialism (MAS), from which Morales has been excluded. Morales has announced his intention to run under his new party, Evo Pueblo, despite being ineligible. The MAS has announced that it will present its candidacy on May 3, with President Luis Arce expected to be the candidate, although other options such as Minister Eduardo del Castillo or Senator Andrónico Rodríguez have also been mentioned. From the opposition, despite initial plans for a united candidacy, former President Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga has distanced himself from this formula, citing concerns about the possibility of the electoral authorities rejecting the candidacy. Quiroga has stated, 'It would be unfair to decide who should run based on a poll, given the risk that the electoral authorities might reject the candidacy.' Meanwhile, his expected rival, Samuel Doria Medina, has confirmed that he will continue with the process. The alliance between Cochabamba Mayor Manfred Reyes Villa and Korean pastor Chi Hyun Chung appears to have fewer options, according to recent polls.

**Bolivia Announces General Elections for August 17, 2025**
The Electoral Tribunal of Bolivia has called for general elections to be held on August 17, 2025. According to the Tribunal's secretary, Francisco Vargas, the election will choose the president, vice-president, senators, deputies, and representatives to supra-state organizations. The electoral calendar sets May 18 as the last day for parties and political alliances to register with the Tribunal. Campaigns will be allowed from May 19 to August 13. Currently, 7.3 million citizens are eligible to vote, but a massive voter registration drive will take place from April 18 to May 7. The Tribunal's president, Óscar Hassenteufel, stated that the election results will be transmitted through a proprietary system, which has shown 'positive results' after five trials. Hassenteufel also mentioned that 34 countries have been registered for voting abroad, but more countries with small Bolivian populations are still being evaluated. The Movement for Socialism (MAS) party has announced that it will present its presidential candidate on May 3, while former president Evo Morales has created a new party, 'Evo Pueblo', with himself as the sole presidential candidate.

**Evelyn Matthei Leads in First Round Presidential Election Scenarios**
A recent survey by Panel Ciudadano UDD simulated seven scenarios for the first round of the 2025 presidential election. The survey, which had a 90% response rate and a 2.3% margin of error, found that Evelyn Matthei, the candidate from the Chile Vamos party, led in all scenarios, 'winning both among habitual and obligatory voters.' Carolina Tohá, the current presidential candidate from the official party, came in second when the right was divided and the left was united. Jeannette Jara, the Minister of Labor, took fourth place in that scenario, thanks to her role in the approval of the pension reform. The survey also found that if Johannes Kaiser were not to run, 50% of his votes would go to José Antonio Kast and 20% to Evelyn Matthei.

**Bolivian Politician Warns of MAS Victory in First Round Due to Dispersed Vote**
Bolivian politician Branko warns that the MAS party may win the election in the first round due to the dispersed vote. He believes that if no opposition candidate reaches 30% of the vote, the MAS will win in the first round. Marinkovic, a former leader of the civic committee of Santa Cruz, has withdrawn his candidacy and joined forces with Jorge Tuto Quiroga, a candidate from the Democratic Unity Block. Tuto has also formed an alliance with the Revolutionary Left Front (FRI). Marinkovic explained that he supports Tuto due to their shared right-wing ideology. Tuto's alliance has been described as 'very poorly made' by some ministers of Luis Arce, who have also compared him to Argentine President Javier Milei. Meanwhile, Evo Morales is reportedly doing well in the polls, with a significant percentage of votes.
