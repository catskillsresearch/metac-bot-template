**Nobel Laureates Warn of 20-Year Research Setback Under Trump Administration**
Three American Nobel laureates, Guido Imbens (Economics, 2021), Douglas Diamond (Economics, 2022), and Charles Rice (Medicine, 2020), along with Duncan Haldane (Physics, 2016), expressed their concerns that the Trump administration could cause a 20-year setback in research. They stated that the lack of government support for universities is a 'huge problem' and that the attack on the independence of institutions like Harvard is also affecting other national health institutes. Diamond said, 'The lack of support from the government is a huge problem.' Imbens expressed his 'disappointment' with the treatment of the higher education system, and Rice stated that the attack on the 'independence' of Harvard as an 'icon of research and study' also affects other institutions. They all agreed that the situation needs to be solved as soon as possible. They emphasized the importance of educating children at a young age about the value of science, as they believe that the distrust in science has been growing for 20 years and has its roots in the past.

**The Unfulfilled Happiness of Madame Curie**
Baldomero Vásquez reflects on the life of Madame Curie, who remained uncorrupted by fame. He notes that her happiness was tied to her work and recognition, including becoming the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911. Her daughter Irene, who also became a scientist, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935, a year after her mother's death. Vásquez quotes Karen Horney, saying, 'La vida hay que tomarla como viene' (Life must be taken as it comes). He laments that Madame Curie's life's work remains inaccessible due to the radioactive materials she handled, which will remain hazardous for at least 1,500 years.

**The Nobel Error: Rewarding a Placeholder**
The 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Saul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt, and Adam G. Riess for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe through observations of distant supernovae. However, this was a mistake, as the prize was awarded for supernova data, not the actual discovery of dark energy. Dark energy is an invisible, unknown force accounting for 68% of the universe's energy, but it has never been observed and is simply a placeholder term for a mathematical discrepancy. The author argues that this is not science, but rather branding, and that the field has prematurely decided the question is closed, ignoring alternative models that account for the same observational data without invoking dark energy. The accelerating expansion is an assumption based on the misapplication of static-frame models to dynamic structures, and dark energy is a signal that the model is incomplete. The author concludes that a Nobel Prize should never be awarded for naming a ghost.

**Jensen Huang: 'If I were a student today, I would learn AI'**
Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said, 'If I were a student today, the first thing I would do is learn AI.' Geoffrey Hinton, Nobel laureate in Physics 2024, stated, 'Artificial Intelligence is on track to replace computer science teachers due to its ability to teach.' Despite concerns and fears about the future of AI, understanding how it works is crucial to addressing these issues. Many experts advocate for studying AI, given its vast potential in various fields, including healthcare. In an interview with Cleo Abram, Jensen Huang emphasized the importance of learning AI, saying, 'If I were a student today, I would learn AI.' He also noted that new models and interfaces will become increasingly present in university careers in the coming decades. AI is driving changes in all sectors, providing companies with tools and algorithms to improve their work, from voice recognition and recommendations to medical diagnosis and supply chain management. As a result, many jobs are incorporating AI, making it essential to understand its functioning and complexity. According to the Future of Jobs Report 2025, AI-related positions will be highly valued in the job market, including specialists in Big Data, financial technology engineers, AI and machine learning specialists, software developers, and application developers.

**The Position of the Learner in the Process of Reforming Educational Curricula**
The question of the learner's position in the process of reforming educational curricula is a legitimate and important one. It is a question that has been raised by those who have invested in the effort to reform the curricula, whether in the theoretical or practical stages. This question is derived from a larger question, which is: when will the learner's voice be heard? For the school to develop and keep up with the opportunities of modernity, it is necessary for it to return the learner to their leading position in every step of the process. The school should abandon the philosophy of filling students' minds with a large amount of information that they will not benefit from in their practical lives. This approach contributes to the preparation of a person who lacks the will and is unable to take initiative, and who waits for ready-made knowledge without research or effort. The article continues to show the secret to this optional civilizational direction, stating: 'Vietnam focused on revising its entire curriculum every few years, in addition to the national language, foreign languages, and humanities, which are taught to everyone and in which they excel. It also focused on studying mathematics, physics, and sciences, and invested in them, providing incentives for students. One of its scholars abroad, 'Ngo Bao Chau', won the 'Fields' prize in mathematics, which is equivalent to the Nobel Prize, in 2010. As a result, Vietnam became one of the top countries in Asia in terms of academic achievement, and its scientific publications exceeded the average of many countries in Asia. This educational plan and its continuation led to an increase in the number of international students in Vietnamese universities, which reached 240 universities. It also set a future goal to increase the number of its universities in the top rankings to 200 universities, and to increase international publications by 10% with an increase in investment in scientific research to 2%.'

**Barry Barish: 'Dedicating one's life to science is one of the greatest privileges'**
Barry Barish, the 2017 Nobel Physics laureate, said, 'Dedicating one's life to science is one of the greatest privileges.' He emphasized the need for more investment and ethical regulation in science, particularly in the face of new challenges like artificial intelligence. Barish, who was born in Omaha, Nebraska, to Jewish immigrant parents, initially wanted to be a science fiction writer but was drawn to the scientific community in California. He studied physics at the University of California and earned his Ph.D. in 1963. Barish's work on the LIGO observatory led to the detection of gravitational waves predicted by Einstein in 2015. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics two years later, along with Kip Thorne and Rainer Weiss. Barish believes that the detection of gravitational waves was like 'putting on new glasses to look at the universe.' He said, 'We only see 4% of the universe with traditional telescopes. Gravitational waves allow us to observe what doesn't emit light.' Barish dedicated 20 years to developing the technology that made the detection possible, saying, 'It wasn't my life's goal, but it became my priority.' The LIGO project cost over $1 billion and took years to produce results, but Barish believes that making science every day is a privilege and a challenge. He emphasized the importance of international collaboration in science, saying, 'Science has no borders. We use the same equations, share bibliography. We maintain our identities, but work in community.' Barish also highlighted the need for clear ethical regulation in the face of technological advancements like artificial intelligence, saying, 'We share the same pleasures, the same culture. If we did it in society, it would work much better.' He concluded by saying, 'I don't know if gravitational waves will have practical applications, but basic science curiosity has led to advances like antibiotics and magnetic resonance imaging.'

**George E. Smith, Nobel laureate who envisioned digital imagery, dies at 95**
George E. Smith, a Nobel laureate and researcher at Bell Labs, passed away on May 28 at the age of 95. Smith, along with Willard S. Boyle, envisioned the concept of digital photography and the charge-coupled device (CCD), which was honored with a Nobel Prize in physics in 2009. Their work, based on Albert Einstein's photoelectric effect, allowed for the transformation of light into electronic signals. The CCD technology, initially developed for a proposed video phone, later led to the creation of digital cameras, and has since been used in various fields such as astronomy, undersea exploration, and image-guided surgeries. 'Masters of light,' said the Nobel statement, their work helped build 'the foundation to our modern information society.' Dr. Smith retired from Bell Labs in 1986 and spent 17 years traveling the world in a sailboat with his partner, Janet Murphy. He was awarded $250,000 as part of the Nobel Prize, but said his sailboat, Apogee, could use some sprucing up.

**Maurice Allais: The French Physicist Who Found a Way to Combat Global Crises and Won the Nobel Prize in Economics**
Maurice Allais, a French physicist, found a way to combat global crises and received the Nobel Prize in Economics. Allais' paradox, also known as the 'Allais paradox,' is a thought experiment that challenges the idea of rational decision-making in economics. Allais' work laid the foundation for the work of post-war French economists, but his tendency to work in isolation and publish primarily in French led to many of his original ideas being independently rediscovered and popularized by English-speaking economists. As Allais himself said, 'The golden rule is to be careful not to be too careful.' Allais' work continues to influence economic thought, particularly in the areas of globalization and monetary policy.

**Nobel Laureate Criticizes Climate Research, Claims Clouds are Key to Climate Stability**
Nobel laureate John F. Clauser, a quantum physicist, has criticized the current state of climate research, stating that the scientific exchange has been lost. Clauser, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2022, claims that there is no climate crisis and that rising CO2 concentrations would actually benefit the world. He argues that the 'dramatic temperature-stabilizing feedback through clouds' is not considered in current climate models, which would reflect the radiation effect of CO2 50 times stronger. Clauser explains that clouds are formed through the evaporation of seawater due to sunlight and cover a third to two-thirds of the Earth's surface, reflecting a significant portion of the incoming solar energy back into space before it can warm the surface. He also cites the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the US National Academy of Sciences, which have acknowledged that the effects of clouds on the climate are the 'greatest uncertainty' for their predictions. Clauser warns that the 'corruption of science' in the climate debate is a 'dangerous narrative' that threatens the world economy and the well-being of billions of people. He believes that the misguided climate science has become a 'massive pseudoscience' that has become a scapegoat for various unrelated problems, and that the real problem is the provision of an adequate standard of living for the growing world population, particularly due to the energy crisis caused by the false climate science.

**Geoffrey Hinton, the "Godfather of AI," said that hitting on good ideas is easier if you're a contrarian.**
Geoffrey Hinton, known as the 'Godfather of AI,' advises young AI researchers to be contrarian and challenge existing methods. 'You have to have a deep belief that everybody else could be doing things wrong, and you could figure out how to do them right,' Hinton said. He suggests searching for inefficiencies and pursuing them until you understand why you're wrong. Hinton, who was awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, has previously warned of the possible existential risks of AI and estimates that it could be between five and 20 years before AI becomes a real threat. 'It is still possible that the threat will not materialize,' he said.

**Nobel in Physics of 2022 and the Quranic Metaphor from Sleep to Afterlife**
The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger for their groundbreaking experiments in quantum entanglement. Their research challenges our understanding of reality and proves that the universe operates in ways stranger than science fiction. Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two particles become linked, and the state of one instantly affects the other, no matter how far apart they are. This defies classical notions of space and time, suggesting that the universe is interconnected. The Quranic metaphor of sleep reveals that human consciousness is not confined to the brain, but is entangled with a divine backup system. The Quran states that God takes the souls of the dead and the souls of the living while they sleep, and keeps hold of those whose death He has ordained. This suggests that consciousness survives the deaths of our brains, not in the three dimensions we know, but in additional dimensions. The Quranic metaphor aligns with the idea that reality is far stranger than fiction, and that our understanding of space and time is incomplete.

**AI to Revolutionize Fundamental Physics: CERN's Future Director Sees Huge Potential**
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in fundamental physics research could revolutionize the field, according to Mark Thomson, the future director of CERN. AI will be particularly useful in observing the Higgs boson. 'It's not about progressive improvements, it's about very, very, very big improvements,' says Thomson. AI is currently used to select and process large amounts of data, such as those collected at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where the behavior of the Higgs boson is studied. In 2024, three researchers were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing an AI capable of predicting protein structures, Alphafold. Thomson believes that AI can help identify anomalies in data, which could reveal the presence of unknown elements such as dark matter. By 2030, when AI models are coupled with the upgraded LHC, CERN will be able to make major new discoveries, including the simultaneous production of two Higgs bosons, an extremely rare event.

**The Nobel in Physics 2022 Also Goes to Al Ghazali**
The Nobel Prize in Physics 2022 was awarded to Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger for their groundbreaking experiments with entangled photons, which established the violation of Bell inequalities and advanced the field of quantum information science. Their work provided compelling evidence against the principle of local realism, a cornerstone of classical physics. In contrast, the Islamic theologian and philosopher Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (1058–1111) advocated for occasionalism, a doctrine asserting that God is the sole causal agent in the universe. Al-Ghazali's occasionalism posits that God directly causes every event, denying inherent causal powers in creation. This viewpoint reinforces the concept of divine omnipotence and the possibility of miracles. While al-Ghazali's ideas faced criticism, they significantly influenced Islamic thought and contributed to ongoing discussions about the relationship between faith and reason. Interestingly, contemporary scholars have revisited al-Ghazali's occasionalism in light of modern scientific paradigms, drawing parallels between it and the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.

**A Day for the Miraculous Year of Physics**
The year 1925 marked a significant turning point in the history of physics, as Max Planck's idea of quantized energy led to the development of quantum mechanics. This new theory, which challenged the classical understanding of the universe, was further developed by Albert Einstein, who applied the concept of quanta to light, introducing the concept of photons. Today, quantum mechanics is used in various applications, including cryptography and computer science. The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to researchers who experimentally verified a prediction of quantum mechanics, known as entanglement, which shows that particles can be connected and exhibit identical behavior at a distance. The connection between quantum mechanics and artificial intelligence is also being explored, with potential applications in fields such as computing and security. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the development of quantum mechanics, a public lecture series will be held at the University of Lugano, featuring renowned researchers in the field. The event aims to discuss not only the technical and mathematical aspects of quantum mechanics but also its social and political implications.

**Nobel Winner Donates Half of Prize Money to Water First - Rossland Telegraph**
Dr. Geoffrey Hinton, a recent co-recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics, has donated $350,000 to Water First Education & Training Inc., an organization that supports safe water in Indigenous communities. Dr. Hinton expressed his concern for the conditions in many Indigenous communities and his connection to safe water, saying, 'We lived in Peru for a couple of months where we adopted a child. The water was not safe to drink, and seeing the extra work and health care that goes into protecting a child from poisonous water cemented the belief that we must have clean water.' Water First works with Indigenous communities to deliver training and education programs to help build local capacity and support highly-skilled people in the fields of water operation and environmental resource management. Dr. Hinton praised the Water First model, saying, 'When you provide education, you’ve now got somebody who can keep the water safe for forty years.' The organization provides programming to elementary and high school students as an introduction to water science and stewardship, and also offers internships to provide participants with training and support to obtain entry-level certification as water operators and in fish and water resource management.

**Nobel Prize in Physics Awarded to Pioneers of Quantum Information**
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics to French physicist Alain Aspect, American physicist John F. Clauser, and Austrian physicist Anton Zeilinger for their pioneering work on quantum information. According to the Nobel Committee, these experts in physics have conducted innovative experiments using entangled quantum states, where two particles behave as a single unit even when separated. 'The results have cleared the way for new technologies based on quantum information,' explains the jury. The effects of quantum mechanics are beginning to find applications. Now, there is a vast field of research that includes quantum computers, quantum networks, and secure quantum communication. A key factor in this development is how quantum mechanics allows two or more particles to exist in what is called an entangled state. What happens to one particle in an entangled pair determines what happens to the other particle, even if they are very far apart. John Clauser developed the ideas of John Bell, leading to a practical experiment. When he took the measurements, they supported quantum mechanics by clearly violating Bell's inequality. This means that quantum mechanics cannot be replaced by a theory that uses hidden variables. Alain Aspect, from the University of Paris-Saclay, developed the configuration, using it in a way that closed an important gap. He could change the measurement configuration after a entangled pair had left its source, so the configuration that existed when it was emitted could not affect the result. Using refined tools and a long series of experiments, Anton Zeilinger, from the University of Vienna, began to use entangled quantum states. Among other things, his research group has demonstrated a phenomenon called quantum teleportation, which makes it possible to move a quantum state from one particle to another at a distance. 'It has become increasingly clear that a new type of quantum technology is emerging. We can see that the work of the laureates with entangled states is of great importance, even beyond the fundamental questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics,' says Anders Irbäck, chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics.
