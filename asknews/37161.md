**Congress Approves Bills Granting Automatic Appointments to Over 150,000 Teachers**
Congress members have approved two bills that would grant automatic appointments to over 150,000 teachers in public schools, despite opposition from the Executive Branch and various education organizations. The bills, which were observed by the Executive Branch due to concerns about equal opportunities and meritocracy, would allow teachers who have worked for three or more years as contractors to be appointed without a competitive process. The President of the National Council of Education, Luis Lescano, has stated that if the bills are approved, the Executive Branch will take them to the Constitutional Court, as they violate the Constitution. The former Minister of Education, Idel Vexler, has expressed concern that the bills would undermine the meritocracy that has been established in the education sector. 'This proposal generates inequality and injustice. What do you say to the 73% of teachers who were appointed through evaluations? What do we do with young teachers who will no longer be able to find jobs because all the positions will be taken?', Vexler said. The president of the Society of United Contracted Teachers of Lima, María Elena Aguilar, has stated that the appointment is exceptional and just, as there were irregularities in the 2022-2023 competition. 'The meritocracy is a holistic view where we must consider the exam, professional training, degrees, and work experience', said the secretary general of the Sutep, Lucio Castro. 'This project brings down the meritocracy because the teacher from 2012 considers that the evaluation is a necessity', he added.

**Peru Wakes Up to a Historic Day: 18 Ministers Resign, Leaving President Boluarte Isolated**
Peru woke up on May 14, 2025, to a historic day, with at least 18 ministers of state and the President of the Council of Ministers resigning, leaving President Dina Boluarte's government in a state of extreme political and institutional fragility. The wave of resignations has generated uncertainty both nationally and internationally, marking one of the most critical moments of the current government. According to Supreme Resolution 091-2025-PCM, the Executive Branch officially accepted the resignation of 18 ministers and the President of the Council of Ministers, Gustavo Adrianzén. Although it has not been confirmed that all members of the cabinet have resigned, the magnitude of the exits makes evident a large-scale ministerial crisis. The list of officials whose resignations were accepted includes key portfolios such as Economy, Defense, Interior, Education, Health, and Foreign Relations. These changes, unprecedented in recent Peruvian history, raise serious doubts about the governability and stability of the country. According to the official record, the following ministers left their positions: ... The massive exits have created a political vacuum that puts the Executive Branch in a compromised position before the powers of the State and the citizenry. So far, the government has not offered an official explanation for the joint reason for the resignations. However, political analysts point to multiple factors that may have caused this ministerial collapse, including: The resignation of the President of the Council of Ministers would be the final reflection of an internal political fracture that had been brewing for months. The resignation of almost the entire cabinet leaves President Boluarte isolated politically and in a very weak position. The head of state will have to form a new Council of Ministers in the midst of a social and political crisis, which complicates her margin of maneuver. If she fails to form a new cabinet that generates confidence both in Congress and in the citizenry, the country could face a scenario of ungovernability, even with possibilities of a presidential vacancy or an early election call. The Peruvian Constitution establishes that, in the event of the resignation of the President of the Council of Ministers, the entire cabinet must be renewed. President Boluarte has the obligation to appoint a new prime minister and, in coordination with him, propose the new holders of each ministry. Once the new cabinet is formed, it must go to Congress to request a vote of confidence. However, the current context of social discontent, street protests, and frictions with the Legislature make this process highly uncertain. Reactions have not been slow in coming. In the main cities of the country, citizens expressed their surprise and frustration at what they consider a further example of the institutional deterioration of the State. Some political sectors and civil organizations have requested the resignation of Dina Boluarte and the call for new elections as a way out of the crisis. Additionally, this wave of resignations coincides with the realization of the national strike called for this same Wednesday, May 14, which aggravates the climate of instability.

**CAPITOL ROUNDUP: Gov. Shapiro signs executive order to fill critical public service vacancies**
Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signed Executive Order 2025-01 to fill critical public service vacancies by accepting federal government experience as equivalent to Commonwealth work experience for civil service roles. This move aims to recruit experienced former federal employees into the Commonwealth workforce. Shapiro said, 'Right now, Pennsylvania still has 540 critical jobs to fill -- and we have an opportunity to recruit federal workers and veterans who have significant experience and expertise in all of these fields.' Meanwhile, Rep. Dan Meuser co-sponsored the Student Empowerment Act to expand school choice by broadening the scope of 529 Education Savings Plans, allowing families to customize their children's education. Rep. Jamie Walsh is working to save Penn State's branch campuses in NEPA by examining the university's financial figures and enrollment numbers. The Republican Party of Pennsylvania (PAGOP) announced Eric Anderson as their new executive director, bringing nearly a decade of political and operational experience to the role.

**July uprising party: Activists mull over increasing top posts**
The July uprising activists are considering increasing the number of top posts in their new political party to ensure representation of all stakeholders. The party, likely to be launched on February 26, will have 10 or 12 major positions, including convener, member secretary, and spokesperson. Some factions proposed creating a super-ten or super-twelve style top structure, but the matter has not been finalized. There is consensus on Information Adviser Nahid Islam taking on the convener role, but differences of opinion remain over who will assume the member secretary post. Ali Ahsan Zonaed, a former Shibir leader, criticized the leadership formation process as 'neither democratic nor inclusive' and emphasized the need for a qualified person to take up their desired position. 'We are discussing the criteria for determining this qualification,' he wrote on Facebook. The Nagorik Committee leaders expressed hope that the issues will be resolved before the party's announcement and the launch on time.

**AKP's Erdoğan Suggests Change, New Leadership to be Elected**
Following President Erdoğan's signal for change, all eyes are on the upcoming big congress on February 23, where a new party leadership will be elected. Deputy President Cevdet Yılmaz and General Vice Chairman Efkan Âlâ have been tasked with preparing the list of new party executives, including the Central Decision and Executive Board (MKYK), which will be composed of 75 people. According to sources, the list will be based on demographic criteria, regional balance, and the representation of women and young people. Some sources also suggest that some deputy ministers and parliamentary commission chairs may join the MKYK. AKP sources indicate that while some 'memory' figures will be retained, there may be an increase in the number of young and women in the new MKYK. Additionally, some former big city mayors may also join the MKYK. In the AKP's extraordinary congress in October 2023, 49 members of the 75-member MKYK were changed. It is now expected that at least 60% of the current MKYK members will be replaced. President Erdoğan has reportedly told some general vice chairmen, 'We will work with you in other fields,' implying that they will not be part of the new leadership. This may lead to significant changes in the 18-member High Council of Public Order (MYK), with some members possibly having their roles changed. Meanwhile, sources suggest that the cabinet reshuffle may be delayed until after the congress, as President Erdoğan has not yet discussed the issue with his advisors. In a previous meeting, he reportedly said, 'I am not considering bringing a name from the parliament to the cabinet.' AKP sources have described this as 'a scenario that is almost impossible'.

**USAID Employees Not in Critical Positions to be Placed on Administrative Leave**
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) announced that employees who do not hold 'critical positions', are not in 'core leadership' roles, and are not responsible for specific programs will be placed on administrative leave starting February 8. According to the agency's website, employees who are not responsible for critical functions, core leadership, or specific programs will be separated from work worldwide as of this date. The notification of employees who will continue to work will be made on the night of February 7. Additionally, preparations are being made for the return of USAID personnel working outside the US. According to a report published by the US Congressional Research Service in January 2025, over 10,000 USAID employees, or two-thirds of its workforce, are working in more than 60 countries and regional missions abroad. This move comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order on January 21 to review foreign aid programs and suspend payments to agencies and organizations responsible for these programs. The 90-day review period was announced. On January 27, the US Department of State announced that foreign aid programs funded by the department and USAID would be suspended. Troubles between the Government Efficiency Department (DOGE) led by Elon Musk and USAID management were also on the agenda. Musk had previously announced that USAID employees had been 'placed on administrative leave' and that USAID's social media accounts had been closed. Trump and Musk later made statements suggesting that the agency should be closed.

**Agency Spotlight Update January 2025**
The Democratic Party's failure to confirm nominees to independent agencies has left dozens of crucial positions vacant. At least 20 nominations were returned to former President Biden unconfirmed. The lack of confirmation has resulted in the absence of public advocates in offices dealing with labor, finance, and other critical areas. The article highlights the need for Democrats to learn from Republican obstructionism and to vociferously defend the law and regulators. The Trump administration has nominated four officials to independent agency boards, and there are 35 vacant seats across independent agency boards and 40 expired seats that Trump can fill. The article identifies Democratic majorities that are immediately vulnerable to a Republican majority, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, and National Labor Relations Board. Additionally, the article notes that some boards currently have gridlocked political distributions but will soon be vulnerable to a Republican majority. However, some boards have safe Democratic majorities through at least August 2025.
