**Scientists Prepare for New Bird Flu Pandemic**
Since November 2003, more than 700 human infections with the H5N1 virus have been reported to the World Health Organization, mainly in 15 countries. Indonesia, Vietnam, and Egypt have reported the largest number of human cases. Although bird flu is not a new phenomenon, scientists are concerned for three main reasons: first, the significant number of mammal species infected (at least 70 according to the UN), from farms and agricultural workers, to wild areas and domestic animals. Second, the speed at which the virus has spread in cattle herds, which are in closer contact with humans. As Dr. [no specific doctor mentioned], a leading expert in the field, 'warns that the situation is becoming increasingly alarming.'

**Scientists Warn of New Pandemic as Bird Flu Epidemic Spreads**
Scientists have warned of a new pandemic as the bird flu epidemic continues to spread across the globe. The highly contagious H5N1 strain of bird flu has already reached all continents except Australia, infecting penguins in Antarctica and camels in the Middle East. In the US, the infection has been detected in all 50 states, affecting approximately 1,000 dairy cattle and at least 70 people, with one fatality. According to Dr. Kate Rivers, a professor of epidemiology at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, 'Bird flu is not a temporary problem. We used to think it would disappear on its own, but now we understand it's a serious issue that needs to be controlled.' Dr. Rivers and other epidemiologists are concerned that the US is not adequately prepared to handle the situation, and that the current outbreak could become a pandemic if the virus is allowed to continue evolving and adapting to infect other mammals. 'If we give the virus enough opportunities to continuously evolve and adapt to infecting other mammals, the current outbreak among animals in the US could become a trigger for a new pandemic,' said Dr. Rivers. 'We know from history that H5N1 is a very dangerous virus for humans.'

**Bird flu outbreaks in mammals double, raising human risk: report**
The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) has reported a significant increase in bird flu outbreaks among mammals, with 1,022 cases across 55 countries in 2024, compared to 459 in 2023. This rise in mammal outbreaks increases the risk of the virus adapting to transmit between humans. According to WOAH's director general Emmanuelle Soubeyran, 'It is concerning because it is a change in the pattern of the epidemiology of the virus.' The report highlights the importance of vaccination, citing France's success in reducing outbreaks among birds and subsequently decreasing the risk to mammals and humans. Soubeyran emphasized that vaccines are not a 'magic wand' and that biosecurity, surveillance, increased transparency, and global collaboration are also crucial tools in fighting off the threat of bird flu. The report also warns about the rising danger of animal diseases crossing over into humans due to climate change and the increasing resistance of some diseases to antibiotics. However, there is positive news, with a five percent decrease in antibiotic use in animals between 2020 and 2022, with Europe seeing the biggest decline of 23 percent.

**Brazil Confirms First Case of Bird Flu in Commercial Farms**
The Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture and Pecuária (Mapa) has confirmed the first case of bird flu in commercial farms in Brazil. The virus, known as the influenza aviária de alta patogenicidade (IAAP), was previously detected in wild birds in May 2023. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been 939 reported human cases of bird flu in 24 countries between 2003 and 2024, with 464 fatalities (49%). In the US, there have been 70 confirmed human cases since March 2023, with one death. Experts warn that the virus could mutate and become more transmissible among humans, but the risk is still low for the general population. The Brazilian government has assured that the disease is not transmitted through the consumption of chicken or eggs, and that there are no restrictions on their consumption. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that humans can be infected through close contact with infected birds, and that the symptoms can include conjunctivitis, respiratory symptoms, pneumonia, fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, or shortness of breath. A vaccine against bird flu is being developed, but it is not yet available in Brazil. The country has partnered with the Butantan Institute to produce a vaccine, which is expected to be available in the future. 'When the transmission between humans becomes sustained, we will have a big problem, like the H1N1 outbreak, which became known as swine flu. When this happens, we have the risk of a pandemic because it is a new virus for the population, we do not have an immunological arsenal to combat it. That's why there are these strategies to block the virus quickly if it happens,' says Flávia, director of the Brazilian Society of Immunizations.

**Creators of world’s 1st Covid jab call for CAT FLU PANDEMIC VACCINES to be made immediately as GOF-Bird Flu jumps to cats then to humans**
Russian virologist Vladimir Gintsburg has warned of a potential 'Cat Flu' pandemic as the H5N1 virus spreads among felines. According to Gintsburg, 'Domestic cats are susceptible to [bird flu] and provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover to humans.' He emphasized the urgent need for a vaccine prototype that could be mass-produced within weeks if human-to-human transmission emerges. Gintsburg warned that if H5N1 mutates to spread through the air, the consequences could be catastrophic, with a fatality rate of 50-70%. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded 974 human H5N1 cases across 24 countries since 2003, with 470 deaths—most linked to direct poultry exposure. While sustained human transmission has not yet occurred, the CDC and other agencies continue surveillance due to the virus's high lethality.

**Bird flu cases spreading faster and with greater impacts - report**
A new report by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) shows that bird flu cases are spreading faster and having greater impacts on ecosystems, trade, and food security. The number of mammal cases doubled in 2024, with 1,022 outbreaks reported, compared to 459 in the previous year. The virus has affected new species of wild birds, domestic poultry, and an increasing number of mammal species, including livestock and pets. WOAH warns that avian influenza has evolved beyond an animal health crisis into a global emergency, threatening agriculture, food security, trade, and ecosystems. The risk of human infection remains low, but the likelihood of the virus adapting to enable mammal-to-mammal and potentially human transmission increases as more mammalian species become infected. The report highlights the devastating impact on poultry, with over 82.1 million birds lost, and the unprecedented mass die-offs in wild bird populations, disrupting ecosystems and threatening biodiversity. Vaccination may offer a solution or serve as a valuable complement to traditional measures, such as strict biosecurity and active surveillance. France's nationwide vaccination campaign against bird flu in ducks helped reduce the number of outbreaks from 700 to 10. Some countries have also started vaccinating humans at risk of contracting bird flu, such as poultry farm workers.

**H5N1 Outbreak In The US: Experts Warn Of A Potential Pandemic; Here's How It Spreads**
The H5N1 bird flu virus has affected over 1,000 dairy herds in the US since March 2024, resulting in more than 70 human infections and at least one confirmed death. The Global Virus Network (GVN) has warned that the virus's circulation in mammals can increase the risk of mutations that could enable human-to-human transmission. According to Sten H Vermund, MD, PhD, chief medical officer of the GVN, 'Understanding the current landscape of H5N1 infections is critical for effective prevention and response.' The virus can cause severe disease in humans with a high mortality rate, and symptoms include high fever, malaise, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) asserts that the risk to the overall population is still low, but urges individuals to take necessary precautions, particularly those in close proximity to infected animals.

**Mexico Reports First Human Case of H5N1 Avian Flu**
A 3-year-old girl in Coahuila, Mexico, has died from H5N1 avian flu, the country's first human case. According to Dr. Verónica García Flores, the girl likely contracted the virus from a direct contact with an infected bird. The doctor emphasized the importance of reporting any suspicious deaths or illnesses in domestic birds and taking precautions such as not approaching sick or dead birds, using protection when handling animals, and frequent handwashing. She also reminded communities to be vigilant, especially in rural areas, and to follow basic measures learned during the pandemic, including vaccination against influenza during the season. Dr. García Flores stated, 'We should not forget the basic measures we learned during the pandemic: hand washing, etiquetted coughing, social distancing, and vaccination against influenza during the season.'

**Will We See a Bird Flu Vaccine Next Year?**
This year's flu season has been the worst in over a decade, with 40 million flu illnesses, 520,000 hospitalizations, and 22,000 deaths reported so far. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has categorized the season as 'high severity'. The current flu vaccine provides about the same protection as in recent seasons, but its effectiveness is waning. Flu vaccination rates are down, partly due to anti-vaccination sentiment. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a new flu vaccine formula for next season, but the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ultimately determines the formula for the US flu vaccine version. The FDA has approved the 2025-2026 influenza vaccine formula without the input of its expert advisory committee, VBRPAC. Meanwhile, the first human case of H5N1 (bird flu) in the United States was detected in 2022, and there have been 70 confirmed human cases and one human death from bird flu so far. Moderna received a $590 million contract to develop a bird flu vaccine, but its status is now under review by the new administration, sparking worries about the US's preparedness for a potential bird flu pandemic.

**CDC Posts First Bird Flu Update Since Trump Took Office**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released its first bird flu update since President Donald Trump took office, providing a snapshot of recent human cases of H5N1. The report includes two hospitalized cases, bringing the national total to 70 cases and one death. The update highlights recent confirmed cases in Nevada, Ohio, and Wyoming, with the Nevada case being the most mild. The CDC notes that human-to-human spread has not been identified in any of the 70 cases, and the risk to the general public is still considered low. However, scientists are concerned that a mutation causing spread between humans could lead to a new pandemic. The USDA reports over 19 million birds are on the premises of farms and other properties that have been confirmed to have bird flu in the past 30 days.

**The Latest on Bird Flu in Humans, Chickens, and More**
The US has reported 68 confirmed and eight probable cases of bird flu in humans since 2024, with the latest cases in Nevada, Ohio, and Wyoming. A study found that three dairy veterinarians had antibodies to the H5N1 avian influenza virus, indicating that existing tracking systems are not effective. In poultry, over 9 million domesticated birds have been infected or culled in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus, with Ohio being particularly hard-hit. The loss of birds is causing egg prices to rise, with urban egg prices reaching an average of $4.95 a dozen in January. The confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Brooke Rollins as cabinet secretaries has raised concerns about the response to bird flu, with Kennedy promoting raw milk consumption and Rollins' response to the crisis unclear. The recent government-wide firing of workers, including those in the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service and the HHS Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, has also raised alarm among experts.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported at least 68 confirmed human cases of bird flu in 11 states, with one death associated with the H5N1 infection. While the current public health risk is considered low, the spread of bird flu is causing egg shortages and price increases at supermarkets and restaurants. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, nearly 23 million birds were affected by the virus in January, and over 138 million birds have been infected since February 2022. A dairy worker in Nevada has been infected with a new strain of the bird flu, marking the first confirmed human case in the state.

**Poultry markets ordered closed**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 67 cases of bird flu in humans, with most cases being mild and detected among farmworkers. Despite the low risk to public health, the CDC has reported that over 156 million birds nationwide have been affected by the outbreak, leading to the slaughter of millions of birds and driving up egg prices. The highly contagious H5N1 strain of bird flu has been spreading among wild birds, poultry, cows, and other animals. According to CoBank, a Denver-based provider of loans and other financial services to the agriculture sector, US egg prices are likely to remain high past Easter and well into 2025 due to the avian flu outbreak. Gov. Kathy Hochul said, 'There is no immediate threat to public health and the temporary closure of bird markets in the city and its Westchester County and Long Island suburbs comes out of an abundance of caution.'

**How Concerned Do We Need To Be About Bird Flu In The US?**
There have been 67 confirmed human cases of H5N1 bird flu in the US since 2024, with 64 cases linked to animal exposure. Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of the Robert J. Havey Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University, believes it's 'very likely' that the US will see the spread of avian influenza between humans, with 'just a single amino acid change' needed for the virus to infect human cells. However, the CDC says the risk of bird flu infection to the general public remains low, and Murphy advises that people don't need to worry unless they have a chicken farm or raise cattle. The existing stockpile of vaccines is geared towards dairy farmers and poultry workers, but moves have been made to develop mRNA vaccines against potentially pandemic-causing flu viruses, including H5N1. Murphy suggests that more accessible testing for bird flu would be helpful in the scenario where the virus spreads more widely in humans. 'We have over the counter flu tests. Why can't we have an over the counter bird flu test?' he posed.
