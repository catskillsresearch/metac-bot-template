**Behind the Scenes of 'Mountainhead': Carell and Schwartzman Reveal Secrets**
The film 'Mountainhead' follows four wealthy friends on a unique cabin trip during an international crisis, where Hugo Van Yalk (Jason Schwartzman) invites his friends 'the Brewsters' to a poker weekend in his luxurious cabin in Utah. The film features Steve Carell, Ramy Youssef, and Cory Michael Smith in supporting roles. In an interview with TV 2, Carell and Schwartzman revealed some behind-the-scenes secrets from the filming process. Carell mentioned that the film was shot in an unusual way, with two cameras filming everything at all times, and long scenes were filmed like a one-man show. This led to some spontaneous outbursts and a lot of suppressed laughter. Schwartzman added that one of the actors, Cory Michael Smith, had to take measures to stifle his laughter, even eating lemons to avoid bursting out laughing. The film's characters can be interpreted as a satire of wealthy individuals like Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk, but Carell emphasized that he didn't intend to parody these characters. Instead, he aimed to play them as genuinely as possible, without commenting on their stereotypes. The film's director, Jesse Armstrong, also spoke to TV 2 about his experience working with Carell and Schwartzman, and how he drew inspiration from his research on Sam Bankman-Fried, a cryptocurrency founder who was arrested and convicted of fraud. Armstrong's film 'Mountainhead' is his directorial debut, and he has expressed his admiration for Norway, where he has visited on several occasions.

**'Succession' Creator Brings Us a Thinly-Veiled Elon Musk Parody in 'Mountainhead'**
Jesse Armstrong, the creator of Succession, has brought us a satirical comedy, Mountainhead, which is a thinly-veiled parody of Elon Musk and other tech billionaires. The film, premiering on HBO Max, follows the story of four moguls, played by Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Cory Michael Smith, and Ramy Youssef, who are battling personal demons and the consequences of their unmoderated social media platform, Traam. Armstrong developed the concept after following the saga of Sam Bankman-Fried and was inspired by the philosophies of Ayn Rand and the '70s film Network. The film is a commentary on the current state of the world, where tech billionaires exert a noxious influence on society. Armstrong said, 'You know, being unaware is a key reason why people are funny, and arrogance is a good way of being unaware,' and the film's protagonists are caricatures of this type of entrepreneur. The film raises questions about the tech-bro persona and our dependence on their products, but Armstrong doesn't pretend to have a response to these dilemmas.

**Sam Bankman-Fried's Early Release, Schiff Vs Vance, Bitcoin's Fall, And Trump's Meme Coin Dinner: This Week In Crypto - Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) Common units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:BTC)**
The past week in cryptocurrency was marked by several significant events. Sam Bankman-Fried, the notorious fraudster, is set to be released from prison four years ahead of schedule due to 'good conduct time' credits. Economist Peter Schiff publicly disagreed with Vice President JD Vance's support for Bitcoin, sparking a debate over its value and impact. Bitcoin's value dropped below $105,000 after President Donald Trump's warning about the US-China trade agreement. Additionally, Google warned that RSA encryption, a key security feature in securing Bitcoin, may be vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Meanwhile, a black-tie gala hosted by Donald Trump for top TRUMP MAGA/USD meme coin holders turned into a high-net-worth crypto networking event.

**Jesse Armstrong's 'Mountainhead' Explores the World of Tech Billionaires**
Jesse Armstrong, the creator of the hit series 'Succession', has released his first film, 'Mountainhead', on HBO Max. The film, starring Steve Carrel, Jason Schwartzman, and Ramy Youssef, satirizes the world of tech billionaires. Armstrong drew inspiration from his research on Sam Bankman-Fried, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and other tech moguls. 'I wrote a book review on Sam Bankman-Fried, then I read more about technology,' he said. 'I started listening to podcasts from important people like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Sam Altman, but also from intermediate and lower levels - it's an ecosystem.' Armstrong aimed to capture the voices and vocabulary of these individuals, saying, 'I love learning the vocabulary. Once I hear them speak, it opens doors.' The film follows a weekend poker game between four tech billionaires, set against the backdrop of a global crisis caused by one of their companies' AI-related issues. Armstrong's obsession with biographies of entrepreneurs and podcasts like All-in and Lex Fridman's show is evident in the film. He explained, 'People ask, 'Why make a fiction about the rich?' It's a legitimate question... I think it's because I'm interested in power, not just wealth.' Armstrong's film, like 'Succession', explores 'why the world is the way it is and who holds the power'.

**The Cringe, Chaotic, and Current World of HBO's 'Mountainhead'**
The HBO film 'Mountainhead' is a satirical exploration of the tech and entrepreneurial world, written and directed by Jesse Armstrong. The film follows a group of billionaires, including Steve Carell, Ramy Youssef, Cory Michael Smith, and Jason Schwartzman, as they navigate the complexities of AI, cryptocurrency, and the pursuit of wealth and power. The film is a commentary on the excesses and absurdities of the tech world, and the ways in which it can lead to chaos and destruction. Armstrong's vision for the film was influenced by his research on the rise and fall of Sam Bankman-Fried and the world of effective altruism. The film's themes of utilitarianism, effective altruism, and the dangers of unchecked technological advancement are timely and thought-provoking. 'Mountainhead' is a farce that devolves into rowdy, inventive violence, but it is also a nuanced exploration of the human condition and the consequences of our actions.

**Fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried Set To Leave Prison Four Years Early As 'Good Conduct' Credits Trim His 25-Year Sentence**
Sam Bankman-Fried, the former cryptocurrency mogul, is expected to be released from prison on December 14, 2044, four years earlier than his original 25-year sentence. This is due to 'good conduct time' credits that can cut up to 54 days from each year of a sentence. Bankman-Fried was convicted of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy for 'commingling money with Alameda Research' and channeling billions in customer deposits into risky bets, political donations, and luxury real estate. His defense team has appealed both his conviction and sentence, arguing that the trial moved too quickly and misinterpreted cryptocurrency practices. However, regulators and lawmakers continue to sift through FTX's wreckage, and a separate civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission seeks billions in disgorgement.

His sentence has been reduced due to 'Good Conduct Time' and participation in prison programs, as well as time spent behind bars prior to sentencing. Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda and a key witness in the government's case, is also projected to be released in May 2026 after similar reductions, having been sentenced to two years.

Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and CEO of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, is expected to be released from prison on December 14, 2044, more than four years earlier than his original 25-year sentence.

His then-girlfriend Caroline Ellison was sentenced to two years in prison for her role in the fraud and is expected to be released in May 2026.

**Sam Bankman-Fried has had more than 4 years shaved off his prison sentence**
Sam Bankman-Fried, the crypto fraudster, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in the $11 billion FTX scheme. According to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), he will be released on December 14, 2044, which is more than 4 years early. The BOP estimates that Bankman-Fried will earn 'Good Conduct Time' and participate in programs that may reduce his sentence to less than 21 years. A spokesman for the BOP explained, 'Lastly, individuals may also receive credit for time incarcerated before their date of sentencing.' Bankman-Fried's onetime girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, was sentenced to 2 years in prison and had 6 months shaved from her sentence through the same process.

**The Rise and Fall of Sam Bankman-Fried: From Cryptocurrency King to Financial Ruin**
Sam Bankman-Fried, once the king of cryptocurrencies, rapidly rose to fame and was compared to Warren Buffet. He received numerous projects and became the second youngest person to amass wealth quickly, after Mark Zuckerberg. However, his downfall was even more dramatic. In November 2022, allegations of fraudulent activities by Bankman-Fried's company, FTX, began to surface. A request by Bankman-Fried to his former CTO to change the code to allow the company to buy assets from bankrupt companies was exposed. It was claimed that client funds were used to finance Alameda and make risky investments without their knowledge. The panic spread, and investors and business partners rushed to withdraw their money, causing the company to collapse and file for bankruptcy. Bankman-Fried admitted to 'making a mistake' but denied accepting external funds and blamed his former colleagues. He was accused of fraud and conspiracy and was extradited to the US, where he was released on a $250 million bail. However, he was rearrested in August 2023 for allegedly attempting to tamper with witnesses. In March 2024, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison and fined $11 billion to compensate for the losses suffered by clients.

**The Rise of Supermillionaires: A New Era of Unprecedented Inequality?**
The world's 24 supermillionaires have built their fortunes through various industries, with six of the top 10 richest individuals attributing their wealth to the tech industry. However, this wealth is volatile and subject to fluctuations in stock values and investor confidence. The speed at which these fortunes are amassed has also changed, with entrepreneurs like Sam Bankman-Fried achieving billions in less than 10 years. The rise of supermillionaires has led to an explosion in the luxury real estate market, with each of the 24 individuals on the list owning at least $100 million in properties. This has sparked debates about economic inequality and the disproportionate power these individuals hold in society. Economist Joseph Stiglitz has warned that antitrust legislation has failed to address the concentration of power in the tech sector, with companies like Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet dominating the digital landscape with little competition. Critics also point out that supermillionaires have perfected strategies to avoid taxes, such as Elon Musk's $50 billion compensation package from Tesla, which has generated legal battles. With the current rate of wealth accumulation, some analysts consider it plausible that the first trillionaire will emerge in the next few decades. Maya Imberg of Altrata said, 'Before, we would have said no, but today everything is possible.' The rise of supermillionaires raises questions about the future of capitalism, the regulation of extreme wealth, and economic equity.

**Sam Bankman-Fried Slams Biden's Crypto Policies As 'Incredibly Destructive' While Aligning With Trump  --  Looking For A Pardon?**
Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of FTX, has expressed his disapproval of the Biden administration's crypto policies, calling them 'incredibly destructive.' He also aligned himself with Donald Trump, suggesting that they share common adversaries, such as Judge Lewis Kaplan. Bankman-Fried, who was a major donor to Biden's 2020 campaign, stated that his support was driven by a desire to prevent the Democratic Party from becoming the party of Bernie Sanders. He now views himself as center-right, rather than center-left. Bankman-Fried's remarks come as his parents have been discussing possible clemency with Trump's network, following Trump's pardon of Ross Ulbricht, the creator of Silk Road. Bankman-Fried was convicted of misappropriating $8 billion worth of customer funds from FTX.

**Sam Bankman-Fried's Assets Confiscated for $1 Billion**
A New York court has ordered the permanent confiscation of Sam Bankman-Fried's (SBF) assets, totaling around $1 billion. This historic decision comes as FTX begins to repay its first creditors. The court's final order, dated February 18, 2025, details the impressive list of seized assets, including a block of 55.2 million Robinhood shares worth $605.7 million. The shares were initially seized by the US Department of Justice in January 2023. Bankman-Fried's personal fortune also included two luxury jets: a Bombardier Global 5000 and an Embraer Legacy. Additionally, authorities have seized assets belonging to Alameda Research, the trading company co-founded by Bankman-Fried, which is at the center of the FTX scandal. The authorities have also seized a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio, including significant amounts of Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano, Dogecoin, and millions of dollars in stablecoins Tether, primarily held on the Binance.US platform. The confiscation order also reveals a complex network of political contributions orchestrated by Bankman-Fried, including donations to candidates and organizations across the American political spectrum. FTX has begun its first phase of repayment to creditors, distributing $800 million to over 162,000 accounts via Kraken and BitGo platforms. The total value of seized assets exceeds initial estimates, with investigators discovering additional assets, bringing the total to nearly $1 billion. This confiscation represents a major breakthrough for FTX victims, who collectively lost around $9 billion. Sam Bankman-Fried, sentenced to 25 years in prison, continues to fight his case in appeal, contesting the jury's decision and arguing that prosecutors presented a truncated version of the facts regarding the management of user funds on FTX.

**FTX Founder Loses Over $65 Billion in Assets Due to Exchange's Bankruptcy**
Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, lost over $65 billion in assets due to the exchange's bankruptcy. According to Sunil Kavuri, a representative of the largest group of FTX creditors, this amount would have been enough to make Bankman-Fried one of the richest people in the world if he had not filed for bankruptcy in late 2022. FTX's bankruptcy was caused by a combination of factors, including a CoinDesk investigation into the financial state of Alameda Research, a company affiliated with FTX, and a wave of withdrawals from the exchange. The investigation revealed that Alameda had direct access to customer funds, which were used for high-risk investments, and received preferential treatment on the FTX platform. In March 2024, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud, embezzlement of customer funds, and deceiving investors. The estimated value of FTX's assets includes $11 billion in Solana tokens, a $4.2 billion stake in Anthropic, and $3.2 billion in Sui tokens and a stake in Mysten Labs. Additionally, FTX could have been valued at $40 billion, considering its annual revenue of $1 billion and net profit of $400 million.
