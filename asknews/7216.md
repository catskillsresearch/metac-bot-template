**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**The Future of Food: 10 Trends to Watch by 2050**
By 2050, the way we produce, buy, and prepare food will undergo significant transformations. According to predictions, ten main trends will emerge. 1. 'Community meals' will continue to play a central role in our lives, with a focus on shared experiences and emotional connections. 2. The weekly grocery shopping trip will become a thing of the past, replaced by AI-powered meal planning and box delivery services. 3. Clothing will become a source of food production, with wearable technology that can grow food on the go. 4. Urban agriculture will become increasingly integrated into city landscapes, with shared gardens, vertical farming, and community-supported agriculture. 5. Food will be designed to absorb CO2, rather than emit it, with the help of oceanic agriculture and sustainable aquaculture. 6. AI will help reduce food waste by optimizing meal planning and transforming scraps into new dishes using 3D printing. 7. Climate change will lead to the adoption of new crops, such as mangoes and papayas in the Mediterranean, and quinoa and soy in Northern Europe. 8. Ancient crops, such as sorrel and dandelion, will make a comeback, providing a source of biodiversity and resilience. 9. 'Niche' crops, such as teff and fonio, will become more mainstream, providing a source of nutrition and sustainability. 10. Food will become a form of preventive medicine, with AI-powered meal planning and personalized nutrition tailored to individual needs and genetic predispositions. According to Dr. Joseph Poore, 'it's likely that our diet in 2050 will be significantly different from what we have today, although not necessarily in the ways we expect.' Dr. Morgaine Gaye adds, 'the next decade will see significant transformations in our daily habits and food models.'

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak predicts a dystopian future for humanity, with the global population shrinking to 100 million by 2300 due to AI replacing jobs and causing a collapse in birth rates. According to Prof. Kak, 'Computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will be doing literally all that we do because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He warns that major cities like New York and London will become ghost towns, and that the world will be devastated. Prof. Kak, author of 'The Age of Artificial Intelligence', says that people are unaware of the consequences of AI and that it's likely that the world population will collapse. He also mentions that billionaire Elon Musk has expressed similar concerns, suggesting that humans should consider colonizing space to avoid extinction. Prof. Kak states, 'It's likely. I have all the data in the book. This is not just my personal opinion.'

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Can AI save American manufacturing from collapse?**
American manufacturing is facing a severe skills gap, with over 2.1 million jobs potentially going unfilled by 2030, according to Heather Carroll, Chief Revenue Officer at Path Robotics. Carroll emphasizes that this is a 'national problem' that requires immediate attention. She believes that AI can bridge the labor gap, allowing robots to adapt and make decisions on the fly, and augment human capabilities. Carroll stresses that the problem is accelerating and that action must be taken now to avoid being left behind. She describes the current moment as a 'make or break' point for the United States in terms of skilled labor, but also sees opportunities for growth and innovation if leaders adopt AI technology now.

**Russian Expert: Deep Integration of AI and Human Brain Unlikely Before 2050-2060**
According to Yevgeny Kuznetsov, the CEO of Digital Evolution Ventures, the deep integration of artificial intelligence with brain interfaces will not be possible before 2050-2060. Kuznetsov stated that the model for developing and applying new technologies is more complex than the one proposed by Ray Kurzweil, as it takes into account the difficulties of societal acceptance of new technologies and the time it takes for the public to react. According to this model, during the next wave of technological revolution, we will significantly increase our interaction with artificial intelligence through traditional interfaces, i.e., through devices and digital interfaces. However, the deeper integration with the brain will not be possible before 2050-2060, when the next wave of technological revolution will begin, despite the initial signs of these technologies being expected to appear in the time frame predicted by Kurzweil. Kurzweil had previously stated that by 2045, humans will be able to control robots the size of molecules inside their bodies and insert them into the human brain in a non-invasive way to connect the new cortex to the cloud, increasing human intelligence by a million times. Kuznetsov emphasized that 'more integration between humans and digital systems is inevitable and unavoidable.' He added that 'we are already unable to live without smartphones and computers, but to what extent will this integration go?' Despite the fact that digital neural networks are designed in part after the brain, we are not yet technologically compatible. The brain is a complex tissue, and simply filling it with electrodes is a major and complex challenge. For critical cases and patients with serious diseases, this problem will be partially solved in the next decade, but it is unlikely that Neuralink chips or other interfaces will become widespread among the general public.

**Learning from the Sputnik Moment: A New Approach to KI in Europe**
China's DeepSeek has shown what it can do in the field of artificial intelligence. In Europe, we should think about John F. Kennedy's 'Moonshot' speech. The global spread of DeepSeek, the Chinese competitor to the KI-Chatbot ChatGPT, has been described by many commentators as the Sputnik moment of the 21st century. However, it is not enough to simply copy the pioneers. Kennedy's speech in 1962 was not just about the moon landing, but about organizing and measuring the best of our energies and abilities. Europe should not focus on a competition with the US or China over the largest computing capacities or the most powerful language models. Instead, it should develop its own KI-infrastructure, such as the planned 'Cern for AI' or 'AI Factories.' The key to success lies in the integration of KI into value chains. By building a KI-chatbot in a company, basic competences are developed, but this is not enough to create new products or services. This can only be achieved through changes in individual processes and workflows, an area where the large KI-providers lack the necessary industry knowledge. Europe can play to its strengths in industrial production, such as in the automotive and rail sectors, and in tourism and luxury goods. According to studies, only a small part of jobs will be completely replaced by KI (around 7%). Two-thirds of jobs will be supplemented by KI, including high-skilled tasks. Therefore, we should pay special attention to the interface between humans and technology, which is a crucial part of all value chains. This includes the development of 'AI Literacy,' which means understanding the basic concepts of KI, critically evaluating them, and applying them responsibly. This is also required by the new EU-KI-Regulation since February 2025. However, this alone will not be enough. Our organizations will change, and all responsible parties are well advised to take as many people on this journey as possible - a classic task of change management. It is also essential to focus on the effects and success measurement of KI applications. Only then can it be determined whether the necessary changes are going in the right direction. The US is not much further ahead, even large international companies are just at the beginning of the learning curve. This should be used by Europe. Kennedy's 'Moonshot' speech also called for old virtues and experiences of the American settlers. Translated to our topic, it can be deduced that also previous concepts, revived, can be success-critical. Austria and individual federal states such as Styria have been and are very successful with various cluster projects, for example in the mobility sector. Because the competitive advantages primarily arise from the clever use of KI-technologies in value chains, it is necessary to cooperate between universities, companies, administration, etc. Europe can play to its strength in regional networking and thus efficiently connect existing economic sectors with new methods. These 'KI-Cluster 4.0' can also serve as an information and training platform that reaches as many people as possible. The cluster structure was also successful when it came to connecting leading companies with the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Austria, which often still have not found their way in the KI sector. The public sector can also give impulses through the creation of framework conditions and funding and as a former user drive innovations forward.

**China's AI Rise: A 'Sputnik Moment' for the West?**
A recent report by Deutsche Bank, titled 'China Eats the World', has sparked global attention. The report claims that China is not only the center of global manufacturing but also a major player in high-tech fields, threatening Western technological dominance. The report uses the concept of 'Sputnik moment' to describe China's rapid technological advancements. In the field of artificial intelligence, China has made significant progress, with the release of Manus, a general-purpose AI agent that surpasses OpenAI's Deep Research. Manus is a system-level engineering optimization based on large models, which enables it to complete complex tasks with high efficiency. The report highlights the importance of consistency and the need for AI to be more than just a tool, but a partner that can work with humans to achieve complex tasks. The author argues that the current AI landscape is shifting from a 'tool' to a 'partner' role, and that 2025 will be a crucial year for AI agent commercialization. However, the report also notes that there are still significant challenges to overcome, including the lack of a supporting operating system, high latency, and the need for more realistic and personalized memory systems.

**A ‘Sputnik Moment’? Majority Fear Losing AI Lead To China, Back More Gov’t Investment: I&I/TIPP Poll**
A recent I&I/TIPP Poll found that 60% of Americans are concerned about China potentially surpassing the US in artificial intelligence development. The poll also found that 54% of respondents believe the US government should invest more in AI to stay competitive with China. The top concerns among respondents were misinformation and AI-generated content (24%), national security risks (22%), and job displacement and economic impact (21%). The poll results show a broad consensus across Democrats, Republicans, and independent voters on these issues. The poll's findings may be a 'Sputnik moment' for the US, similar to the launch of Russia's Sputnik satellite in 1957, which sparked a panic about the US falling behind in space technology. As tech author Charles Hugh Smith put it, 'America had a kind of “Sputnik moment” recently, after claims were made that China’s “DeepSeek” R1 AI software had leapfrogged other global AI versions.'

**The Sputnik Moment: A Misleading Narrative in the AI Era**
The recent achievement of the Chinese chatbot DeepSeek has sparked a comparison to the Sputnik moment of 1957, when the Soviet Union launched a satellite that shocked the United States. However, the author argues that this narrative is misleading, as the true purpose of DeepSeek is to make money for its parent company, High-Flyer, a hedge fund that develops computer programs to make money quickly. The author contrasts this with the original Sputnik moment, which sparked a national effort to beat the Soviets in the space race, driven by a desire to gain new knowledge and improve people's lives. Instead, the current competition between American and Chinese companies is driven by greed and a desire to widen the gap between the rich and the poor. The author quotes John F. Kennedy's speech at Rice University, where he said that the goal of going to the moon was not just to achieve a technological feat, but to gain new knowledge and improve people's lives. In contrast, the current rhetoric around AI is focused on making money and widening the gap between the rich and the poor. The author also quotes Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer of AI, who warned that the increasing productivity generated by AI will widen the gap between the rich and the poor, creating fertile ground for fascism. The author concludes that humanity has nothing to gain from the battle between American and Chinese turbo-capitalism over AI, and that we must choose the path of scientists like Hinton who aim to improve people's lives, not just make money.

The AI development landscape has seen a significant shift with China's DeepSeek startup revealing its own AI model, equivalent to America's ChatGPT, at a fraction of the cost. This breakthrough has left investors reeling, with shares plummeting, and has raised questions about America's dominance in AI. According to venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, this is 'one of the most remarkable breakthroughs I've ever seen... It's AI's Sputnik moment.' The comparison to the 1957 Sputnik launch, which put Russia ahead of America in the space race, is significant, but it remains to be seen if China's lead in AI will be short-lived.

**A red moon: Will the next 'Sputnik Moment' be made in China?**
The United States is facing a new 'Sputnik Moment' as China is rapidly advancing its lunar program, with plans to land Chinese 'taikonauts' on the lunar surface before 2030. NASA's Artemis program is behind schedule, with a first planned landing mission, Artemis 3, now set for no earlier than mid-2027. China's lunar ambitions are driven by a focus on economic development and resource exploitation, with the moon's south polar region being a key target. The U.S. risks being caught flat-footed if it fails to follow through on its commitment to return humans to the moon by 2024, with potential consequences for global leadership and space governance. To avoid ceding ground to China, the U.S. government needs to streamline and simplify launch licensing, and clear the regulatory and bureaucratic underbrush to accelerate Artemis. 'We better watch out … It is not beyond the realm of possibility that they [China] say, 'Keep out, we're here, this is our territory,' cautions former NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. 'There is no reason to believe they will not be first to send a crewed mission to the lunar south pole,' writes Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's former head of science.
