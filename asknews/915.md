**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**Scientists Discover New Evidence of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes' Origin**
Scientists have discovered new evidence of the origin of intermediate-mass black holes. The study, led by Dr. Karan Jani, director of the Vanderbilt Lunar Labs Initiative, found that gravitational waves detected by the LIGO and Virgo detectors were caused by the merger of black holes with masses 100-300 times that of the Sun, the largest collision of black holes ever recorded. According to Jani, 'black holes are like cosmic fossils that contain the keys to understanding the early universe.' The recent discovery of a group of black holes in this analysis provides a unique opportunity to learn more about the first stars that formed after the Big Bang. However, the current detectors can only capture a brief moment of the final collision of these 'lighter' intermediate-mass black holes, making it difficult to understand how they form. To learn more, Jani's lab is focusing on the future LISA mission, a space project by the European Space Agency and NASA, scheduled to launch in the late 2030s. Two additional studies published in the Astrophysical Journal demonstrated that the LISA mission can track intermediate-mass black holes for years before their merger, providing new insights into their origin, evolution, and fate. The researchers noted that the detection of gravitational waves requires extraordinary precision, comparable to hearing a pin drop during a hurricane. This work confirms the idea that intermediate-mass black holes are one of the most important sources for gravitational wave detectors on Earth and in space. Each new discovery helps scientists better understand where these black holes come from and why they exist in this unusual mass range. The team plans to investigate how lunar detectors can help observe intermediate-mass black holes in the future. Access to lower-frequency gravitational waves from the lunar surface can help identify the environments where these black holes exist, which cannot be achieved by ground-based detectors. Jani said, 'This is an exciting time not only for the study of black holes but also for the combination of scientific research with a new era of space and lunar exploration. This provides a rare opportunity to teach the next generation of students whose discoveries will depend on the Moon and be conducted from it.'

**New space mission to Venus could reveal signs of alien life**
A new, multi-stage space mission is set to launch in 2031, aiming to search for signs of alien life in the acidic clouds of Venus. The planet, with temperatures reaching 456 degrees Celsius, is considered one of the most inhospitable places in the solar system. According to NASA, the mission will be a significant step in understanding the planet's atmosphere and potentially revealing evidence of life beyond Earth. As Dr. David Wysotski, a leading expert in the field, said, 'The discovery of life on Venus would be a groundbreaking moment in the history of space exploration.' The mission is a collaborative effort between space agencies and scientists, with the goal of expanding our knowledge of the universe and potentially answering the question of whether we are alone in the cosmos.

**A Bee Network bus pulls into traffic and, for some, that is very bad news - Manchester Evening News**
The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) have launched a joint initiative to crack down on driving offences. The operation, known as Operation Decker, uses a Bee Network bus as a mobile camera to spot and record drivers breaking the law. The bus is equipped with officers who use hand-held cameras to capture evidence of offences such as using mobile phones while driving, not wearing seatbelts, and speeding. Inspector Bradley Ormesher, from GMP's Roads Policing Unit, said, 'The idea is that we get down in areas we potentially couldn't get a marked car, or we'd struggle to get a marked car down, and we will film anyone committing any offences.' The operation is part of the force's bid to drive down serious and fatal collisions and is signed up to 'Vision Zero' - the ambition to eliminate road deaths in the region by 2040. In the first three hours of the operation, 32 potential offences were identified, with 17 related to the use of mobile phones, seven to the wearing of seatbelts, and seven to stopping on a verge or central reservation.

**Invisible hydrogen: Key to unraveling neutron decay, dark matter mystery**
Physicist Eugene Oks from Auburn University has proposed a new explanation for the discrepancy in neutron lifetime measurements. According to Oks, in some cases, a neutron might break down into just two particles: a neutrino and a type of invisible hydrogen atom, which he refers to as a 'second flavor' of hydrogen. This unusual hydrogen atom doesn't respond to light, making it invisible to regular detectors. Oks' theory could not only solve the neutron decay mystery but also offer clues about dark matter. Typically, when a neutron decays, it splits into three particles: a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. However, Oks suggests that there's another possible decay path involving just two particles: a hydrogen atom and a neutrino. The results from beam and bottle experiments differ by about 10 seconds, with beam experiments yielding a neutron lifetime of 888 seconds and bottle experiments yielding 878 seconds.

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**New Evidence of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes: A Missing Link in the Universe**
Researchers have discovered new evidence of intermediate-mass black holes, which are a 'missing link' in the universe. According to the University of Vanderbilt's Astrophysical Journal Letters, the researchers found that these waves corresponded to mergers of black holes with masses greater than 100 and 300 times that of the Sun, making them the most intense gravitational wave events recorded in astronomy. The researchers also found that the future LISA gravitational wave observatory may be able to track these black holes years before they merge, shedding light on their origin, evolution, and fate. As Dr. [no specific researcher mentioned] noted, detecting gravitational waves from black hole collisions requires extreme precision, 'like trying to hear a pin drop during a hurricane.'

**New proton emitter 188At implies an interaction unprecedented in heavy nuclei**
Researchers have discovered the heaviest proton-emitting isotope yet, 188At. The non-adiabatic quasiparticle model was extended to treat heavy nuclei and reproduced the measured decay frequency if the proton is emitted from a strongly prolate-deformed state. The dominant proton wavefunction component of the proton-emitting state is s1/2. The Thomas-Ehrman shift, a phenomenon where the valence protons have a wave function extending outside the nuclear interior, reducing the repulsive Coulomb effect, is observed in the separation energies of the lightest astatine nuclei. This is the first instance when a meaningful signal of the possible Thomas-Ehrman effect has been observed in heavy nuclei. The researchers propose that the proton is emitted from a prolate deformed (2) state with a dominant s proton component in the wave function, in agreement with the shape evolution predicted by other models. Further studies are needed to narrow down the present uncertainties of the decay energy and half-life by observing more At decay events.

**Return to Ceres: This dwarf planet could contain the clues to life’s origins**
A recent study published in Nature Communications suggests that the dwarf planet Ceres may hold the key to understanding the origins of life. The researchers, led by Kosuke Kurosawa, recreated the conditions of a cosmic crash in a lab and found that high-speed impacts can destroy evidence of carbon, a crucial building block of life. This discovery could explain why carbon has been difficult to find in meteorites. The study's findings have implications for the search for life beyond Earth and have sparked calls for a sample return mission to Ceres. 'I think that detailed analysis of return samples with microscopes [on Earth] — or something like that — is required,' Kurosawa said. The National Academies Planetary Science Decadal Survey recommended a Ceres sample return mission in 2022, but funding issues have delayed the proposal period until 2026. Assuming funding is secured, the mission would focus on the youngest region of Ceres, Occator crater, to search for evidence of carbon-shocked material.

**Claims that "the Universe will end sooner than expected" are false**
A recent paper suggested that Hawking-like radiation isn't just for black holes, and therefore, everything will eventually decay. However, a deeper examination reveals that the idea is fundamentally flawed. The key ingredient necessary for this type of radiation to physically exist is the presence of a horizon, either a cosmological horizon or an event horizon. Without a horizon, objects cannot radiate via the Hawking (or Unruh) mechanism, and therefore, they will not have a finite lifetime or spontaneously decay. This was pointed out in the peer-reviewed literature as a follow-up to the original paper in a comment in November 2024 and in an independent paper at precisely the same time. As a result, only objects with horizons, such as black holes, will radiate and decay, while other massive objects, from protons to stars to stellar and planetary corpses to dark matter halos, will remain stable against decay via Hawking radiation infinitely far into the future.

**CERN's Future Circular Collider: A New Frontier in Particle Physics**
The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) has completed a feasibility study for a new particle accelerator, the Future Circular Collider (FCC), which could be built in the 2040s. The FCC would have a tunnel of approximately 91 kilometers in circumference, compared to the 27 kilometers of the current Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The goal of the FCC is to explore the fundamental laws of the universe, particularly the properties of the Higgs boson, which was discovered in 2012. The study presents the scientific, technical, and economic aspects of the project, which includes two phases: a electron-positron collider and a proton-proton collider with a record-breaking energy of 100 TeV. The estimated cost of the first phase is 15 billion Swiss francs, spread over 12 years starting in the 2030s. The CERN aims to make the FCC a model of responsible research, with a minimal environmental impact. The study will be reviewed by independent experts and submitted to the CERN Council in November 2025, with a final decision expected in 2028.

**CERN Unveils Ambitious Plan for Successor to Large Hadron Collider**
The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) has unveiled plans for a successor to the Large Hadron Collider, a 27-kilometer tunnel that accelerates particles to near-light speeds and collides them. The new collider, called the Future Circular Collider (FCC), will be three times larger and will be built along the Franco-Swiss border and under Lake Geneva. The FCC will conduct high-precision experiments in the mid-2040s to study 'known physics' in more detail, and then enter a second phase in 2070 that will perform high-energy collisions of protons and heavy ions that 'will open the door to the unknown,' said Giorgio Chiarelli, director of research at the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics. 'The history of physics tells us that when there are more data, human ingenuity can extract more information than originally expected,' Chiarelli said. The FCC is expected to cost around 14 billion Swiss francs (16 billion dollars) and will be built in the mid-2040s, pending approval from the CERN's 12 member countries in 2028. The project promises to make groundbreaking discoveries in fields such as cryogenics, superconducting magnets, and vacuum technologies that could benefit humanity. Experts also hope to learn more about the elusive Higgs boson, a particle that has been dubbed 'the particle of God' and helped explain how matter formed after the Big Bang. The Higgs boson was confirmed to exist in 2013 by the Large Hadron Collider, which helped explain some of the fundamental forces in the universe.

**CERN's $17 bn Future Circular Collider proposal clears technical hurdles**
The European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern) has announced that it has cleared all technical hurdles for the Future Circular Collider (FCC), a $17 billion project slated to be the world's biggest particle collider. The FCC is planned to be an 91 km long circular tunnel running beneath the Swiss-French border and will be used to collide protons at unprecedented energies to study fundamental forces and particles. Cern's CEO has projected the FCC to be an essential tool in tackling some of the most perplexing questions about the universe, such as dark matter and dark energy. The proposed project will be developed in two phases, with the first phase featuring an electron-positron collider expected to begin operations in 2046 and the second phase introducing a proton-proton collider in 2070. The collider is expected to target an energy level of 100 trillion electronvolts, over seven times higher than the maximum energy achieved by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Cern's member states will have time until 2028 to decide whether to allocate the funds needed for this project. Some scientists and environmental advocates have argued that the funds might be better used for smaller-scale research projects. As Cern's CEO said, 'The FCC is expected to do just that' - allow scientists to keep pushing the envelope for more discoveries related to the fundamental part of Physics.

**Nuclear: No Fast Neutron Reactors Expected Before 2060**
According to our information, a demonstrator of a fourth-generation nuclear reactor with several hundred megawatts of power, based on the technology of cooled sodium fast neutrons, is not expected to start in France before 2045, while its construction could begin in 2038. The industrial version of this type of reactor is expected only after 2060. Last Monday, during a long-awaited nuclear policy council (CPN), Emmanuel Macron announced the launch of a new industrial program around fourth-generation reactors to close the nuclear fuel cycle. This is a strategic reversal, as the head of state had endorsed, in 2019, the abandonment of the Astrid research program, which aimed to build an experimental fourth-generation reactor based on fast neutron (RNR) technology cooled by sodium.

**New finding forces search for ultra-rare decay process to continue**
Microsoft's new quantum computing chip, Majorana 1, has sparked debate among scientists about its potential to solve complex problems. While Microsoft claims it can achieve this in years, not decades, independent scientists have raised doubts. The chip uses Majorana particles, which are unique in that they are their own anti-particles. Physicists are searching for evidence of neutrinoless double beta decay (0vßß), a rare process that would prove neutrinos are Majorana particles. The AMoRE experiment in South Korea has been searching for this process, but so far, no evidence has been found. The team estimates that a population of Mo-100 nuclei would decay to half their number through 0vßß in no less than 1024 years. They also estimate that the mass of each neutrino would have to be lower than 0.22-0.65 billionths of a proton. The search for 0vßß continues, and the AMoRE experiment plans to look for it in 100 kg of Mo-100 in a future iteration. 'The presence of even a small amount of mass in neutrinos vexes the theory and indicates it has a gap somewhere,' said the AMoRE team. 'The trouble is physicists don't yet know where.'

**New radiation belts found following G5 – Extreme geomagnetic storm in May 2024**
A team of scientists from the University of Colorado Boulder and NASA discovered two previously unknown radiation belts containing high-energy particles in the aftermath of the May 10, 2024, G5 – Extreme geomagnetic storm. The belts were formed at L-shell ranges of 2.5-3.5 and L = 2, containing electrons with energies between 1.3 and 5 MeV and protons with energies between 6.8 and 20 MeV, respectively. The electron belt lasted over three months, while the proton belt remained stable with no signs of rapid decay. The presence of the belts has significant implications for spacecraft, as satellites in geostationary transfer orbits face increased radiation exposure. Xinlin Li, the lead author of the study, said, 'Wow, this is something really new.' David Sibeck, a former mission scientist for NASA’s Van Allen Probes, added, 'Some might stay in this place for a very long time.' The proton belt is expected to last a year or more, making it one of the most persistent radiation structures formed after a geomagnetic storm.

**Scientists Simulate End of the World Using Quantum Computer**
Scientists have used a quantum computer to simulate the catastrophic collapse of the universe, according to a study published in Nature Physics. Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin employed a 5,564-qubit quantum system to study the decay of the false vacuum, a hypothetical state that could potentially threaten the existence of the universe. The team, using the D-Wave quantum computer, constructed a simplified model of the universe by encoding the quantum field states in qubits. According to one hypothesis, the cosmic vacuum may be unstable. If the Higgs field is in a metastable state, it could decay, creating a 'bubble' of true vacuum that would expand at the speed of light, destroying everything in its path. As the researchers noted, the results of the study matched theoretical predictions. The simulation successfully demonstrated the creation of particles in an expanding universe and allowed scientists to observe the process of bubble formation and interaction. The Higgs field is expected to remain stable for trillions of years. The study opens up new possibilities for quantum computing and cosmology, the researchers said, enabling them to test theories such as the instantaneous collapse of the universe. A previous study by the World One supercomputer predicted that modern civilization could cease to exist between 2040 and 2050. Meanwhile, NASA has identified a possible date for the impact of a recently discovered asteroid on Earth.
