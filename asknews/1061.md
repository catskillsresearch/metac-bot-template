**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**NYC skyscraper undergoes dramatic redesign to reach new heights**
The Avenir, a high-rise project in New York City, has undergone a dramatic redesign. Originally planned as two connected towers, it will now consist of one taller skyscraper, reaching 785 ft (almost 240 m) in height, up from the originally proposed 680 ft (207 m). The new design features a wavy nine-story podium with terrace areas, a glass exterior, and a segmented, stepped form made up of four main sections. The interior will include a hotel, casino, restaurants, bars, conference spaces, a spa, and affordable housing, with 100 apartments to be allocated via the NYC housing lottery system.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Be Cautious of 'Mang Zong' on June 5th: Folk Expert Warns of Blood Light Disaster**
According to folk expert Liao Da-yi, the upcoming 'Mang Zong' (June 5th) will bring a significant change in the magnetic field, which may lead to a 'blood light' disaster. People born in the years of the pig, snake, monkey, and tiger should be cautious and avoid wearing black and red clothes during the three to four days leading up to 'Mang Zong'. Liao Da-yi suggests that these individuals can perform good deeds or charity to ward off the disaster. 'Mang Zong' is the ninth solar term, marking the beginning of the end of the planting season. The expert warns that the high temperature and humidity in May will lead to an increase in mosquito-borne diseases, and the strong magnetic field change will make it easier for disasters to occur. Liao Da-yi advises people to be careful and avoid going to crowded places, especially those with children under 100 cm tall. He also suggests that people can help by spreading health education and promoting good deeds.

**pico-mac-nano is a glorious tiny replica of the original Macintosh - 9to5Mac**
Hobbyist Nick Gillard has created a working replica of the original Macintosh, called the pico-mac-nano, which stands at just 62 millimeters tall. The project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, a 2-inch TFT screen, and a speaker to emulate the original Mac's sound and visuals. According to Gillard, 'I just couldn't resist creating a matching, tiny version of the iconic 'Picasso' box that the original 128K Macintosh shipped in.' The pico-mac-nano can run MacPaint and MacWrite, and Gillard plans to sell pre-assembled kits soon, with DIY enthusiasts able to download the STL files, firmware, and parts list from 1BitRainbow.com.

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**The Mystery of the Amsterdamer Fuß: A Measurement with No Context**
Willi explains that a foot is the part of the body with five small toes, but he is unsure what an 'Amsterdamer Fuß' is. After researching online, he finds that nine Amsterdamer Fuß is equivalent to approximately 255 centimeters or 2.55 meters. This measurement has no context, but it is interesting to note that Trijntje Keever, a woman born in Edam, Netherlands, 409 years ago, was reportedly the tallest person ever measured, standing at nine Amsterdamer Fuß. However, her condition, acromegaly, was exploited by her parents who displayed her at fairs like a sideshow attraction, which Willi believes has nothing to do with being tall.

**Baba Vanga's Predictions: A Glimpse into the Future**
Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian mystic, has predicted that the world will end in 5079. She has made several predictions in her lifetime, which have come true, including the 9/11 attacks, the COVID-19 pandemic, and an earthquake in 2025. Vanga's predictions are still widely discussed on the internet and social media. Although there is no scientific evidence to support her predictions, many events have matched her statements. For example, she predicted the death of Princess Diana and China's rise to global power, which have both come true. Vanga has also predicted that humanity's downfall will begin in 2025, with a series of catastrophic events, including a devastating earthquake, a global economic collapse, and a war in Europe that will affect the population. She also predicted that humans will start searching for energy resources on Mars in 2028, the polar ice caps will melt, causing a rise in sea levels, and communism will spread across the world again in 2076. Additionally, she predicted that humans will establish contact with aliens in 2130, a severe drought will hit the Earth in 2170, and a war will break out between the inhabitants of Earth and Mars in 3005.

**This 11-year-old Dutch girl is considering growth-prohibiting surgery after already reaching 170cm tall**
Ninthe, an 11-year-old Dutch girl, is considering growth-prohibiting surgery due to her exceptional height of 170cm (5′7″), which is already above the average height for a child. Her mother, Marion, explains that being so tall can be isolating and that Ninthe has received negative comments. Orthopaedic surgeon Lars van Rozen explains that the surgery involves making a small incision to halt about 30-40% of expected growth, with an average remaining growth of 8 centimetres. People opt for the procedure for personal and practical reasons, such as finding clothes and traveling by public transport. Lisa Lambert, who underwent the surgery at 15, sent Ninthe words of encouragement, saying, 'If you’re considering the operation, it’s not something to be afraid of. The first few weeks are tough, but after that, you won’t have any problems. Tall girls rule the world!'

**How Humans Will Look in 3025, According to Science**
According to experts, in the year 3025, humans will have a more uniform appearance, with darker skin and a more intermediate appearance. They may also be more attractive, as the selection pressure will favor individuals with desirable traits. The professor Mark Thomas suggests that the early maturation of humans could lead to a decrease in height, as it would allow individuals to have more children and pass on their genes. However, this is still a theory and has not been proven in population studies. On the other hand, the increasing number of children that individuals can have will lead to a greater selection pressure, which could favor individuals with more attractive traits. The professor Thomas also suggests that the human brain may become smaller over time, as computers take over more tasks and the advantage of having a large brain decreases. The expert in sleep, Sophie Bostock, predicts that the lack of sleep in humans will lead to changes in their bodies, such as chronic back pain, fine hair, and a weakened immune system. However, these changes will not be genetic, as there will be no evolutionary advantage to passing them on. If a group of humans were to venture into space, they may evolve separately from the rest of the human population on Earth, leading to the possibility of speciation. In space, humans may become taller and develop longer arms to adapt to the low gravity, and their eyes may become larger and more sensitive to see in low light conditions.
