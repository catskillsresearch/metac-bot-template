**Substantial cuts to Medicaid could undermine efforts to increase nursing facility staffing levels: KFF**
The Trump administration's proposed Medicaid cuts could harm long-term care operators' efforts to attract and retain workers, according to a KFF brief. In contrast, 45 out of 49 states with Medicaid programs have increased nursing facility fee-for-service base rates in fiscal 2024 and 2025 to combat dwindling staffing levels. Iowa and Ohio reported significant base rate increases of 25.5% and 17%, respectively. Some states are also using Medicaid to increase minimum wage for direct caregivers and enhance benefits offerings. For example, Connecticut passed a bill to increase direct caregivers' pay, which will be funded by a $164 million investment in nursing homes over three fiscal years. Research shows that nursing homes that fail to implement better incentives to retain staff, such as through Medicaid, suffer unfavorable consequences, including a 50% yearly turnover rate. This has led to nearly 1.7 million long-term care employees leaving their organizations or the industry altogether.

**Canada's Long-Term Care System Faces Staff Shortages and Bed Shortages**
Canada is facing a severe shortage of long-term care (LTC) workers and a shortage of beds in nursing homes. According to a report by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), the number of LTC beds needs to nearly double in the next decade to meet the growing demand for care for people aged 85 and older. The report warns that the current supply of LTC beds is far from meeting the demand, with 50% of LTC facilities reporting staff shortages, which affects the quality of care, increases absenteeism and overtime, and exacerbates existing staff burdens. The problem has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many LTC workers are choosing to leave their jobs or retire early, with a 42.5% decline in registered practical nurses (RPNs) and a 9.1% decline in occupational therapists between 2014 and 2023. In 2023, there were over 29,000 vacant registered nurse (RN) and RPN positions, 13,000 vacant licensed practical nurse (LPN) positions, and 26,000 vacant personal support worker (PSW) positions. CIHI recommends providing more flexible work arrangements, such as adjusting schedules based on employee needs, to stabilize LTC facilities' workforce and alleviate the crisis. 'We need to take action to address the long-term care workforce shortage and ensure that our seniors receive the care they need,' said CIHI. 'This requires a collaborative effort from governments, healthcare organizations, and the public to prioritize the well-being of LTC workers and the quality of care they provide.'

**Demand for Long-Term Care Increasing in Canada as Workforce Declines**
A recent report by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) highlights the challenges facing Canada's long-term care (LTC) sector. The report states, 'This coming decade will be a challenging period for the LTC sector,' citing staffing and quality challenges that pre-date the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of LTC residents with 'higher clinical care needs' has increased by 4.5% since 2014, while the number of registered psychiatric nurses (RPNs) and occupational therapists working in LTC homes has declined by 42.5% and 9.1% respectively. The report notes that efforts to attract and retain LTC workers are crucial, as 1 in 5 LTC workers expressed an intention to leave their job during the pandemic. The report also highlights the increasing number of vacancies in LTC settings, with over 29,000 openings for RNs and RPNs, and the substantial increase in sick hours and overtime hours logged by LTC staff since the pandemic. CIHI suggests that sustaining the LTC workforce may require strategies that allow employees flexibility to shape their schedules to suit their lives.

**Rethink Staffing With Assessments Every 4 Hours - Oncology Nurse Advisor**
A novel assessment tool has been implemented in an oncology setting to optimize staffing levels every 4 hours. This innovative solution translates to improved nurse-to-patient ratios and efficient labor costs. The tool provides real-time data entry, preset values for hours per patient day (HPPD), and color-coded indicators to optimize resource allocation. As a result, the hospital saw a reduction in overstaffing during low-census periods, lowering unnecessary labor costs. The initiative also strengthened the partnership between nursing leadership and finance teams, providing valuable insights into the nuances of staffing decisions and its financial implications. By implementing 4-hour assessments, the hospital created a more adaptive staffing model that better aligned with patient needs, promoting a culture of fiscal accountability and empowering nurses to consider the financial implications of staffing decisions.

**More staff not magic solution to quality - Australian Ageing Agenda**
Researchers from Flinders University and the Registry of Senior Australians Research Centre have found that increasing staffing levels in aged care homes is not a magic solution to improving quality of care. According to Associate Professor Stephanie Harrison, a skilled, well-supported workforce with strong clinical leadership is more effective at providing quality care than a large one. The study, which analyzed data from January 2023 to March 2024, showed a 12% increase in aged care homes meeting or exceeding their total care minutes target, but found no associated improvement in residents' experiences or quality measures. Associate Professor Harrison stated, 'A holistic view to care quality is needed, beyond just meeting staffing targets. Adequate training, staff retention strategies, and tailored models of care that meet individual resident needs are all important for policymakers to consider.'

**'I just couldn't take it anymore': Why these long-term care workers left the industry**
Wendy Harvie, a 60-year-old personal support worker from Oshawa, Ont., quit her job after 14 years at a private nursing home due to years of violence and abuse from residents. She suffered injuries, including being punched, kicked, and pinched, and witnessed residents engaging in self-harm. Harvie says she and her coworkers didn't feel safe or supported, and she took eight months of stress leave before quitting. She is among the rising number of people leaving the long-term care industry in Canada, where staff shortages and lack of benefits have led to burnout. Althea Quinton, a 72-year-old registered practical nurse, also left the industry after 15 years, citing mistreatment by management and staff shortages. Both women found meaning in helping people, particularly the elderly, and continue to work in healthcare, albeit in different capacities.

**Domestic Service Workers' Salaries in June 2025**
In June 2025, cooks and specialized task personnel, part of the second category of domestic service workers, will receive a salary based on the previous month's reference, as a new collective agreement has not been reached to update their wages. According to the current resolution 1/2025, the minimum amounts for each category of worker are established. These values are used for workers who work less than 24 hours a week for the same employer. For workers who work 24 or more hours a week, the salary will be calculated proportionally to the number of hours worked. Employers must also pay additional concepts such as seniority, pension contributions, and social work. The vacation scheme for domestic service workers, including supervisors, specialized task personnel, housekeepers, nannies, and adult caregivers, and general task personnel, is based on the time worked. Between November 1st and March 30th, employees are entitled to take vacations, with the number of days depending on their seniority. New employees will receive a proportional number of days off based on the hours worked.

**Long-term Care Industry in Taiwan Faces Challenges: Industry Representatives Propose Fee Adjustments**
The long-term care industry in Taiwan has seen a significant increase in demand, but the current fee regulations have not kept pace with market reality. The Kaohsiung City Council held a public hearing to review and discuss the long-term care institution fee standard review mechanism. Industry representatives proposed setting a monthly fee of NT$30,000 per bed as a review ceiling, and exempting institutions with fees below NT$30,000 from submitting salary and cost analysis reports. Councilor Zheng Guangfeng pointed out that the long-term care 2.0 program has been in place for nearly 10 years, and the Kaohsiung City long-term care center allocated NT$8 billion in budget last year, including home care, community care, migrant workers, and institutional care. Data from last year showed that home and community services accounted for 86%, indicating a significant imbalance. Long-term care 3.0 is set to launch this year, aiming to adjust the resource allocation and raise fees for long-term care institutions based on reference data such as minimum wage, per capita GDP, and consumer price index. Councilor Chen Huifen stated that facing severe inflation, if fees are not adjusted, it will affect the welfare of caregivers within institutions, leading to high turnover rates. She proposed setting a fair and just price to achieve a balance between the government, institutions, and consumers, and to achieve the goal of 'old age with a sense of fulfillment.' Councilor Zhang Boyang believed that some industry representatives have reflected that the fee mechanism and review data are too cumbersome, and the long-term care industry's institutional health will impact consumer rights. He hopes that through regulatory building, the long-term care market can move towards positive competition. Professor Lee Ren-yao from National Kaohsiung University suggested that long-term care institutions are mostly operating at a loss, and raising fees without providing services will create a vicious cycle. He recommended linking fee prices and institutional evaluation mechanisms to allow the government to effectively monitor service quality. Professor Lee Liang-jian from I-Shou University stated that using the minimum wage as a basis, plus inflation, as a reference for fees, but institutions themselves need to have self-regulatory mechanisms. When fees are raised, institutions should not hire illegal migrant workers. Associate Professor Lee Chao-ying from Fu Jen Catholic University pointed out that institutions face challenges such as labor shortages, recruitment difficulties, high turnover rates, and financial and personnel costs. If the fee is set too low, based on the Social Affairs Bureau's low-income and middle-low-income disabled elderly care services subsidy of NT$24,400, it will be too low. Lin Wen-xiong, honorary chairman of the Kaohsiung City Long-term Care Institutions Association, suggested that for a 49-bed example, the minimum number of caregivers should be 9, with a labor-to-capital ratio, and each month's cost should be at least NT$1.35 million. With a monthly fee of NT$30,000 per bed, it can barely balance the budget. If the monthly fee exceeds NT$30,000, the cost analysis and financial report can be provided, and the salary summary and salary details can be referenced from the financial report, without needing to provide additional documents. Zhang Bi-zi, chairman of the Kaohsiung City Long-term Care Institutions Association, stated that government subsidies for 'welfare beds' account for 80% of institutional beds, and she believes that fees should be similar to those of nursing homes, with high fees leading to high quality.

**Digital Revolution in Montreal's CHSLD: A New Era of Efficiency and Safety**
Eight CHSLD (residential care facilities for seniors) in Montreal have finally abandoned their old paper files thanks to a digital revolution that allows employees to save 30 minutes per day and almost eliminate the use of the fax machine. At the Centre d'hébergement de Verdun, the time spent deciphering illegible medical notes, going down four floors to consult a file, or searching for lost papers is a thing of the past. 'Sometimes, deciphering certain doctors' notes was like reading Chinese,' said Martine Viger, head nurse at the Verdun CHSLD. 'It's amazing how much time we save.' The digitalization of CHSLD in Quebec is very late compared to medical clinics and hospitals. The Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux (CIUSSS) Centre-Sud-de-l'Île de Montréal believes it is the first to have digitized its residences for seniors. To date, eight CHSLD have been digitized and seven others are in the process, according to Le Journal. The project cost $200,000 to digitize the eight CHSLD, which are now connected to the Gustave system. 'It's not a question of money, it's a question of effort and having a strategy. We have to believe in it,' said Sergio Fernandes, director of information resources at CIUSSS. 'The gains are enormous in the long term. With time, we will maximize the innovations.' At Verdun, healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, nutritionists) now use laptops to write medical notes from consultations with patients. The various medical forms are also digitized. This has allowed them to save half an hour per day and access information remotely. 'We can see vital signs, laboratory results, it's much faster to orient ourselves to make a decision,' said Dr. Marc André Laplante, physician at the CHSLD. 'Before, we were very dependent on the nurse.' 'The medical note is the key. It's the trace of interventions, our thoughts, our hypotheses of diagnosis,' added Dr. Laplante. 'It has really improved care coverage and patient safety.' If it seems simple from the outside, this transition to leave paper behind is 'painful,' admits Fernandes. 'It's extremely complex. It seems easy, but there are many interconnections between each branch,' said the director, referring to the healthcare network. 'I don't know if there are businesses as complex as this.'

**Missouri lawmaker pushing for change in how long-term care facilities operate**
Missouri Senator Stephen Webber is pushing for changes in how long-term care facilities operate in the state through Senate Bill 733. The bill would require a certificate of need for any transfer involving assisted living, intermediate care, residential or skilled nursing facilities, and tighten licensing requirements by mandating disclosure of facility owners, trustees, and companies providing administrative, clinical, or financial services. Additionally, the bill sets minimum staffing requirements, mandating that registered nurses and certified nursing assistants provide care for a specified amount of time each day. Missouri's staffing at nursing homes ranks among the worst in the nation, with an average of 3.37 hours of nursing care per day for each resident. According to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, there are over 1,100 licensed long-term care facilities in the state, with 161 facilities considered 'troubled' due to poor performance or failure to report staffing numbers.

**Courts Diverge in Challenges to CMS's Minimum Staffing Requirements for LTC Facilities**
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published a Final Rule in May 2024 to implement minimum staffing standards for long-term care (LTC) facilities. However, the rule was challenged in two lawsuits, resulting in divergent rulings. The US District Court for the Northern District of Texas vacated the staffing requirements, while the US District Court for the District of Iowa denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has filed a brief defending the lower court's ruling with the Eighth Circuit, arguing that CMS had the authority to issue the staffing requirements. The outcome of these cases will have significant impact on the future of CMS's oversight of the country's nursing homes.

**Texas Court Strikes Down Key Portions of Biden-Era Rule Imposing Minimum Nurse Staffing Requirements at Nursing Homes**
A Texas court has struck down key provisions of a Biden-era rule requiring nursing homes to have a registered nurse (RN) on site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and setting minimum staffing standards based on a facility's number of residents. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of the Northern District of Texas ruled that the two nurse staffing provisions, which were implemented in a 2024 CMS regulation, exceeded the agency's statutory authority. The court stated that Congress had mandated 'nursing homes use the services of a registered professional nurse for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week,' and that CMS was not free to amend this statute and replace 8 hours a day with 24 hours a day. The court also rejected CMS's argument that it had broad authority to implement requirements to protect the health and safety of nursing home residents, ruling that the minimum staffing standards failed to consider the nursing needs of a facility's residents as required by Congress.

**CMS Final Rule on Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities Struck Down**
The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas has struck down the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Minimum Staffing Rule, which mandated a 24/7 registered nurse presence and hours per resident day (HPRD) requirements for long-term care facilities. The American Health Care Association (AHCA) and others challenged the rule, arguing that CMS acted without authority in issuing the 24/7 Requirement and that the HPRD requirements failed to consider a facility's nursing needs. The Court agreed, ruling that CMS lacked authority to implement these provisions. While the 24/7 and HPRD requirements are no longer in effect, other provisions of the Final Rule remain in place. CMS has 60 days to appeal the decision.

**Federal Court Strikes Down CMS Nursing Home Staffing Mandate**
A federal court has struck down the CMS nursing home staffing mandate, which would have required a registered nurse to be present 24 hours a day and set minimum staffing levels based on the number of residents. The court ruled that CMS failed to meet statutory requirements and unlawfully substituted a one-size-fits-all benchmark for individualized assessment. While the ruling offers near-term relief, it increases long-term uncertainty for providers, investors, and lenders. CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz has expressed openness to relaxing the staffing mandate altogether. States may seek to fill the vacuum, creating a heightened risk of regulatory fragmentation for multistate operators. Providers should consider ensuring the defensibility of their workforce practices, retaining acuity-driven assessments, documenting key workforce decisions, and continuing smart workforce investments. Lenders should focus on whether an operator has scalable staffing models, documented acuity-based staffing plans, and internal controls that can withstand evolving standards.

**Federal judge kills Biden administration's nursing home staffing rule**
A federal judge has blocked the Biden administration's nursing home staffing rule, citing inconsistency with Congress's existing legislation. The rule, issued in May 2024, aimed to provide safe and quality care by setting a consistent floor for nurse-to-resident ratios. However, several nursing home-related organizations sued, arguing that it exceeded CMS's statutory authority and created impossible-to-meet standards. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk agreed, stating that 'though rooted in laudable goals, the Final Rule still must be consistent with Congress's statutes.' The lawsuit claimed that the mandate would have required a registered nurse to be present 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which is different from Congress's eight-hour, seven-day requirement. The American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, plaintiffs in the lawsuit, praised the court decision, saying it protects access to care for the aging population and upholds the rule of law and balance of powers.

**Nursing Professionals Warn of 'Grave Risk' to Elderly Residents in Castilla and León Residences**
The Council of Nursing Colleges in Castilla and León has warned that the new decree on the typology of social services centers for long-term care and the regulation of minimum staffing ratios 'does not guarantee' the presence of healthcare professionals in the community's residences. The professionals have presented formal objections to the project of the Decree of Typology of Social Services Centers for Long-term Care and Minimum Staffing Ratios, promoted by the Junta of Castilla and León. The main demand of the institution is that the legislation explicitly guarantees the presence of nurses in residential centers, 'correcting the omission detected in the current draft'. According to Enrique Ruiz Forner, president of the Council of Nursing Colleges of Castilla and León, 'we cannot understand that a text that regulates care for people in a state of dependency does not mention nurses explicitly as essential personnel.' He added that the law, 'as it is written, could be interpreted as allowing residences to dispense with nursing professionals, which would mean a setback in the quality of care and an unbearable burden for the public health system.' The Council of Nursing Colleges has proposed a minimum of two nurses per 100 residents in each of the three daily shifts. This would ensure a '24-hour coverage of healthcare in all centers, public and private.' The Council has urged the Junta to correct the 'grave error' in the decree's drafting and guarantee the presence of nurses in all centers for dependent care. 'You cannot manage the health of the elderly with purely economic criteria. We need the Junta to rectify and listen to the professionals who know firsthand the reality of these centers,' Ruiz Forner concluded.

**Missouri advocates decry nursing home staffing shortages, which rank among worst in nation**
Missouri nursing homes have some of the worst staffing levels in the nation, with an average of 3.37 hours of nursing care per day for each resident, according to federal data. This has led to understaffing, which can cause residents to be neglected, and has resulted in near-impossible working conditions for staff. 'We are struggling, trying to get all of these people taken care of,' said Katherine Stewart, a nursing home staff member. 'How are we supposed to get our job done if we don't have enough staffing?' Michelle Gralnick, a leader of the Missouri Alliance for Long-Term Care Reform, said understaffing can lead to serious health consequences, including sepsis, skin irritation, and pressure sores. The group has published a report highlighting the state's chronic understaffing of nursing homes, lack of proper oversight, financial misconduct, and regulatory failures. A bill sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Stephen Webber would increase oversight and create minimum staffing requirements statewide. 'This is an issue that every single Missourian should care about, because every single Missourian themselves could end up in a facility like this,' Webber said. However, a bill sponsored by Republican state Rep. Dean Van Schoiack would reduce public disclosure of noncompliant long-term care facilities, and a bill filed by state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman would exempt long-term care facilities in good standing from annual onsite inspections. 'Unsafe staffing to maximize profitability is often the culprit' of facility quality issues, according to the report. Almost 80% of Missouri nursing homes are for-profit.

**Changes on the Horizon for Long-Term Care Facilities**
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has implemented new staffing standards for long-term care facilities, requiring a minimum of 0.55 hours per resident per day (HPRD) for registered nurses (RNs), 2.45 HPRD for nurse aides (NAs), and 3.48 HPRD for total nurse staffing. Additionally, facilities must have a RN on duty 24 hours a day. The new regulations aim to improve health outcomes, but some providers are concerned that they will be forced to reduce the number of licensed registered nurses to satisfy the new staffing minimums. Researchers have found that at least 80% of nursing homes fail to meet the updated requirements. Providers have several alternatives to compliance, including litigation, exemption options, and compromise with CMS. However, many are hopeful that the new regulations will be modified or rescinded in the future.

**PCs failure to fix long-term care, make care better key ballot box issue for Ottawa LTC staff**
Rayment, a representative of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), is urging voters in Ottawa to critically evaluate the Ford government's record on long-term care (LTC) for vulnerable seniors. Despite passing legislation for a daily resident care standard of four hours, understaffing and incorrect pay for front-line staff continue to be issues. Rayment stated, 'We have money taken away, hours paid are not right, and from one week to the next we are guessing if there will be enough pay on our pay cheques to buy groceries and pay rent.' The waitlist for LTC in Ontario has doubled over the past 10 years, and it is expected to grow, surpassing 50,000 people in 2025. CUPE is calling for positive changes, including increased staffing and correct pay for LTC workers, regardless of who forms government after the election.
