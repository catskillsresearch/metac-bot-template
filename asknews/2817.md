**UK Announces Nuclear Submarine and Ammunition Factory Plans in Response to 'Russian Threat'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive rearmament plan for the UK, including the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and six new ammunition factories. The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate £15 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional £6 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.

**UK Prepares for Possible War, Plans to Build Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarines**
The UK is preparing for a possible war and plans to build up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines as part of a multi-million dollar military plan to counter threats from Russia and Iran. According to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, 'The threat is more serious, more immediate, more unpredictable than ever since the Cold War.' The plan is part of the AUKUS alliance with the US and Australia and aims to reaffirm the UK's role as a strategic power in Western defense. The UK's Defense Minister, John Healey, stated that this rearmament is 'a message to Moscow.' The UK is also looking to strengthen its role within NATO and has commissioned a strategic review focused on emerging threats and the use of technologies like artificial intelligence and drones. Despite budget constraints, Starmer has reiterated his commitment to increasing defense spending to 3% of GDP by 2029 and 2.5% by 2027, surpassing the current 2.3%.

**Nato must be ready for war with Russia by 2029, Germany warns**
Germany's defence chief, Breuer, warned that NATO must be ready for a war with Russia by 2029, citing Russia's rapid production of weaponry, including 1,500 battle tanks and four million rounds of artillery each year. Breuer stated, 'There's an intent and there's a build up of the stocks.' He emphasized that NATO must be prepared to fight tonight, not just in 2029. The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are particularly vulnerable, and Breuer urged fellow NATO nations to rebuild their militaries. The UK has announced plans to build a dozen new nuclear submarines armed with Tomahawk missiles, bolstering its nuclear warhead programme, which Defence Secretary John Healey said is 'what Putin fears most.'

**UK Expands Nuclear-Powered Submarine Fleet to Counter Growing Threats**
The UK is preparing to invest in new generation submarines to enhance its defense capabilities. The Ministry of Defense announced that 12 new attack submarines, powered by nuclear energy and carrying only conventional weapons, will enter service by the late 2030s, replacing the current seven submarines. Additionally, the ministry revealed that the total cost of a new nuclear warhead development program, which was initiated earlier, will be £15 billion. Defense Secretary John Healey stated, 'We are aware of the growing threat and we must demonstrate a clear stance against Russian aggression. Our new submarines, equipped with the latest technology, will project British power on the high seas, while our domestically developed nuclear warheads will bolster our national security from within.' The new submarines are reportedly being developed as part of the AUKUS security pact between the UK, US, and Australia.

**Britain is getting a defense boost aimed at sending a message to...**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, amid growing threats from Russia. The government will also build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would 'send a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. The government has accepted all 62 recommendations made in a strategic defense review, which includes increasing conventional Britain's weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons and investing 15 billion in Britain's nuclear arsenal.

**UK to Restore 'Readiness Status', Build 12 New-Generation Attack Submarines**
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced that he will 'restore the UK's readiness status' as the core goal for the armed forces, and increase the UK's defense production capacity. The UK government will publish a 'Strategic Defense Review' on May 31, which will assess the threats facing the UK, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and US President Trump's pressure on NATO allies to increase defense spending and strengthen their defenses. The report will call for the UK armed forces to enter a 'readiness status', explaining the changing security threats and the defensive technologies needed to address them. Before the report's release, the UK government will announce a significant expansion of its nuclear-powered attack submarine fleet and accelerate the modernization of its military-industrial complex. The UK Ministry of Defense has stated that the UK will build up to 12 new-generation attack submarines, but equipped with conventional non-nuclear weapons, replacing the existing submarines, which is expected to cost £15 billion. UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said, 'With the new, most advanced submarines patrolling international waters, and the UK's nuclear warhead program, we are making the UK strong at home and globally.' Sunak has pledged to increase the UK's defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and further increase it to 3% by 2029, currently at 2.3%. He warned on May 31 that the UK must be prepared to fight and win wars against countries with advanced military capabilities.

**NATO Warned of Possible Russian Invasion Within Four Years**
The General Inspector of the German Armed Forces, Carsten Breuer, has warned that NATO should prepare for a possible Russian invasion within the next four years. Breuer stated that Russia has produced 4 million 152-mm artillery shells in 2024, not all of which will be used in the war against Ukraine. He also mentioned that Russia produces 1500 tanks per year, many of which could be used for attacks on NATO member states in the Baltic region by 2029 or earlier. Breuer noted that not every tank will be sent to the war in Ukraine, but will also be used in stockpiles and new military structures that are always directed against the West. The NATO is facing a 'very serious threat' from Russia, according to Breuer, who has never experienced such a threat in his 40 years of service. Meanwhile, the British government has announced plans to increase its nuclear-powered submarine fleet, with the goal of making Britain safe at home and strong abroad. The UK will build up to 12 next-generation attack submarines that are nuclear-powered and can carry conventional and non-nuclear weapons. Additionally, the UK will invest 15 billion pounds (approximately 18 billion euros) in nuclear programs, creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country. In other news, a drone attack in the Ukrainian region of Cherson has injured two teenagers, and the Ukrainian president has expanded his delegation for talks with Russian representatives in Istanbul. The Ukrainian delegation now consists of 14 people, including three new members from the military, justice, and human rights departments. The US, UK, France, and Germany will also send security advisors to the talks.

**'New era of threat' warning as UK to buy combat aircraft for firing nuclear weapons - Daily Star**
The UK government is planning to acquire US-made combat aircraft capable of firing tactical nuclear weapons to counter the threat from Russia. This move would mark a significant expansion of the UK's nuclear deterrent since the Cold War. Defence Secretary John Healey warned of a 'new era of threat' and stated that the world is becoming more dangerous, with nuclear risks rising. Healey emphasized the importance of a strong industrial base to support a country's armed forces, citing the lesson from Ukraine. The government has pledged £1.5 billion to set up factories and support the procurement of 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons, creating 1,800 jobs. Healey said this is 'a message to Moscow' that Britain is strengthening its armed forces and industrial base to ensure readiness to fight, if required.

**Britain to spend $2.6b on weapons' factories as Starmer calls for war readiness**
Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a £1.5 billion plan to build at least six new weapons and explosives factories, as part of a broader effort to boost the country's defence industry. Starmer warned that Britain must be ready to fight and win a war against states with advanced military forces, citing Russia's invasion of Ukraine as an example. Defence Minister John Healey described the investment as 'a message to Moscow' and a way to stimulate Britain's sluggish economy. The plan includes procuring up to 7,000 long-range weapons, built in Britain, and has been met with reports that the government wants to purchase US-made fighter jets capable of firing tactical nuclear weapons. The investment is part of a larger defence review, which will set out the threats Britain faces and the military equipment and services needed to meet them. Starmer has committed to raising defence spending to 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product by 2027 and targeting a 3 per cent level over the longer term.

**These Are The Countries With The Most Nuclear Weapons**
As of 2024, nine countries possess the world's 12,000 nuclear warheads. The U.S. and Russia hold around 88% of the world's nuclear weapons and 84% of the warheads ready for military use, with over 10,000 warheads combined. According to a 2018 study, 100 nuclear weapons would be the 'pragmatic limit' for any country's arsenal. While the U.S. has been reducing its nuclear arsenal, other countries such as Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are increasing their warhead stockpiles. Approximately 3,904 warheads are deployed with operational forces, with about 2,100 U.S., Russian, British, and French warheads on high alert. Despite the world's continued ability to cause mass destruction, nuclear weapon stockpiles have significantly declined over the last few decades, decreasing from a peak of approximately 70,300 warheads in 1986 to an estimated 12,331 at the beginning of 2025.

**Top Nuclear-Armed Nations In 2025: Where Does India Stand? - News18**
According to a study by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), as of early 2025, the world's nine nuclear-armed nations collectively possess approximately 12,331 nuclear warheads. The top five countries with the largest nuclear arsenals are Russia (5,449 warheads), the United States (5,277 warheads), China (600 warheads, expected to exceed 1,000 by 2030), France (290 warheads), and the United Kingdom (225 warheads). India has approximately 180 nuclear warheads and adheres to a no-first-use policy, while Pakistan has around 170 nuclear warheads and maintains its arsenal largely due to its historical rivalry with India. Israel is believed to possess around 90 nuclear warheads, and North Korea has approximately 50 nuclear warheads, although the exact number remains uncertain due to the secretive nature of its nuclear programme.

**China Accelerates Nuclear Development: Arsenal Approaching 1,000 Warheads**
According to a recent report by the Federation of American Scientists, China currently possesses around 600 nuclear warheads, with many more in production. The study highlights that China is developing its nuclear arsenal at the fastest rate among the nine nuclear-armed states, despite having signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The report, published by the Nuclear Information Project, reveals that since May 2024, China has continued to develop three new missile silo fields for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with solid fuel, as well as proceeding with the construction of new silos for its ICBMs DF-5 with liquid fuel. China is also advancing the development of new ICBM variants and advanced strategic launch systems. The report suggests that Beijing has produced excess warheads for these systems, ready to be used once the launchers are operational. The study also notes the Pentagon's projections, which indicate that China's arsenal will surpass 1,000 warheads by 2030. The 2024 report presented to the US Congress by the Department of Defense revealed that China could have around 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. However, the Nuclear Notebook notes that the growth of the arsenal will depend on China's stockpiles of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and tritium. In 2023, the International Panel on Fissile Materials estimated that China possessed approximately 14 tons of HEU and around 2.9 tons of separated plutonium available for nuclear weapons.

**Over 9,000 Nuclear Warheads Ready for Launch**
According to the Nuclear Weapons Ban Monitor report from Norsk Folkehjelp, there are now 9,604 nuclear warheads ready for use, spread across nine countries. This is an increase of 19 from last year and over 330 from seven years ago. The report's general secretary, Raymond Johansen, comments, 'An incredibly alarming increase.' With the current tense global situation and Russia's repeated threats to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine, the number of ready-to-use warheads is expected to continue increasing. 40% of these warheads are already deployed on missiles, making them capable of being launched within a few seconds or minutes from land, submarines, or fighter jets. The report also notes that both Russia and the US are modernizing their nuclear arsenals, as stated by the Swedish peace research institute Sipri in 2023. Meanwhile, half of the world's countries have joined the UN's convention on banning nuclear weapons, but the US, Sweden, and other NATO countries have not. The US has nuclear warheads deployed in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, and Turkey, and Norsk Folkehjelp is concerned about France and Germany's plans to build up a European nuclear arsenal. 'Increased investments in nuclear deterrence are not the right way to go,' says Raymond Johansen. 'Nuclear weapons cannot be used for anything that does not harm us ourselves.'

**9,605 nuclear weapons now deployable globally, UN report alarms**
According to a UN report, the number of deployable nuclear weapons globally has increased to 9,605. China now has 600 warheads 'available for use', while India and Pakistan have 180 and 170 respectively. North Korea has 50 operational nuclear weapons. The U.S. and Russia still retain 3,700 and 4,299 operational nuclear weapons respectively. Hans M. Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists warned that the upward trajectory of nuclear stockpiles will continue unless there is a breakthrough in arms control and disarmament efforts. However, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) is gaining traction, with Raymond Johansen of Norwegian People's Aid describing it as 'the bright spot on the horizon'.

**More and Deadlier Nuclear Weapons in the World**
According to the Nuclear Weapons Ban Monitor 2024, presented by Norsk Folkehjelp at the UN, 9,604 nuclear warheads are ready for use, 19 more than the previous year. This is equivalent to 146,500 Hiroshima bombs. 40% of these warheads can be launched on short notice from land or submarines. The Federation of American Scientists warns that the increase will continue as countries modernize and expand their arsenals. Russia has also changed its nuclear doctrine to include the use of nuclear weapons in conventional attacks. Despite 70% of the world's countries supporting a nuclear ban, Norway and other NATO countries remain outside of it.

**Nuclear Weapons Numbers Continue to Rise, ICAN Reports**
The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) has announced that the number of nuclear weapons has increased, with 9,585 nuclear weapons in 2024 and 9,604 in 2025. This is equivalent to a small fraction more than the 146,500 bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, killing 140,000 people. The report states that 40% of these weapons are deployed, with some on submarines, land-based missiles, and bombers. Despite the decrease in the total number of nuclear warheads since the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) was adopted in 2017, the number of usable warheads has increased steadily since then, from 9,272 in 2017 to 9,272 in 2025. The report also highlights that Russia and North Korea have threatened to use nuclear weapons in violation of the TPNW. ICAN Executive Director Melissa Parke stated, 'It is time for nuclear-armed states and their nuclear-allying partners to give up their opposition to the TPNW and join the global majority.' Hans Kristensen, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, added, 'As countries modernize and in some cases increase their arsenals, we can expect this trend to continue unless there is a breakthrough in arms control and disarmament efforts.'
