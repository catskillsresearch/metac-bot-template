**Renewable Energies Surpass 40% of Global Electricity Production in 2024**
In 2024, more than 40% of the world's electricity came from low-carbon sources, according to the annual report of the think-tank Ember. This is a remarkable milestone, as it is the first time that the 40% threshold has been exceeded globally. The growth of low-carbon energies is largely driven by the growth of solar energy, which increased by 29% in 2024 compared to 2023. Solar energy now accounts for approximately 7% of the world's electricity production, double what it was just two years ago in 2022. China's massive investments in solar energy have made it the largest producer of solar energy, accounting for 39% of global solar production. In India, solar energy has doubled in just one year. This decoupling of electricity demand and fossil fuel consumption is a significant development, as it means that countries like China and India are no longer relying on fossil fuels to meet increasing electricity demand. In 2024, renewable energies covered 81% of the increase in electricity demand in China, and a similar decoupling is occurring in India. By 2030, India could potentially meet all of its increasing electricity demand with low-carbon energies. This is a positive development, as electricity demand is expected to continue growing in the coming years due to economic development, new uses such as artificial intelligence, and the electrification of transportation. 'It's a good news, because we know that electricity demand will continue to grow in the coming years,' said an expert. The mix of energy sources should not be confused with the mix of electricity production, as the two are often confused. For example, France's electricity production is largely decarbonized due to its nuclear power plants, but the country still relies heavily on fossil fuels for heating and transportation. One way to reduce fossil fuel consumption is to electrify transportation and heating through electric vehicles and heat pumps. However, if the electricity is produced from fossil fuels, it is a step backward. It is therefore a positive development that the increase in demand is being met by renewable energies. In the United States, renewable energies generated more electricity than coal for the first time in 2024, with Texas being the leading state in renewable energy development. In Europe, solar energy also surpassed coal for the first time in 2024. China is also starting to export solar panels to Africa, which is essential, as there were almost as many solar panels in Belgium as on the entire African continent in 2024. It's not just solar energy. There's also hydroelectric energy, which accounts for 14% of the global electricity mix, and wind energy, which continues to grow and accounts for 8% of production, and of course nuclear energy, which is not considered a renewable energy but is a low-carbon energy. Nuclear energy accounts for 9% of the global electricity mix, but its share is decreasing. It means that if we want to cross the 50% threshold of decarbonized electricity this year, we will have to make a big effort and lower the prices of low-carbon energies. But the European example shows that it is possible: in the European Union, more than 70% of the electricity mix is decarbonized.

**Renewable Energy Sources Exceed 40% of Global Electricity Production for the First Time**
Renewable energy sources have exceeded 40% of global electricity production for the first time in 1940, according to the 'Global Electricity Review' report by the International Energy Think Tank Ember. The report analyzes the changes and developments in the global electricity sector in 2024, based on country-specific data. Renewable energy sources have increased electricity production by 858 terawatt-hours, a record high. Solar energy has increased by 474 terawatt-hours (29%) compared to the previous year and has become the largest contributor to clean energy production for the third consecutive year. As a result, solar energy's share of global electricity production has reached 6.9%. The growth in solar energy production was driven by China, where the country's clean energy production increased by 81% of the country's electricity demand. India has also seen a significant increase in electricity production capacity, with a two-fold increase in 2024 compared to 2023. Wind energy has increased to 8.1% of global electricity production, while hydroelectric power has remained at 14.3%. Nuclear energy has accounted for 9% of global electricity production, and other renewable energy sources have accounted for 2.6%. As a result, clean energy sources, including renewable energy and nuclear, have accounted for 40.9% of global electricity production. Despite the rapid growth in renewable energy, fossil fuels have seen a limited increase in electricity production, with a 1.4% increase in 2024. The growth in electricity demand, which was 4%, has driven the increase in fossil fuel use. The increase in fossil fuel use has led to a 1.6% increase in electricity sector emissions, the highest level on record. However, if it were not for the extreme heatwaves and increased air conditioning usage in 2024, the growth in fossil fuel use would have been limited to 0.2%. The report also notes that technologies such as artificial intelligence, data centers, electric vehicles, and heat pumps have contributed to the increase in electricity demand, accounting for 0.7% of the total increase. The report predicts that the growth in clean energy production will surpass the growth in electricity demand in the coming years, leading to a permanent decline in fossil fuel use. According to the report, the expected growth in clean energy production will be sufficient to meet the 4.1% increase in electricity demand by 2030. The report also notes that the development of new technologies, as well as the changes in electricity production in countries such as China and India, will be crucial in shaping the global electricity outlook.

However, the growth in renewable energy use will pose new sustainability challenges, particularly in managing waste from equipment nearing the end of its useful life. For example, many wind turbines installed in the 1990s and early 2000s are approaching the end of their lifespan. While most turbine components can be recycled, their blades are often expensive to dispose of and may end up in landfills or incinerators, posing a significant environmental challenge. By 2050, the world is expected to face a massive amount of waste from renewable energy sources, with an estimated 78 million tons of solar panel waste and 43 million tons of wind turbine blade waste.

**Agriculture's Renewable Energy Contribution to Reach 22% by 2030**
According to the first report of the Confagricoltura Observatory on agroenergies, supported by Enel, the contribution of agriculture to the production of renewable electricity in Italy is 11%, achieved through 48,000 installations and a capacity of 5 GW, with a production of 13 TWh. By 2030, the prospects estimate that the share of renewable energy from agriculture could reach 22% if all land is included, not just agricultural land. 'The Observatory on renewable energies and especially renewable energies from agricultural sources is a moment to take stock of where we are and especially on the prospects,' said Massimiliano Giansanti, president of Confagricoltura. 'Today, green energy production is a great wealth for the country, we contribute almost 5 GW to electricity production, and I remember that we can give up everything except eating and having energy, so today agriculture, an integral part of renewable energy production, is fundamental to the country's strategic assets, both in the function of primary goods and in electricity production.'
