**Magnificent 7 Trades at Seven-Year Low Valuation**
Goldman Sachs' analysis suggests that the 'Magnificent 7' tech companies (Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and others) are trading at a modest discount to their fundamental value, despite concerns around AI spending, trade-policy uncertainty, and antitrust lawsuits. The group's financial health and growth outlook remain robust, with average analyst earnings upgrades outpacing the broader market. However, regulatory and competitive risks, such as ongoing antitrust probes and competitive headlines, may cast a shadow on the group. As a result, investor focus is likely to oscillate between AI-driven upside potential and regulatory overhang, setting up a volatile but opportunity-rich environment for tech-heavy portfolios.

**Magnificent 7 Stocks Shift Toward Stability and Selective Growth**
The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, consisting of Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, and NVIDIA, are staging a comeback after a period of volatility. This group of dominant tech-oriented companies has become pillars of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100. The comeback story starts with a recent bout of volatility triggered by new U.S. trade tariffs, which led to a sharp market correction and a 20% drop in some stocks. However, a sharp rebound followed once the market absorbed the shock and capital stepped in to meet margin calls. Now, the price action shows signs of resilience, with Microsoft trading at 96% of its 52-week high. One key theme in this rebound is divergence, with not all stocks recovering at the same pace. Investors appear to be distinguishing between stability-driven leaders and high-volatility growth names. Microsoft and Apple fall squarely into the former category, while Alphabet and Meta offer similar defensiveness. Amazon.com Inc. also deserves mention as it bridges both defensive and growth characteristics. Analysts have taken note, with many revising price targets upward, highlighting its balanced exposure to growth and resilience.

**The New Leaders of the S&P 500: NRG Energy, Palantir, and Howmet Aerospace**
The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, and others, have lost their dominance in the market. In the past five months, their prices have fallen, with Apple down 18.6%, Tesla down 27.4%, and Alphabet down 3.3%. Although Meta and Nvidia have experienced strong rebounds since their annual lows, their crown is no longer shining as brightly. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which groups these stocks, has risen 18% since April, but this is no longer enough. The market has expanded its focus and now applauds other names. In this volatile 2025, the leaders are not the stars of artificial intelligence (AI), but rather less well-known names with consistent and impressive results. NRG Energy has become an unexpected star, with a 71% increase in its stock price, driven by its acquisition of a energy portfolio and a 16% growth in its quarterly earnings. Palantir Technologies has also risen 68%, becoming a certainty after being a promise. The company's software for 'strategic AI' that simulates conflicts in the South China Sea is a real competitive advantage. Howmet Aerospace has added 46% in 2025, thanks to the surge in military demand. The company manufactures key parts for fighter jets, rockets, and turbines, including components for the F-35 and the future NASA lunar rocket. Uber Technologies has surprised everyone with a 45% revaluation, having finally found stability in transportation, deliveries, and logistics, and has attracted investor Bill Ackman, who has bet $2.2 billion. Super Micro Computer has risen 42%, representing the physical muscle of the AI revolution. Its servers are the material support for intelligent processing, fueled by strategic agreements such as the one signed with DataVolt. Mosaic has burst onto the scene with a 42% increase, in a context of agricultural inflation and tension over global food supply. Its new automated plant in Brazil will operate without human personnel, managed entirely by algorithms. The fertilizers also trade in the digital era. The famous tobacco company completes this new podium of seven companies, with a 40% increase. Its star product, ZYN, has skyrocketed sales in the US by 53%. Such success has led the company to consider spinning off this business, free of combustion, in 2026. Tobacco, yes, but reinvented.

**Forget the Magnificent 7 - Here Are the Real 10X Plays**
The market is experiencing a surge in speculative interest, driven by traders who are betting on the potential of stocks rather than their current fundamentals. This is evident in the performance of Palantir, which is considered overbought by traditional valuation metrics but continues to attract buyers. The return of speculation is bullish for the market, and traders are now focusing on the 'Speculative Seven' stocks, which have the potential to deliver 10X returns. These stocks include SOUN, RGTI, QBTS, IONQ, SMR, ACHR, and NNE. The Russell 2000 index, which tends to lag in bear markets and lead in recoveries, is up nearly 20% since the April 9 bottom, and is a key signal for the market's direction. Investors should remain cautiously bullish or focus on short-term trading until small caps start leading with conviction.

**Tech Declines, But Still Sharply Higher For May - Tech Roundup**
Technology shares declined slightly, but remain significantly higher for May so far. The Magnificent Seven, a group of large tech companies, lagged the broad market in April, but investors have returned to the group in May, according to J.D. Joyce, president of Joyce Wealth Management. Meanwhile, Sanmina agreed to purchase ZT Systems' data-center infrastructure manufacturing business from Advanced Micro Devices for up to $3 billion.

**JPMorgan Downgrades Netflix Despite Increasing Target Price**
JPMorgan has downgraded Netflix from 'overweight' to 'neutral', despite increasing the stock's target price to $1,220. The company's stock price has risen by over 33% in 2025, outperforming the broader S&P 500 Movies & Entertainment Index. Analysts say that the strong stock price gains have likely reflected a significant portion of the company's upward potential, which is included in its earnings forecast for 2025. As a result, they see few short-term catalysts that could drive the stock price significantly higher. The company's stability in an uncertain market has made it a preferred choice among investors seeking stability. According to LSEG data, the average rating from 51 analysts is 'buy' with a median target price of $1,150. However, concerns about the valuation have arisen, with the stock trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 43, which is higher than the S&P 500's ratio of 21 and even the 'Magnificent Seven' group of technology giants, which averages 27. Ben James, a strategist at Baillie Gifford, said that the transformation of the stock from a speculative content provider to a profitable company has justified its valuation. The company is optimistic that its operating margins will nearly double to 50% by 2030.

**JPMorgan Downgrades Netflix Despite Attractive Position as Safe Haven**
JPMorgan has downgraded Netflix from 'overweight' to 'neutral' despite the company's attractive position as a safe haven. The reason for the downgrade is the company's high valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio of around 43 times its future earnings. This is higher than the S&P 500's multiple of 21 and even the 'Magnificent Seven' group of tech giants, which has an average multiple of 27. According to data from LSEG, the average rating of 51 Netflix analysts is a 'buy' with a median PT of $1,150. However, the company's high valuation has raised concerns among analysts, who say that the stock's recent gains may have been driven by a large part of the upside already being priced in. As a result, they see limited short-term catalysts to drive the stock significantly higher. Despite this, many investors remain focused on the company's long-term story, which is that Netflix will continue to shape the future of global entertainment.

**Mag 7 Stocks Tracking Second-Largest Daily Gain in Market Value**
The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, consisting of Apple, Amazon.com, Tesla, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, were on track to add $821 billion in market cap on Monday, according to Dow Jones Market Data. This would be their second-largest one-day market cap gain, following a $1.85 trillion increase on April 9, 2024, when President Donald Trump paused 'reciprocal tariffs' beyond 10% for 90 days. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which tracks the group, rose 5.6% to $50.58, its highest close since February 28, and is now only down 13% from its December 17 record close.

**Magnificent 7 earnings under the microscope as big tech deals with tariffs, AI bets, and market sentiments**
The Magnificent 7 tech firms, including Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Tesla, and Nvidia, are set to report their earnings this week, with Microsoft and Meta reporting on Wednesday and Amazon and Apple reporting on Thursday. The underperformance of these stocks since their peak in February 2025 is raising concerns among investors. Alphabet reported a $30.6 billion operating income for the first quarter, exceeding Wall Street's prediction of $28.7 billion. However, Elon Musk's Tesla posted disappointing first-quarter numbers, including a 71% drop in net profits. Investors will be watching if these companies will invest tens of billions of dollars in the race for artificial intelligence despite the unstable economic climate. According to Jay Woods, Chief Global Strategist, Freedom Capital Markets, 'Considering we are dealing with the top market caps in the world, their price impact will move the markets.'

The 'Magnificent Seven' US tech megacaps have lost nearly $2 trillion in value since April 2, when President Donald Trump announced tariffs. However, after Trump paused the tariffs for 90 days, the stocks gained $1.5 trillion in market value. Despite this, the companies have collectively lost $3.4 trillion in value since their peak in late 2024, with $2 trillion of those losses coming since last week. Investors are buying back the stocks, whose valuations had reached 'stratospheric levels' as the companies invested billions in artificial-intelligence infrastructure.

**The 'Magnificent Seven' Tech Companies Suffer $2.32 Trillion Loss in Q1 2025**
The 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, NVIDIA, and Alphabet, have lost a combined $2.32 trillion in market capitalization during the first quarter of 2025. According to the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, the companies' stock prices have dropped by 13.4% to 47.13 units. NVIDIA, the leading developer of AI chips, has lost $594.514 billion, with its stock price falling 17.77% to $110.38. Apple, the manufacturer of iPhones, has lost $422.012 billion, with its stock price dropping 10.5% to $157.04. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has lost $399.208 billion, with its stock price falling 19.95% to $157.07. Tesla, the electric vehicle manufacturer, has lost $386.848 billion, with its stock price dropping 29.98% to $282.67. Microsoft, the software developer, has lost $292.980 billion, with its stock price falling 9.16% to $382.14. Amazon, the e-commerce platform, has lost $229.627 billion, with its stock price dropping 10.66% to $196.01. Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, is the only company in the group to show a slight gain, with a $1.367 billion increase in market capitalization and a 0.18% increase in stock price to $583.95. Analysts from Monex Casa de Bolsa attribute the decline to a cautious investor attitude towards US markets, economic, commercial, and corporate risks, and the impact of the US-China trade tensions and the potential reduction of corporate taxes by President Donald Trump. 'In 2025, investors have shown a cautious attitude towards US markets, with certain periods of recovery; however, there persists a view of greater risk on economic, commercial, and corporate issues,' they wrote. 'Factors such as a lower global economic growth, commercial challenges that will modify various sectors and industries, and changes in the Fed's vision, in the face of the commercial landscape, will affect the behavior of the stocks.'

The total market capitalization of the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants has shown a volatile trend from January 2024 to March 2025. Despite a recent $430 billion rebound, the companies are still down a significant $2.2 trillion from their February peak, with the total market cap sitting at $15.5 trillion as of March 14, 2025. The data illustrates fluctuating values, marked by sharp peaks and troughs, emphasizing the inherent volatility in the tech sector.

**Seven Magnificents Face Uncertain Environment Amid Correction**
The recent correction in the US market has put the spotlight back on the 'Seven Magnificents', a group of large-cap technology companies that led the bull market of the last two years, but now face an uncertain environment marked by political tensions, macroeconomic volatility, and new operational challenges. As the S&P 500 has fallen over 10% since its February highs, some investors wonder if this correction represents an entry opportunity or if it anticipates a deeper deterioration in the market. The correction has been particularly severe in the technology sector, with the Nasdaq 100 index falling 1.9% in the last session, accumulating a loss of over 13% in the last four weeks. Microsoft reported a 12% increase in revenue, driven mainly by its intelligent cloud business, where Azure grew 31%. The company's operating profit grew 17% year-over-year, although it acknowledged challenges outside of its artificial intelligence business. Amazon's results were also solid, with the company achieving $187.8 billion in revenue, a 10% increase from the same period last year. AWS, its cloud business, grew 19%, while total operating profit increased 60%, benefiting from logistics improvements and greater automation. Alphabet showed growth in both its advertising platforms and Google Cloud, which grew 30%. However, limited infrastructure capacity hindered some of its expansion. In response, the company announced that it will significantly increase its investment in 2025 to meet the growing demand for AI solutions, although it acknowledged that this could impact its margins in the short term. Tesla faced a more complex quarter, affected by the slowdown in its automotive business. Vehicle sales fell 8%, and operating profit retreated 23%. However, the energy and services segments showed growth of 113% and 31%, respectively. In its 2025 guidance, the company anticipates a recovery driven by new models and advances in autonomous driving, as well as a 50% increase in energy storage. Elon Musk confirmed that the production of the humanoid robot Optimus will begin this year for internal use, with plans for commercialization in 2026.

**Tesla: The Only Magnificent Seven Stock In Freefall - Can It Reverse Course? - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)**
Tesla is the worst-performing stock among the 'Magnificent Seven' in 2025, down 25.66% year-to-date. The company's forward P/E ratio of 95.24 is sky-high compared to the rest of the group, and its trailing P/E ratio of 138.21 suggests investors are still pricing in significant future growth despite the stock's pullback. Tesla's revenue growth of 11.44% lags behind Nvidia's 59.26% and Meta's 16.69%, and its market cap of $894.84 billion is a far cry from its trillion-dollar days. Technical indicators suggest continued weakness, with the stock trading below its five-day, 20-day, and 50-day exponential moving averages. However, the 200-day SMA at $278.70 offers a potential long-term support level. As the only MAG 7 stock firmly in the red for 2025, investors will decide whether Tesla's recent freefall is an overreaction or a sign of deeper trouble.
