**World Bank Intensifies Discussions on Lebanon's Reconstruction**
The World Bank has intensified its discussions with Lebanese officials regarding the reconstruction of Lebanon, following the devastating Israeli attack on the southern suburbs of Beirut on November 26, 2024. The World Bank's regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, Jean-Christophe Carrière, led a delegation that met with the Lebanese Finance Minister, Yassin Jaber, to discuss the preparations for launching the 'Lebanon Emergency Assistance Project' (LEAP). The project aims to establish a special financial fund under the World Bank's supervision, which will attract funding from donor countries, international and Arab institutions to support Lebanon's reconstruction efforts after the extensive damage caused to its infrastructure during the multiple crises, particularly after the recent war. Jaber stated that the meeting discussed 'the technical and administrative issues related to the fund's mechanisms, as well as the legal rules governing it, which ensure the highest standards of transparency and accountability, enhancing the confidence of donors and financiers and ensuring the optimal use of resources in targeted sectors.' Jaber added that invitations will be sent to ambassadors of donor countries, as well as representatives of international and Arab financing institutions, to hold a broader meeting in Beirut on June 10 to present the project in detail and explain its objectives and operational mechanisms. He expressed optimism about the progress, saying that 'the start looks promising and free of obstacles, in light of positive indicators on Lebanon's restoration of confidence with the international community, resulting from a series of reform laws passed by the government and approved by Parliament in recent times.' He pointed out that 'the meetings related to the project will intensify in the coming period, including all concerned parties from local and international ministries and institutions, to ensure a participatory and integrated approach that enhances the chances of success and good resource utilization.' The move related to the LEAP project comes at a time when the international community is showing renewed interest in supporting Lebanon, but with clear conditions related to the implementation of institutional and financial reforms. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently announced that the progress in talks with Lebanon is still 'slow', despite the agreement on the level of staff that was signed in 2022, highlighting the urgent need to implement financial and monetary laws and regulate the banking sector.

**Lebanon's Economy Stabilizes Amid Ongoing Challenges**
The price of the US dollar against the Lebanese pound has stabilized on Thursday, May 29, 2025, according to the exchange rate and parallel market bulletin. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) estimated that Lebanon's real GDP will contract by 5.7% in 2024, due to the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah, which has led to a large-scale displacement of people, significant damage to infrastructure and physical capital, and a need for reconstruction financing of around $11 billion. The report reduced its economic growth expectations for Lebanon to 1.9% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026, compared to previous expectations of 2% and 3% for the same years. The report considered the formation of the new government to have reduced political obstacles to implementing essential economic reforms, and noted that the appointment of a new governor of the Central Bank of Lebanon and the renewed interest in reaching an agreement with the International Monetary Fund are positive developments in the economic recovery process. The report emphasized that progress in files such as the restructuring of the banking sector remains crucial for reaching a final agreement with the IMF, restoring international market confidence, and enabling foreign financing and investment opportunities. According to the report, the economic growth rate in the South and East Mediterranean region is expected to be 3.6% in 2024 and 3.9% in 2025, while the growth rates in the bank's member countries are expected to be 3% in 2025 and 3.4% in 2026. The report also noted that the local indicators continue to show a decline in inflation rates with a stable exchange rate, with an annual rate of 15.6% in February 2025. The report warned of risks threatening the economic scene, including the possibility of the resumption of military operations in the Middle East, the delay in the launch of the reconstruction process, and the potential return of political deadlock. The exchange rate of the Lebanese pound against the dollar in the black market remained stable at levels between 89,600 and 89,700 pounds per dollar, supported by a continuous increase in the Central Bank of Lebanon's foreign exchange reserves, which reached around $40.4 billion in mid-May, compared to $34.2 billion at the end of 2024. The increase in gold reserves, valued at $5.2 billion since the beginning of the year, due to the rise in global gold prices, is the main reason for this increase. The dollar was stable at 89,500 Lebanese pounds on the exchange platform, according to the Central Bank of Lebanon's website. 'The formation of the new government has reduced political obstacles to implementing essential economic reforms,' said the report. 'The appointment of a new governor of the Central Bank of Lebanon and the renewed interest in reaching an agreement with the International Monetary Fund are positive developments in the economic recovery process.'

**Lebanon's Economy Stabilizes Amid Ongoing Challenges**
The price of the US dollar against the Lebanese pound has stabilized on Thursday, May 29, 2025, according to the exchange rate and parallel market bulletin. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) estimated that Lebanon's real GDP will contract by 5.7% in 2024, due to the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah, which has led to a large-scale displacement of people, significant damage to infrastructure and physical capital, and a need for reconstruction financing of around $11 billion. The report reduced its economic growth expectations for Lebanon to 1.9% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026, compared to previous expectations of 2% and 3% for the same years. The report considered the formation of the new government to have reduced political obstacles to implementing essential economic reforms, and noted that the appointment of a new governor of the Central Bank of Lebanon and the renewed interest in reaching an agreement with the International Monetary Fund are positive developments in the economic recovery process. The report emphasized that progress in files such as the restructuring of the banking sector remains crucial for reaching a final agreement with the IMF, restoring international market confidence, and enabling foreign financing and investment opportunities. According to the report, the economic growth rate in the South and East Mediterranean region is expected to be 3.6% in 2024 and 3.9% in 2025, while the growth rates in the bank's member countries are expected to be 3% in 2025 and 3.4% in 2026. The report also noted that the local indicators continue to show a decline in inflation rates with a stable exchange rate, with an annual rate of 15.6% in February 2025. The report warned of risks threatening the economic scene, including the possibility of the resumption of military operations in the Middle East, the delay in the launch of the reconstruction process, and the potential return of political deadlock. The exchange rate of the Lebanese pound against the dollar in the black market remained stable at levels between 89,600 and 89,700 pounds per dollar, supported by a continuous increase in the Central Bank of Lebanon's foreign exchange reserves, which reached around $40.4 billion in mid-May, compared to $34.2 billion at the end of 2024. The increase in gold reserves, valued at $5.2 billion since the beginning of the year, due to the rise in global gold prices, is the main reason for this increase. The dollar was stable at 89,500 Lebanese pounds on the exchange platform, according to the Central Bank of Lebanon's website. 'The formation of the new government has reduced political obstacles to implementing essential economic reforms,' said the report. 'The appointment of a new governor of the Central Bank of Lebanon and the renewed interest in reaching an agreement with the International Monetary Fund are positive developments in the economic recovery process.'

**IMF Pressures Lebanon to Speed Up Financial Reforms**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is pressuring Lebanon to speed up its financial reforms, particularly after the country's new law on bank secrecy was approved. According to Finance Minister, the proposed law 'Reform of the Banking Sector in Lebanon and its Reorganization' is not new, but rather an updated version of a law presented by former Deputy Prime Minister Saad El-Din Al-Shami in November 2023 to the Council of Ministers. However, the IMF has expressed concerns about certain provisions in the law, including the composition of the 'Higher Banking Authority', which would be responsible for making decisions about banks. The IMF also opposes the idea of giving the judicial body the power to review decisions made by the Higher Banking Authority. The IMF's concerns have been met with skepticism by the Lebanese government, which has refused to take their recommendations into account. The IMF has warned that the proposed law could undermine the effectiveness of the reforms and hinder the country's progress.

**IMF Praises Egypt's Economic Progress, Calls for Tax Simplification**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced on Tuesday that Egypt has made progress towards economic stability, but still needs to simplify its tax and customs procedures and expand its tax base. A team from the IMF visited Egypt from May 6 to 18, as part of their fifth review of the $8 billion financial support agreement signed in March 2024. According to IMF Mission Chief, Vladka Holar, 'Egypt has made a tangible progress towards overall economic stability.' She added in a statement, 'We expect the growth to continue to improve, and we have raised our forecast for the fiscal year 2024-2025 to 3.8 percent, based on the results that exceeded expectations in the first half of the year.' A Reuters poll of 17 analysts last month also forecasted a 3.8 percent growth in the fiscal year 2024-2025, which began in July.

**Lebanon's Dollar Price Remains Stable Amid IMF Negotiations**
The price of the US dollar against the Lebanese pound remained stable on Friday, March 14, 2025, amidst calm trading in the official and parallel markets. A new round of negotiations between the Lebanese government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) delegation, led by Ernesto Ramírez Rigo, aimed to achieve progress towards a final agreement that would grant Lebanon a loan. According to financial expert Walid Abu Suleiman, 'The agreement signed in April 2022 serves as the basis for any new agreement, but it requires the implementation of reforms such as auditing the accounts of major banks, enacting capital control, unifying the exchange rate, and restructuring debt. The expansion of the 'cash economy' and Lebanon's accession to the gray list have added complexity to the scene, especially since the IMF emphasizes combating money laundering.' The IMF prioritizes debt sustainability over granting the loan and requires the implementation of reforms, including combating corruption, reducing tax evasion, and balancing the budget, which remains unrealistic, especially after the recent Israeli aggression and resulting losses. Regarding the proposal to 'wipe out deposits,' Abu Suleiman explained that it involves a fair distribution of losses according to a predetermined hierarchy, calling for auditing financial accounts to distinguish between suspicious and clean money. The possibility of Lebanon requesting an increase in the loan to $9 or $10 billion was discussed, but the IMF will not agree without significant reform steps, such as restructuring the public and banking sectors, combating customs and tax evasion.

Aoun pointed out that a 2025 budget was signed during the previous meeting and stressed the need to monitor public spending according to Article 118 of the Public Accounting Law.

Aoun emphasized the importance of reaching an agreement with the IMF before the summer, stressing that this path requires cooperation between all authorities and parties in the country to restore internal and external trust, which is a basic condition for economic reform. He also mentioned the IMF's demands, which include the appointment of a new Governor of the Central Bank and the establishment of a unified data center (data center) at the Ministry of Finance. The IMF delegation emphasized the need to pass two essential laws: a revised banking secrecy law and a law to restructure the banking sector, which is a crucial step in the process of reforming the banking sector and restoring confidence in the Lebanese financial system.

**Lebanon to Reach New Agreement with IMF**
Lebanese Finance Minister Yassin Jaber announced on Wednesday that there will be a new agreement between his country and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to a statement from the Ministry of Finance, the announcement came after a meeting between Jaber and the IMF delegation led by Ernesto Ramirez Rigo. Jaber described the meeting as 'good' and 'transparent'. Lebanon has been experiencing a severe economic crisis since 2019, when its financial system collapsed under the weight of state debt. The country failed to make payments in 2020 and ordinary depositors were denied access to their savings. In 2022, Beirut reached a draft 'financing agreement' with the IMF, but it was conditional on reforms that were not implemented. Jaber said, 'I expressed the government's commitment to implementing all necessary reforms. Not because anyone asked us to, but because the country needs these reforms.' He did not provide details of the agreement, but said the government is responsible for developing a new plan with the IMF. He added that the government has presented its priorities for the next phase to the IMF, including the appointment of a new governor for the Central Bank. Jaber said that the IMF will visit Lebanon again in early April if a new governor is appointed. Additional talks will be held with the IMF on Thursday in Lebanon.'

**Lebanon Expected to Negotiate New Agreement with IMF in Spring**
Lebanon's government, led by Prime Minister Najib Mikati, is expected to negotiate a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the coming spring. The agreement will be an extension of the previous agreement, with some modifications. According to Dr. Anis Bou Diab, an economic expert and member of the Economic and Social Council, the agreement will include the implementation of a new budget for 2024 and the preparation of a draft budget for 2025 that meets the IMF's requirements. The agreement will also include the establishment of a new fund to support the Lebanese economy, as well as the implementation of reforms to address the country's financial crisis. Bou Diab stated that the agreement will be a significant step towards resolving the country's financial crisis and will help to restore confidence in the Lebanese economy. However, the agreement will require the government to take responsibility for its financial obligations and to work with the IMF to implement the necessary reforms. The agreement will also include the establishment of a new mechanism for the distribution of losses among the banks and the government. Bou Diab emphasized that the agreement will not be a condition, but rather a requirement for Lebanon to access the IMF's funds. He also stated that the agreement will not include the cancellation of deposits, but rather a collaborative effort between the government and the banks to find a solution to the problem. The agreement will also include the establishment of a new capital control law, which will allow the government to control the flow of capital in and out of the country. Bou Diab concluded that the agreement will be a significant step towards resolving the country's financial crisis and will help to restore confidence in the Lebanese economy.

**EU Announces 500 Million Euros in Aid to Lebanon with Conditions**
The European Union has announced that it will provide 500 million euros in aid to Lebanon, but with conditions. The aid is conditional on the restructuring of the banking sector and reaching an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The EU had previously pledged 1 billion euros in aid to Lebanon in May 2023 to support the country in combating irregular migration to Europe. The EU's Commissioner for the Mediterranean, Dubravka Šuica, said that the 500 million euros had been approved in August 2023 and another 500 million euros will be released soon, but with certain conditions. The main condition is the restructuring of the banking sector and a good agreement with the IMF. Šuica said, 'When these conditions are met, we will of course continue the process of releasing the funds.' The international community has been calling on Lebanon to implement reforms to allow it to access billions of dollars to boost its economy after a financial crisis that began in 2019 due to poor management and corruption. Lebanon has been without a president for over two years, but a new president was elected in January 2024. The IMF has expressed its openness to an agreement with Lebanon on new loans after talks with the new finance minister, Yassine Jaber. Šuica also discussed with President Aoun a 'new Mediterranean Charter' which means 'we will start strategic partnership agreements with countries, including Lebanon', without providing further details. She also discussed with Aoun a ceasefire that ended a devastating war between Hezbollah and Israel, as well as support for the Lebanese army and the situation in neighboring Syria. Šuica will also meet with Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Speaker of the Parliament Nabih Berri during her visit, according to a statement from the EU.

**Lebanon to Begin Negotiations with IMF for New Economic Reform Program**
The Lebanese government has announced plans to begin negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to establish a new economic reform program. According to a statement, the government aims to create a 'state with effective governance and institutions', which requires a reorganization of the public sector based on a modern vision. The government plans to strengthen the economy by restructuring the banking sector, with the goal of enabling it to drive economic growth. The statement also highlights the importance of prioritizing deposits, through a comprehensive plan that meets international standards for protecting depositor rights. Lebanon has been facing a severe economic crisis since 2019, due to a collapse in its financial system caused by a large accumulation of public debt. The government agreed on a draft agreement with the IMF in 2022, which includes financial assistance, but it depends on the implementation of economic and financial reforms that the Lebanese authorities have not yet implemented. According to Finance Minister Yassin Jaber, a delegation from the IMF is expected to visit Lebanon in March. Jaber met with the IMF's representative in Lebanon, Frederico Leite, and emphasized that the government is committed to moving forward with reforms. The exchange rate of the Lebanese pound against the US dollar remained stable in both the official and parallel markets, while the government announced plans to begin negotiations with the IMF. The exchange rate of the dollar was fixed at 89,500 Lebanese pounds on the exchange platform, according to the Central Bank of Lebanon's website. The Central Bank's liquid foreign exchange reserves increased to $10.388 billion by the end of January 2025, up by $253 million during the month, and $1.815 billion since the new administration took over the Central Bank in July 2023.

**Lebanese Government to Negotiate New Program with IMF**
The Lebanese government announced that it will negotiate a new program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and work on addressing the country's financial crisis and public debt. According to the government's statement, the goal is to have a 'state that is effective in its administration and institutions', which requires restructuring the public sector according to a new vision. The government also emphasized the importance of reforming the banking sector to revive the economy and prioritizing depositors' rights. Additionally, the government aims to resume oil and gas exploration and establish a ministry for technology and artificial intelligence. Lebanon has been experiencing an economic crisis since 2019, when the financial system collapsed under the weight of massive public debt, leading to a delay in paying off sovereign debt in 2020 and freezing ordinary depositors' savings in the banking system. A draft agreement with the IMF was reached in 2022, but the required reforms were not implemented.
