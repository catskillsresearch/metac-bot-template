**Impact of 37.5-Hour Workweek on Various Sectors and Companies**
The proposed reduction of the working week to 37.5 hours, a key project promoted by the Ministry of Labor, is in its final stages of parliamentary approval. Despite maintaining salaries, the impact will not be uniform across all sectors. Those who will benefit are in areas such as commerce, hospitality, construction, and manufacturing, while employees in sectors like education, public administration, finance, and waste management will see little change, as their current average working hours are already below or around 37.5 hours. According to the legislative proposal's economic report, this reform will not affect all companies equally. For workers currently working 40 hours a week, the cost per hour could increase by up to 6.67%, but this represents only a fraction of the total. For the majority of private sector employees (14.5 million), the average cost per hour increase will be 2.21%. The CEOE-Cepyme has expressed concern about these potential economic effects and has requested caution in implementation to avoid a greater burden on companies. The Ministry of Labor, however, defends that this reduction should not directly increase business activity costs, and that it can be balanced through increased productivity. According to their estimates, the adjustment could be offset by a 56% increase in business margins since 2009 and a 36% increase since 2019. This reform will affect over 12.5 million workers, with a distribution of 6.8 million men and 5.7 million women, but the degree of impact will depend on the sector and company size.

**Colombia Implements 44-Hour Workweek for Private Sector Employees**
As of July 2025, all employees in the private sector in Colombia will work a reduced 44-hour workweek, in accordance with the 2021 Law 2101. This change is mandatory nationwide and does not imply a reduction in salary or impact on benefits. According to the Ministry of Labor, which will oversee compliance, companies that fail to implement the change or violate labor rights may face economic and legal sanctions. The reform aims to improve workers' quality of life without compromising their economic stability. As one expert noted, 'This new model can translate into greater commitment and efficiency from workers.' The law establishes a four-year plan to gradually reduce the workweek from 48 to 42 hours. The Colombian government expects this policy to promote better mental health, emotional well-being, and overall productivity in the long term.

**Yolanda Díaz Warns Companies Against Demanding Recovery of Lost Work Hours Due to Power Outage**
Spanish Vice President Yolanda Díaz has stated that it is 'completely illegal' for companies to ask employees to recover hours lost due to the power outage that occurred on October 28, 2023. Díaz reminded that the government modified labor legislation to regulate paid leave in the event of exceptional events, such as the power outage, so that employees do not have to recover lost work hours. The Minister of Labor has encouraged workers to defend their rights if their companies ask them to recover lost hours, suggesting they contact a union or file a complaint with the labor inspection or courts. Díaz also urged companies to respect current legislation. When asked about the negotiations to pass a law reducing the working week to 37.5 hours, Díaz replied that negotiations are ongoing and that she will not reveal any information until there is a development.

**Díaz Warns Companies Against Demanding Recovery of Lost Hours**
Spanish Vice President and Minister of Labor and Social Economy, Yolanda Díaz, stated that it is 'completely illegal' for companies to ask employees to recover hours lost due to the power outage that occurred in the Iberian Peninsula on October 28. Díaz reminded that the government made modifications to the regulations so that employees do not need to recover lost hours in cases of catastrophes like the Dana or events like the power outage. She encouraged workers to 'defend their rights' and report this situation to a union, the Labor Inspection, or the courts, as they will 'win the lawsuit'. Díaz also mentioned that negotiations for the project of law to reduce the maximum weekly working hours to 37.5 hours are ongoing, but she will not reveal any information until there is a new development. 'When we are negotiating, we need silence, and we are in that process, and when there are new developments, we will make it known', she concluded.

**Europe's Working Hours: A Country-by-Country Comparison**
According to a Eurostat report, the average working hours in Europe can vary by up to 8 hours from one country to another. The Netherlands has the lowest average working hours, with 32.1 hours per week, while Greece has the highest, with 39.8 hours per week. In Spain, the average working hours were 37.8 hours per week in 2024, exceeding the European average. The report attributes the low working hours in the Netherlands to the prevalence of part-time work. In contrast, Spain's labor market is characterized by long working hours and a high workload, especially in the private sector. The study also found that self-employed individuals work on average 4 hours more per week than salaried employees, with a significant difference in countries like Austria, Ireland, and Spain. The sector in which one works also affects the duration of the working hours, with agriculture and fishing having the longest working hours, and education, healthcare, and real estate services having the shortest.

**Spain to Reduce Working Hours to 37.5 Hours per Week**
The Spanish government, led by Labor Minister Yolanda Díaz, plans to reduce the working hours from 40 to 37.5 hours per week. This change will affect around 12 million workers in the hospitality, commerce, and agriculture sectors. The goal is to implement this measure before the end of the year. According to Díaz, 'we can continue working 40 hours some weeks and others maybe work 30, and the average will be those 37.5 hours.' Employers will have until the end of the year to adapt to the new schedule. Workers will not see a reduction in their salary, but rather an adjustment proportional to the new working hours. For example, if a worker previously worked 20 hours a week, they will now represent 53.3% of a full 40-hour week, potentially leading to a slight increase in pay.

**Elderly Farmworkers Fired in San Quintín, Mexico**
Rodolfo Gálvez León, leader of Jornaleros Unidos, reported that elderly farmworkers in San Quintín, BC, have been fired from agricultural ranches due to companies seeking younger workers for higher productivity. 'In recent weeks, they have fired workers over 50 years old because they no longer produce, they are constantly looking for workers of a certain age with more capacity,' he said. Gálvez León lamented the situation, as most of the affected are people of limited resources living day-to-day and who, after many years of dedicating their lives to farming, are now unable to find work elsewhere. He added that the work in the fields is physically demanding and companies are trying to save costs by hiring workers who can produce more. 'We have attended cases in San Vicente, which belongs to the municipality of Ensenada, and an average of three complaints per week, sometimes the person who wants to complain tells me that they know of others in the same situation,' he said. Gálvez León also noted that farmworkers work longer hours than those in maquiladoras or businesses, with some working up to 13-15 hours a day, including travel time.

**Switzerland: Working hours decrease by 8 minutes in 2024**
According to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (UST), in 2024, the average working time in Switzerland was 40 hours and 4 minutes per week, which is 8 minutes less than the previous year. Over the past five years, the decline has been 50 minutes. The effective working time is calculated by adding overtime (37 minutes) to the contractual working time (41 hours and 47 minutes) and subtracting absences (2 hours and 20 minutes). It's worth noting that absences have increased by 31 minutes over the past five years. In 2024, employees aged 20-49 had an average of 5.0 weeks of vacation, compared to 5.5 weeks for those aged 15-19 and 5.6 weeks for those aged 50-64. Compared to five years ago, vacations have increased by 0.3 days, reaching 5.2 weeks. The total number of hours worked by all employed people in Switzerland in 2024 was 8.2 billion, a 0.1% increase from the previous year. This increase is due to the growth in the number of jobs (+0.8%), which was almost entirely offset by a decline in the effective annual working time (-0.7%). In international comparisons, Switzerland has the shortest effective weekly working time for full-time employees, but when considering all employed people, the country is in the middle due to the high percentage of part-time workers.

**Spain's New Working Hours: What it Means for Vacation Time**
The Spanish government is planning to reduce the working hours from 40 to 37.5 hours per week, but this change will not affect the number of vacation days, which will remain at 22 days per year. However, some employees may see an increase in their time off due to the possibility of their employers being forced to compensate them for the excess hours worked. According to Sebastián Ramírez, a labor lawyer, 'Tu jefe te dará doce días más de vacaciones al año' (your boss will give you 12 more days of vacation per year). This will apply to employees who prefer to maintain their previous working hours, 40 hours per week. The measure still needs to be approved by the Congress of Deputies and may face possible amendments that could delay its implementation. The government aims to apply the reduction in working hours before the end of summer 2025, benefiting two large groups: workers not covered by collective agreements that already establish shorter working hours and employees of companies whose average annual working hours exceed 37.5 hours per week.

**Monreal: 'Hay que esperar el momento' para legislar la jornada laboral de 40 horas**
As the implementation of the 40-hour workweek for Mexican employees approaches, Ricardo Monreal, coordinator of the Morena parliamentary group and president of the Junta de Coordinación Política (Jucopo), emphasized the importance of waiting for the right moment to discuss and legislate the proposal. According to Monreal, 'there is no need to discredit anything or anyone. The time will come when we will discuss this proposal and all the proposals that come from economic sectors, unions, or labor organizations will be welcome.' The proposal aims to reduce the workweek from 48 to 40 hours, allowing workers to have more free time. Walmart has already begun to adapt to the new regulations. The reform has a deadline of 2030, but large companies must implement the measure with their employees by December 2025 and January 2026.

**US Non-Farm Employment Data Pushes Back Expectation of First Rate Cut in 2025**
The upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 6th is crucial, following the release of the April employment report last Friday. The report showed that the non-agricultural employment number was 177,000, lower than the revised 185,000 in March (employment data was revised down by 58,000 positions). Economists had previously expected 138,000. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2%, and average hourly earnings grew by 0.2% month-over-month, lower than the 0.3% in March. The ADP private sector employment data was disappointing, and the number of people applying for unemployment benefits increased significantly. The ISM manufacturing survey showed that factory activity continued to contract in April, and the first-quarter GDP data showed a 0.3% decline. The FOMC is expected to maintain its current interest rate of 4.25-4.5% after the meeting, as the healthy growth of 177,000 non-agricultural employment and stable unemployment rate have alleviated concerns about an immediate rate cut. However, the market still expects a rate cut of nearly four times, each by 25 basis points, by December, according to LSEG data. The strong employment report has pushed back the expectation of the first rate cut in 2025 to July, with the probability of a rate cut at the June 18th FOMC meeting decreasing to 31.8% from 50.4% before the report. The probability of a rate cut at the July 30th FOMC meeting has increased to 57% from 47% before the report. Market participants generally expect a 25 basis point rate cut in the next two months, bringing the federal funds rate from the current 4.25-4.50% to 4-4.25%. We will wait for the FOMC's statement after this week's meeting to see if the probability of a rate cut in July will increase further.
