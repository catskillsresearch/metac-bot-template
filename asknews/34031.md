**Similarities in media coverage of viral moments in Washington draw scrutiny**
The media landscape in Washington has shifted significantly, with increased competition for attention and shifting incentives to gain it. This has led to a 'herd mentality' in the press, where outlets prioritize delivering what their audience wants, rather than objective reporting. According to Alison Dagnes, a political science professor, 'With the media getting so big and so many places to get news, the reason for the kind of herd mentality of the press has to do with the really, totally shifting profit and financial incentives and the margins being slow and small.' The commonalities in coverage have been observed and analyzed well before social media, but its visibility has been exacerbated by the wide availability of content. Journalists try to frame things in a way that will land with an audience that doesn't pay much attention, leading to hyperbolic language and a focus on viral moments. This comes at a time with a White House and president known for being combative with reporters and major media outlets, highlighting a longstanding complaint from Republicans about a liberal bias and perceptions of partisanship in news coverage.

**'Unreasonable' tax audit of some Hong Kong media: Press union**
The Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) has accused the Hong Kong tax authorities of conducting 'unreasonable' tax audits on at least five local media outlets and multiple journalists. The HKJA claims that the audits were not based on sufficient evidence or reasonable grounds, with the tax department allegedly calculating non-existent income from before one of the outlets was founded. HKJA chairwoman Selina Cheng, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, said that she and her parents were also impacted by the audits. Hong Kong's press freedom ranking has plummeted since Beijing cracked down on dissent after the 2019 pro-democracy protests. In an annual survey, over 90% of journalists said that the city's press freedom was 'significantly' impacted by a domestic security law enacted in March 2024. China's Foreign Ministry has defended the security laws, stating that they target a 'very small number of individuals who severely endanger national security, not law-abiding media reporters'.

**HAC to Implement Drastic Measures to Clean Up Guinean Press**
Boubacar Yacine Diallo, president of the Haute Autorité de la Communication (HAC), has criticized certain journalists for lacking professionalism and self-proclaiming themselves as great chroniclers or investigative journalists without the necessary skills. Addressing media professionals on May 21, 2025, at the closing of the Forum on the Future of Guinean Press, Diallo first recalled his own experience in investigative journalism before pointing out practices he considers non-conformist to ethics and deontology. 'Some individuals self-proclaim themselves as great chroniclers and investigative journalists,' Diallo said. 'I have no qualms in telling them that I am one of those who initiated investigation in this country. The way they proceed is not investigation, it's not journalism, and they will not have a press card.' Diallo also announced drastic measures to clean up the profession. Starting July 1, 2025, the HAC will report to the relevant authorities and event organizers to ban anyone without a professional journalist's card from accessing events. 'We consider this the best way to clean up the profession,' Diallo said. 'This decision will be ratified by the college of commissioners, and as the law requires, we must comply. We have no choice.' He added that the press card is free and issued by the HAC, eliminating any excuse for not having one. 'No one has any more arguments.'

**Trump is 'done with whining' Republicans: reporter**
President Donald Trump summoned Speaker Mike Johnson and members of the House Freedom Caucus for a scolding, according to MSNBC host Katy Tur. NBC News Capitol Hill Correspondent Ryan Nobles revealed that there are still over 500 amendments to the House budget bill that must be voted on before the vote on the full bill. Nobles stated that some amendments are an 'effort by Democrats to message against this legislation,' but the real hold-up is that Mike Johnson doesn't have the votes. Trump has made it clear that he is 'done with whining' Republicans and wants them to vote yes as soon as possible. Rep. Andy Harris said that the leadership will 'have to figure out where we go from here.' Trump denied losing his patience with the members, saying 'That's a lie. Who told you I said I'm losing my patience?' Trump's goal is to have everything rolled into 'one, big, beautiful bill' that includes the budget, funding for his immigration and border security plan, and extending his 2017 tax cuts.

**Spanish Government Approves Measure to Censor and Revoke Press Credentials**
The Spanish government has approved a measure allowing the Congress to censor and revoke the press credentials of 'agitators' among journalists. Madrid's president, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, stated that all journalists are welcome in Madrid, saying, 'No expulsamos a ninguno ni los dejamos fuera por incómodas que sean sus preguntas' ('We don't expel any of them, nor do we leave them out because their questions are uncomfortable'). However, the PSOE party in Madrid responded by saying, 'Ayuso siempre en el lado incorrecto. Ahora apoyando a los agitadores que boicotean el trabajo de los periodistas' ('Ayuso is always on the wrong side. Now supporting the agitators who boycott the work of journalists'). This move comes after the government approved a measure allowing the Congress to revoke press credentials based on criteria such as respect for the right to truthful information and the proper functioning of the chamber.

**Guinea's National Forum for the Future of Journalism: A Platform for Discussion and Reform**
The National Forum for the Future of Journalism in Guinea has begun in Conakry, the capital of Guinea. The forum, organized by the Higher Council for Communication, aims to discuss the future of journalism in the country, identify the challenges faced by journalists, and the relationship between the state and institutions working in the field. The forum, which will last for three days, was attended by the President of the National Transitional Council, General Mamadi Doumbouya, and the Prime Minister, Bah Oumarou, as well as several civil and military personalities. The forum will also feature guests from several African countries, including experts and specialists in the field of journalism from Morocco, Senegal, Gambia, Mali, and Côte d'Ivoire. In his opening speech, the President of the Higher Council for Communication, Yacine Diallo, said, 'This forum will serve as a platform to discuss the challenges related to the practice of journalism, which has unfortunately been infiltrated by those seeking to profit, and characterized by a lack of integrity... It is our responsibility to purify the sector, and restore respect and credibility.' The forum comes at a time when the Guinean press is facing significant challenges, including the tightening of restrictions on journalists. In his speech to the President of the Transitional Council, Yacine Diallo called on the Guinean judiciary to continue investigating the disappearance of journalist Habib Marouf Koura, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper 'Rivlatir', who was allegedly taken by security forces on December 3, 2024. The Guinean press is facing significant challenges, including the revocation of licenses for three media outlets, 'Fem', 'Espas', and 'Diguma', and the ban on four radio stations and a popular television channel, as reported by the Ministry of Information on May 22, 2024.

**Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson on Explosive Biden Book, Media Cover-Up, and Why The View Won't Have Them on Air**
CNN host Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson have co-authored a book, 'Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again', which explores former President Joe Biden's mental decline and the cover-ups surrounding it. The authors spoke with Mediaite editor Aidan McLaughlin about their book, which reveals that Biden's top advisers endeavored to conceal his declining mental state as he vied for a second term in office. The book also details how the media fell short in doing critical investigative journalism on the issue. Tapper and Thompson describe how Biden's performance at a June 2024 fundraiser, where he failed to recognize George Clooney, was a disturbing example of his decline. They also discuss how the White House took steps to hide Biden's decline from the public, including managing his debate performance and limiting his interactions with staff and cabinet members. The authors argue that Biden's decision-making was affected by his declining mental state, citing examples such as his inability to communicate effectively and his failure to make key decisions. They also suggest that if Biden had been 20 years younger, the administration would have been run differently, with more progressive policies being implemented. The book has been met with sharply divided reactions, with some Democrats defending Biden and others acknowledging the evidence of his decline. Tapper and Thompson have been invited to speak on Fox News, but not on The View, which they find perplexing.

**Hong Kong Journalists Denounce Unjustified Fiscal Audit**
Journalists in Hong Kong are denouncing an unjustified fiscal audit targeting 'online' media outlets, journalists, and some family members. According to the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA), the authorities have claimed that these individuals did not declare their income fully between 2017 and 2019, resulting in retroactive tax demands. Selina Cheng, HKJA president and former Wall Street Journal journalist, stated that the association, herself, and her parents were also affected. The targeted media outlets include Hong Kong Free Press, Inmedia, and The Witness, a news portal focused on judicial coverage. The Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department (IRD) assured that they followed legal procedures and that the actions do not target specific sectors, but declined to comment on individual cases. The HKJA's annual survey found that over 90% of journalists believe that Hong Kong's press freedom has been significantly impaired by the National Security Law, approved by the local parliament in March 2024, which punishes crimes such as espionage and foreign interference. This is the second such law imposed on the region, following a similar law imposed directly by Beijing in 2020.

**Guinea: One Year After Media Closures, Journalists Face Uncertain Future**
One year after the closure of private media outlets in Guinea, the situation for journalists remains concerning, according to Reporters without Borders (RSF). The country has dropped 25 places in the annual ranking of press freedom. In March 2024, Prime Minister Bah Oury justified the closure of these media outlets, stating, 'Those who refuse to go in the direction of change will disappear of their own accord.' He also told journalists, 'There is a space to be taken, but this space must correspond to a realization that the paradigms have changed.' However, RSF reports a unprecedented repression of the profession since Bah Oury took office, including the loss of over 700 jobs and a surge in 'aggressions, arbitrary arrests, and threats' against journalists. The year ended with the kidnapping of Habib Marouane Camara by gendarmes, who is still missing. Two months later, Information Minister Fana Soumah told journalists in Nzérékoré, 'We are not more powerful than the state. When the state wants to silence you, it will silence you. You can do nothing!'

**US Vice President Suggests Biased Reporters Will Be Treated Differently**
US Vice President J.D. Vance suggested that some journalists covering the White House under Trump are biased, possibly even 'Democratic Party propagandists,' and that the new government will closely monitor those who ask questions at press conferences. 'We really take very seriously who the reporters are who attend, because if you're a reporter, even if you have a left-leaning bias, we definitely want to answer your questions,' Vance told Sean Hannity of Fox News in an interview aired on Wednesday. 'If you're a Democratic Party propagandist, then we're going to treat you like a Democratic Party propagandist,' the Republican vice president said, without providing further details. Vance also praised White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, who made her debut in the press room this week. Leavitt announced that two seats next to her podium, usually occupied by White House staff, would be used by 'new media' journalists, instead of traditional media reporters who already have seats in the press room. 'Karoline received many representatives of new media, many young people who represent, I think, the vanguard of the media in this country... These are actually some of the people who drive the news in 2025 in the United States,' Vance said. Leavitt said that the Trump team plans to restore press credentials to over 400 individuals who, according to her, were 'incorrectly revoked' by the government of former President Joe Biden.

**‘Seat’s Taken’: Mainstream Media Gatekeepers Cling to Old Norms as Culture Shifts**
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt shook up the briefing room by designating two 'new media' seats and prioritizing calling on outlets snubbed by the Biden administration. This move was met with resistance from legacy media reporters who demanded that new media members leave their seats if legacy media reporters asked them to vacate what they claimed as their assigned spot. Natalie Winters, co-host of Steve Bannon's War Room, said there was an 'undercurrent' of mainstream media 'scoffing' at her presence, and accused them of covering up for President Biden's dereliction of duty. Leavitt announced plans to restore the revoked press credentials of 440 reporters and adapt the White House to the new media landscape of 2025. Former Daily Wire host Brett Cooper said 'young people are just hungry for independent voices' and that they don't want to hear from traditional pundits 24/7.

**White House Opens Doors To 'New Media', Allocates Seats To Influencers**
The Trump Administration has announced that it will allocate seats in the White House press briefing room to representatives from 'new media' outlets, including podcasters, social media influencers, and content creators. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, the youngest in history at 27 years old, invited independent journalists and creators to apply for White House press credentials through the newly launched website, whitehouse.gov/newmedia. Leavitt stated, 'It is crucial for our team to share President Trump's message widely and adapt the White House to the evolving media landscape of 2025.' She also revealed that a front-row seat in the briefing room, traditionally reserved for the press secretary's staff, will now be designated the 'New Media Seat.' The move marks a significant shift in the White House's approach to media engagement, reflecting the changing ways Americans access and consume news in the digital age. Leavitt emphasized the administration's commitment to the First Amendment, announcing plans to reinstate press passes for 440 journalists whose credentials were revoked under the previous administration. 'This White House strongly believes in the First Amendment, which is why we are working diligently to restore press passes to journalists who were wrongly denied access,' she explained.

**White House to open media access to podcasters, influencers**
The White House will now allow podcasters and social media influencers to apply for press credentials to cover the White House, according to new press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Leavitt stated, 'We welcome independent journalists, podcasters, social media influencers and content creators to apply for credentials to cover this White House.' The move aims to increase the number of journalists with White House access, and Leavitt cited a Gallup poll showing low trust in media in the United States, particularly among younger people. Credentials will be given to those who meet the White House's criteria and pass a Secret Service background check. The White House also intends to reinstate the credentials of about 440 journalists whose badges were 'wrongly revoked' by the Biden administration in 2023.

**White House to Allow Social Media Influencers to Attend Press Conferences**
The White House, under Donald Trump's administration, will allow social media influencers, podcasters, and bloggers to attend press conferences in the White House press room. According to Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, 'we welcome independent journalists, podcasters, 'influencers', and content creators and urge them to request credentials to cover this White House.' Leavitt referred to this group as 'new media voices.' The influencers will be seated in the lateral row of the press room, which is usually occupied by press assistants and other staff, and will be called 'the new media seat.' They will have the opportunity to ask questions to the press secretary, although any accredited journalist can attend the conferences on their feet. For Trump's second term, the Republican president will give the first question to BreitbartNews, a far-right media outlet, and Axios, instead of The Associated Press.

**White House Announces New Media Space in Press Room**
The White House announced that 'influencers', podcasters, bloggers, and representatives of new media will have a space in the White House press room. According to Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, this is to give a voice to new media outlets that produce informative content and are not currently represented in the press room. 'We will open this press room to new media voices that produce informative content and whose media are not represented in these seats. We welcome independent journalists, podcasters, 'influencers', and content creators and urge them to request credentials to cover this White House,' she announced. The new media outlets will be located in the side row of the press room, previously occupied by the secretary's assistants and other staff. This space will be called the 'new media seat.' The reorganization of the press room will not deprive the large US media of seats, but will provide new spaces for new media. The White House press room has 49 seats, all assigned to a specific medium. Having a seat facilitates the possibility of asking questions to the press secretary, although any journalist with credentials issued by the White House Press Office can attend the press conferences on foot. The first row is reserved for The Associated Press and correspondents from major TV networks such as NBC, Fox, CBS, ABC, and CNN. The second row is occupied by important newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and The New York Times, among others. Traditionally, The Associated Press asks the first question at the press conference. However, Leavitt noted that, as a reflection of the new times, in the first press conference of Donald Trump's second term, the first question would be for the journalists of Breitbart News, a far-right medium, and for the Axios portal. Additionally, the press secretary announced that the White House will restore the press credentials of the 440 journalists whose passes were revoked during the Joe Biden administration (2021-2025).

**Karoline Leavitt announces 'new media' seating at White House briefings**
In her first press briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the creation of a dedicated seating section for 'new media' journalists and said the Trump administration will restore the press credentials of 440 individuals that were 'wrongly revoked by the previous administration.' Leavitt criticized the media, saying 'it's essential to our team that we share President Trump's message everywhere and adapt this White House to the new media landscape in 2025.' She gave her first question to Mike Allen of Axios and said the White House will welcome applications for press credentials from nontraditional journalists, including creators on social media platforms like TikTok, podcasters and bloggers who are 'producing legitimate news content.' Leavitt also pushed back at Peter Alexander of NBC News, saying 'you're asking a hypothetical based on programs you can't even identify?' when he asked about some of the Trump administration's early actions regarding deportations and a decision by the White House to pause all grants and loans disbursed by the federal government.
