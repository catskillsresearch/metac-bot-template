**Trump Has Historic Opportunity to Stand with Steel Workers**
President Donald Trump has a historic opportunity to support the steel industry by backing Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, rather than Cleveland-Cliffs' bid. Cleveland-Cliffs has been idling plants and laying off workers, shedding over 2,700 jobs in recent months, while Nippon Steel has indicated it will preserve U.S. Steel's workforce, invest in American plants, and honor union collective bargaining agreements. As Mitchell Brown, a former Trump administration official, notes, 'President Trump has rightly prioritized manufacturing, reshoring, and supply chain security. But that mission demands discernment. Not every company that wraps itself in the flag deserves a blank check.' Brown argues that Nippon Steel has demonstrated a workable plan to grow American jobs, invest in U.S. infrastructure, and compete globally without slashing its way through the industrial heartland.

**United States Steel Shares Rise on Merger Progress**
United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) shares closed 2.5% higher after reports of progress in merger talks. Rohan Goswami from Semafor revealed that Takahiro Mori from Nippon Steel (TYO:5401) is scheduled to visit Washington next week for crucial meetings with government authorities about the merger with U.S. Steel, followed by a trip to Pennsylvania to meet with local union members. The potential acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel has been under scrutiny since its announcement in December 2023. The deal is currently under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), with concerns that it may be blocked due to national security implications. Despite the challenges, both parties are committed to moving forward with the deal, which is approaching the CFIUS and merger agreement deadlines in May and June, respectively. Investors seem to be responding to the latest developments with cautious optimism, as evidenced by the rise in U.S. Steel share prices. The merger talks are at a critical juncture, with representatives from the company planning to meet with key stakeholders, including local union members in Pennsylvania. The agenda in Washington, although still fluid, indicates a sense of urgency from both sides to advance the discussions. The acquisition, if successful, would mark a significant consolidation in the steel industry, potentially altering the competitive landscape. However, the complexity of the deal and the geopolitical considerations involved have created an atmosphere of uncertainty. The outcome of the CFIUS review will be crucial in determining whether the merger can proceed.

**US Steel and Nippon Merger: Should Investors Bet on It? | Investing.com**
The merger between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel is currently in a state of flux. Despite initial opposition from the Biden administration, the deal has seen a sentiment shift, with U.S. Steel's stock rebounding 60% from its 52-week low. Nippon Steel has agreed to acquire U.S. Steel at a 40% premium of $55 per share, with a deal valued at $14.1 billion. However, the Department of Justice and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) have raised national security concerns, leading to a deadlock. President Joe Biden has officially blocked the merger, but Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have filed lawsuits, stating that the ruling was unconstitutional. The Biden Administration has delayed enforcement until June 18, 2025. The deal's fate now depends on the U.S. Court of Appeals' ruling by June 18, 2025. Analysts have pointed out that the courts rarely rule against the CFUIS and Presidential decisions due to national security concerns. If the deal is restructured, there may be compromise, but political and union opposition remains fierce. As for the outcomes, Nippon could walk if the court ruled against the deal, opening up the potential for a merger with Cleveland Cliffs and Nucor, or the Trump administration's revised partial investment, or U.S. Steel going it alone.

**U.S. Steel and Nippon Merger: Should Investors Bet on It?**
The proposed merger between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel has been blocked by President Joe Biden, citing national security concerns. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have filed lawsuits against the U.S. government, claiming the ruling was unconstitutional. The Biden Administration has delayed enforcement of the executive order until June 18, 2025. Meanwhile, Cleveland Cliffs and Nucor have offered to buy U.S. Steel for $30 per share, which is lower than the $55 per share offered by Nippon Steel. The case is now in the U.S. Court of Appeals, and analysts believe that the courts rarely rule against the CFUIS and Presidential decisions. If the deal is restructured, there may be compromise, but political and union opposition remains fierce. The potential outcomes include Nippon Steel walking away, a merger with Cleveland Cliffs and Nucor, or U.S. Steel going it alone.

**US Steel Stock Falls as Trump Distance Himself from Nippon Steel Investment Talks**
US Steel's stock fell 1.9% on February 13, 2025, after US President Trump stated that the tariffs he implemented would save the company and that he would not support a deal where Japanese steelmaker Nippon Steel would invest in US Steel. When asked if he would still assist in negotiations between US Steel and Nippon Steel, Trump replied, 'I don't know.' Trump previously stated that Nippon Steel would not be able to acquire a majority stake in US Steel, effectively ending the current merger agreement. Trump commented, 'US Steel is now in a great position, thanks to the tariffs that I implemented, which have given the company a new path forward.' The US Steel stock price had been falling due to Trump's previous statements suggesting that the merger agreement was being abandoned.
