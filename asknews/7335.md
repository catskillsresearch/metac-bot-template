**Africa Francophone Countries See Decline in Press Freedom, According to RSF's 2025 Index**
The 2025 World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) shows a decline in press freedom globally. In Africa, the situation is particularly dire, with many countries experiencing a decline in their rankings. Togo fell from 113 to 121, while Benin dropped from 89 to 92. Cameroon also fell from 130 to 131. The report highlights the challenges faced by journalists in these countries, including economic vulnerability, aggressive taxation, and government control over advertising contracts. In some countries, such as Guinea, the transition to a military regime has led to a radical decline in press freedom, with journalists facing aggression, arbitrary arrests, and death threats. However, there are some positive notes, with Gabon and Senegal showing improvements in their rankings due to reforms and a commitment to press freedom.

**Young Americans' support for free speech declines sharply - UPI.com**
A recent report by The Future of Free Speech found that support for free speech among young Americans has declined sharply in recent years. In 2021, 71% of 18- to 34-year-olds said people should be allowed to insult the U.S. flag, but by 2024, that number had fallen to just 43% -- a 28-point drop. This decline is part of a broader shift in attitudes, with younger Americans becoming more hesitant to defend speech that offends minority groups or religious beliefs. Sociologist Jean Twenge has tracked changes in attitudes using data from the General Social Survey, which shows that Gen Z has reversed the trend of increasing support for free speech rights seen in previous generations. The report also found that young Americans may be drifting rightward politically, which may help explain changes in speech attitudes. Today's young Americans may be less likely to instinctively defend speech aligned with liberal or progressive causes, and are more likely to support regulating speech to prevent offense. This raises questions about whether these changes reflect a life-stage effect or a deeper generational shift.

**From defenders to skeptics: The sharp decline in young Americans' support for free speech**
A recent report by The Future of Free Speech found that young Americans are becoming increasingly skeptical of free speech. In 2021, 71% of 18- to 34-year-olds said people should be allowed to insult the U.S. flag, but by 2024, that number had fallen to 43%, a 28-point drop. Support for pro-LGBTQ+ speech declined by 20 percentage points, and tolerance for speech that offends religious beliefs fell by 14 points. Sociologist Jean Twenge has tracked changes in attitudes using data from the General Social Survey, which shows that Gen Z has reversed the trend of increasing support for free speech rights. The shift may be due to a political drift and cultural realignment, with young Americans becoming more conservative and less likely to instinctively defend speech aligned with liberal or progressive causes. The study found that younger Americans are especially hesitant to defend speech that offends minority groups, with only 47% saying such speech should be allowed. This raises questions about whether these changes reflect a life-stage effect or a deeper generational shift.

**1&1 Reports Decline in Earnings for Q1 2025**
1&1, a subsidiary of United Internet, reported a decline in earnings for the first quarter of 2025 due to increased costs for its mobile network. The company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) decreased by almost 15% to approximately €156 million, compared to the same period last year. The net profit per share was €0.27, a decline of almost 43% from the previous year. The company attributed the decline to higher depreciation costs, mainly due to the installation of more antenna locations. The revenue decreased by 0.6% to €1.019 billion, while service revenues remained stable. The number of customer contracts decreased by 40,000 to 16.35 million. 1&1 still expects a stable contract base and service revenue of around €3.3 billion for 2025, but the EBITDA is expected to decline by around 3.4% to approximately €571 million. The decline in operating profit is also due to the ongoing transition to Vodafone's network, which does not include the same type of one-time payments as the previous contract with Telefonica (O2).

**Key Interest Rate May Decrease to 19% by End of 2025**
According to 'Izvestia' citing expert forecasts, the key interest rate may decrease to 19% by the end of 2025. The first decrease may occur as early as summer. The Central Bank may start to ease monetary policy after the July 25 meeting, but it will do so gradually, not more than one percentage point at a time. Economist Pavel Biryukov from Gazprombank noted that decisions to lower the rate are possible only after receiving complete inflation statistics for April and May, expected in the summer. Senior analyst Igor Rapakhin from SberCIB Investment Research added that the situation is developing according to the 'soft landing' scenario with slowing inflation and a return of GDP growth to 1.5-2%. However, according to Natalya Milchakova, leading analyst at Freedom Finance Global, it is unlikely that annual inflation will reach the target 7% this year, as the current dynamics of consumer prices indicate a slow decline. The key interest rate was raised to 21% in October 2024 due to accelerating inflation, which, according to experts, has already exceeded 10% this year. The regulator maintains a high rate to curb price growth.

**Tamaulipas sees increase in internet access, decline in pay TV and radio**
According to the ENDUTIH 2024 report, the number of households in Tamaulipas with internet access increased to 74.9% (851,911 households), up from 73.2% in 2023 (821,573 households). The percentage of people using the internet also rose from 86.8% in 2023 to 87.7% in 2024. In contrast, the number of households with pay TV and radio decreased. Pay TV decreased from 34.6% of households in 2023 (388,441 households) to 29.6% in 2024 (337,215 households), while radio usage fell from 36% in 2023 (403,679 households) to 25.4% in 2024 (289,317 households). The report also found that 26.7% of households have smart devices, reflecting the growing adoption of technologies such as virtual assistants, security cameras, and connected appliances. Nationally, the trend is similar, with around 100 million Mexicans aged six and over having accessed the internet by the end of 2024, a 3% increase from 2023. Graciela Márquez Colin, president of the INEGI, noted that the agency is analyzing the methodology for the ENDUTIH study for the next year, given the process of extinction of the IFT. 'This survey had been co-financed with the INEGI and the IFT. We have been in conversations with the Digital Agency, but as the legislative process has not been completed, we now have a lifting financed exclusively by the INEGI for this year,' she said.

**The tech that defined the modern internet is changing, and Silicon Valley is finally admitting it**
Tech giants Apple, Google, and Meta are facing pressure as consumers shift away from their core products. Google search queries on Apple devices have decreased for the first time, and Meta's Facebook is seeing a decline in users sharing content with friends. Instead, users are turning to direct messages and AI chatbots. Apple's iPhone may also be at risk of losing favor in the next decade, according to an executive. The companies are adapting by investing in new technologies like smart glasses and AI, which they believe will be the next step in computing. 'The amount that people are sharing with friends on Facebook has been declining,' Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during an antitrust trial. 'Even the amount of new friends that people add... I think has been declining. But I don't know the exact numbers.' Google said it continues to see overall query growth in search, but market research firm Gartner estimated that search engine volume will drop 25% by 2026 as consumers gravitate toward AI tools.

**Brazil Makes Significant Leap in Press Freedom Ranking**
According to the Reporters Without Borders ranking, most countries experienced a decline in press freedom in 2025. However, Brazil made a significant leap of 47 positions, moving from 110th to 63rd place, due to its 'implacable' press defending democracy, particularly during the 'pernicious' administration of Jair Bolsonaro. The main factor contributing to the decline in the index is the poor economic environment. Physical attacks on journalists are the most visible attacks on press freedom. Despite the government's shortcomings and corruption, Brazil has a press that defends its citizens. Paulo Panossian notes that at least the press is there to defend the people.

**The Decline of Press Freedom: A Threat to the Travel and Tourism Industry**
The RSF World Press Freedom Index has reported a 'disturbing decline' in global press freedom, with the rise of technology giants like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft dominating the dissemination of information and contributing to the decline. The report states that these unregulated platforms absorb an increasingly large share of advertising revenue that would normally support journalism, with online advertising spending reaching $247.3 billion in 2024, a 14% increase from 2023. The report also highlights the concentration of media ownership, pressure from advertisers and sponsors, and limited or unclear public funding as major factors contributing to the decline of press freedom. The index shows a significant decline in press freedom in countries like the US, India, and Israel, with Israel being criticized for 'exterminating' journalists who report on the völkermörderischen bomb attacks and hunger campaign in Gaza. The report also notes that the concentration of media ownership is a major threat to media diversity, with data showing that media ownership is highly concentrated in 46 countries, including Russia, Hungary, and Georgia. The report concludes that the decline of press freedom has significant implications for the travel and tourism industry, which contributes to the problem by giving advertising revenue to technology giants and focusing on content creators, bloggers, and influencers who are not journalists.

**Global Freedom Declines for 19th Consecutive Year, According to Freedom House Report**
According to the Freedom House report, 'Libertad en el Mundo 2025', the world has seen a decline in freedom for the 19th consecutive year. The report ranked 210 countries in 2024, with 88 classified as 'free', 55 as 'partially free', and 67 as 'not free'. The top countries for freedom were Finland, Sweden, New Zealand, and Norway, while the bottom countries were North Korea, Eritrea, Turkmenistan, South Sudan, and Syria. In Latin America, Uruguay ranked 17th globally, followed by Chile (21), Argentina (52), Brazil (81), and Colombia (83). Venezuela was the only country in the region classified as 'not free', ranking 179th globally. The report noted that under Nicolás Maduro's regime, 'liberties have decreased precipitously' over the past 12 years. The report also highlighted threats to freedom, including violence from criminal groups and non-state actors, as well as concerns over human rights in countries like El Salvador and Honduras. However, the report also noted advancements in countries where citizens have successfully pushed back against authoritarianism, citing examples in Bangladesh, Senegal, and South Korea. As Freedom House stated, 'The events that took place in these countries last year demonstrated, and not for the first time, that ordinary citizens have the power to reject authoritarianism, protect free institutions, and demand accountability from their leaders.'

**Global freedom on decline, elections saw 'authoritarian efforts to restrict voters' choices': Freedom House**
According to a report by Freedom House, global freedom has declined, with elections in over 40% of countries and territories being marred by authoritarian efforts to restrict voters' choices. The report noted that candidates were targeted with assassination attempts or assaults, polling places were attacked, or postelection protests were suppressed with disproportionate force. However, the report also highlighted bright spots, such as the return of elections to Jammu and Kashmir, which resulted in a change of status from 'Not Free' to 'Partly Free'. The report emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary in democracy and noted that elected leaders have increasingly used tactics to weaken judicial independence. In India, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sought to gain more influence over judicial appointments, leading to a backlog of cases and a decline in political rights and civil liberties. Freedom House called on those who believe in democracy to invest in democratic institutions, call out attacks on rights abroad, and support human rights defenders.

**Freedom House Report: Global Freedom Declines for 19th Consecutive Year**
Freedom House has released its annual 'Freedom in the World' report, which notes a decline in global freedom for the 19th consecutive year. However, some countries in Asia and Africa have shown improvements. Yana Gorokhovskaia, co-author of the report, says that 2024 was a dynamic year due to numerous elections around the world. The Sénégal has made significant progress, with the opposition winning power despite the outgoing president's attempts to delay elections. The country has been upgraded to 'free' status, while the Tanzanie and Niger have been downgraded from 'partially free' to 'not free'. Tunisia has also seen a significant decline in freedom. On the other hand, the Bouthan has become the only country in Asia to achieve 'free' status, following a peaceful transfer of power. The Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have also shown improvements, while the India has seen a decline in freedom due to government nominations in the judiciary. The Jordan has made progress in the Middle East, passing from 'not free' to 'partially free' due to competitive elections. The report also notes improvements in Syria, but notes that the country still has a long way to go to establish strong institutions. The Corée du Nord has the lowest score, while the Koweït, Salvador, and Haïti have seen a decline in freedom. The Finland, Suède, Nouvelle-Zélande, and Norvège have the highest scores, with 100 and 99 respectively.

**Freedom House Report: Global Freedom Declines for 19th Consecutive Year**
According to the annual report by Freedom House, a US-based organization promoting democracy, political freedom, and human rights, at least 60 countries experienced a decline in their level of freedom in 2024, while only 34 saw improvements. This marks the 19th consecutive year of global decline. The report highlights violence during elections as a key factor, with 40% of countries experiencing violent incidents during national elections. 'Attacks against candidates occurred in 20 countries, with groups committing these acts in Mexico and South Africa to control territory and influence politics,' the report states. Additionally, extremist and partisan disputes led to physical aggression against politicians in France, Japan, and South Korea. Voters were also targeted, with attacks on polling stations in at least 14 countries. The report also notes that authoritarian leaders took measures to ensure their permanence in power, such as Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, who recently banned opposition leader María Corina Machado and threatened to prosecute Edmundo González. Freedom House calls for democracies to unite in defense of human rights and global freedom, as only 20% of the world's population lives in 'free' countries where political rights and civil liberties are respected. 'The only way to end nearly two decades of decline in global freedom is for people, regardless of their political environment, to fight for their rights and security, and for democratic governments to work together to support them,' said Gerardo Berthin, interim co-president of Freedom House.

**Global freedom in decline with setbacks in Africa, the US and the far right in Europe**
The 2025 report from Freedom House has highlighted a continued decline in global freedom, with authoritarian regimes on the rise. Africa experienced its tenth consecutive year of declining freedom in 2023, with 14 countries seeing score declines and only five recording improvements. Niger experienced the sharpest decline, dropping 18 points after a military coup. Liberia stood out with the most significant improvement, gaining four points due to successful elections and judicial rulings that protected LGBT+ rights. Despite these positive developments, only 7% of Africa's population resides in 'Free' countries, while half live in 'Not Free' nations. The report also raises concerns about democracy in the United States under Donald Trump, with the country's Global Freedom Score standing at 84 out of 100, reflecting a decline over the past decade. Freedom House warns of rising political violence, with far-right groups posing a growing threat and false claims of election fraud continuing to undermine democratic norms.

**Freedom Levels Decline Globally, Including in India, Says Freedom House**
According to the American research group Freedom House, which studies democracy, freedom levels declined globally in 2024. The group also reported a decline in democracy in India. Freedom House stated that 2024 saw a decline in freedom levels worldwide. Yana Gorokhovskaya, co-author of the group's annual report, said, 'This was the 19th consecutive year that global freedom levels have declined, but the year was particularly unstable due to several elections.'

**Rights decline but bright spots in South Asia: Freedom House**
Freedom House reported a decline in global freedom in 2024, but noted bright spots in South Asia, including Senegal and Bhutan, which were elevated to 'free' status. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka made strong gains in the index without changing categories. However, India saw further deterioration, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to gain influence over judicial appointments contributing to the decline. Freedom House co-author Yana Gorokhovskaia said, 'The big picture is that this was another year of the same trajectory of a global decline in freedom but because of all the elections, it was more dynamic than previous years.' She noted that both Bangladesh and Syria saw immediate improvements in civil liberties, but that it would be a longer road to see gains in political representation. The only country given a perfect 100 score on freedom was Finland, with New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden all right behind at 99. Four countries were downgraded from 'partly free' to 'not free' - Kuwait, Niger, Tanzania, and Thailand. Tunisia, El Salvador, and Haiti also saw steep declines.

**Annual report documents decline in global freedoms**
According to the Freedom House 'Freedom of the World 2025' report, global freedom has declined for the 19th consecutive year in 2024. The report states that key factors driving the degradation in rights and liberties include violence, repression of political opponents, ongoing armed conflicts, and the spread of authoritarian practices. In Eurasia, no country showed improvement in its freedom score in 2024, with Georgia experiencing a significant decline due to government manipulation and fraud in the parliamentary election.
