**Taiwanese Progressive Party Chairman Warns of 'Ostrich-Like' Mentality Amid China's Military Threats**
Taiwanese Progressive Party Chairman Wang Hsing-huan warned that Taiwan cannot afford to be in a ' ostrich-like' mentality, ignoring the possibility of war. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently stated that China's military action against Taiwan 'may be imminent' and urged allies in the Indo-Pacific region to increase their defense budgets to deter China. Wang pointed out that various US think tanks, frontline Indo-Pacific commanders, and naval combat forces have warned that China will launch an invasion of Taiwan in 2027. China has also set a goal of 'winning a local war' by 2027. Wang emphasized that China's ideal script for invading Taiwan is to 'encircle and blockade' the island, creating pressure on Taiwanese society through localized military actions, and then using pro-China parties in Taiwan to advocate for 'peace talks' and shape international opinion to accept unification. He stated, 'Those who advocate for peace talks are Taiwan's enemies.' To counter China's military threats, Wang suggested that Taiwan must strengthen its military deterrent, solidify its alliances with Indo-Pacific nations, and cultivate an 'unyielding resistance spirit' to prevent China from launching an invasion. 'If China expects a blockade to lead to a long-term war and international sanctions, it will be hesitant to launch an invasion,' Wang said.

**China Criticizes US Defense Minister Hegseth Over Taiwan Comments**
China has criticized US Defense Minister Pete Hegseth for his comments on the situation in the Indo-Pacific region. Hegseth had previously described China as a threat in the region and warned of a possible military intervention in Taiwan. The Chinese government accused the US of undermining peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region. China also warned the US against interfering in the Taiwan issue, calling it an 'internal affair'. Hegseth stated that 'China's army is training for the worst-case scenario' and that the threat from China is real and could happen at any moment. Chinese President Xi Jinping has allegedly ordered his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. Hegseth's comments were his strongest since taking office in January. Chinese Admiral Hu Gangfeng, leader of the Chinese delegation at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, called Hegseth's accusations 'unfounded' and aimed at provoking conflicts and destabilizing the Asian-Pacific region. Hegseth had also urged Asian allies to increase their defense spending in the face of the 'threat from communist China'. China wants to become the dominant power in Asia and control the entire region, he said. The US does not seek a conflict with China, but will not be pushed out of the region and will not allow its allies and partners to be subordinated.

**China Responds Harshly to Hegseth's Warning on Taiwan**
China has responded harshly to US Defense Minister Pete Hegseth's statement, warning of a potential Chinese military attack on Taiwan. Hegseth had said, 'China's army is training for the worst-case scenario.' The Chinese Foreign Ministry has rebuked the US, saying, 'Don't play with fire.' Hegseth's comments were 'defamatory', 'regrettable', and 'aimed at sowing discord.' A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry accused the US of undermining 'peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region' and 'turning the region into a powder keg' with the deployment of offensive weapons. China has warned the US not to interfere in the Taiwan issue. Hegseth had warned of a potential Chinese military attack on Taiwan, saying, 'China's army is training for the worst-case scenario.' He also called on Asian allies to increase their defense spending, saying, 'Deterrence has a price.' China aims to become the dominant power in Asia and control the entire region, Hegseth said. A Chinese takeover of Taiwan 'would have devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world.'

**China Accuses US of Provoking Conflict over Taiwan**
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has sparked outrage in China with his warning of an impending attack by China on the island of Taiwan. Beijing sees this as a threat to peace and stability. The Chinese government suspects that the US has a motive to provoke conflicts. A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry accused the US of undermining 'peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region' and turning the region 'into a powder keg.' China also warned the US government against interfering in the Taiwan issue. Hegseth had warned at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore on Saturday that China's army was training for a worst-case scenario. 'China's army is training for the worst-case scenario,' he said. 'We will not sugarcoat it - the threat from China is real. And it could be imminent.' Chinese Admiral Hu Gangfeng countered that Hegseth's accusations were 'unfounded' and aimed at provoking conflicts and destabilizing the Asian-Pacific region. Hegseth emphasized the 'threat' from China, saying that it is seeking to become the hegemonic power in Asia and dominate the entire region. He called on Asian allies to increase their defense spending in the face of this 'threat.'

**US and China Engage in Confrontational Rhetoric Over Taiwan**
The rhetoric has become sharper and the tone more confrontational between Washington and Beijing in Singapore, as they accuse each other of destabilizing the Indo-Pacific region. At the center of the dispute is Taiwan and the question of how long peace will last. The Chinese government has strongly criticized US Defense Minister Pete Hegseth's comments on the situation in the Indo-Pacific region, accusing the US of undermining 'peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region' and turning it into a 'powder keg'.

**US Warns Allies of China's Growing Threat: 'Invading Taiwan in 2027'**
US Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, has warned allies not to 'look away' from the 'imminent risk' posed by China, which is investing in high-level nuclear arms and armament technology to 'invade Taiwan in 2027'. Hegseth has reiterated that China's attempts to conquer Taiwan 'by force' would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. China has warned the US that military aid to Taiwan increases the 'risk of conflict'. Hegseth has called for increased defense spending 'to prevent war, make the cost too high, and peace the only option'. Analysts interpret this as a signal from Washington to increase arms sales in Asia. Hegseth has also highlighted the 'risk' of economic dependence on China, which 'deepens its malign influence' globally. This comes as tensions rise, with China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, not attending the Singapore meeting, and instead sending a delegation from the National Defense University.

**US Warns of Potential Chinese Advance Against Taiwan Islands**
The US Defense Intelligence Agency has issued a warning that China could advance against the islands of Taiwan. According to the 2024 Global Threat Assessment, China is a key player in the conflict between China and the US. The islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Dongsha, and Taiping, as well as Penghu, are crucial in this conflict. The US is ready to support Taiwan, its ally in the Pacific, as stated by the Institute for the Study of War. This move comes as the US government tightens relations with China by making a key announcement about visas. As reported by the US Defense Intelligence Agency, China's President Xi Jinping has been a key figure in this conflict. The US has also signed a multi-million dollar agreement that includes the sale of arms to a Middle Eastern power, as confirmed by former US President Donald Trump.

**Washington Think Tank Warns of Limited International Support for Taiwan in Conflict**
A recent report by the New America Security Center (CNAS) in Washington D.C. suggests that if a conflict were to break out in the Taiwan Strait, other countries would likely not provide significant assistance to Taiwan unless the U.S. intervenes on a large scale. The report, titled 'Regional and Global Responses to A Taiwan Contingency,' was sponsored by the Taiwanese representative office in the U.S. and evaluates the likelihood of other countries providing aid to Taiwan in the event of a sudden crisis. According to the report, if Taiwan does not strongly resist and the U.S. does not intervene on a large scale, other countries are unlikely to provide significant assistance to Taiwan. However, the report notes that other countries may still try to stop the conflict to protect their economic interests, particularly access to advanced semiconductors. The report also warns that policymakers in the U.S. should be prepared for limited assistance from other countries in the event of a Taiwan crisis, citing the reality of geopolitics. The report categorizes countries into four groups: the front line, including Japan, the Philippines, and other U.S. allies; East Asia; Southeast Asia; and Europe and other countries. According to the report, Japan's military priorities in a Taiwan conflict would be to protect its people and territory, including residents in Taiwan and the southwestern islands, as well as to maintain control of the Senkaku Islands. Japan would also aim to avoid becoming a target for Chinese missile attacks. The report suggests that Japan may provide shelter and logistics support to U.S. troops stationed in Japan, and may also provide submarine patrols to support U.S. monitoring or closure of key chokepoints in the First Island Chain. The report also notes that the Philippines' priority would be to evacuate residents from Taiwan and decide whether to allow U.S. military use of their military facilities in the event of a Taiwan crisis. South Korea, meanwhile, would need to balance its priorities of deterring North Korea, maintaining the U.S.-South Korea alliance, and avoiding being drawn into a war with China, and may consider providing logistical support to the U.S. military, similar to Japan's actions during the Korean War. South Korea may also consider conducting air and sea patrols in the Yellow Sea to counter the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Northern Fleet headquarters in Qingdao.

**War Over Taiwan Would Cause 500,000 Deaths, Economic Devastation, US Admiral Paparo Says - Vision Times**
US Admiral Samuel Paparo has warned that a war over Taiwan would cause 500,000 deaths, economic devastation, and a 25% drop in Asian GDP. He also stated that a regional conflict could lead to nuclear-armed South Korea and Japan, and cause other countries to align with China. Paparo emphasized that a successful US intervention against a PRC invasion of Taiwan would reduce losses, but the damage and human toll would still be immense. He also called for enhancing capabilities in cyber, space, anti-space, and long-range strike operations across the Indo-Pacific, and advocated continuing the mission of USAID to promote American soft power around the world. According to Paparo, a regional conflict could result in 10-12% of the US GDP, 7 to 10% of American employment, and 500,000 deaths. He also stated that if the US reduces its military involvement on the Korean Peninsula, Japan and South Korea might consider producing and deploying nuclear weapons of their own. Paparo said, 'If the US reduces its military involvement on the Korean Peninsula, in Northeast Asia, or around Taiwan, Japan and South Korea might consider producing and deploying nuclear weapons of their own.'

**US Commander Warns of 'Great Humanitarian Disaster' if War Breaks Out in Taiwan Strait**
US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Samuel Paparo recently warned in a Senate hearing that a war in the Taiwan Strait would destroy the global economy, potentially causing 500,000 people to die in desperation, even if the US intervenes successfully. He stated that the Chinese Communist Party's military pressure on Taiwan has increased by 300%, and is not just a simple military exercise, but a 'dress rehearsal' to simulate the forced unification of Taiwan. Paparo said that Taiwan is a core component of the global semiconductor industry, and if the production line is blocked, it would severely impact the US's economic modernization and growth. He warned that if a regional war breaks out, the GDP of the Asian region could drop by 25%, and the US GDP could decline by 10-12%, with a 7-10% increase in unemployment rate, and 500,000 people could die in desperation, such as through suicide or drug overdose. Even if the US intervenes successfully, it would only be able to reduce the damage by half, and still cause a 'great humanitarian disaster.' Paparo also stated that the trust between regional allies and partners would be tested, and if the US's influence declines, some Indo-Pacific countries may follow China's long-term goal of leading the international order, while others may turn to developing their own nuclear weapons due to security concerns, leading to an escalation of conflict. He emphasized that 'the victory of World War II relied on logistics, not artificial intelligence. You cannot use AI to compensate for the lack of physical equipment.'

**US Commander Warns of 'Extreme Humanitarian Disaster' in Taiwan Strait Conflict**

Paparo stated that China's military pressure on Taiwan has increased by 300%, and is not just a simple military exercise, but a 'dress rehearsal' to simulate the forced unification of Taiwan.

Paparo said that Taiwan is a core component of the global semiconductor industry, and if the production line is blocked, it would severely impact the modernization and growth of the US domestic economy. He warned that if the region goes to war, the GDP of the Asian region could drop by 25%, the US GDP could drop by 10-12%, and the unemployment rate could rise by 7-10%, and cause 500,000 people to 'die in desperation', such as suicide, drug overdose, etc. social problems. Even if the US intervenes successfully, it would only reduce the damage by half, still causing 'extreme humanitarian disaster'. Paparo said that the trust between regional allies and partners would be tested, and if the US influence declines, some Indo-Pacific countries may succumb to China's long-term goal of dominating international order, while others may turn to developing their own nuclear weapons due to security anxiety, leading to an escalation of conflict.

**Escalating Tensions Between China and Taiwan: A Complex and Delicate Situation**
The relationship between China and Taiwan has been complex and marked by periods of tension and rapprochement. Recently, tensions have escalated due to a series of military maneuvers and political statements that have put the international community on alert. China considers Taiwan a 'rebellious province' and maintains its commitment to unifying it with the mainland, although it prefers to achieve this through peaceful means. Taiwan has its own government, elected by its citizens, and a population of 23 million people, but its leaders do not share the same stance on the island's future or how to relate to China. In response to what Beijing considers provocations by Taiwan and its allies, China has intensified its military activities in the Taiwan Strait, including large-scale exercises with 59 fighter jets and 23 warships around the island. The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense has condemned these actions, calling them 'irresponsible provocations that undermine regional peace and stability.' The Chinese government has reiterated that Taiwan is an 'inseparable part' of Chinese territory and has warned other countries not to interfere in what it considers internal affairs. The international community is concerned about the possibility of an armed conflict in the region. China has increased its use of non-military tactics to pressure Taiwan, aiming to weaken it without resorting to force. Analysts warn that these maneuvers aim to influence Taiwanese public opinion, promoting the idea that unification with China is the most viable option. 'We support the One-China policy, we support everything we've done in the past, but that doesn't mean China has the capacity, jurisdiction to enter and use force to take Taiwan,' said former US President Joe Biden. 'In the face of the pandemic, we supported each other. Now, in the face of authoritarian expansion, we continue to work together. We will continue to do everything we can to safeguard democracy so that a democratic Taiwan can continue to shine its light in the world,' said Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te.

**China Redoubles Threats of War Against Taiwan Amid Independence Tensions**
China's communist regime has reiterated its threats of war against any attempt at Taiwanese independence. Chinese Premier Li Qiang stated, 'We will resolutely oppose separatist activities seeking Taiwan's independence and external interference.' He emphasized the need for 'rejuvenation of the nation' through reunification with Taiwan. Li's mention of Taiwan was met with applause from the nearly 3,000 delegates gathered at the Great Hall of the People. China has maintained its stance on Taiwan since 1949, considering it a rebellious province and threatening annexation, including the use of force. The Chinese regime has intensified military pressure on Taiwan, with air and naval exercises aimed at creating a climate of fear. Beijing has also used its economic influence to diplomatically isolate Taiwan, pressuring countries to break ties with Taipei and recognize China. Currently, only 13 countries maintain official relations with Taiwan, down from 22 in 2016. The US, Taiwan's main ally, has reiterated its support for the island against Chinese aggression. The US has approved significant arms sales to Taiwan, strengthening its military capabilities against a possible Chinese invasion. High-ranking US officials' visits to Taiwan have sent a clear message to Beijing: any attempt at forced annexation will have consequences. The Taiwan Strait conflict remains one of the most volatile hotspots in the current geopolitical landscape, with China's aggression and rhetoric of forced annexation posing a grave risk to regional stability.

**Taiwan's Defense Minister: China's Military Not Currently Capable of Invasion**
Taiwan's Defense Minister Wellington Koo believes that China's military is not currently capable of invading the island, but this could change in the future. In the event of a war, Taipei expects support from the US, even under President Trump. Koo stated, 'I don't think the US can afford to lose the Indo-Pacific.' The US is committed to preventing any conflict in the region that could threaten its interests in the Indo-Pacific. Taiwan, along with Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea, forms a chain of US allies surrounding China. The Taiwan Strait and surrounding shipping lanes are crucial for global trade. A conflict in the region would have significant consequences for global trade. Although the US has no official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it has committed to supporting the island's defense capabilities. Koo believes that China's military is still a threat, even if it is not currently capable of invasion. He stated, 'Given that the Taiwan Strait is a natural barrier, I don't think the People's Liberation Army currently has the capability for amphibious warfare.' Koo pointed out that China's military is undergoing modernization and has not ruled out invading Taiwan. The Communist Party in Beijing considers Taiwan, with its population of over 23 million, to be part of China, despite the island's decades-long independence and democratic government. China is using 'gray zone' tactics against Taiwan, explained Koo, including actions below the threshold of open conflict, such as entering Taiwan's air defense zone with fighter jets. Taiwan's air defense zone is not to be confused with its airspace. These tactics include surprise military exercises, such as the one on February 26, when China's military set up a training area off the southern coast of Kaohsiung and Pingtung without warning. Similar actions near Australia have further highlighted China's role as a security threat in the Indo-Pacific and 'troublemaker,' said Koo.

**North Korea's Military Support for Russia in Ukraine: A Threat to Global Security**
The Ukraine-Russia war has entered its third year, with two Taiwanese volunteers, Chen Shengguang and Wu Zhongda, losing their lives in combat. According to the Ukrainian government, there are currently around 5-6 Taiwanese volunteers in Ukraine. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, China, Iran, and North Korea have been closely cooperating with Russia, with North Korea even sending troops to assist Russia in 2024. This alliance was identified by former US President Joe Biden as a threat that needed to be countered. Chen Shengguang, a 25-year-old from Hualien, Taiwan, joined the Ukrainian military despite his friends and family's objections. He was killed in action in November 2022. Wu Zhongda, a 44-year-old single father, was a veteran of the Taiwanese special forces and joined the Ukrainian International Legion in 2023. He was injured in combat and returned to Taiwan for treatment before rejoining the fight in July 2024, where he was killed in November. North Korea's decision to send troops to Russia has come at a great cost, with around 12,000 soldiers being sent to the southern region of Russia, resulting in 300 deaths and 2,700 injuries. However, the actual number of casualties may be higher, with Seth Jones, a researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, estimating that the death toll could be as high as 1,000. The alliance between Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea has been dubbed the 'Axis of Evil' or 'Axis of Chaos' by some, with the US viewing it as a threat. However, the new US administration seems to be taking a more relaxed approach, with President Trump's actions being seen as unclear and inconsistent.

**US-China War over Taiwan: A Devastating Conflict**
A recent analysis by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) suggests that a war between the US and China over Taiwan could be devastating for all parties involved. The study, based on the All-Source Intelligence methodology of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and open sources, estimates that the US would lose between 10 and 20 warships, including 2 aircraft carriers, and 200 to 400 combat aircraft, with over 3,000 US military personnel killed in the first three weeks of the conflict. Taiwan would be devastated and would run out of critical ammunition, while China would lose up to 90% of its amphibious fleet, 52 surface ships, and 160 combat aircraft. The study also notes that the US and Taiwan would exhaust their ammunition reserves quickly, including critical missiles such as LRASM, JASSM-ER, and Tomahawk Block V, which would take two years or more to produce. The analysis concludes that the US would likely lose a war with China over Taiwan, but at a very high cost, and that the conflict would have significant economic and industrial implications for all parties involved.

**60% Americans favor defending Taiwan when the time comes: Report - The Taiwan Times**
A recent survey titled 'Order and Disorder' found that 60% of Americans support the US defending Taiwan against a possible Chinese invasion. The survey, conducted by YouGov from August 28 to September 6, gathered responses from 1,000 adult US citizens. According to the results, 18% strongly supported intervention, 42% somewhat supported intervention, 27% were somewhat opposed, and 13% were strongly opposed. Republicans were more likely to support taking military action than Democrats or Independents. The survey's findings suggest that the US may be willing to commit troops to defend Taiwan, which could potentially lead to a global conflict, including the possibility of World War III.
