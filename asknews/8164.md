**2027 Election: 'It's Funny How APC Is Celebrating Defection' - PDP Spokesperson, Ologunagba**
The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) spokesperson, Debo Ologunagba, has criticized the All Progressives Congress (APC) for celebrating defections from opposition parties. Ologunagba stated that the focus in 2027 will be on President Bola Tinubu's performance and policies, rather than defections. He emphasized that some defections are due to coercion, rather than conviction, and that the APC's celebration of defections is an 'illusion' that a one-party state will not happen. Ologunagba said, 'It's curious and strange that this government celebrated defections as if it were the success of policies, someone is defecting, then you find the whole statecraft brought forward.' According to Naija News, several lawmakers have defected from the PDP and Labour Party to the APC, including former PDP presidential candidate Ifeanyi Okowa and all Delta State National Assembly members.

**Lula warns of right-wing 'overwhelming' the Supreme Court in 2026 Senate elections**
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated that in the 2026 elections, it is necessary to elect a majority in the Senate to prevent the right from 'overwhelming' the Supreme Court (STF). Lula made this statement on Sunday (1st), during the closing speech of the national congress of the PSB in Brasília. According to Lula, 'We often have to elect the best candidates, elect senators, elect federal deputies, elect senators, because we need to win the majority in the Senate, because otherwise, those guys [from the right] will overwhelm the Supreme Court.' Lula also emphasized that the Supreme Court is not a 'sweet apple', but it is necessary to 'preserve the institutions that guarantee the exercise of democracy in this country.' In 2026, there will be an election for ⅔ of the Senate seats - 54 out of 81. The right has already declared that it seeks a majority in the Upper House of Congress, as it is the instance that can initiate impeachment proceedings against STF ministers. The right sees this possibility, with Senator Flávio Bolsonaro stating in February that 'we have almost 40 senators in favor of impeaching Minister Alexandre de Moraes.' Senator Davi Alcolumbre, the president of the Upper House, also stated in February that he would not prioritize impeachment proceedings against STF ministers and that the Senate 'is not a correction body of the STF.'

**Why On-And-Off Voters Who Backed Trump May Be GOP's Midterm Silver Bullet | CDN**
A recent study by J.L. Partners found that many Americans who voted for President Donald Trump in the past are now feeling unmotivated to vote Republican in the 2026 midterm elections. Analysts believe that motivating these low-propensity voters could be crucial for the Republican Party to maintain control of Congress. Sam Kay, a pollster at OnMessage Inc., said, 'Republicans will have a hard time surviving the 2026 midterms without figuring out how to engage the low-propensity Trump voter.' Kay added, 'If we want low-propensity Trump voters to turn out in 2026, we need to make this election about protecting President Trump's agenda.' James Johnson, pollster and co-founder of J.L. Partners, said, 'Most (64%) would still vote GOP if the election were held tomorrow, but lack a clear reason to do so.' Johnson believes that these voters are motivated by the idea that voting for a Republican-controlled Congress in 2026 will help the Republicans win the presidency in 2028. Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, said, 'Midterms should be considered separately from presidential elections.' Kondik noted that presidential elections have higher voter turnout than midterms and that the outcome of midterms does not necessarily predict presidential outcomes.

**Mexico Holds First-Ever Judiciary Elections Amid Controversy**
Mexico held its first-ever elections for the judiciary on Sunday, with over 7,700 candidates vying for 2,600 positions in the country's judicial system. The elections are part of a reform aimed at reducing impunity and democratizing the justice system, but critics argue that it could weaken the checks and balances of power. According to analyst Rodolfo Ramos, 'the Mexican justice system was far from perfect, and this new judicial system will not address its deficiencies.' However, he added that public scrutiny will be much greater. The reform, which was sent to Congress by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador in February 2024, aims to elect judges and magistrates by popular vote, reduce the number of Supreme Court justices, and abolish requirements for the position, such as age and work experience. Critics argue that the election will expose judges to even more influence from political forces, particular interests, and organized crime. 'The true test of fire will come in a few months, when a company or individual presents a judicial order against a government action and, after months of legal processes, reaches the Supreme Court,' said Ramos. The elections are expected to be low-key, with only 37% of 1,000 people surveyed by Buendía&Márquez in May saying they would vote. The opposition party, PAN, has called on its members not to participate, calling it a 'vulgar fraud.' President López Obrador's party, Morena, has tried to mobilize its base, with López Obrador saying, 'We call on people to participate, participate, participate. Participating is the best way to transform a country... And it will be better to have a judiciary that arrives than the one we have now.'

**House Dems' campaign chair says her party's 'on offense' in 2026 battle to win back majority from GOP**
House Democratic campaign chair Suzan DelBene says her party is 'on offense' in the 2026 battle to win back the majority from the GOP. DelBene notes that the party only needs three more seats to take control of the House, and that they have 35 districts in play where they have opportunities. She argues that the reason they have opportunities is because people are outraged and want to see someone who will fight for their communities, not just be blindly loyal to a president. DelBene also points to the fact that the party gained seats in the 2024 elections and is confident that they will take back the majority in 2026. However, the party is facing a polling dilemma, with their ratings at historic lows in national surveys. The Fox News poll showed that 41% of voters have a favorable view of the Democrats, while 56% have an unfavorable view. Despite this, the poll also showed that 49% of voters would back a generic Democrat in their congressional district, while 42% would support the generic Republican candidate.

**Massa Moves Forward with Strategy to Maintain Political Space**
Sergio Massa, the leader of the Frente Renovador, is moving forward with a strategy to maintain his political space and avoid the fragmentation of the Peronist movement. Although he has not yet confirmed whether he will be a candidate in the legislative elections, Massa is working to preserve the unity of the province of Buenos Aires and ensure the representation of the Frente Renovador in Congress and the provincial legislature. According to his entourage, his goals are to 'preserve the unity of the province and guarantee the legislative representation of the Frente Renovador, both in Congress and in the provincial legislature.' Massa's low profile since his presidential defeat in November 2023 has sparked speculation about his potential candidacy. Cecilia Moreau, a national deputy, stated that 'many colleagues and colleagues are asking Sergio to return to Congress.' Moreau justified her statement with data, highlighting Massa's victories in the province of Buenos Aires in the 2023 presidential election. The Frente Renovador is also working to incorporate new voices and leadership, with Massa promoting the renewal of the party's leadership with young figures like Francisco Caporiccio. As the expectation for his possible candidacy grows, the Frente Renovador continues to add political muscle in the Fourth Electoral Section, a key area for the provincial strategy.

**ZAMBIANS WILL HAVE THE FINAL SAY IN 2026 – Peter Chanda - The Zambian Observer**
Peter Chanda, the president of the New Congress party, stated that Zambians will have the final say in the 2026 elections. He emphasized that the seat of authority belongs to the people of Zambia, not individuals. Chanda criticized President Hichilema, saying 'Mr. Hichilema is saying “twalikala kale, akekala pesa”, I want to remind him that the seat of authority does not belong to anyone. It belongs to the Zambian people and it is the Zambians that are going to decide who to put on the seat of Presidency in 2026.' Chanda also announced that the New Congress party has completed the formalities to change its party symbol from a satellite dish to a chair, which he said represents authority. He urged the people of Lumezi to vote in the upcoming parliamentary by-election on June 26, 2025.

**What does the future hold for the California Democratic Party?**
The California Democratic Party is facing a moment of reckoning after recent losses, but leaders are calling for self-introspection and acknowledging the need to do more to win over voters. Rusty Hicks, the Chair of the California Democratic Party, acknowledged that the state legislature has more work ahead to address affordability issues, but shrugged off the fact that Republicans managed to flip three legislative seats during the 2024 election. Despite this, Democrats continue to enjoy a supermajority in Sacramento. The party's priority in 2026 will be the congressional midterm elections, and they plan to engage with young voters by going to high school and college campuses. Democrats are hoping to wrest back control of at least one of the houses in Congress to thwart Republicans' attempts to advance President Donald Trump's agenda. 'We need to think about how we talk about economics, with a real plan to help people who are struggling,' said Dave Min, a Democrat. 'We need to stay focused and fearless, go into red districts with resolve,' added Sydney Kamlager-Dove. Corrin Rankin, chair of the California Republican Party, responded that Republicans are just getting started and that the 2024 election made one thing clear: 'Voters are done with Democrat mismanagement. Californians are ready for change, and Republicans are ready to lead.'

**"We Will Fight for Every Seat!" - WhatsUp News**
The National Democratic Congress (NDC) is determined to secure every parliamentary seat it believes was stolen in the 2024 general election, despite already holding a commanding majority in Ghana's Parliament. According to Hon. Rockson-Nelson Dafeamekpor, the party's Majority Whip and South Dayi MP, 'We are still in court over a couple of seats that we are fighting to recover.' He dismissed rumors of discontent among NDC MPs due to a perceived lack of ministerial appointments, saying 'My MPs are not hungry! They are not idle. And they are not jobless. They are not.' Dafeamekpor credits President John Dramani Mahama's promise to appoint only 60 ministers with resonating deeply with the electorate, contributing significantly to the high turnout and solid support for the NDC. He revealed that President Mahama is currently operating with a mere 56 ministers, allowing more MPs to be appointed to statutory boards, ensuring their continued engagement and responsibility within the legislative cohort. The NDC holds a clear two-thirds majority in the current Ninth Parliament, with 187 seats, including four independent MPs caucusing with the party. Dafeamekpor boldly proclaimed, 'We can do anything we want in the house. We can turn a woman into a man in this house,' underscoring the immense influence the party now wields in the chamber.

**Incertidumbre hasta el final: The Proposal to Allow Non-Party Members in Presidential Tickets**
The proposal to allow non-party members to be included in presidential tickets has been put forward by Congress member Juan Burgos. This idea, which was previously allowed but later banned due to its potential for 'outsiders' to be postulated without a clear identity or program, could create several problems. According to the author, 'it would open the door to uncertainty about who could be candidates in 2026: even Antauro Humala could return to the scene.' Moreover, it would continue to foster informality and improvisation among political parties, a problem that has always existed in Peru. The author suggests that Congress should prioritize other pressing issues, such as the high number of parties competing in the election and the need to extend the deadline for party alliances to reduce fragmentation.

**APC determined to take over FCT in coming elections – Mahmoud — Daily Nigerian**
Dr Mariya Mahmoud, Minister of State for the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, has stated that the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, is determined to win all seats in the FCT area council's election scheduled for February 21, 2026, and the 2027 general elections. According to Mahmoud, the party has identified its problems and is ready to confront them head-on. She added that the party will take steps to ensure that the selfish interests of some individuals do not override the collective interest of the party. Mahmoud said, 'I can see that APC in FCT is taking shape and becoming more focused on the way forward. We have identified where our problems lie, and we are more united to overcome them. The result of our unity will manifest more in the area council elections coming up in February 2026 and the general elections in 2027.' The minister also highlighted the President Bola Tinubu-led administration's efforts to entrench inclusive governance in the FCT through the creation of Youth and Women Secretariats, which she believes will give the APC an edge in coming elections. Earlier, the chairman of the party in the FCT, Abdulmalik Usman, commended the stakeholders for their efforts, saying, 'Today, our collective resolve is key to sustaining the dominance of APC as the ruling party. We will continue to deliver dividends of democracy to our people and build a stronger, more prosperous nation.'

**Stefanik and NY-21 Special Election Should Move Forward Soon**
The NY-21 congressional seat is expected to become vacant soon, triggering a special election. President Trump and House Republicans have delayed Elise Stefanik's confirmation as Ambassador to the United Nations to ensure enough GOP members to pass the upcoming budget vote. Speaker Mike Johnson said, 'If we get the budget resolution passed this week, it's possible that Elise Stefanik would go ahead and move on to her assignment at the U.N.' Stefanik's resignation will start the process for a special election, where Republican committees in the 21st congressional district will elect their candidate. The Democrats have already chosen their candidate, Blake Gendebien. The special election will be held within 70 to 80 days of the announcement, with a weighted voting process for Republicans to nominate their candidate. More than 20 Republicans have expressed interest in running, including local Assemblyman Robert Smullen and Rome businessman Joe Rutkowski.

**After 10 years, Congress back in GHMC panel**
After a 10-year hiatus, the Congress party is set to return to the standing committee of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) following an understanding with the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM). The elections, which will be held on February 25, are expected to be unanimous as the BRS and BJP have opted out of the polls. According to the agreement, Congress will secure seven seats, while AIMIM will take the remaining eight. The BJP and BRS, with 41 and 40 corporators respectively, have decided to stay away from the elections citing insufficient numbers. This development marks a significant shift in the political landscape of the GHMC, where Congress has 24 members, BJP has 41, BRS has 40, and AIMIM has 41. 'It's a good development for the Congress party,' said a Congress leader, 'We are looking forward to working with AIMIM and serving the people of Hyderabad.'

**Congress to Induct Abhijit Mukherjee, Son of Former President Pranab Mukherjee, into Party**
The Congress party has announced that it will induct Abhijit Mukherjee, the son of former President Pranab Mukherjee, into the party on February 12, 2025, as part of its plan to reorganize in the eastern state. According to AICC Secretary Asif Ali Khan, 'Abhijit Mukherjee will rejoin the Congress in Kolkata on February 12 in the presence of senior leaders. We welcome his return. This will boost the party's chances in the state.' Abhijit Mukherjee had joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in 2021, and his return to the Congress is seen as a significant development, particularly in the context of the upcoming 2026 West Bengal Assembly elections. Khan said, 'The TMC's vote bank is essentially the Congress's traditional support base. We still have a good presence in many assembly constituencies. Now, we will reorganize the party in the state and go to the people who are suffering from unemployment and inflation.' The Congress party faces a tough challenge in reviving its fortunes in West Bengal, where it has been struggling to regain lost ground. The party had contested the 2021 Assembly elections in alliance with the Left parties but failed to win a single seat. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Mamata Banerjee's TMC refused to share seats with the Congress, winning only one of the 42 parliamentary seats in the state. The rise of the BJP in the state has also posed a problem for the Congress, which has accused the TMC of playing into the hands of the BJP to polarize voters and remain in power. Khan said, 'The TMC is, in a way, helping the BJP to polarize voters and remain in power. They have actually helped the BJP to grow in the state. The Congress is the only party that can challenge the BJP at the national level and should be strengthened.'
