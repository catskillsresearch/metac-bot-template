**EU FTA pace to beat expectations of leaders: Goyal**
Negotiators for the India-European Union Free Trade Agreement (FTA) are accelerating talks, with Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic holding three meetings in 35 days. Goyal said, 'We have held three meetings in 35 days. It shows our shared commitment for the FTA...we are trying to do it faster.' The FTA is expected to be concluded before the end of 2025, beating the expectations of top leaders from both sides. With the agreement, India would have fully covered Europe, as an agreement with the UK has already been finalized and with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) signed. EFTA covers Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

**Africa Is Not Aspiring to Join Arbitration - It's Already a Key Player - Experts**
Experts at a conference in Kigali on June 5 declared that Africa is not aspiring to join the arbitration world, but rather is already a key player. Chief Justice Domitilla Mukantaganzwa emphasized that arbitration is no longer a foreign concept on the continent, citing Rwanda's progress in embedding arbitration as a vital part of its justice system. She noted that African countries are revising arbitration laws, modernizing legal frameworks, and strengthening institutions to support effective dispute resolution. Mukantaganzwa called for continued investment in developing local talent, strengthening institutions, and building trust. International arbitration expert Meg Kinnear highlighted the importance of arbitration for its speed, confidentiality, and flexibility, but stressed the need for enforceability. The Minister of Justice, Emmanuel Ugirashebuja, commended Africa's growing leadership in arbitration, stating that it is key to building trust in trade, resolving disputes fairly, and advancing sustainable development. 'Arbitration is key to building trust in trade, resolving disputes fairly, and advancing sustainable development,' he said. 'With mechanisms like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) taking shape, cross-border transactions will increase and arbitration will be essential.'

**Future of business in Africa will be shaped by partnerships**
The future of business in Africa will be shaped by partnerships, according to the Corporate and Investment Banking Managing Principal at Absa Bank Kenya Plc. As global and regional forces continue to evolve, businesses are navigating an economic environment characterized by currency movements, changing capital flows, and shifts in trade dynamics. This has led to a shift in corporate and institutional clients' operating models, with a focus on greater financial agility, liquidity management, and adaptive funding strategies. The role of financial institutions is also changing, with clients expecting more than just credit, including timely insights, sectoral understanding, and a partnership approach. Absa is well-positioned to support clients operating across jurisdictions, with a pan-African presence and access to capital markets, foreign exchange, and risk management capabilities. The emergence of initiatives such as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) underscores the need for financial partners who can navigate regulatory diversity while supporting seamless cross-border execution. The future of business in Sub-Saharan Africa will be shaped by the partnerships forged today, with long-term value creation depending on how well financial partners understand their clients' objectives, constraints, and environment.

**How to secure exports beyond the US-South Africa diplomatic dance?**
South Africa's export potential remains strong despite recent diplomatic tensions with the US. Behind-the-scenes reports suggest more positive and constructive engagements beyond closed doors. To secure exports, South African businesses need to accept that losing the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade programme is a reality. A dynamic marketplace requires credit risk management as a fundamental discipline. Anticipating and mitigating risks is crucial for secure and profitable export ventures. A holistic view, clear contracts, and robust force majeure clauses are essential. An informed approach to credit management involves rigorous buyer due diligence, country risk assessment, and trade credit insurance. Market diversification is also crucial, with the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) offering opportunities for regional trade and growth. Ultimately, a credit management team with deep expertise in international trade finance, legal frameworks, and geopolitical analysis is a strategic asset.

**Leveraging intra-African trade to boost Nigeria's manufacturing sector**
Nigeria's manufacturing sector has the potential to boost the country's economy through intra-African trade. The sector is dominated by cement and building materials, food and beverages, tobacco, chemicals and fertilisers, wood, and textiles. However, intra-African trade has remained relatively low. Recent data suggests a promising shift, with a 195% year-on-year surge in intra-African trade to N2.911 trillion in the second quarter of 2024. Companies such as Dangote Cement and BUA Group are actively involved in exporting manufactured goods to neighbouring African states. To scale up impacts, Nigeria must utilise its network of Free Trade Zones (FTZs) and provide a tangible solution to its power sector. Regulatory hurdles also slow down cross-border transactions, and the Nigerian government must set and harmonise trade policies to reduce customs delays and streamline documentation processes. Trade fairs and expos offer platforms for Nigerian manufacturers to build networks and secure buyers. As a leading economic engine room in Africa, the trade agreement through the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) offers Nigeria a strategic opportunity to diversify its economy, strengthen local industries, and drive sustainable development. 'No doubt, Nigerian manufacturers can compete and thrive within the continent and thus cement the country as a regional industry leader,' according to Rahaman Abiola, Editor-in-Chief of LEGIT.ng.

**2025 inaugural AfCFTA digital trade & services forum masterclasses lays foundation for e-commerce**
The 2025 inaugural AfCFTA digital trade forum was preceded by thought leadership masterclasses that focused on unlocking Africa's digital trade potential and laying the foundation for e-commerce. Sessions on E-commerce by Google Hustle Academy empowered entrepreneurs to build and scale online, while the AfCFTA secretariat highlighted the vast potential of digital trade, covering all transactions in goods and services. Industry experts from renowned institutions discussed areas of digital trading, including monetizing digital platforms and responsible digital payments for MSMEs. The adoption of the AfCFTA Protocol on Digital Trade and its constituent Annexes marks a significant milestone, paving the way for a single African digital market with harmonised rules and standards. This will benefit African MSMEs, comprising over 90% of the African market, with about 70% owned by women and youth, and open new doors for sustainable investment, technology transfer, and integration into the global digital market.

**Afreximbank rolls out specialised AfCFTA training to empower businesses**
Afreximbank is launching a specialized training program in Abuja from June 30 to July 2, 2025, to help African businesses leverage the opportunities offered by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The program aims to equip businesses with a deep understanding of the AfCFTA's commercial implications and regulatory landscape. According to Dr Yemi Kale, Group Chief Economist and Managing Director of Research at Afreximbank, 'AfCFTA is not just a policy framework but is also a catalyst for a structural shift in Africa's economic landscape.' However, many African businesses are still grappling with limited awareness of the agreement's technical provisions, trade protocols, and strategic benefits. The training program will provide policy-relevant insights to interpret treaty instruments, ensure compliance with new trade rules, and offer support to exporters in navigating tariff and non-tariff barriers. Dr Kale emphasized that 'this training is about more than compliance; it is about empowerment. It equips participants not only to meet regulatory requirements but also to develop export strategies, diversify markets, and improve competitiveness.'

**Nigeria ratifies 90% duty waiver on imports under AfCFTA to crash costs**
The Nigerian government has ratified the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, which will eliminate 90% of import duties within Africa. This move is expected to boost Nigeria's role in shaping the future of African trade and unlock new opportunities for businesses. Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Jumoke Oduwole, described the submission as a show of confidence in Nigeria's entrepreneurial capacity, stating that the country looks forward to receiving products from other African countries. Experts say the development will give fresh impetus to Nigeria's exporters amid currency instability and rising demand for FX, and will drive the industrial revolution. 'It's a partnership,' Oduwole said. The move comes several months after the Nigerian government established a 150-day import duty-free window for essential food items, which helped to crash food prices.

**Africa’s trade goals are realised on local levels primarily with energy, transport projects**
The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) aims to create a single market in Africa with no trade restrictions between countries. While the treaty's architects have finished their work and most African nations have signed on, the implementation is being carried out on local levels. Governments are not businesses and should enable trade opportunities by providing infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and electricity. Malawi and Mozambique have agreed to establish one-stop border posts, and the World Bank is financing road infrastructure improvements in both countries. Bilateral projects are also meeting energy needs, such as the South Sudan-Sudan energy pipeline and the Eastern Electricity Highway Project. The AfCFTA is being realised through individual nations coming together to meet trade needs, with projects such as the Lobito Corridor Railway project and the African Atlantic Gas Pipeline. These projects aim to boost energy security, provide new jobs, and distribute fuel to millions of customers, as envisioned by the AfCFTA architects. The UN Economic Commission on Africa has predicted that the AfCFTA will boost intra-Africa trade by up to 25% by 2040, earning up to US$70 billion in trade that would not exist otherwise.

**Will BRICS membership help the African Union develop its own free trade area?**
The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) aims to create a single market of 1.7 billion people and $6.5 trillion in GDP by 2030. The organization's goal is to integrate the economies of 55 African countries, which is a historic challenge. According to Amos Lugoloobi, the AfCFTA's objective is to seek more autonomy and have an alternative to the European Union and the United States. The partnership with the BRICS group is expected to diversify foreign investment, bring development to the region, and create a 'virtuous cycle' in African economies. As Alexandre dos Santos, creator of the podcast Mundioka, said, 'They want to integrate what has been happening historically, but without the umbrella of the entire African continent.' Benin, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, and Eritrea are some of the countries that are part of the AfCFTA. The professor at PUC-Rio, who was not named, mentioned that the history of the European Union is an example of the difficulties of building such a large economic project. The good relationship between African countries and China is also seen as a positive factor for the AfCFTA's success. As Rafael Abrão said, 'The expectations are high, and this optimism is justified by the historical approach between the continent and China in recent years.'

**AfCFTA is key to Africa's economic resilience – UN ECA report**
The UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) report 'Economic Report on Africa 2025' highlights the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement in addressing key sustainable development challenges in Africa. The report states that the AfCFTA Agreement can help boost trade-led growth, unlock regional value chains, and ensure that Africa transitions from being a supplier of raw materials to a producer of high-value goods and services. The report also notes that Africa can benefit from the new global trade landscape, characterized by fragmentation, regionalism, and near-shoring, as it incentivizes the continent to pursue deeper regional integration. The report projects that Africa's growth will gradually recover to 3.8% this year and 4.1% in 2026 on the back of increased private consumption and improved trade performance. However, while growth has rebounded post-pandemic, it remains subdued and is still below the level needed to improve people's living standards and reach the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The report proposes that Africa needs to reinforce the ongoing trend and look for its own, Africa-grown solutions for its development challenges. The AfCFTA Agreement can help address the continent's key challenges like energy gaps and food insecurity by fostering cross-border trade in energy products and encouraging African countries to adopt renewable-energy technologies. The report also notes that implementing climate policies could boost Africa's renewable energy use by 5% to 12% by 2045. The AfCFTA can also tackle food insecurity by enhancing food market integration and boosting intra-African food trade, helping reduce the impact of climatic events on production and prices. According to the report, a successful AfCFTA, driven by industrialisation and diversification, could significantly boost Africa's trade and drive transformational change. It could shift Africa from primary commodity exports to higher-value industrial products, while raising intra-African trade by almost half. The report also notes that the AfCFTA Agreement positions Africa to strengthen trade ties with rapidly growing emerging markets like China, India, and Türkiye, thereby strengthening its resilience against global shocks. The report highlights that successful implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement over the medium term could also contribute to global trade and growth, thereby enhancing Africa's competitiveness and its position as a global growth pole. If accompanied by supportive policies fostering trade and investment, the AfCFTA can build livelihoods and social cohesion, thus contributing to the integrated, peaceful, and prosperous Africa envisaged in the African Union 'Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want'. The report also notes that the full implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement by 2045 is expected to raise Africa's GDP by 1.2% and welfare by 0.9%.

**Diplomacy, Dollars, and Danger: Navigating Africa's Trade, Politics, and Militancy Maze**
To accelerate the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), nations must deepen their participation in Regional Economic Communities (RECs), establish more Customs Unions, and ratify the Free Movement of Persons Protocol (FMOPP) to create a truly borderless Africa. The AfCFTA has the potential to boost intra-African trade by over 52.3% by 2035, but success hinges on financial independence and a strategic break from foreign currency dependency. The Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) is a major breakthrough in this regard, enabling real-time transactions in local currencies and eliminating the need for USD or Euro conversions. However, achieving its full potential requires regulatory harmonization, cross-border adoption, and unwavering political support. Africa must also develop homegrown funding solutions that align with the AfCFTA Investment Protocol to overcome financial dependency on external donors. Furthermore, the continent must balance security and economic progress to ensure long-term stability, as geopolitical tensions threaten regional stability and disrupt trade networks.

**EAC launches trade watchdog for South Sudan**
The East African Community (EAC) has launched a new committee in South Sudan to oversee cross-border trade in pre-packaged food products and cosmetics. The committee, formed by the National Coordination Committee (NCC) for the EAC in South Sudan, aims to enhance the quality and safety of goods traded within the region. According to Ramadan Mfaume, a Senior Standards Officer at the East African Community Secretariat, the committee will facilitate the implementation of the EAC's framework for cross-border trade in pre-packaged goods. Gloria Nyoka, Executive Director of the South Sudan National Bureau of Standards (SSNBS), emphasized the importance of harmonizing standards to align with the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The newly formed committee will be chaired by Moses Kur from South Sudan's National Ministry of Trade and Industry and is expected to play a key role in facilitating cross-border trade in pre-packaged food and cosmetics.

**Five Years On, AfCFTA Struggles to Deliver on Its Promise**
The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has been struggling to deliver on its promise of boosting intra-African trade and accelerating economic development. Despite being launched in 2019 and commencing trading in 2021, implementation has been sluggish. According to Africa Kiiza, a trade policy analyst, the agreement's foundation was built on an overly simplistic assumption that tariff removal and trade liberalization alone would automatically lead to increased trade. Kiiza argues that production-related challenges, such as low industrial output, poor infrastructure, and non-tariff barriers, must be addressed before trade can flourish. As of 2025, 54 out of 55 African Union member countries have signed the agreement, but full execution remains distant, with the goal of removing tariffs on 90% of goods pushed back to 2034. Kiiza stresses that these hurdles challenge the production capacity of the continent and must be addressed before trade can flourish, reinforcing his point that tariff removal alone is insufficient. 'The idea that liberalization and tariff removal will automatically increase trade is flawed. We must first overcome production-related challenges to truly facilitate exchanges,' he explains.
