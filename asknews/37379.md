**2025 NBA Finals: Where to Watch the Decisive Games Live and Online**
The 2025 NBA Finals are set to begin on June 5th, with the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers facing off in the Eastern Conference, and the Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves competing in the Western Conference. The series will be played in the traditional 'best of seven' format, with the team winning four games first being crowned champions. The Thunder and Pacers have a slight advantage in the standings, but the Knicks and Timberwolves are still very much in the running, with talent and determination on their side. The finals are expected to be a thrilling and unpredictable ride, with the potential for upsets and historic moments. 'The Pacers have shown organization and a sharp collective game,' said Haliburton, the team's maestro. 'But the Knicks have grit and tradition. They haven't won a championship since 1973, and that drought is a motivating factor.' The Thunder, meanwhile, has relied on the potent offense of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and a well-adjusted defense. 'We're a young team, but we're mature,' said Shai. 'We're counting on our attack and defense to take us to the championship.' The finals are expected to be a wild ride, with the potential for upsets and historic moments. 'The best is yet to come,' said the NBA. 'Get ready for the most exciting and unpredictable finals in years!'

**A hidden stat is deciding the NBA's conference finals**
The 2025 NBA conference finals are being influenced by a hidden stat: ball pressure. Teams are using different tactics to apply pressure on their opponents, with some teams thriving when applying more pressure. The New York Knicks, for example, increased their pressure in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals, forcing the Indiana Pacers to waste time and ultimately leading to a Knicks win. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Timberwolves, who typically play aggressive defense, adjusted their strategy in the Western Conference finals, drawing back in instead of extending their pressure, which allowed Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to thrive. The Timberwolves' coach, Chris Finch, fixed his team's mistake by adjusting their approach, and the Thunder regained the tactical advantage in a crucial Game 4 win. Ball pressure is a key factor in the playoffs, and teams are constantly making adjustments to gain an edge.

**2025 NBA conference finals: Everything to know about Knicks-Pacers, Thunder-Wolves series**
The 2025 NBA conference finals are set, with the New York Knicks facing off against the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference, and the Oklahoma City Thunder taking on the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference. The Pacers are back in the conference finals for the second consecutive season, but the path has not always been linear. The Knicks, on the other hand, have had a remarkable run, despite being winless in 10 games against the league's three 60-win teams. 'Styles make series,' said one scout, 'the team that controls the style in which this series is played probably will win it and advance to the NBA Finals for the first time in more than a generation.' The Thunder, who have been the best team in the league all season, will need to perform at their best to take down the Timberwolves, who have won their first two series in five games each. 'That will be a fun as hell series,' said another scout, 'Minnesota is big and long, and comes at you in different ways.'

**NBA Playoff Picture 2025: Five games to watch on NBA final day, including Clippers vs. Warriors**
The NBA playoff picture is set to be decided on the final day of the season, with five games that will impact the final standings. The most significant game is between the Clippers and Warriors, with the winner finishing in the top six and the loser falling into the play-in tournament. The Clippers have won seven straight games, while the Warriors are 7-2 in their last nine. Both teams have stars who have proven themselves in clutch moments, and the game will be a closely contested one. Meanwhile, other games will determine the seeding for teams like the Timberwolves, Nuggets, and Mavericks, with some teams having a slim chance of moving up or down in the standings. As one observer noted, 'If the Warriors lose and fall to No. 7, then win the first play-in game (at home against Memphis), they avoid LeBron James, Luka Doncic and the Lakers in the first round and instead get the young, athletic but untested Rockets. Golden State might prefer Houston, but not at the price of falling into the play-in.'
