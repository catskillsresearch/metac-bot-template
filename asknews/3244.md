**I've written 30,000 wills  --  these are the strangest requests**
Robert and Gill Phipps, founders of Pembroke Will Writers, have written 30,000 wills and seen their fair share of unusual requests. One client paid them with a live crab, which they released back into the sea. They also dealt with a client who wanted to ensure their sons didn't spend their inheritance on 'fast cars and fast women', but couldn't put that in a will. The couple has also seen cases of people disagreeing with their loved ones' wishes, particularly since the pandemic. Robert Phipps, a former Royal Navy veteran and Kent policeman, emphasizes the importance of writing a will, especially in blended families, to avoid potential disputes. The business is planning a 25th-anniversary event on June 18.

**The Final Leg**
The author is wrapping up a 30-hour trip to the nation's capital and is looking forward to returning to normal on Tuesday. Despite a disappointing amount of softening in equities, sentiment remains 'giddy and exuberant'. The author notes that bulls are 'blind to any and all risks' and points to a ramping-up of geopolitical risk over the weekend, which gold is celebrating. The author also mentions a short-term inverted head and shoulders pattern in gold, suggesting it has a chance of pushing to lifetime highs. However, crude oil is spiking due to an OPEC+ announcement, which could impact the author's bearish energy plays. The author will be back to trading on Tuesday morning, ready to get back to their 'beloved rut'.

**The Last Days of Robert Johnson: A Graphic Novel Tribute**
Franz Duchazeau's graphic novel, 'Los últimos días de Robert Johnson', is a tribute to the legendary blues musician. The book explores Johnson's life, from his early days as a young musician to his untimely death at 27. Duchazeau's precise and delicate pencil work brings to life the rural landscapes and towns of the Mississippi Delta, where Johnson wandered from town to town, playing his guitar and struggling with racism and personal demons. The novel also delves into the myths surrounding Johnson's life, including the legend that he sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads in exchange for supernatural guitar skills. Duchazeau's work is a nuanced and artistic portrayal of a musician who left a lasting impact on the blues and rock genres, despite only recording 29 songs in his lifetime.

**Alma Guillermoprieto's 'La vida toda, Nueva crónica estadounidense': A Collection of Diverse and Thought-Provoking Texts**
Alma Guillermoprieto's book 'La vida toda, Nueva crónica estadounidense' is a collection of 15 recent texts chosen by the Mexican writer. The book begins by attributing to the chronicle the character of an antidote against a disease of our time: 'in this anxious century, there is a category of addicts who need to consume information through a constant bombardment of capsules, whether these correspond to the truth or not...'. Guillermoprieto justifies the inclusion of a text by Robert A. Caro, who has spent almost 50 years absorbed in a single historical report, the biography of Lyndon B. Johnson, president number 36 of the United States. Caro advises aspiring chroniclers to 'never assume anything', and to use silence as an instrument, as the famous fictional interviewers Maigret and George Smiley do. The book includes a variety of texts, including a crónica by Gideon Lewis-Kraus about the role of cats in social media, and a text by Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah about the monstrous habit of mass shootings in the United States. The book also includes a text by George Saunders about the supporters of Donald Trump, and a text by Elizabeth Weil about Aleksander Doba, a Polish man who crossed the Atlantic Ocean alone in a kayak at the age of 71. The book is a collection of diverse and thought-provoking texts that explore the complexities of the human experience.

**We Rediscovered Robert Caro's Abandoned Novel About an Intrepid Journalist. Read Never-Before-Seen Excerpts Here**
Robert Caro, a renowned biographer, has revealed that he wrote a novel about an intrepid journalist, but it was never published. The novel, titled 'News Man: A Novel' or 'The Ladies in the Lobby', was based on Caro's experiences as an investigative reporter for Newsday. The story follows a journalist who encounters women who have turned to newspapers as a last resort for justice. Caro's novel drew inspiration from his own life and work, including his famous Newsday series 'Misery Acres'. Despite having written 15 folders of fragments, the novel remains unfinished. Caro's editor, Robert Gottlieb, reportedly told him to 'forget this' after reviewing a draft, but Caro is unsure what Gottlieb meant. Caro has since returned to working on his Lyndon B. Johnson biography, which he has been writing for years.

**When did the media go wrong? A new book blames Robert Caro.**
In his new book, Why Nothing Works, author Marc Dunkelman argues that American media lost its way in 1974, when the Washington Post took down Richard Nixon and the New Yorker published a biography of Robert Moses. Dunkelman blames Robert Caro, the author of The Power Broker, for this shift, describing him as 'Abbie Hoffman in a tweed suit'. Caro's book, a 1,246-page biography of Moses, is a legend of American biography, but Dunkelman puts it back into context, arguing that it reflected a new worldview that was skeptical of power and its use. Dunkelman believes that Watergate and The Power Broker embodied a new sort of negative naivete, where journalism became about holding power to account, rather than celebrating its successes. As Moses himself protested, 'If not, we wouldn’t build anything!' Dunkelman's book challenges the conventional wisdom that Caro's work is detached from any time or place, and instead sees it as a product of its time, reflecting a cultural change in the way journalists viewed power.

**Rifling Through the Archives With Legendary Historian Robert Caro**
Robert Caro, a renowned historian, has spent most of his life researching and writing about the lives of powerful individuals, including Lyndon B. Johnson. He has been working on a five-volume biography of Johnson for over 50 years, and has recently opened his archive at the New York Historical. Caro's approach to writing is unique, as he always knows the final line of his book before he starts writing. He believes that this approach helps him to see the entire story and how it all ties together. Caro's writing process is meticulous and time-consuming, and he has been working on the fifth volume of his Johnson biography for 'a long time.' He is captivated by every detail he uncovers and is determined to complete the book without changing or hurrying his process. Caro's archive contains over 120 boxes of material, including notebooks, interview notes, and other research. He hopes that the archive will be a valuable resource for future historians and will help to bring to life figures in American history that ought to be brought to life.

**Is Elon Musk A Modern-Day Robert Moses?**
Robert Moses, a notorious power broker in U.S. history, has been studied by politicians due to journalist Robert Caro's Pulitzer-Prize-winning biography, The Power Broker. Moses' life story, which involved accumulating power in New York and abusing it, bears similarities to Elon Musk's approach to government efficiency. While some, like Newt Gingrich and Elon Musk, may see Caro's book as an instruction manual, others, like Barack Obama, view it as a warning about the dangers of unchecked power. Obama, who awarded Caro a literary honor in 2010, said, 'I read it when I was young and just starting my career in public service, It helped me understand power in America.' The question remains whether Musk's plans for government efficiency will follow the same path as Moses', who was known for cutting government workers and abusing his power.

**The Untitled Robert Johnson Biopic Unveiled in Honor of the King of the Delta Blues**
A biopic about the life of Robert Johnson, the King of the Delta Blues, is set to be released. Johnson's legacy has endured for decades, influencing artists such as the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, and Jimi Hendrix. Despite only recording 29 songs during his lifetime, Johnson's music addressed themes of love, loss, and betrayal, and showcased his signature finger-picking and slide guitar style. Michael Johnson, the singer's grandson, said that his grandfather's story is 'significant to American history' and highlights how talent can shine through adversity. The biopic, written by Ridgeway Wilson, will peel back the enigma of Johnson's real-life story and is authorized by his estate. A release date has not yet been announced.
