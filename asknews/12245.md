**Solar Flares Accelerate Starlink Satellite Fall to Earth, Raising Concerns**
A recent study by the Goddard Space Flight Center, a NASA facility, found that geomagnetic storms caused by solar flares can accelerate the fall of Starlink satellites to Earth, due to increased atmospheric drag at low altitudes. The study revealed that these satellites, which often orbit at altitudes below 300 kilometers, become more susceptible to burning up in the atmosphere faster than expected, with their orbital lifetime decreasing by about 10 days during storm periods. The Starlink constellation is particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon as the sun approaches its peak activity, which occurs every 11 years. Researchers warn that the risk lies in the possibility of unburned debris from these satellites reaching the Earth's surface, according to the British Independent newspaper. Actual cases of debris falling have been recorded, including in February 2022, when most of the 49 Starlink satellites launched by SpaceX fell to Earth shortly after launch due to a geomagnetic storm. A piece of a satellite was also found on a farm in Canada in August 2024. With over 7,000 Starlink satellites currently in orbit, SpaceX plans to increase the number to 30,000, raising concerns about the environmental and safety implications of space debris falling to Earth.

**Musk: Chances of Starship Flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50**
Elon Musk said that the chances of Starship flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50. The spacecraft has already completed nine test flights, with the last one taking place on May 27. However, the mission ended in an emergency due to a fuel leak. The previous flights in January and March also ended in failure, with the spacecraft exploding within the first 10 minutes of flight. Despite this, Musk is optimistic about the progress made and believes that the data collected will help improve the spacecraft. The next version of Starship, Version 3, is expected to be 124.4 meters tall and will be capable of flying to Mars. The spacecraft will be reusable and will have a refueling system on orbit, which is necessary for long-distance space travel. The first flight of this version is planned for the end of this year, and if successful, Starship may fly to Mars as early as next year. SpaceX plans to send five Starship Version 3 spacecraft to Mars in 2026 to test the spacecraft and its technologies. However, Musk believes that it will be challenging to achieve this goal, citing the need to master the refueling of Starship in space as the main problem. He estimates the chances of success as 50/50. If successful, SpaceX plans to send around 20 spacecraft to Mars in 2028-2029, which may be crewed. However, Musk also suggests that two robotic landings may be conducted before sending humans. The final decision will be made later. In the third launch window (2030-2031), up to 100 Starship spacecraft may be sent to Mars, and in the next window (2033), up to 500. SpaceX is currently searching for a suitable location for a Martian city, which should be relatively far from the poles, have access to water ice, and have a flat surface for landings and takeoffs. The main candidate is the Arcadia Planitia region. The ultimate goal is to create a self-sufficient settlement on Mars with a population of over a million people, which will require transporting millions of tons of cargo. According to Musk, the construction and maintenance of such a city will be carried out using Starship, possibly its future 142-meter version. During periods of Earth-Mars alignment, thousands of upper stages of the spacecraft will be able to arrive and depart.

**The moon: Why we want to go back**
NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole, called Artemis Base Camp, and launch a new space station, Gateway, into the moon's orbit. A joint China-Russia project, the International Lunar Research Station, also plans to build a moon base by 2035. The moon's resources, including water, regolith, and helium-3, make it an attractive destination for future space missions. These resources can be used to sustain lunar bases, extract minerals from asteroids, and even provide fuel for nuclear fusion power. The moon's distance from Earth also makes it an ideal location for testing technologies and equipment for future Mars missions. According to Sara Pastor, ESA's Lunar and Gateway Program Manager, 'Humans have had a continued presence in space for the past 20 years aboard the International Space Station. But the ISS is only 250 miles away in low-Earth orbit, which is as little as four hours after launching from Earth. The moon is 250,000 miles away -- about three days' spaceflight -- and a far riskier journey for astronauts.' The first research on the moon aims to make that journey safer and easier, and to determine how human activity affects the lunar environment. 'ESA is developing instruments for radiation environment measurements, drilling and in-situ sample analysis, geophysics and lunar space weather,' Pastor said. The long-term goal of building surface and orbital moon bases is to serve as a staging post for more distant space travel, and to provide a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration, as Pastor noted, 'A colony on the moon will be extremely useful and a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration.'

**NASA Prepares for Solar Storms: Protecting Astronauts from Radiation Risks**
As we are in the solar maximum phase of the 25th solar cycle, which began in December 2019 and is expected to end around 2030, there is a real risk to space missions, especially those that travel beyond Earth's orbit. Without a dense atmosphere or a magnetic field to act as a natural shield, astronauts are exposed to direct radiation from solar storms, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares. Ian Cohen, deputy chief scientist for space exploration at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, explained that most spacecraft designed for human exploration, including those for the Artemis program, are built to protect astronauts from radiation risks. 'There are also protocols in place at NASA to monitor and respond to such events and areas of the spacecraft specifically designed where astronauts can take refuge,' Cohen added. The Orion spacecraft is equipped with radiation detectors and warning and alert systems, and crew members will wear active dosimeters to monitor their exposure. The biggest threat arises when astronauts perform extravehicular activities in space or on the lunar surface. In such cases, NASA may modify or cancel these activities to ensure the safety of the crew. The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is working with NASA's radiation experts to strengthen support for space weather for human missions to the Moon. 'We are well-prepared' for the upcoming Artemis II mission, they say, and will do 'the best job of predicting, warning, and alerting astronauts' in case of solar events that could pose a health risk. Currently, there is a good set of forecasting tools, with improved modeling capabilities, higher-quality data, and advanced technology to detect and warn about solar events that could affect astronaut health. However, more detailed information is needed about the duration and intensity of solar events to improve forecasts. The launch of the NOAA's GOES-U satellite and the Space Weather Follow On Lagrange 1 (SWFO-L1) satellite in June will significantly contribute to this task.

**Elon Musk targets 2026 for first space mission to Mars**
Elon Musk aims to launch the first space mission to Mars by the end of 2026, but acknowledges that overcoming technological hurdles, particularly in-orbit refueling, is crucial for the long journey. A favorable planetary alignment in late 2026 provides a unique opportunity for a relatively short transit between Earth and Mars. If Starship is not ready by then, a new mission in 2028 would be targeted. The first mission would consist of -built Optimus humanoid robots. Despite failed test flights, including a fuel leak and uncontrolled spinning on the ninth test flight, Musk remains optimistic, citing each failure as valuable data for accelerated testing. NASA relies on Starship for its Artemis program, which aims to send astronauts to the moon as early as 2027, a stepping stone to possible human missions to Mars in the 2030s. Musk's ultimate vision is to launch up to 2,000 Starships every two years to establish a permanent and self-sustaining human settlement on Mars.

**Musk retains plan to fly Starship to Mars in 2026 despite setbacks**
Elon Musk has reaffirmed his plan to send Starship to Mars in 2026, despite recent setbacks in test flights. Musk stated that the success of this mission depends on Starship's ability to accomplish several challenging technical feats, including a post-launch refueling manoeuvre in earth orbit. He gave SpaceX a 50% chance of meeting the deadline. If not, the company will wait two years before trying again. Musk envisions launching 1,000 to 2,000 ships to Mars every two years to establish a self-sustaining human settlement. NASA plans to return humans to the moon aboard Starship in 2027, with the goal of launching astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. Musk has previously aimed to send an uncrewed vehicle to Mars by 2018 and a crewed mission by 2024, but has since pushed back the timeline.

**US company to use giant spinning cannon to blast hundreds of pancake-like 'microsatellites' into space**
SpinLaunch, a California-based startup, plans to launch hundreds of 'microsatellites' into low-Earth orbit using a giant centrifugal cannon. The first batch of 250 satellites, built by NanoAvionics, could be launched as soon as next year. Each satellite will be shaped like a flat disk and weigh approximately 154 pounds, making them significantly lighter than most other communications satellites. If successful, this would set a new record for most spacecraft launched at once. SpinLaunch aims to establish its own satellite constellation, Meridian Space, which could provide more cost-effective competition to SpaceX's Starlink network. The company predicts that its future commercial launches could cost between $1,250 and $2,500 per kilogram launched into space, which is less than half the cost of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets. However, this ambitious launch frequency could exacerbate problems in low-Earth orbit, including increased chances of spacecraft collisions and light pollution.

**SpinLaunch Plans LEO Broadband Constellation, Built by Kongsberg NanoAvionics**
SpinLaunch, a startup developing a steel vacuum chamber to launch satellites, is planning a Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) broadband constellation called Meridian Space. The constellation is backed by a $12 million investment from Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace and will be built by Kongsberg NanoAvionics, which has secured a contract valued at 122.5 million euros ($135 million). The initial constellation will consist of 280 satellites, with plans for a future constellation of 1,190 high-throughput satellites. SpinLaunch claims it can provide global coverage with a single traditional rocket launch, and remains committed to advancing its kinetic launch system. The satellites will feature ultra-efficient reflectarray antenna technology, and will be designed to be lighter than currently operational satcom platforms. According to SpinLaunch director of Satellite programs Sev Sandomirsky, the payload is 'both a reflect array and a bent pipe,' making it a low-power, beam steering antenna. 'This means that it is a low-power, beam steering antenna, as opposed to a direct radiating phased array that uses much more power and is much more complex,' Sandomirsky said. The constellation will have a unique orbital architecture featuring a repeating ground track, simplifying user terminals and gateways. 'We are now excited to officially bring our low-cost, dynamic communications service to enterprise customers worldwide,' said David Wrenn, CEO of SpinLaunch.

**Russia Enters the Satellite Internet Race with 'Bureau 1440' Project**
Russia plans to create its own low-orbit satellite group to provide high-speed internet access. This ambitious task is part of the national project 'Economy of Data' and could lead to significant changes in the telecommunications market. The global race for satellite internet has been ongoing, with SpaceX leading the way with its Starlink project, which has over 4,750 operational satellites and serves over 2 million customers in 60 countries. However, Russia does not want to be left behind and has announced its own project, 'Sfera', which aims to launch a satellite group to provide connectivity across the country. The company 'IKS Holding' has already launched the first three low-orbit satellites as part of the 'Bureau 1440' project, with plans to launch 700 satellites by 2035. According to Mikhail Mishustin, the Prime Minister of Russia, the goal is to create a group that will meet the needs of fast internet not only in Russia but also in friendly countries. The project has already undergone several test launches, including a successful test of a laser communication system with a data transfer speed of up to 10 Gbps over a distance of 1,000 km. Experts note that creating a Russian analogue of Starlink is a complex and ambitious task that will require significant financial and technological resources. 'We have never had a low-orbit satellite group, which should appear by 2028... To solve this problem, which has not been solved for decades, using a low-orbit satellite group is possible,' said Denis Kuskov, general director of the analytical agency TelecomDaily. The project 'Bureau 1440' will compete with the 'Sfera' project from Roscosmos, which also aims to create a satellite group for internet access. According to Mikhail Mishustin, the goal is to increase the number of satellites in orbit by several times, which will significantly improve the quality of services for the state, citizens, and business. 'To implement the tasks set by the President, it is necessary to increase the composition of the orbital group of spacecraft by several times, which will allow significantly improving the quality of services for the state, citizens, and business,' said Mikhail Mishustin. The head of Roscosmos, Yuri Borisov, announced that the production of satellites in Russia will start in 2026, which will require 60 billion rubles. It remains to be seen whether this ambitious task will be implemented.
