**Kneecap say Glastonbury slot at risk after terrorism charge**
The Irish rap group Kneecap claims they are being made a 'scapegoat' after one of their members, Mo Chara, was charged with a terrorism-related offence for allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag at a London gig in November 2024. The group denies the charge and says it's 'political policing' and a 'carnival of distraction' from the real issue of genocide in Gaza. They announced a last-minute gig at London's 100 Club, which sold out in 90 seconds, with Chara taking the stage with tape over his mouth in a symbolic protest. The group believes the timing of the charge is deliberate, coming just ahead of their scheduled Glastonbury appearance, and says they are being targeted to prevent them from speaking out at the festival.

The Metropolitan Police said a 'policing plan' was in place for the event, but there were no issues or arrests reported. O'Hanna is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on June 18.

**Irish Hip-Hop Group 'Kneecap' Member Charged with Terrorism-Related Offenses**
The British police have charged a 27-year-old member of the Irish hip-hop group 'Kneecap' with terrorism-related offenses for allegedly waving a Hezbollah flag during a performance in London last year. Liam O'G O'Hanlon, known by his stage name 'Mow Sharah', has been accused of supporting a proscribed organization under the Terrorism Act. The incident occurred at the Kennington Town Forum on November 21, 2024. O'Hanlon is scheduled to appear in court on June 18, 2025, as investigations continue into another concert held in November 2023. The group, known for reviving Irish Gaelic culture in Belfast, has been at the center of controversy after videos surfaced showing members chanting slogans in support of Hamas and Hezbollah, and calling for the murder of lawmakers. The group has denied supporting any proscribed organizations, accusing 'establishment figures' of taking their statements out of context to create a 'phony moral hysteria.' The group has faced pressure, leading to the cancellation of several performances, and some lawmakers have called for them to be banned from performing at the upcoming Glastonbury Festival.

**Kneecap claims terrorism charge is a 'witch-hunt' to prevent Glastonbury performance**
Irish rap group Kneecap has claimed that a terrorism charge against one of their members is a 'witch-hunt' to prevent them from performing at Glastonbury this summer. The charge is related to the display of a Hezbollah flag at a gig in London last year. The band's Mo Chara (Liam Og O hAnnaidh) said, 'There's a reason why what's happened to me, happened before Glastonbury... There's a reason they're trying to f**king stop me speaking at Glastonbury in front of the UK.' The group believes the charge is 'political policing' aimed at suppressing criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza. They also accused the British establishment of focusing on them instead of addressing the real issue of genocide in Gaza. The Metropolitan Police said they were at the venue to manage visitors to the sold-out event, but Kneecap denied the 'offence' and vowed to defend themselves.

TRNSMT festival bosses have announced British singer James Bay as a special guest for the event on July 11, amid calls for Irish rap group Kneecap to be axed from the festival's lineup.

**Kneecap surprise London gig: 'They're trying to stop me speaking at Glastonbury'**
Belfast rap trio Kneecap claimed that a campaign is being mounted to prevent their performance at Glastonbury this summer, after a surprise gig at the 100 Club in London. The group said they are being used as a 'scapegoat' because they 'spoke about the genocide [in Gaza]' at the Coachella music festival in the US last month. One of the band members, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, was charged with a terrorism offence for allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hizbullah at a gig in London last November. The band said the charge is 'political policing' intended to stifle criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza. They announced an impromptu gig after the charge, which sold out in 90 seconds with 2,000 people on the waiting list. The band said they will 'vehemently contest' the charge, which they called 'politically motivated' and intended to 'restrict our ability to travel' and 'silence voices of compassion'.

**Kneecap accuse authorities of trying to 'silence' them as member of Irish rap trio is charged with terrorism offences after 'displaying a flag in support for Hezbollah' | Daily Mail Online**
Irish rap trio Kneecap claim that the charging of one of their members, Liam O'Hanna, with a terror offence in the UK is an attempt to 'silence' them. O'Hanna is alleged to have displayed a flag in support of Hezbollah while the group performed at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town last year. Kneecap described the charge as 'political policing' and stated that they will 'victoriously defend' themselves. The group claims that the authorities are trying to restrict their ability to travel and speak to young people across the world, and that they are being targeted for speaking out against the war in Gaza. Kneecap has been involved in several high-profile controversies in response to the war in Gaza, including being banned from concerts and calls for their Glastonbury set to be axed. The group has also received criticism and censorship over their music and has been in dispute with now-Tory leader Kemi Badenoch. O'Hanna is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on June 18. 'We deny this 'offence' and will vehemently defend ourselves. This is political policing. This is a carnival of distraction. We are not the story. Genocide is. As they profit from genocide, they use an 'anti-terror law' against us for displaying a flag thrown on stage. 'A charge not serious enough to even warrant their 'crown court', instead a court that doesn't have a jury. What's the objective? 'To restrict our ability to travel. To prevent us speaking to young people across the world. To silence voices of compassion. To prosecute artists who dare speak out. 'Instead of defending innocent people, or the principles of international law they claim to uphold, the powerful in Britain have abetted slaughter and famine in Gaza, just as they did in Ireland for centuries. 'Then, like now, they claim justification. The IDF units they arm and fly spy plane missions for are the real terrorists, the whole world can see it. 'WE STAND PROUDLY WITH THE PEOPLE. YOU STAND COMPLICIT WITH THE WAR CRIMINALS. WE ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY. YOU ARE NOT. WE WILL FIGHT YOU IN YOUR COURT. WE WILL WIN. FREE PALESTINE.'

**Kneecap threaten to sue industry critics who want a Glastonbury ban**
Irish republican rap trio Kneecap have threatened to sue music industry figures who called for them to be banned from this year's Glastonbury Festival lineup. The band is currently under investigation by police after footage emerged of them shouting 'up Hezbollah, up Hamas' and 'kill your local MP' at music events in 2023 and 2024. Music agents allegedly wrote to Glastonbury founder Emily Eavis and other festival organisers, urging them to ban the group. Kneecap's lawyers have accused those behind the complaint of making 'untrue and defamatory' claims, and have demanded an 'unequivocal' apology or face high court action. The band has been dropped from several music festivals this summer, but others have stood by them, refusing to cancel their performances. Kneecap's manager has been accused of praising terror leaders and comparing Israel to the Nazis in social media posts.

**POLL: Should Kneecap be banned from performing at Glastonbury?**
The Irish republican band Kneecap is under scrutiny after making a series of political statements. A video from a November 2023 gig appears to show a band member saying, 'The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.' Another video is being assessed by the Metropolitan Police, which appears to show a band member saying 'up Hamas, up Hezbollah' at a London performance in November last year. This is a crime in the UK, as Hamas and Hezbollah are banned. The band's statements have sparked a debate about whether they should be allowed to perform at Glastonbury.

Rap group Kneecap is facing mounting pressure to be dropped from the Glastonbury festival after a video surfaced of them telling fans to 'kill your local MP' and shouting 'the only good Tory is a dead Tory'. The band's comments have been widely condemned, with the Prime Minister's official spokesman calling their lyrics 'completely unacceptable'. Kneecap's DJ Provai performs onstage at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California - April 11, 2025. The band has also been criticized for their support of Palestinian terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah, which they displayed at Coachella. The group's manager Daniel Lambert said they have received 'severe' death threats after Coachella. Kneecap has apologized to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox, saying they 'never intended to cause you hurt'. The band has also faced criticism from Tory leader Kemi Badenoch, who has called for them to face prosecution. The UK Government has condemned threatening remarks made towards any individual, and all reports of intimidation, harassment and threats are taken extremely seriously. Kneecap has been dropped from the Eden Sessions, a series of concerts held at the Eden Project in Cornwall this summer. The band's visas are understood to no longer be valid, and they are in the process of securing a new sponsor ahead of its sellout October tour in North America.
