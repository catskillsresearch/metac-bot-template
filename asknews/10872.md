**Seattle Mariners Complete Surprising Trade By Dealing Hard-Throwing Reliever**
The Seattle Mariners have made a surprising trade, dealing hard-throwing reliever Will Klein to the Los Angeles Dodgers. In return, they acquired left-handed reliever Joe Jacques from the Dodgers. Jacques is a 30-year-old journeyman with a 5.46 ERA in his career, and has struggled in Triple-A this season. The Mariners could use a second lefty in their bullpen, and Jacques could potentially take the spot currently held by Casey Lawrence. However, Trent Thornton is also expected back soon, complicating matters. Jacques is under contract through 2030 and has a 4.00 ERA in his minor league career. The Mariners are currently in first place in the American League West, but face a busy schedule ahead with several roster decisions to make.

**Texas on the Brink of Total Ban on THC Products as Governor Abbott Decides on Key Bills**
Texas is on the verge of a total ban on THC products as Governor Greg Abbott is set to decide on two key bills that could transform the state's healthcare and cannabis industries. The Senate Bill 3 proposes a strict regulation, effectively a ban, on products containing THC derived from cannabis, which could affect an industry worth $8 billion annually in Texas. The bill aims to regulate products with psychoactive cannabinoids derived from cannabis, which are currently sold freely in specialized and convenience stores without a medical prescription or precise regulation. If Abbott does not sign or veto the bill within the 10-day deadline, it will automatically become law. The other key legislation, SB 31, also known as the 'Life of the Mother Act', seeks to establish clearer definitions and legal protections around medical exceptions to abortion, a highly sensitive and politically charged topic in Texas since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. The bill requires that medical treatments be performed in a way that maximizes the chances of fetal survival, but allows doctors to prioritize the mother's well-being if it increases the risk to her life or health. Abbott has until June 12 to decide on the bills, and if he does not act, they will become law automatically.

**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**Trump Warns of Economic Ruin if Tariffs are Overturned**
US President Donald Trump stated that the US economy would face severe consequences if the American courts were to overturn the import tariffs he introduced. Trump made this claim on June 1 in a post on the social media platform Truth Social. He wrote, 'If the courts somehow rule against us on tariffs, which is not expected, it will allow other countries to hold our country hostage with their anti-American tariffs, which they will use against us. This would mean economic ruin for the United States of America!' The US appeals court reinstated Trump's tariffs on May 29, but the new ruling does not provide any specific definitions and 'creates new uncertainty about the fate of Trump's tariffs'.

**Supreme Court to Decide on Travel Ban for Former Interior Minister Juan José Santiváñez**
The Supreme Court of Peru will decide on June 3rd whether to impose a travel ban on former Interior Minister Juan José Santiváñez as part of a preliminary investigation into alleged corruption. The court will review an appeal by the National Prosecutor's Office to overturn a previous ruling by Judge Juan Carlos Checkley, who declared the travel ban request unfounded on March 20th. The Supreme Court will hear arguments from both sides and is expected to make a decision in the coming days. The investigation centers around allegations that Santiváñez, in his capacity as a lawyer, accepted a bribe in 2024 to influence a favorable ruling in the Constitutional Tribunal. Santiváñez has denied these claims, stating that he does not know any of the Constitutional Tribunal magistrates. He is also facing another preliminary investigation into alleged abuse of authority against the state. This investigation was sparked by leaked conversations between Santiváñez and a police captain, in which he allegedly asked the officer to control a journalist, among other things. Santiváñez has repeatedly denied being the author of the recordings and conversations presented as evidence in this case.

**US Federal Court Rules Against Public Library in Book Removal Case**
The US Federal Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that a public library in Texas did not violate the right to information (part of the freedom of expression) of its patrons by removing 17 books with content that the government did not like. The books, now prohibited, contain racial, sexual, and supposed vulgarities, such as the word 'bumbum' in a children's humor book, 'I broke my butt'. The court's majority decision, written by Judge Stuart Kyle Duncan, states that the decision to remove books from a library is based on the government's freedom of expression and cannot be challenged by patrons. The court also overturned a previous decision by a federal judge and a panel of three judges from the same court, which had ruled that the removal of the books was unconstitutional and ordered them to be returned to the shelves. The decision is seen as a threat to the freedom of expression and the role of public libraries as institutions of knowledge, rather than political institutions. The dissenting opinion, written by Judge Stephen Higginson, criticizes the government's attempt to undermine the mission of public libraries and defends the importance of access to a wide range of information and ideas. The case is now headed to the US Supreme Court.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Letters to the Editor  --  Runoff, hunger, reservoir, humanities, potholes, Commandments**
Letters to the Editor from The Dallas Morning News discuss various topics such as the Irving runoff election, hunger, the Marvin Nichols Reservoir, the importance of humanities in education, and the posting of the Ten Commandments in classrooms. Sergio Porres is endorsed for Irving City Council at-large District 2 due to his opposition to a casino in Irving. Timothy Norman argues that hunger is a personal choice as well as a policy choice, while Tracy Wallace emphasizes the need for infrastructure to support the growing population of North Texas. Holmes Brannon advocates for the construction of the Marvin Nichols Reservoir to meet the water needs of the region. V.C. Patterson highlights the importance of humanities in education, citing the example of a company that prefers to hire liberal arts graduates. Steven R. Butler criticizes the Texas legislature for voting to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms, arguing that it is a sectarian law that will likely be overturned in court.

**The U.S. Supreme Court Could Realistically End Cannabis Prohibition in the Near Future**
The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently rejected a lawsuit by Massachusetts-based cannabis businesses seeking to overturn the federal ban on marijuana. However, the plaintiffs' attorney, Jonathan Schiller, said they will seek Supreme Court review. Justice Clarence Thomas has expressed skepticism about the federal government's approach to marijuana policy, and some legal experts believe the case has a realistic chance of being taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Court takes up the case, the three liberal justices may side with Justice Thomas in ending prohibition, potentially ending the federal ban on personal freedom grounds. A decision could be expected by mid-2026, potentially making it a key issue for the midterm elections.

**Josh Duggar Requests New Lawyer to Help Overturn Child Porn Conviction**
Josh Duggar, 37, has requested a court-appointed attorney to help him overturn his 2022 conviction on child pornography charges. In a letter submitted to the court, Duggar claimed he cannot afford a lawyer due to his current financial circumstances. He is seeking a lawyer to evaluate potential 'constitutional violations' and prepare a motion to vacate or correct his conviction and sentence. Duggar alleged errors in the admission of forensic evidence during his trial and that prosecutors did not disclose full evidence due to the 'broad publicity' of the case. He also claimed that new legal theories have emerged that may be relevant to his case. Duggar's request comes nearly a year after the Supreme Court rejected his appeal. He is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence at FCI Seagoville in Texas and will be released in 2032.

**VAACS Appellate Chamber Overturns Onyshchenko's Verdict and Sends Case for New Review**
The Appellate Chamber of the Higher Anti-Corruption Court (VAACS) has overturned the verdict against former Ukrainian MP Alexander Onyshchenko and another defendant, and sent the case for a new review. 'After reviewing the case, the court of appeal of VAACS left the prosecutor's appeal without satisfaction, partially satisfied the appeals of the defense, the representative of the company, and the civil plaintiff, and canceled the verdict of VAACS and appointed a new review of the criminal case in the first instance court, in another part, the appeals were left without satisfaction,' the court said in a statement published on social media. The Center for Combating Corruption (CCP) notes that the case has been in appeal for over a year, and before that, it was on the VAACS agenda for almost 5 years. The deadline for Onyshchenko's criminal liability expires in 2031. The Higher Anti-Corruption Court has already sentenced Onyshchenko in absentia. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) reported the completion of the pre-trial investigation. Onyshchenko has been in hiding since 2016. German law enforcement authorities detained him, but Germany refused to extradite him to Ukraine.'

**California appeals court upholds ban on higher-capacity magazines, spurring unusual video dissent**
A California appeals court upheld the state's ban on higher-capacity gun magazines, ruling that they are not protected under the Second Amendment. The 7-4 decision was met with a dissenting opinion from Judge Lawrence VanDyke, who recorded a video showing how guns are loaded and fired, arguing that the ban is arbitrary and could be used to restrict other gun accessories. The majority opinion cited a 2022 Supreme Court ruling that prioritizes historical tradition over public safety concerns. California Attorney General Rob Bonta praised the decision, stating that the law 'saves lives' by limiting the capacity of lone shooters to cause mass casualties.

**Elizabeth Holmes fails to overturn her Theranos fraud conviction**
Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the disgraced blood-testing startup Theranos, has lost her bid to overturn her fraud conviction. A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that Holmes had not proven any legal missteps during her trial for defrauding investors with false claims about her company's technology. Holmes, who is currently serving an 11-year sentence in a Texas federal prison, claimed that Theranos had developed a revolutionary medical device that could detect diseases from a few drops of blood, but the technology never worked. Holmes and her former business partner Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani were ordered to pay $452 million in restitution. Holmes' listed release date is March 19, 2032, while Balwani is set to be released in 2033. As Judge Jacqueline Nguyen wrote in the 54-page ruling, 'they failed to prove any violations or major errors by the lower court.'

**From the Bench: Can forensic evidence overturn a conviction based on admission?**
In a recent case, Lawrence Abina was convicted of murdering Rita Ellul in 2022. Abina had admitted to the crime on three separate occasions, but appealed his conviction based on a discrepancy between his statements and forensic evidence. The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed his appeal, holding that the minor discrepancy did not undermine the fact that Ellul was indeed strangled to death by Abina, as confirmed by his own admissions. The court concluded that the jury had been correctly guided on the law and that its guilty verdict was justified beyond reasonable doubt. As noted by Lord Widgery, 'if the overall feel of a case left the court with a 'lurking doubt' as to whether an injustice may have been done, then a conviction will be quashed, notwithstanding that the trial was error-free'. However, the court will not take too kindly to vexatious attempts at circumventing the legal system in order to attain an acquittal by trying to extract doubt from ill-founded premises.

**Evsyukov's Defense Attempts to Overturn Life Sentence**
The defense team of former Moscow police officer Denis Evsyukov, who was sentenced to life in prison for a 2009 shooting at a Moscow supermarket, has attempted to overturn the verdict. According to RIA Novosti, the grounds for the appeal were alleged investigative irregularities. One of the key points of contention was a bullet hole in a victim's shoe. Evsyukov was convicted of shooting and killing two people and injuring over 20 others at the 'Ostrov' supermarket in April 2009. The Moscow City Court sentenced him to life in prison, leading to several police resignations. The defense claims that one of the victims threw away his shoe, which had a bullet hole, and that this could have been caused by a different source. They also argue that the bullet casings and bullet found by the victim do not constitute conclusive evidence, as the victim could have found them at the scene. However, the Supreme Court rejected these arguments and upheld the verdict. Evsyukov will be eligible for parole after serving 25 years, in 2034. It was previously reported that Evsyukov has been avoiding paying compensation to the victims, with a court ruling that he owes two of them approximately 650,000 rubles.

**Oil Giant Shell Wins Appeal, Loses All Remaining Scraps of Moral Integrity**
The Hague Court of Appeal has overturned a previous ruling, allowing Shell to avoid cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030. The court acknowledged that there is a fundamental human right to be protected from the catastrophic effects of climate change, but did not provide enough evidence to force Shell to meet specific reduction targets. Shell's victory does not change the fact that it remains one of the world's most significant contributors to environmental destruction. The claimants may take this fight to the Dutch Supreme Court, but until governments hold Shell accountable, the cycle of climate accountability will continue. As John Donovan, the owner of this website, notes, 'Shell's legal victory doesn't change the fact that it remains one of the world's most shameless purveyors of environmental destruction.'
