**7 Upcoming IPOs To Watch In 2025**

Panera Bread is a bakery-restaurant chain that has been flirting with the idea of going public for a while.

**Amid the AI arms race, these IPOs could be poised for long-term investor success**
The AI sector is expected to continue its growth, but investors face a dilemma due to high share prices of public companies. However, new AI firms are poised to go public, including Cerebras, a California-based chipmaker, and CoreWeave, a cloud-computing company targeting a $35 billion public offering in 2025. According to Dzung Nguyen, a Wells Fargo banker, a new era of public offerings is underway, with more AI startups ready to list. Kelly Rodriques, CEO of Forge Global, says Cerebras and CoreWeave are 'interesting AI companies to watch,' but notes they are not in the same category as top AI companies like OpenAI and Databricks. Garrett Hinds, a senior analyst at PitchBook, explains that AI startups can raise massive rounds from venture investors without needing to go public, where increased scrutiny and disclosure can lead to deflated valuations.

**IPOs: A Dry Well or a Geyser of Capital?**
Despite the surge in optimism on Wall Street, the attractiveness of the stock market remains a concern for companies going public. According to Renaissance Capital, the number of IPO applications has increased by 33% and 47% for price fixations and prospectus deposits, respectively, but the amount raised has decreased by 4%. Venture Global, the largest IPO of 2025, ended its first trading session down 4% despite lowering its ambitions. Donald Trump's 'Drill, baby, drill' campaign aims to keep prices low for Americans, and Venture Global's $1.8 billion raise, based on a total value of $67 billion, is the largest energy sector IPO in a decade. In contrast, Databricks, a non-listed company, has raised $10 billion in a private funding round, with Meta and sovereign funds participating, valuing the company at $62 billion. Databricks' CEO Ali Ghodsi does not need to be listed to secure funding or ensure liquidity for existing shareholders.

**Meta joins $10 billion investment in Databricks as data analytics startup prepares for potential IPO**
Meta has invested in data analytics startup Databricks, which has secured $10 billion in funding, one of the largest in venture capital history. The investment brings more than capital, as Meta and Databricks have an existing collaboration, with Databricks building its AI solutions on Meta's Llama open-source large language models. CEO Ali Ghodsi emphasized the shared vision between the two companies, saying, 'We've discussed open-source software in the past, and he cares a lot about open-source models and Llama.' The funding will fuel Databricks' ambitions to develop cutting-edge AI products, explore acquisitions, and expand its international footprint. Databricks is preparing for a potential IPO and has already secured a $5.25 billion credit facility led by JPMorgan Chase. 'On Wednesday Databricks also announced a $5.25 billion credit facility led by JPMorgan Chase. Credit can be a much better option than spending with stock and diluting existing shareholders, even with a high interest rate,' Ghodsi said.

**Databricks Secures $10 Billion in Funding, Valued at $62 Billion**
Databricks has closed its Series J funding round with a record $10 billion, valuing the company at $62 billion. The company plans to invest in new AI products, acquisitions, and international expansion. Additionally, a $5.25 billion loan was secured from multiple banks. QIA, Qatar's state investment fund, has participated in the round again, along with new investors such as Temasek and Macquarie Capital. Meta has also joined, a rare move for the company. CEO Ali Ghodsi said it would have been 'stupid' to go public in turbulent times. Ghodsi emphasized the importance of this funding round: 'We received overwhelming interest from both new and existing investors and strategic partners who believe in our vision and market impact.' The company will use the funds to invest in new AI products, expand its go-to-market activities, and provide liquidity to current and former employees. An IPO is not currently planned, but rather a long-term goal.

**Databricks Raises $15.25 Billion in Mega-Funding Round**
Databricks has finally raised more than $15 billion in funding. The company had announced in December 2024 that it had closed a $10 billion funding round in 'Series J'... However, this new mega-funding round will exceed $15 billion. Databricks has confirmed the finalization of its mega-funding round, totaling $15.25 billion. This amount includes $10 billion in equity financing (Series J, announced in December) - valuing the company at $62 billion - and $5.25 billion in debt financing, provided by JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Citi, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. Meta is among the new investors. The company plans to use the funds to accelerate the development of new AI products, strengthen its international presence, and finance future acquisitions. Databricks also intends to use a portion of the funds to offer liquidity to its current and former employees. This funding round raises questions about the company's potential IPO, which was previously planned for 2025. The fact that Databricks is now offering liquidity to employees suggests that the company may delay its IPO even further.
