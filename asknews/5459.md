**Lawsuit advances over psilocybin access for disabled Oregonians**
A U.S. District Judge has ruled that licensed psilocybin providers can proceed with their lawsuit against the Oregon Health Authority, seeking to provide home-based services to people with disabilities or a terminal illness. The state had argued that allowing such services would violate federal law, but the judge disagreed, stating that the issue is about physical access, not the use or distribution of a controlled substance. The providers want the state to comply with the federal Americans With Disabilities Act, which would allow their disabled clients to have the same physical access to psilocybin services as nondisabled people. Judge Mustafa T. Kasubhai wrote that altering the state law may be necessary to bring it into compliance with the disabilities act. Kathryn L. Tucker, a lawyer for the providers, said, 'We are hoping to move forward quickly now and bring relief to homebound Oregonians who could benefit from psilocybin services.'

**6 In 10 Americans Fear Social Security Will Vanish Before They Retire, As 2033 Insolvency Clock Ticks Louder - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)**
A recent survey by DepositAccounts found that 59% of working-age Americans fear that Social Security will not exist by the time they retire, with 70% of Generation X sharing this concern. The anxiety is driven by the program's main trust fund's depletion in 2033, which would leave incoming payroll taxes covering only 79% of promised checks. Jaime Eckels, a certified-financial-planner, warned that the countdown has moved from abstract to immediate for many savers, saying, 'It's not that far away. We're creeping up on it.' However, not all gauges are as bleak, with the 2025 Retirement Confidence Survey finding that about half of workers remain at least 'somewhat confident' that the government will pay benefits of equal value to today's. Despite this, 60% of workers worry about cuts to Social Security benefits. Analysts stress that insolvency does not equal disappearance, with LendingTree's Matt Schulz saying, 'The truth is that it's highly, highly unlikely Social Security 'won't be available.'

**Elon Musk Denies Excessive Drug Use During 2024 US Presidential Election**
Elon Musk denied using drugs excessively during the 2024 American presidential election campaign. A report by The New York Times claimed that Musk used substances beyond occasional use, citing sources familiar with his activities. Musk responded on X, saying, 'To be clear, I am not using drugs! The New York Times was lying outrageously. I tried prescribed ketamine a few years ago and mentioned it on X, so that's not news. It helps get out of dark mental holes, but I haven't used it since then.' Musk also claimed that he took ecstasy and psilocybin mushrooms and carried a daily medication box containing around 20 pills, including Adderall, according to a photo of the box and people who saw it. Musk maintains good relations with Trump, but has expressed disappointment with the US government and frustration with the obstacles he faced in trying to eliminate federal bureaucracy, raising questions about the strength of the alliance between the president and the world's richest man. Musk was the largest known political donor in the 2024 elections and told Trump's advisors this year that he would donate $100 million to groups controlled by the president's team before the 2026 midterm elections. However, the money has not been received yet, according to sources familiar with the matter.

**Improving Memory and Concentration for Exams: Expert Recommendations**
Experts and educators recommend reducing caffeine and sugar intake, increasing physical activity, and consuming more nuts and fruits to improve memory before exams. According to the PAU (Access to University) results, 91.7% of second-year high school students who took the exam in 2024 passed, with 97.3% passing in the general phase. To alleviate stress and anxiety, educators remind students that they are well-prepared and that the exam format is familiar to them. The recipe for success includes creating a study schedule, alternating between theoretical and practical subjects, using flashcards and prioritizing key content, and taking breaks to relax. A balanced diet, including foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, nuts, and seeds, is also essential. 'I don't have a set limit for breaks, I take a walk and eat something when I feel distracted,' says Victoria, a PAU student. Educators warn against the negative effects of excessive caffeine, sugar, and energy drinks, which can overstimulate the brain. 'Chocolate with high cocoa content keeps the mind alert, and eggs and whole grain cereals provide energy to the brain,' says Sergio Cook, an orientator at the Colegio Oficial de Psicólogos de Madrid. Aiming for 8 hours of sleep and some exercise or meditation can also help to relax the mind. 'Once you know the space and the exam mechanics, most students realize it's not as complex,' says Fernando Miralles, a professor at the Universidad CEU San Pablo. To perform well on the day of the exam, it's recommended to eat a balanced breakfast, leave early, and bring multiple pens and start with the easier questions. 'If we get nervous and block, we pause and review the multiplication table,' says Miralles as a technique to distract the brain.

**Maine Committee Advances Bill to Decriminalize Personal Possession of Psilocybin**
The Maine House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee has voted to advance House Bill 1034, which would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of psilocybin for adults 21 and older. The bill, introduced by a bipartisan group of nine lawmakers, removes criminal penalties for possessing up to one gram of psilocybin or one ounce of psilocybin-containing mushrooms. Supporters of the bill point to research suggesting psilocybin may have mental health benefits, particularly in treating depression and PTSD. This move reflects a national trend of easing restrictions on psychedelics, with Oregon and Colorado already implementing broader psilocybin reform and several cities adopting decriminalization policies.

**Top U.S. Marijuana Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist Right Now**
The U.S. cannabis industry is expected to grow significantly, with over 80% of Americans supporting some form of legalization. Recent headlines suggest the DEA may reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III, which could ease tax burdens and promote medical research. Analysts project the legal U.S. cannabis market could surpass $71 billion by 2030. Three top marijuana stocks to watch in May 2025 are Verano Holdings Corp. (VRNOF), Cansortium Inc. (CMTNF), and Ayr Wellness Inc. (AYRWF). Verano is a major U.S. multi-state operator with a large retail presence, while Cansortium is a U.S.-based cannabis company operating under the Fluent brand. Ayr Wellness is a vertically integrated cannabis company with operations in several U.S. states. Each of these companies has faced market challenges but continues to position itself for long-term growth. As federal reform efforts progress, these stocks may offer substantial upside.

**Connecticut Psilocybin Decrim Bill Advances to Senate**
Connecticut's House Bill 7065 has advanced to the Senate, aiming to decriminalize the possession of up to 0.5 ounces of psilocybin. Under the proposed changes, possession of this amount would be downgraded from a Class A misdemeanor to a civil infraction, punishable with a fine of $150 for first-time charges and a maximum fine of $500 for subsequent charges. The bill would also prevent minors from being found guilty in juvenile court for first- or second-time charges. This move follows New Mexico's decriminalization of psilocybin in April, and comes as other states, such as Massachusetts, Maine, Oregon, and Colorado, consider similar measures. As one might say, 'it's a good trade'.

**What psychedelic critics get wrong about Colorado’s mental health crisis | Colorado Newsline**
A psychiatrist and licensed psilocybin facilitator argues that psychedelic centers in Colorado are not a danger to kids and are actually helping to address the state's mental health crisis. They point out that psilocybin is not a Schedule I drug due to its safety, but rather due to outdated political bias and institutional inertia. The facilitator also notes that many licensed mental health professionals are working in these centers, and that they are regulated and follow strict safety standards. They argue that Colorado's mental health crisis is real and that psilocybin can offer real relief when used in a structured setting with trained professionals. The facilitator calls for an open-minded approach to psilocybin and for listening to the science, rather than relying on misinformation and fear-mongering.

**California Senators Approve Bipartisan Bill To Create Psilocybin Pilot Program For Veterans And First Responders**
California Senators have approved a bipartisan bill to create a psilocybin pilot program for military veterans and first responders. The program, sponsored by Sens. Josh Becker (D) and Brian Jones (R), aims to study and develop 'psilocybin services' for eligible patients in up to five counties across the state. The pilot program would be carried out under the University of California (UC) system, with a focus on veterans and inactive first responders with post-traumatic stress disorder, end-of-life distress, or other specified conditions. According to Sen. Becker, 'every day, an average of 17.6 veterans die by suicide. First responders—those who run towards dangers to protect the rest of us—are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty.' The bill would establish a 'Veterans and First Responders Research Pilot Special Fund' to fund the work, and would require the agency to report specified information about the pilot program to the Legislature by January 15, 2030. Research suggests that psilocybin and psilocyn may offer significant benefits in treating mental health disorders, particularly those related to trauma and stress, and the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already granted a breakthrough therapy designation for a treatment that uses psilocybin as a therapy for treatment-resistant depression.

**Federal Appeals Court Rules Against Doctor Seeking to Use Mushrooms to Aide Terminal Patients: How We Learned to Question the Rationale of the Controlled Substances Act**
Dr. Sunil Aggarwal's efforts to obtain psilocybin for terminally ill cancer patients have been rejected by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Aggarwal had petitioned the DEA to reschedule psilocybin from Schedule I to Schedule II, but the DEA denied the petition. The Ninth Circuit directed the DEA to reconsider its decision, but ultimately ruled in favor of the DEA. Aggarwal also attempted to use the Right to Try Act (RTT Act) to access psilocybin for his patients, but the DEA denied his request. The Ninth Circuit found that the DEA's reasoning in blocking Aggarwal's access to psilocybin was not arbitrary and capricious. This decision is seen as a significant setback for proponents of easier access to psilocybin outside of the research context.

**California Would Launch A Psychedelic Access Program For Veterans And First Responders Under New Bipartisan Bill**
California senators and assemblymembers have filed a bipartisan bill to create a psilocybin pilot program for military veterans and first responders. The program, led by Sens. Josh Becker (D) and Brian Jones (R), would provide research and development of psilocybin services for targeted populations in up to five counties. The California Health and Human Services Agency (CHHSA) would oversee the program, partnering with local mental health clinics, hospice programs, and other community-based providers. The bill states that research suggests psilocybin may offer significant benefits in treating mental health disorders, particularly those related to trauma and stress. The program would focus on veterans and inactive first responders with post-traumatic stress disorder, end-of-life distress, or other specified conditions. CHHSA would need to submit a report on the pilot program outcomes, data analysis, and recommendations to the legislature by January 15, 2030.

**New West Virginia Bill Would Deschedule Marijuana, Psilocybin, and THC**
A new bill, House Bill 2854, has been introduced in the West Virginia Legislature to deschedule marijuana, psilocybin, and tetrahydrocannabinols (THC) from the state's list of controlled substances. If passed, the bill would mark a major shift in West Virginia's approach to drug policy, removing these substances from scheduling altogether at the state level. However, the federal government still classifies them as Schedule I drugs. The bill has been referred to the House Health and Human Resources Committee, with further consideration by the Judiciary Committee if it advances. Delegate Young, one of the sponsors, has not made any public statements regarding the bill's intentions. The filing of HB 2854 comes the same day as the introduction of House Bill 2887, which would legalize recreational cannabis, including allowing licensed marijuana stores in counties that decide to allow them.

**Bills to allow some, regulated access to psilocybin unlikely to move forward**
Two bills in Washington state, Senate Bill 5201 and House Bill 1433, aimed to establish a regulated and supervised access to psilocybin for adults, but they will not move forward due to opposition from state psychiatric and medical groups, as well as advocates for psychedelics. State Sen. Jesse Salomon, the primary sponsor of Senate Bill 5201, said that advocates who think the legislation doesn't go far enough are slowing progress. Cole Schrim, a licensed therapist and founder of the Tacoma Psychedelic Society, expressed concerns about the regulation, stating that it would only allow access to psilocybin and not other natural psychedelics. Other states, such as Oregon and Colorado, have made moves to open the doors to accessing these substances, but passing state legislation on this is a different landscape due to the classification of psychedelics as a Schedule 1 drug.

**Court upholds DEA denial of Seattle doctor's request to use psilocybin to treat terminal patients**
A federal appellate court has upheld the DEA's denial of Dr. Sunil Aggarwal's request to use psilocybin to treat terminally ill cancer patients. The court found that the DEA provided a 'reasonable explanation' for its decision, citing the need for proper registration under the Controlled Substances Act. The court ruled that the doctor must be properly registered as an approved researcher to dispense or possess Schedule I controlled substances. The institute argued that right-to-try laws waived the registration requirement, but the court disagreed, stating that the institute didn't demonstrate how its proposed use of psilocybin was 'consistent with public health and safety.' The state of Oregon and several other states filed a friend of the court brief in support of the Seattle doctor and institute, arguing that they have an interest in avoiding 'undue federal regulation of the practice of medicine' and upholding the rights of patients with life-threatening illnesses to make medical decisions with their doctors.

**Federal Court Rejects Washington Doctor’s Effort To Legally Access Psilocybin For End-Of-Life Patient Care**
A federal appellate court has rejected the efforts of a Washington State doctor, Dr. Sunil Aggarwal, to legally use psilocybin to treat cancer patients in end-of-life care. The court ruled that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) provided a reasonable explanation in denying the doctor's request. The DEA argued that the federal Right to Try (RTT) law does not provide any exemptions from CSA restrictions, and that psilocybin is a Schedule I substance. Dr. Aggarwal and his clinic, the Advanced Integrated Medical Science (AIMS) Institute, have been working since 2020 to find a way to legally obtain psilocybin for patients in palliative care. The clinic has presented DEA with multiple proposals to legally cultivate or otherwise obtain psilocybin, but all have been denied. Washington State and eight other jurisdictions filed an amicus brief in support of the clinic's position, arguing that CSA doesn't prohibit the use of controlled substances under RTT.

**Rhode Island Lawmakers Discuss Bill To Legalize Psilocybin**
Rhode Island lawmakers held a hearing on a bill that would exempt psilocybin from the state's laws against controlled substances, legalizing possession and home cultivation for personal use. The bill, H.5186, would permit the possession of up to one ounce of psilocybin, as long as it is 'securely cultivated' within a person's residence or 'shared by one person to another.' The change would last until July 1, 2027, at which point it would sunset. Rep. Brandon Potter (D) said, 'Psilocybin is effectively a natural compound that's in a variety of mushrooms. It is non-toxic, non-addictive. It's a natural compound.' Victoria Litman, a professor and psychedelics law expert, emphasized that 'citizens and elected officials nationwide are seeing the promise of these medicines.' The bill would also require the state's attorney general to report on the number of violations issued for possession, cultivation, or distribution of psilocybin, and the director of the state Department of Health would need to report on the federal scheduling status of the substance.
