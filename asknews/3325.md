**2.8 Billion People Worldwide Lack Access to Suitable Housing, UN Report Finds**
According to the United Nations' Habitat Programme annual report for 2024, approximately 2.8 billion people worldwide lack access to suitable housing. Of these, 1.1 billion people live in poor or informal settlements, which is 'the main challenge for sustainable urban development', as stated in the report. Around 90% of the population of these poor settlements live in Africa and Asia, where there is a shortage of housing units of around 170 million. Anna Claudia Robisch, Executive Director of the United Nations' Habitat Programme, said in the report that 'climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters continue to force millions of people to leave their homes in search of safety, stability, and better living conditions.' The report estimates that 318 million people are homeless, equivalent to the population of the United States. Globally, 'one in four people lives in conditions that harm their health, safety, and well-being', according to the United Nations' Habitat Programme report. Only 14% of urban residents and 40% of rural residents have access to clean water, and two in five people do not have access to sanitation services. The report states that 'safe and managed sanitation is a fundamental element of human development and is often used as a measure of progress in reducing poverty, diseases, and premature deaths.' Anna Claudia Robisch called for 'rethinking urban policies, land use, laws, and financing to prioritize housing and basic services as key drivers of climate action and sustainable development.' By 2040, it is expected that 2 billion urban residents will be exposed to significant temperature increases. The United Nations' Habitat Programme member states adopted the programme's strategic plan for 2026-2029, which focuses on access to housing, land, and basic services, such as clean water and sanitation.

**UN-Habitat Reports 2.8 Billion People Worldwide are Inadequately Housed**
According to the United Nations' Habitat agency, 2.8 billion people worldwide are inadequately housed, with 318 million people homeless. The report highlights that 1.1 billion people live in slums or informal settlements, which is the 'principal challenge of sustainable urban development.' Anacláudia Rossbach, executive director of ONU-Habitat, states, 'Climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters continue to displace millions of people, forcing them to leave their homes in search of security, stability, and better living conditions.' The agency reports that 14% of urban residents and 40% of rural residents lack access to clean water, and two out of five people do not have access to sanitation services. Anacláudia Rossbach calls for 'rethinking urban policies, land use, legislation, and financing to prioritize housing and basic services, as they are essential levers for climate action and sustainable development.' By 2040, 2 billion urban residents are expected to face significant temperature increases.

**Cattle and lamb turn off surges as seasonal conditions bite**
Australia's red meat sector has seen a significant increase in cattle and lamb slaughter volumes in the first quarter of 2025, according to Meat & Livestock Australia. Cattle slaughter reached 2.2 million head, up 2% from Q4 2024 and 20% year-on-year, with the largest quarterly cattle slaughter in Victoria since 1979 and in NSW since 2015. The female slaughter rate rose to 52.7%, indicating elevated female turn-off, particularly in South Australia and Victoria. However, MLA's market information manager Stephen Bignell said, 'The elevated female slaughter rate reflects regional responses to seasonal pressures, particularly in the south where a prolonged and expanding drought is impacting numbers.' Lamb slaughter surged to 6.86 million head, the second-highest quarterly figure on record, up 12% from the previous quarter and slightly above year-ago levels. Victoria led the charge, processing a record 3.83 million head, while NSW lifted 27% to 1.48 million head. The gross value of sheep and lamb slaughtered in Australia lifted once again across all states to an impressive $1.58 billion.

**Experts Warn: The Biggest Mistake in Storing Sacrificial Meat**
As the Eid al-Adha approaches, Ankara Butchers' Association President Fazlı Yalçındağ has warned of the importance of proper handling and storage of sacrificial meat. Yalçındağ emphasized that the process of cutting and processing the meat must be done by professional butchers, as it is crucial for hygiene and health. He noted that approximately 800-900 thousand head of cattle and 2-2.5 million head of small livestock are slaughtered in Turkey every year during the Eid period, resulting in around 200 thousand tons of meat. Yalçındağ warned that seeking out unlicensed services for the slaughter process poses a threat to public health. He advised that the tools used for slaughter must be sharp, clean, and complete, and that using makeshift equipment can lead to contamination. Yalçındağ also cautioned against storing hot meat directly in the refrigerator, as this can lead to bacterial growth. He recommended that the meat be allowed to cool for at least 2 hours at room temperature before being refrigerated or frozen. Yalçındağ emphasized that frozen meat should be consumed within 3-4 months, as longer storage can lead to a decrease in quality and potentially harmful consequences. He noted that approximately 20 thousand tons of meat are wasted every year due to improper handling and storage, which is equivalent to the meat needs of Ankara for about 15 days.

**Ministry of Supply Launches Largest Meat and Sacrifice Distribution Plan**
The Ministry of Supply and Trade has raised its readiness level to the highest and has started implementing one of the largest operations to present meat and sacrifices in various forms in the consumer complexes and outlets affiliated with the Holding Company for Food Industries. The early move aims to break the waves of rising prices and ensure the availability of live, fresh, and frozen meat, with around 200 cattle being slaughtered daily, weighing between 200 and 240 kg, and distributed across the country to ensure complete coverage. At Majazr al-Basatin, the slaughtering and preparation work begins with the first hours of the morning. According to Khaled Saket, the Managing Director of the Egyptian Meat and Poultry Company, the meat arrives at the outlets between 8:30 and 9:00 am, making it available to citizens at an optimal time. Saket explained during his visit to Majazr al-Basatin that the slaughterhouse regularly receives shipments of meat from Sudan and Djibouti, which are subject to inspection and preparation according to the highest standards of quality and food safety before being presented in the market. Frozen poultry is also available, with 70-100 tons being presented daily, increasing to 150 tons during peak seasons and holidays like Eid al-Adha. More than 500 heads of live sheep and over 100 cattle are also available, all at reasonable prices to facilitate access for citizens without compromising the quality of the offerings. This move is part of a broader strategy by the Ministry of Supply to enhance national food security and provide essential goods at a reasonable quality and price, amidst complex global conditions in terms of supply and rising costs.

**Kurban Bayramı Et Tavsiyeleri: Kasaplar Odası Başkanı Yalçındağ'in Açıklaması**
Yalçındağ, in a written statement, emphasized that the slaughter and processing of meat, especially after the slaughter, must be done by a professional butcher. He stated that in Turkey, 800-900 thousand head of cattle and 2-2.5 million head of small cattle are slaughtered every year for Kurban Bayramı, resulting in 200 thousand tons of meat production. Yalçındağ noted that even if all the slaughterhouses in Europe were to be gathered and sent to Turkey, it would not be possible to organize such an event in one day. He emphasized that 'our sacrifice must be slaughtered and processed by the right people and stored in the right way. The right address is the butchers in everyone's neighborhood. This would greatly reduce the number of accidents. The tools used during slaughter must be sharp and clean, and everyone must be trained every year. Appearing every year and saying 'I am a butcher' and providing mincing service with the machine taken out of the coal yard is a threat to public health. Our goal is not to make money, but to provide the safest and most hygienic service and product.' Yalçındağ also warned that cutting the meat into pieces and storing it in plastic containers without letting it cool down is not safe. He emphasized that the biggest mistake is to store the meat in this way, as it will produce bacteria within an hour and spoil. He recommended that the meat be transported in trays, cooled down for at least 2 hours, and then stored in the refrigerator. He also advised that the meat be frozen and consumed within 3-4 months.

**Ankara Butchers' Association Warns of the Importance of Proper Meat Cutting and Storage**
Ankara Butchers' Association President Fazlı Yalçındağ has issued important warnings about the correct cutting and storage of meat during the Eid al-Adha. Yalçındağ emphasized that only experts should perform the cutting and processing of meat, and that it should be done in a hygienic environment. He stated that in Turkey, 800-900 thousand head of cattle and 2-2.5 million head of small livestock are slaughtered every year during Eid al-Adha, resulting in 200,000 tons of meat production. Yalçındağ noted that even if all the slaughterhouses in Europe were to be transported to Turkey, it would not be possible to organize such a large-scale operation in one day. He emphasized that 'our sacrifice should be cut and processed by the right people and stored in the right way. The right address is the butchers in everyone's neighborhood. This would greatly reduce the number of accidents. The tools used during cutting should be sharp and clean, and the person performing the cutting should be experienced. Bringing out an old machine from the coal yard and using it to mince meat is a threat to public health. Our goal is not to make a profit, but to provide the safest and most hygienic service and product.' Yalçındağ also warned that if a portion of the meat is not properly removed, it can contaminate the entire batch, and that the machine can transfer the residue to the next customer's meat.

**CIA Report Warns of Global Catastrophe by 2030: A Countdown to Disaster**
A 2003 report by the CIA, 'The 2030 Spike: Countdown to Global Catastrophe', written by Colin Mason, describes six factors that will converge in the next decade, leading to a global catastrophe. These factors include energy scarcity, demographic disparities, global poverty, climate change, food shortages, water scarcity, and international anarchy. The report proposes over 100 measures to mitigate the consequences of this crisis. According to the report, 'estimates place available petroleum resources at less than one billion barrels, and global consumption at 28 billion barrels per year, indicating depletion in as little as 34 years.' The report also cites studies by the International Water Management Institute, predicting that one billion people will face absolute water scarcity by 2025. To avoid this, the report suggests using science, particularly genetics and climatology, to address climate change, water and food scarcity. However, some measures proposed in the report are more controversial, including: diverting scientific effort from arms, space research, and 'doubtful' technologies to practical goals for humanity; establishing a global authority to define priorities and advise on implementation; forming a 'censor' body to examine new technologies and identify potential harm; creating a specialized international penal law body to prevent the application of harmful technologies; and establishing research institutes with secure funding. The report concludes that these objectives may not be achievable, but can be approached.

**USAID Cuts to Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under five years old. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.' Bill Gates has announced that he will increase his donations to global health programs to $10 billion annually and maintain the investment for 20 years.

**Río Grande Strengthens Local Production and Consolidates New Alternatives**
The Secretary of Productive Development, Facundo Armas, highlighted that food production has become one of the pillars of local economic development: 'Six years ago, we started to strengthen food sovereignty, to reduce our dependence on food from the continent. And we have demonstrated that it is possible.' Armas noted that the production scale has shifted from almost family-based to semi-industrial schemes. For example, poultry production began in 2022 with a batch of 1,500 grilled chickens and now reaches 60,000 units per year. 'We are supplying butcher shops in Tolhuin and Ushuaia. The product we are offering does not exist in Patagonia, so there is demand and a highly valued quality differential,' explained Armas. The development of RGA Alimentos, initially articulated with La Misión Salesiana, has been the core from which other production lines such as tomatoes, potatoes, garlic, and vegetables have been strengthened. Currently, more than 1.5 tons of tomatoes are produced per season, even in months like May and June, extending the historical seasonal period. In this process, companies from the technology sector based in the city have also begun to participate. 'In addition to electronics, Río Grande demonstrates that it can develop food and there are companies like Mirgor that are starting to participate in this,' said Armas, highlighting the synergy between sectors. The possibility of developing trout production is also being explored, reusing municipal facilities in disuse such as the old water treatment plant. 'Río Grande identifies with trout, but few riograndenses have tried it. We want to make it a local, accessible, and sustainable product,' proposed Armas. Significant advances have also been made in the strengthening of pig production, which already has more than 55 registered producers in the municipal program. In 2023, around 8,000 pigs and 6,000 cattle were slaughtered. The Municipal Abattoir was completely refurbished and now works in conjunction with the private plant Los Jazmines. Additionally, local butcher shops were accompanied to improve their conditions of traceability and ensure the local supply of meat in the domestic market. Another highlighted policy is the support for the artisanal fishing sector, historically marginalized. The Municipality implemented a registry of fishermen, delivered nets and work clothing, and articulated commercialization through the Paseo Canto del Viento, ensuring the supply of fresh fish throughout the year. The development of the sector also includes the production of fresh eggs, with over 100 active poultry producers in the city. In the near future, the Avícola Seal, a certification of good practices promoted together with INTA and SENASA, will be implemented, which aims to add value and security to these products. This entire strategy is linked to employment and training programs. From the Employment Department, courses related to food production were added as a concrete labor outlet. 'The idea is that those who are trained can have a profitable business and generate a sustained income,' emphasized Armas. Finally, the official recognized that some projects cannot advance due to lack of financing and change in national government priorities. 'There were projects related to feedlots, production of forage, four-season greenhouses, and a refrigerator with BID financing for almost $8 million. Unfortunately, they did not prosper due to lack of provincial support to take on the debt,' lamented.

**Humans are on pace to slaughter 6 trillion animals per year by 2033**
Humans are on track to slaughter 6 trillion animals per year by 2033. However, most people are unaware that fish and shrimp are farmed on an even larger scale, with trillions of animals caught or farmed annually, compared to 76 billion chickens. If people's compassion for animals extends to marine life, they may advocate for sea creatures. Furthermore, the emerging industry of insect farming, which involves confining and killing large numbers of insects for use as animal feed or human consumption, is also worth considering.

**The Fascinating History and Cultural Significance of Chickens**
According to biologist Astrid Drapela, a chicken can lay up to 300 eggs per year. However, 85% of these eggs come from battery cages, as stated in her book 'Es war einmal das Huhn'. In contrast, wild chickens produce a maximum of 5-15 eggs per year. There are approximately 34 billion chickens worldwide, making them the most common land vertebrate on Earth. Chickens are found on all continents except Antarctica and are consumed in almost every culture. Every day, millions of chickens are slaughtered worldwide. The chicken has a long history, dating back over 3,000 years, and has been used in various ways, including as a symbol of masculinity and aggression in sports. However, the chicken's popularity has also led to the development of industrialized mass production, resulting in the creation of fast-growing broiler chickens that are often slaughtered at a young age. In 2022, around 75 billion broilers were slaughtered worldwide, with an average of 140,000 chickens per minute. Drapela notes that 16.8 billion broilers are not consumed but instead end up in the trash or die before slaughter. The chicken has also been used in various cultural and symbolic contexts, such as being used as an oracle in West Africa and being associated with good luck and prosperity in some cultures. Additionally, chicken soup has been used as a medicinal treatment for various ailments, including asthma and leprosy, and has even been taken to the moon by astronauts. However, the chicken's future is uncertain, and Drapela highlights the need for more humane and sustainable farming practices, such as the Rondell method and the Kipster start-up, which provide better living conditions for chickens.

**The Fascinating and Troubling World of Chickens: A Look at their History, Breeding, and Treatment**
According to biologist Astrid Drapela, in her book 'Es war einmal das Huhn', a chicken can produce up to 300 eggs per year. However, 85% of these eggs come from battery cages, with wild chickens producing only 5-15 eggs per year. There are currently 34 billion chickens on the planet, making them the most common land animal. Chickens are found on every continent except Antarctica and are consumed in almost every culture. In the Roman era, chicken meat and eggs became popular, leading to the development of specialized farms. Drapela notes that the profession of butcher and meatcutter also originated during this time. The modern chicken has undergone significant changes, with some breeds being created for rapid growth, leading to the production of 75 billion broilers in 2022. This is equivalent to 140,000 chickens per minute. Drapela also highlights the issue of waste, with an estimated 16.8 billion broilers not being consumed but instead ending up in the trash or dying before slaughter. In some cultures, chickens are used for divination and are considered a symbol of masculinity and aggression. The book also explores the history of chicken breeding, with the first recorded chicken being the Bankiva chicken from Southeast Asia. Today, there are over 1,600 registered chicken breeds worldwide, with most commercial chickens being white and lacking feathers. The book concludes by highlighting the need for more humane and sustainable chicken farming practices, citing examples such as the Rondell method and the Dutch start-up Kipster.

**FAO Warns of Unprecedented Spread of Bird Flu, Calls for Global Response**
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has warned of an unprecedented spread of bird flu and called for a global response. According to the official UN website, the FAO warned of the spread of bird flu and in a meeting with member states in Rome, officials from the organization called for immediate action to enhance biological security, monitoring, and rapid response mechanisms to mitigate the spread of the disease. Bird flu poses a significant threat to global food security and food supplies, including loss of nutritional value, functions, and income in rural areas, economic shocks, and increased costs for consumers. With millions of people relying on poultry for meat and eggs, the challenge goes beyond containing the virus to protecting food production systems. The spread of bird flu also has a negative impact on the global economy, for example, egg prices reached a record high in the United States in February, according to the American Consumer Price Index, forcing farmers to slaughter over 166 million birds so far, mostly white chickens. According to news reports, more than 30 million birds have been killed in the United States this year. FAO Deputy Director-General Beth Bechdol emphasized the need for a coordinated global response, describing the H5N1 virus as a transboundary threat that no country can tackle alone. 'It was a great day' when the world came together to address this challenge, said Bechdol. 'We need to work together to prevent the spread of bird flu and protect our food systems.'

**Soaring U.S. egg prices and millions of dead chickens signal the deep problems and risks in modern poultry production**
The recent volatility of egg prices in the United States has highlighted the deep problems and risks in modern poultry production. The avian flu, which has been afflicting poultry birds since 2022, has led to the killing of millions of birds in an attempt to contain its spread. However, this 'depopulation' is just a small part of the issue, as 9.5 billion chickens are slaughtered annually in the U.S. and 76 billion worldwide. The poultry industry has been criticized for its unhealthy conditions, with birds living in densely-packed operations where reproduction, life, and death are greatly accelerated. The growing risk of avian flu mutations is related to the enormity of poultry bird populations and the unhealthy conditions of life in large enclosures. The Trump administration's response to the crisis has been to undermine infectious disease surveillance, which is a grave threat to public health. 'It's profoundly irrational to be weakening infectious disease surveillance in the midst of the current avian flu crisis,' said the author. 'Pursuing this course might temporarily bring egg prices down, but it also inevitably means passing untold risks into the future.'

**A World Without Meat: Exploring Alternatives for a Sustainable Future**
The world's population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, leading to an increase in meat consumption. This has consequences for the climate and environment. Brigitte Gothière, founder of the animal welfare organization L214, says, 'It is unrealistic that we will consume animal products in the same amount in 2050 as we do today.' The production of meat involves the slaughter of 70 billion animals worldwide each year, which pollutes the environment as much as the entire transportation industry. Researchers are looking for alternatives to meat consumption, such as insects, legumes, camel milk, and synthetic meat produced in a laboratory. These alternatives could provide the necessary vitamin B12, which is mainly found in animal products. 'We need to change our eating habits today to be able to eat sustainably in the future,' says Gothière.

**Belgium Slaughtered Over 27 Million Animals in December 2024**
In December 2024, more than 27 million animals were slaughtered in Belgium, according to Statbel. This trend shows significant volumes, despite a global decline in slaughter over the past few years. Chickens dominate with 26.105.003 slaughter, followed by pigs (753.939) and cattle (70.079). These figures confirm the predominance of poultry in the Belgian slaughter industry. A general downward trend since 2021 has been observed, with a slight increase of +0.54% between 2021 and 2023, from 766,939 animals slaughtered in 2021 to 771,095 in 2023. However, significant disparities exist by species. Pigs have seen a marked decline, from 11.58 million in 2021 to 9.36 million in 2023. Cattle have seen a slight increase between 2022 (755,081) and 2023 (771,095), while cows have seen a decrease (from 313,996 in 2021 to 301,456 in 2023), and calves have seen a notable increase. Poultry have shown remarkable stability with approximately 300 million units slaughtered each year. Sheep and goats have seen a net decline, particularly for sheep, whose numbers have decreased from 121,274 in 2021 to 75,409 in 2023. Flanders dominates the slaughter activity, with 8.75 million pigs slaughtered in 2023, compared to only 875,757 in Wallonia. Cattle follow the same trend, with 570,878 slaughter in Flanders in 2023, far above the 200,217 recorded in Wallonia.
