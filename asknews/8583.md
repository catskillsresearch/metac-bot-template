**The Future of Food: 10 Trends to Watch by 2050**
By 2050, the way we produce, buy, and prepare food will undergo significant transformations. According to predictions, ten main trends will emerge. 1. 'Community meals' will continue to play a central role in our lives, with a focus on shared experiences and emotional connections. 2. The weekly grocery shopping trip will become a thing of the past, replaced by AI-powered meal planning and box delivery services. 3. Clothing will become a source of food production, with wearable technology that can grow food on the go. 4. Urban agriculture will become increasingly integrated into city landscapes, with shared gardens, vertical farming, and community-supported agriculture. 5. Food will be designed to absorb CO2, rather than emit it, with the help of oceanic agriculture and sustainable aquaculture. 6. AI will help reduce food waste by optimizing meal planning and transforming scraps into new dishes using 3D printing. 7. Climate change will lead to the adoption of new crops, such as mangoes and papayas in the Mediterranean, and quinoa and soy in Northern Europe. 8. Ancient crops, such as sorrel and dandelion, will make a comeback, providing a source of biodiversity and resilience. 9. 'Niche' crops, such as teff and fonio, will become more mainstream, providing a source of nutrition and sustainability. 10. Food will become a form of preventive medicine, with AI-powered meal planning and personalized nutrition tailored to individual needs and genetic predispositions. According to Dr. Joseph Poore, 'it's likely that our diet in 2050 will be significantly different from what we have today, although not necessarily in the ways we expect.' Dr. Morgaine Gaye adds, 'the next decade will see significant transformations in our daily habits and food models.'

**'80s franchise reboot knocked out by Lilo & Stitch at box office**
The Karate Kid: Legends reboot, starring Ralph Macchio and Jackie Chan, landed third at the box office with $21 million from 3,809 theaters, despite uniting the original and reboot stars. In contrast, Disney's live-action Lilo & Stitch remake surged past $610 million globally, making it the second-biggest Hollywood release of 2025. At this pace, Lilo & Stitch could overtake A Minecraft Movie as the highest-grossing film of the year. Meanwhile, Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning continues to climb, blasting past the $350 million benchmark, and Warner Bros.' Sinners also crossed the same milestone, keeping the summer box office sizzling.

**Live-Action Remakes of Animated Films: A Mixed Bag**
The trend of live-action remakes of animated films has been gaining momentum in recent years. Disney was the first to pioneer this trend with '101 Dalmatians' in 1996, which was a commercial success. However, not all live-action remakes have been successful, with some receiving negative reviews from critics and audiences. For example, the 2023 remake of 'Blancanieves' was a box office failure. On the other hand, some live-action remakes have been well-received, such as 'The Jungle Book' (2016) and 'Beauty and the Beast' (2017), which were both commercial successes. The article also mentions that the public tends to prefer the original animated films over their live-action remakes, but the latter can still generate significant revenue. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the live-action remake of 'The Lion King' (2019) grossed over $2 billion, while the original animated film (1994) grossed around $1.6 billion when adjusted for inflation. 'Lilo & Stitch', the latest live-action remake, has received mixed reviews from critics, with some considering it one of the best adaptations in recent years, but still falling short of the original.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**10 Movies That Were Box Office Bombs (But Had a Flawless Cast)**
Several movies have been considered box office bombs despite having a talented cast. These films include Chaos Walking, Heaven's Gate, How Do You Know, Speed Racer, The Marvels, Amsterdam, Deepwater Horizon, The Suicide Squad, and Evan Almighty. Chaos Walking, based on the first book in Patrick Ness' novel trilogy, had a profit deficit of around $100 million despite the performances of Tom Holland, Daisy Ridley, and Mads Mikkelsen. Heaven's Gate, a 1980 epic Western, was a huge box-office bomb and a highly divisive and controversial film. How Do You Know, a 2010 romantic comedy, had a poor reception at the box office despite the performances of Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd, and Jack Nicholson. Speed Racer, a 2008 movie written and directed by the Wachowski sisters, received mixed reviews and grossed around $30 million less than its budget. The Marvels, a 2023 film and a sequel to Captain Marvel, remains many fans' least-favorite project in the franchise despite its amazing cast and exciting team-up plot. Amsterdam, a 2022 period mystery comedy, had a star-studded cast including Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, and John David Washington, but failed to attract movie-goers. Deepwater Horizon, a 2016 disaster film, received critical acclaim but was heavily criticized for taking factual liberties. The Suicide Squad, a 2021 film and a sequel to the DC franchise, had a confusing marketing campaign and failed to meet expectations despite the performances of Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, and Viola Davis. Evan Almighty, a 2007 comedy, was a huge commercial failure despite the performances of Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, and Lauren Graham.

**Why Hollywood needs to stop churning out sequels - or die**
Actor-writer Joel Kim Booster argued that the people running Hollywood studios should be replaced by artificial intelligence due to the industry's reliance on sequels. According to Box Office Mojo, the number of reboots, remakes, sequels, spin-offs, and prequels in the global top 20 box office has increased by 800% since 1993. In 2024, only two films in the global top 20 were not sequels, spin-offs, or remakes, with It Ends with Us and The Wild Robot being book adaptations. Booster noted that AI is a statistical prediction machine that can choose the most likely next thing, implying that Hollywood's reliance on sequels is predictable and could be replaced by AI.

**Disney's Riskiest Live-Action Remake Is Coming Out Soon, And It Might Change Their Whole Strategy Forever**
Disney is releasing a live-action remake of Moana, which is considered a risk due to the original film's recent release. The company has been successful with live-action remakes of older films, but Moana will be the first from the 'revival era' (2009-2019). Despite some reservations, Moana (2026) can still succeed and potentially become the highest-grossing live-action remake of an animated film. If it does well, Disney may consider remaking other recent animated hits, such as Frozen, The Princess and the Frog, or Pixar's Coco and The Incredibles. The success of Moana 2, which grossed over $1 billion, is a good sign for the upcoming remake. Disney's previous live-action remakes, such as Alice in Wonderland and The Lion King, have been successful, and the company will continue to produce live-action remakes of recent movies, regardless of Moana's performance.

**Hollywood's Shift towards Remakes and Sequels: A Trend Driven by Audience Demand**
The film industry in Hollywood is shifting towards remakes and sequels, with most of the top-grossing films in Switzerland in 2024 being sequels. According to Roman G√ºttinger, Head of Sales at Ascot Elite, this trend is driven by the fact that people are more likely to watch familiar stories. 'Fortsetzungen und Remakes machen heute leider oftmals mehr Geld als originelle Neustoffe', he says. G√ºttinger attributes the success of sequels to the fact that people are more likely to go to the cinema if they know the story, and that the first few weeks after a film's release are crucial for its success. He also notes that the programming of cinemas plays a role, with many cinemas showing the same blockbuster in different versions. Additionally, the media landscape is also a factor, with less attention being given to new, original, and smaller films. G√ºttinger says, 'Die Medien haben bei den Filmjournalisten gespart', and that without media attention, new productions lack the chance to reach their audience. The current global situation also contributes to the trend, with people preferring light-hearted films in times of crisis. G√ºttinger notes that the system is self-reinforcing, with successful franchises being shown more widely and new films struggling to get into cinemas. He says, 'Es ist wie eine Schlange, die sich in den eigenen Schwanz beisst', and that the trend is driven by the audience's demand for familiar stories.
