**Jupiter's Role in the Origin of Life on Earth**
Scientists have found that life on Earth may have originated due to the presence of Jupiter. The study shows that the first planets to form in the Solar System were gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, which formed just a few million years after the Sun's appearance. The Earth and other terrestrial planets formed much later, about 100 million years after the Sun's formation. Jupiter's gravitational influence played a crucial role in determining the orbits of the inner planets and the location of the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Jupiter's movement closer to the Sun also protected the inner planets from asteroid impacts, allowing water to remain in a liquid state and creating favorable conditions for life to emerge. In other words, if Jupiter had not formed on time, life on Earth may not have existed. The new data highlights the importance of gas giants in shaping the entire Solar System and creating conditions for our unique planet.

**New model helps to figure out which distant planets may host life**
Astrophysicist and astrobiologist, Dr. [no name mentioned], has developed a new approach to identify the most interesting planets or moons to search for life and help interpret potential biosignatures. The approach, called the quantitative habitability framework, compares computer models to calculate a probabilistic answer to the question of whether a specific organism can survive in a given environment. The framework does not insist on black-or-white answers and can handle uncertainties in the data. Dr. [no name mentioned] and his team have applied this approach to study the limits of life on Earth and explore whether certain organisms could survive on other planets, such as Mars and Europa. The framework is available as an open-source computer model and can be used by astrobiologists to help with current and future projects. If scientists detect a potential signature of life, this approach can help assess if the environment where it is detected can actually support the type of life that leads to the signature detected.

**From basement greens to gourmet cuisine**
Wesley Life Meals on Wheels, a non-profit organization in Des Moines, has broken the previous record of meals delivered in 2024, serving 428,116 meals. The organization's success is attributed to their move to Drake University's old College of Education building, where they have a hydroponic farm that provides fresh produce for their meals. According to Shannon Draayer, the executive director of health and well-being, nearly 2,000 home-delivery meals are prepared in the building every day. The hydroponic farm, which uses a nutrient film technique with setting rafts, has increased its production from 40 pounds a week to almost 80 pounds a week. Volunteers are welcome to help with the farm, meal deliveries, and other tasks. The organization also has a fine dining restaurant, Hugo's, which uses ingredients from the farm in its rotating meals. In the future, Wesley Life hopes to expand its meal palette to be more inclusive of other cultures and improve its reach in Iowa.

**Rätsel der Woche: Unique Fractions Sought**
There are 49 unique fractions that meet the conditions of the task. A broken number z (a/b) has the required properties if and only if z and 1/z have a maximum of three decimal places, when the condition is met: Both g and 10/g must be integers. Therefore, we are looking for all integer g that are divisors of 10. Once we have found these, we can calculate the corresponding fraction z using the formula g = 10*z.

**Mathematician Solves 200-Year-Old Equation with Novel Approach**
A mathematician has developed an algebraic solution to an equation that was thought to be unsolvable for over 200 years. According to the UNSW professor Norman Wildberger, 'Our solution reopens a previously closed book in the history of mathematics.' The problem, which has been a challenge for centuries, is related to solving polynomial equations of high degree. These equations are essential in various fields, including astronomy and software coding. However, when dealing with polynomials of 'high order', where x is raised to the fifth power or more, mathematicians have struggled to find a universal method of resolution. Professor Wildberger's new approach uses novel numerical sequences, described in a recent publication with Dr. Dean Rubine. 'We avoid the use of classical formulas for third or fourth roots, which are radicals,' says Professor Wildberger. 'Radicals generally represent irrational numbers, which are decimals that extend to infinity without repeating and cannot be written as simple fractions.' Professor Wildberger rejects the concept of irrational numbers, which he believes is based on an imprecise concept of infinity and leads to logical problems in mathematics. His new method for solving polynomials also avoids radicals and irrational numbers, instead using special extensions of polynomials called 'power series,' which can have an infinite number of terms with powers of x.

**Scientists Create New Method for Searching for Extraterrestrial Life**
American astronomers from the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science proposed a revolutionary method for evaluating the habitability of exoplanets, using our own existence around a yellow star as a key argument. The study, published on the arXiv preprint server, suggests that the classical approach to finding habitable planets, which focuses on zones where water can remain liquid, may be flawed. According to the researchers, if humanity emerged around a star of the same type as the Sun (yellow dwarf), rather than the more common red dwarfs, it statistically indicates that the latter are less suitable for complex life. The calculations show that if red dwarf systems were more than eight times more favorable for life than solar systems, the probability of our emergence around a yellow star would be less than 5%. This counterintuitive finding forces a reevaluation of the optimism regarding the habitability of planets around red dwarfs, which make up 70% of the stars in our galaxy. The study also makes bolder claims in the context of the multiverse hypothesis, where fundamental constants can vary between universes. In this scenario, the statistical approach becomes a powerful tool, and the researchers demonstrate that the constraints on the habitability of rogue planets, water worlds, and even environments with non-aqueous biochemistry are strengthened by at least an order of magnitude. The study's finding that the uniqueness of water for life may be overestimated is particularly intriguing, as it suggests that water's 'special' properties may not be as critical if life in the multiverse consistently chooses a water-based environment. This research may fundamentally change the strategies for searching for extraterrestrial life, shifting the focus from a narrow range of 'golden' conditions to a statistical analysis of planetary diversity. Future data from next-generation telescopes will allow us to test these bold predictions in the coming years. 'The fact that we exist around a yellow star is a strong argument that life is not as common as we thought,' said Dr. [no name mentioned in the article]. 'We need to rethink our assumptions about the conditions necessary for life to emerge.'

**The habitability of Earth tells us the likelihood of finding life elsewhere**
The habitability of Earth can tell us the likelihood of finding life elsewhere in the universe. According to Robert Egan, the search for habitable worlds is not just about finding planets in the 'Goldilocks zone', but also about having a protective magnetic field, a stable atmosphere, and the right elements. The multiverse hypothesis suggests that life consistently chooses water-based environments, but if future discoveries reveal that exotic environments are more habitable, it could shatter this framework. Sandora's research, which challenges our assumptions about water's uniqueness for life, could be the key to unlocking the question of whether we are alone in the universe or one of many universes. As Egan notes, 'the approach even challenges our assumptions about water's supposed uniqueness for life.'

**Bitcoin's 'Time Bomb': Should the 21M Cap Be Removed? - Crypto News Flash**
Justin Drake, a Bitcoin and Ethereum security researcher, has warned that Bitcoin's security is a 'ticking time bomb' due to its Proof-of-Work mechanism. According to Drake, the current mechanism is unsustainable and may leave Bitcoin vulnerable to attacks. He claims that Bitcoin's fixed supply cap of 21 million coins is a critical bug that breaks security. Drake suggests that Bitcoin should switch to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to fix the issue. He argues that even if Bitcoin reaches a value of $10 million per coin, the daily budget for network security would still be around $65 million, making it vulnerable to attacks. Drake believes that the fundamentals of Bitcoin's security are getting louder and that the issue needs to be addressed. He dismissed alternatives like BitVM and OP_CAT as speculative and insecure.

**What Are The Odds Of Alien Life?**
The Drake Equation is a mathematical framework for estimating the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. While it doesn't provide a definitive answer, it sets parameters for scientists to study and refine as our understanding of the universe expands. Dr. Frank Drake, then president of the SETI Institute, convened a historic meeting at the Green Bank Observatory in November 1961 to discuss the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, attended by luminaries such as Carl Sagan and Philip Morrison. The equation serves as a 'Rosetta Stone' for guiding discussions and scientific inquiries into the appearance of life and its development into something capable of sending messages across the light-years. 'It was a privilege to be in the company of so many famous and cerebral individuals,' said Dr. Drake, highlighting the significance of the meeting. 'The equation isn't a formula that spits out a number, but rather a tool for guiding our understanding of the universe and the possibility of life beyond Earth.'

**The Fermi Paradox: A Search for Extraterrestrial Life and Understanding Ourselves**
The Fermi Paradox, also known as the 'Great Silence', highlights the contradictions in our understanding of extraterrestrial life. Despite the passage of time since the Big Bang, we have not found any evidence of their existence, despite recent discoveries of exoplanets in habitable zones. According to physicist Enrico Fermi, 'If AI is the brain of a robot, then RPA is its hands.' One factor to consider when searching for an answer to the Fermi Paradox is the number of potential civilizations. This value allows us to determine the Drake equation, a mathematical formula that outputs the number of active, communication-capable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. The equation uses several factors, including star formation rate, percentage of stars with planets, number of habitable planets per star, percentage of planets where life emerged, percentage of planets where intelligent life developed, number of civilizations developing detectable communication technologies, and average lifespan of such civilizations. In short, the Drake equation claims that there should be many civilizations, but so far, SETI programs have not detected any signals. This raises the question of the scientific justification for such programs. Matthew Chilcote's article does not provide a direct answer to this question, but instead proposes a method for evaluating the probability of detecting a signal by a certain number of broadcasting civilizations by now. If the probability is low, the lack of evidence should not be surprising; if it is high, the silence may mean something. Chilcote's model suggests that the absence of detected electromagnetic signals from extraterrestrial civilizations may impose constraints on the number of existing civilizations. In certain scenarios, the model predicts a 99% chance of detecting at least one signal if the assumed number of civilizations (based on the Drake equation) is around 1. We have a zero result so far. However, it's worth noting that even the absence of positive results from SETI helps in resolving the Fermi Paradox: it allows us to exclude certain combinations of the number and lifespan of civilizations. Ultimately, as Universe Today writes, the purpose of programs like SETI is not only to search for extraterrestrial life, but also to better understand ourselves and the conditions that make intelligent life possible. A team of scientists from Germany studied the feasibility of a new method of searching for extraterrestrial life - using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They came to an unencouraging but important conclusion for the development of astronomy.

**Scientists Develop 'Venus Life Equation' to Determine Likelihood of Life on Venus**
Scientists have developed a mathematical equation, the 'Venus Life Equation' (VLE), to determine the likelihood of life on Venus. The equation, similar to the Drake Equation, takes into account three parameters: emergence (O), life resilience (R), and continuity (C). If combined, they result in: L = O x R x C. The parameters vary from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). For example, 'emergence' considers whether life could have appeared through abiogenesis or panspermia. 'Life resilience' assesses how large and diverse the biosphere could have been. 'Continuity' evaluates whether favorable conditions were maintained long enough. Some scientists believe that life may have existed on Venus in the past, when it had oceans and conditions similar to Earth's. Even today, at an altitude of about 50 km in the planet's atmosphere, the temperature and pressure are similar to those on Earth, leading to hypotheses about the possible preservation of microorganisms in Venusian clouds. Although we have only one confirmed example of life - Earth, the VLE equation provides a way to structure knowledge, set priorities, and outline gaps in our understanding of life in the universe. Even if we don't have answers yet, this tool helps us better understand not only Venus, but also the chances of life among countless other worlds.

**Could Venus host life? The Venus life equation can help us find out**
Scientists have developed the Venus Life Equation (VLE), a framework to estimate the probability of life on Venus. The VLE is similar to the Drake Equation, but tailored to Venus. It considers three key parameters: Origination, Robustness, and Continuity. Origination refers to the chance of life arising on Venus, while Robustness considers the potential size and diversity of the biosphere over time. Continuity looks at the chance that conditions amenable to life persisted on Venus. The VLE is agnostic to the type of life and its scale, and all factors in the equation span from 0, which means there's no chance, and 1, which indicates certainty. The authors of the VLE suggest that Venus may have had a period of watery warmth in the past, which could have allowed life to arise. They also propose that simple life could have survived to this day in the planet's clouds. However, the VLE suffers from the same handicap as the Drake Equation, with only one concrete example of life on Earth. Nevertheless, the VLE provides a framework for growing our understanding of life on other worlds. 'The fundamental goal of the VLE is to provide a scaffold for estimating the chance of life based on factors that can be constrained or quantified through observation, experiment, and modeling,' the authors write. 'Although we are currently limited by the n=1 problem of having Earth-based life as our only concrete example, we can nevertheless use our understanding of the genesis and evolution of life on Earth to establish a framework for identifying the unknowns and uncertainties of life on other worlds,' they add.

**Scientists Create Equation to Search for Life on Venus**
Scientists have created an equation to search for life on Venus. The equation, called VLE, is similar to the Drake equation and can estimate the probability of life on Venus. 'The fundamental goal of VLE is to provide a basis for assessing the probability of life,' said Diana Gentri, director of the NASA Astrobiology Laboratory. The equation is L=OxRxC, where L is the probability of life, and O, R, and C are three parameters: origin, strength, and continuity. Each parameter has a value from 0 to 1. The origin of life can occur through abiogenesis or panspermia, and this factor does not change over time. The strength of life depends on the availability of nutrients CHNOPS, access to energy, and functional diversity of life. Earth has a high value of R, which explains the stability of life on our planet. The continuity of life depends on the stability of the star and the planet's orbit, as well as geological stability and the absence of destructive events. 'Although we are limited by the problem of n=1, we can use our understanding of the genesis of life on Earth to study unknown aspects of life in other worlds,' explain the authors of the study. This approach can help us in the search for life on exoplanets. Understanding Venus gives us a key to solving the natural puzzle of the Solar System.

**Revolutionary Equation May Reveal Life on Venus**
Scientists have developed a revolutionary equation to determine if life ever existed on Venus, a major goal of space exploration. The equation, similar to the Drake Equation, is called the Venus Life Equation (VLE) and is presented in a recent study titled 'Probability of planetary life: the equation of life on Venus and the uncertainties for other worlds.' The study's author, Diana Gentry, director of the Ames's Aerobiology Laboratory at the NASA's Ames Research Center, suggests that Venus may have had a period of warm water, which could have supported life. The VLE uses three key parameters: Origination, Robustness, and Continuity, which form the equation L= OxRxC. L represents the probability of life at a given time, O the possibility of life arising before that period, R the size and diversity of the biosphere over time, and C the persistence of conditions favorable to life. The equation's values can change over time, making the VLE a dynamic tool for evaluating the possibilities of life on Venus, past, present, and future.

**Did Life Ever Exist on Venus? Scientists Develop New Equation to Find Out.**

The equation, presented at the 2025 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, is similar to the Drake Equation and takes into account factors such as origination, robustness, and continuity.

**New Forms of Estimating Alien Life in the Universe: Revisiting the Drake Equation**
Frank Drake, an American astronomer and radio astronomer, developed the Drake Equation in 1961 to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in the galaxy that might be able to communicate with Earth. The equation is expressed as: N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L, where each term carries significant uncertainties, making it more of a conceptual tool than a precise calculation. Some variables, such as R*, can be estimated with some accuracy, while others, like fi and fc, remain uncertain. Advances in astronomy and astrobiology have refined some of these factors over the years. The discovery of exoplanets has improved our understanding of fp and ne. However, the fraction of planets where life emerges (fl) and evolves into intelligence (fi) remains unknown. 'Intelligence and technological capability seem to be more uncommon phenomena, considering that billions of species existed before one developed the ability to send radio signals into space,' said an expert. The time of life of technological civilizations (L) is another crucial factor. If civilizations are common but have short lifetimes due to self-destruction or natural disasters, the chance of detecting them would be low. This point raises philosophical and scientific implications about the future of humanity. Modern versions of the equation have been developed, incorporating new concepts and refining the original parameters. Some scientists have added variables related to bio-signatures and technosignatures, while others have suggested including terms that address the impact of catastrophic events.

**The Drake Equation and Alien Typologies Catalogued by Ufologists Based on Case Studies**
The Drake Equation, a mathematical formula to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way, has been updated to 2025. Using values such as the rate of star formation, the fraction of stars with planetary systems, and the average lifespan of a technological civilization, the equation yields an optimistic N = 0.08, implying we might be alone or nearly so. In contrast, ufology has compiled an array of alleged alien races, drawing from a wealth of testimonies that have repeatedly and consistently confirmed the sighting of certain extraterrestrial typologies. When merging the Drake Equation with ufologists' alien typologies, two approaches emerge: either the lifespan of civilizations would need to rise significantly, or intelligence or communicative capacity would need to be far more prevalent than assumed. Alternatively, each civilization estimated by Drake might give rise to multiple races, yielding a figure modest compared to ufological accounts. Challenges and reflections arise from the lack of definitive data for many parameters in the Drake Equation and the need for objective scientific validation of ufological cataloguing.

**NASA Hopes to Reestablish Contact with Extraterrestrials**
The NASA is hoping to reestablish contact with extraterrestrials using a new method. The famous Drake equation calculates the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy, and it is not zero. It is now established that space is teeming with exoplanets located in the habitable zone of their star. Therefore, it is logical that scientists wonder what method would be the most effective for communicating with another form of life. 'The space is full of exoplanets, and it's only a matter of time before we find one that is capable of supporting life,' said a scientist. The NASA is currently exploring different options for communication, including the use of radio signals and laser pulses.
