**Forget Canada and Greenland, Puerto Rico Should be the 51st State of the Union**
If Donald Trump is serious about increasing the number of states in the Union, he should support Puerto Rico's bid to become a state, rather than continuing as a commonwealth. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, but lack representation in Congress and the right to vote for U.S. President. Despite this, Puerto Rico has a strong military presence, with one of the highest per-capita military enlistment rates and a history of honorable service since World War I. In 2024, Puerto Ricans voted in favor of statehood with nearly 60% support, marking the fourth time this century they have done so. However, any change to Puerto Rico's status would require Congressional approval, which has been divided on the issue. Additionally, Puerto Rico's massive debt and history of corruption and high crime would require significant U.S. government support if it were to become a state.

**Humberto Costa: 'Far-right Senate majority would be a disaster for democracy'**
Senator and interim president of the PT, Humberto Costa, expressed concern in an interview that the opposition may win a majority of seats in the Senate in 2026, when 54 of the 81 mandates will be renewed. 'I don't believe it will be easy, but if the far-right wins a majority in the Senate, it could be a disaster for our democracy,' he said. 'It could lead to the opening of processes against STF ministers, rejection of names for the Central Bank, regulatory agencies, and the diplomatic corps... it could be a true pandemonium.' Costa confirmed that he will run for re-election and stated that the PT's central strategy will be to prioritize the Senate election. He aims to form 'the future government Lula's bench' in case of Lula's re-election in 2026. 'In the Senate, the main strategy will be to form a solid base for the Lula government, so we don't have to face the same difficulties we're facing now,' he said. Costa also stated that the party will work to expand its presence in the Chamber. 'It's possible to do so with a well-planned election. Good teams and vote-pullers can improve our situation in the Chamber,' he said.

**The Meaning of "Commonwealth" - PUERTO RICO REPORT**
Puerto Rico is often referred to as a commonwealth, but what does this term really mean? The answer lies in the 1952 local constitution, which was approved by Congress. However, Congress was explicit that this did not change Puerto Rico's status as a territory or lessen federal control. Since then, the term 'commonwealth' has evolved to describe a potential relationship between the US and Puerto Rico, where Puerto Rico would have special rights and privileges. However, US officials have rejected this proposal as unconstitutional and unfeasible, stating that 'commonwealth' is not an option that the US federal government accepts. Despite this, the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico has continued to promote the 'commonwealth' label, even going so far as to urge supporters to vote for 'none of the above' in protest. In a 2017 plebiscite, 97% of voters chose statehood, further solidifying the unconstitutionality and unattainability of the 'commonwealth' platform.

**Senate rankings: The 5 seats most likely to flip**
The 2026 midterm cycle is heating up, with several Senate seats up for grabs. Here are the five seats most likely to flip: Georgia, North Carolina, Maine, Michigan, and New Hampshire. In Georgia, Sen. Jon Ossoff is considered the most vulnerable Democrat, and Republicans are eager to win back the seat. However, the GOP's top choice, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, has decided not to run, leaving a crowded field of B-tier candidates. In North Carolina, Democrats are waiting to see if Gov. Roy Cooper will run against Sen. Thom Tillis. In Maine, Democrats are struggling to find a viable candidate against Sen. Susan Collins, and Rep. Jared Golden has announced he will run for his House seat instead. In Michigan, a trio of Democrats are running to succeed retiring Sen. Gary Peters, including Rep. Haley Stevens and former health director Abdul El-Sayed. In New Hampshire, Rep. Chris Pappas is the top-tier Democratic candidate, but Republicans are eyeing a comeback with former Sen. Scott Brown. 'Kemp is the 1:1 on the board. Full stop,' said one GOP operative. 'This is a situation where you want a primary. Where you want them to show their mettle because I just don't think that we have a clear enough indication on any of these guys to say they can do it.' Democrats remain bullish on their chances, but the Republican Party is confident in their ability to win back the majority. 'I am bullish on Jon Ossoff.... He's done a great job. He's centered the people of Georgia and their needs and their concerns,' said Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.). 'I'd hate to have to run as a Republican in this moment,' he added.

**Puerto Rico is Trump's perfect partner in reshoring**
President Trump's executive order to bring pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the U.S. has created an opportunity for Puerto Rico to partner in this effort. As a territory, Puerto Rico has a $50 billion pharmaceutical manufacturing industry and a workforce ready to support the effort. However, the territory status has limited the island's economic development, creating uncertainty and an unequal playing field for economic competition. Puerto Rico's Republican Gov. Jenniffer González-Colón is leading an effort to reshape the national narrative about the island and its people, and ultimately achieve statehood. Her executive order promotes the relocation of overseas manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and other products to Puerto Rico, aligning with the Trump administration's vision to reshore advanced manufacturing of critical products. The Medical Manufacturing, Economic Development and Sustainability Act, recently reintroduced, incentivizes pharmaceutical manufacturing on the island and throughout economically distressed zones across the United States.

**PRFAA Insists There Will Be No Cuts to PAN**
The executive director of the Federal Affairs Administration of Puerto Rico (PRFAA), Gabriella Boffelli, stated that the proposed budget cuts by President Donald Trump are not definitive and that the US Congress will determine the final version. She also confirmed that the proposed budget includes an increase in funds for the Program of Nutritional Assistance (PAN), which will directly benefit Puerto Rico. According to Boffelli, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) document does not present significant changes in terms of priorities or proposed cuts. However, Trump still intends to reduce non-defense discretionary spending by over $160 billion, while proposing increases in military spending. Boffelli emphasized that the budget still needs to be evaluated, amended, and approved by Congress. 'The constitutional authority to evaluate, amend, and approve the budget rests exclusively with Congress. The legislative process has already begun,' she said. Boffelli stated that PRFAA remains attentive and active in the legislative process, advocating for the needs of Puerto Rico. She added that it is unlikely that the approved budget for fiscal year 2026 will include drastic cuts or the elimination of programs with bipartisan support, such as CDBG or Head Start.

**Thomas Rivera Schatz Advocates for Puerto Rico's Statehood and Reconstruction in Washington D.C.**
Puerto Rico's Senate President, Thomas Rivera Schatz, met with US Congress members in Washington D.C. to advocate for faster reconstruction of the island's electrical grid, streamlined permitting processes, and to promote the idea of Puerto Rico becoming the 51st US state. Rivera Schatz met with Senator Ashley Moody (R-FL), who has remained silent on the statehood proposal, and Representatives Mike Collins (R-GA) and Carlos Giménez (R-FL). According to Rivera Schatz, he agreed with Giménez that 'the only way for Puerto Rico not to become another Cuba is to achieve statehood' and that progress must be made in the reconstruction process. Rivera Schatz stated that his efforts began in March, following a statehood summit in Congress convened by Governor Jenniffer González, and that no statehood proposal for Puerto Rico has been presented yet. He emphasized the need for 'agility in the approval of reconstruction projects, equal treatment in federal programs like Medicaid, and a firm commitment to decolonization.'

**Group Proposing Puerto Rico Independence Meets with Senator's Staffer**
A group proposing independence for Puerto Rico by decree had a virtual meeting with a staffer from Senator Thune's office, a key ally of the Republican leader in the Senate. According to Sepúlveda, the staffer asked questions about the debate generated by Trump's interest in making Canada the 51st state of the US and annexing Greenland. Sepúlveda also stated that the staffer questioned whether the group's proposal had support in Puerto Rico, to which Sepúlveda replied that the recent plebiscite showed an advancement of independence, as the majority voted in favor of statehood. Despite this, officials from key congressional offices consulted by El Nuevo Día insisted that the topic of Puerto Rico's future remains off the agenda, despite efforts by pro-statehood and independentist groups.

**Puerto Rico Senate Approves Extension of Exemption on Income from Residential Rentals**
The Puerto Rican Senate has approved a measure to extend the exemption on income from residential rentals for 10 years, until 2035. This exemption, which is set to expire at the end of this year, aims to promote stability in the rental housing market in Puerto Rico. The measure, proposed by Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz, amends the Law of Stimulus to the Real Estate Market (Law 132 of 2010) to extend the exemption for 10 years. According to the law, the exemption currently benefits 'any individual, succession, corporation, society, or trust, resident or non-resident of Puerto Rico, that rents a new construction property or a qualified residential property.' However, the measure does not exempt short-term rental income from taxes, as it recognizes that these rentals 'have a predominantly tourist use.' Rivera Schatz stated, 'While we understand that supplemental short-term rentals should be considered a commercial activity, we also believe that these are alien to the purposes established in Law 132. This is because the purpose of Law 132 was to benefit people who rent properties with the aim of establishing their residence in them.' The legislative measure passed the Senate with a positive report from the Senate Committee on Housing and Social Welfare. The report states, 'At present, just as when the Legislative Assembly passed Law 132-2010, Puerto Rico faces a severe problem of affordable housing, exorbitant construction costs, and high bank interest rates that significantly reduce access to housing for Puerto Rican families.' The report details that the committee received a favorable opinion from the Department of Housing and that it did not request comments from the Municipal Revenue Collection Center (CRIM) because the measure 'does not impose an economic obligation on the municipal governments' budgets.' The report also does not mention that an opinion was requested from the Treasury Department or other fiscal agencies. Senate President Jaime Barlucea stated that 'it would be destructive for the people of Puerto Rico' if the Legislative Assembly does not act before the benefit expires in December, and that 'maintaining the exemption until December 31, 2035, would allow us to mitigate the negative impacts of inflation until better economic circumstances are reached.'

**Senate Approves Bill to Extend Coal Use in Puerto Rico Until 2032**
The Puerto Rican Senate approved a bill on Monday night, extending the use of coal as a source of energy generation in Puerto Rico until December 31, 2032. The bill, presented by La Fortaleza, includes language that establishes the reduction of fossil fuel use through the progressive integration of renewable energy, as technology allows, without compromising the continuity of the electrical system. The bill also maintains the compliance with the 2050 goals, particularly in terms of the reliability and resilience of the electrical service. The Popular Democratic Party (PPD), Independentist Party of Puerto Rico (PIP), and Dignity Project (PD) delegations, as well as independent senator Eliezer Molina Pérez, did not support the measure, which was confirmed with 18 votes in favor and 9 against.

**Puerto Rico Intensifies Campaign for Statehood in the United States**
Puerto Rico's government has strengthened its campaign in Washington D.C. to become the 51st state of the United States. Despite the lack of support from the Trump administration, Governor Jenniffer González expressed the local government's firm stance in favor of statehood during the Puerto Rico Equality and Statehood Summit at the Capitol, according to EFE. González stated that the people of Puerto Rico have consistently expressed their desire to become a state of the United States, as confirmed in the non-binding consultations of 2012, 2017, 2020, and 2024, in which 58% of voters supported annexation. González emphasized that statehood is a firm goal of the Puerto Rican government and that she is committed to pursuing it, despite the obstacles, including the lack of interest from the Trump administration and the opposition from some politicians. She also mentioned that Elon Musk, director of the US Department of Government Efficiency, expressed support for Trump's candidacy, citing the Democratic Party's intention to make Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. states to gain control in Congress. However, González downplayed these statements and reaffirmed that Puerto Rico has a political balance that would allow it to advance towards statehood, regardless of the party in power in the White House.

**Trump’s remarks on Canada becoming the 51st state raise a lot of questions**
President Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state, but the idea is met with skepticism by Canadians and faces significant hurdles. According to Trump, 'If people wanted to play the game right, it would be 100% certain that they'd become a state.' However, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has stated that Canada will never become the 51st state. To become a state, Congress would need to approve the addition, which would require a House majority and at least 60 votes in the Senate. Additionally, the Constitution's Admissions Clause would need to be satisfied, and the president would need to sign the bill into law. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has even proposed a counteroffer, suggesting that Canada buy Alaska and Minnesota in exchange for statehood. While there have been past pathways to statehood, such as the absorption of the 13 colonies and the annexation of Texas, Canada would likely need to hold a referendum to gauge voters' interests in joining the U.S. before proceeding. Trump's proposal has been met with criticism from Canadians, who view the U.S. more positively than negatively, but have been left feeling betrayed by Trump's tariffs. Adding Canada as a state would profoundly affect U.S. elections, with its population of 41.6 million making it the largest state and giving it 55 House seats and 57 Electoral College delegates. Other potential new states, such as Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., have also been discussed, but face significant opposition from Republicans.

**Puerto Rico as the 51st State: An Economic Powerhouse Waiting to Happen**
Making Puerto Rico the 51st state could be a 'slam dunk' for the U.S. economy, with billions in federal funding and job creation. According to the Government Accountability Office, Puerto Rico lost $2.9 billion in Medicaid funding in 2023 due to its territorial status. Statehood could also boost tourism, with the island's $9 billion industry potentially rivaling Hawaii's $20 billion. However, the article warns that Hawaii's statehood experience shows how economic gains can come at the cost of cultural identity, and that Puerto Rico's Spanish roots, Taíno heritage, and Afro-Caribbean soul must be protected. Governor Jenniffer González-Colón's GOP credentials and engagement with cultural icons like Bad Bunny could help sway Republicans and ensure buy-in from the 58% of Puerto Ricans who voted for statehood in 2024. 'Make it the 51st state, and watch it shine -- for itself, and for us all,' the article concludes.

**Could Canada really become the 51st US state? Here’s what it would take**
President Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested that Canada should be the 51st U.S. state, but the process of adding a new state is complex and would require approval from Congress. According to Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution, Congress must approve the admission of a new state, and the president must sign the bill into law. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham joked that 'They skipped Canada. We'll fix that next time!' However, no major legislation is advancing that would extend an invitation to statehood to America's northern neighbor. Canada would have to hold a referendum to gauge voters' interests in joining the U.S. before the process could begin. If Canada were to join the U.S., its population of 41.6 million would make it the largest state, and it would get two senators and 55 House seats. This would profoundly affect U.S. elections, making Canada the presidential race's richest prize with 57 Electoral College delegates. Trump has also talked about adding other potential new states, including Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., but Republicans now control both chambers of Congress and are likely to oppose adding states that could be majority Democratic.

**Could Canada Become the 51st State of the US?**
Former US President Donald Trump has suggested that Canada could become the 51st state of the US, but it would require a majority in the House of Representatives and a minimum of 60 votes in the Senate. The Constitution's Admission Clause states that new states can be admitted by Congress, but it would require the consent of the state legislatures and Congress. Canada would need to hold a referendum to measure the interest of its voters in joining the US. While there have been multiple paths to statehood in the past, the majority of states were added after Congress accepted a petition from a territorial legislative body. The possibility of Canada's approval seems low. If Canada were to join the US, it would become the largest state, surpassing California. It would also gain two senators and 55 seats in the House of Representatives, making it a highly sought-after prize in presidential elections. However, the Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929 limits the number of seats in the House of Representatives to 435, meaning other state delegations would have to reduce their seats to make room for the new Canadian members. This could make states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin less important in presidential elections. The article also mentions that Washington, D.C. has voted in favor of statehood and has a proposed constitution and boundaries, but it has not been approved by Congress. The Republicans now control both chambers, making it unlikely that they would approve the addition of states that could be majority Democratic, such as Puerto Rico or D.C.
