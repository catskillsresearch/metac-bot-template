**Half of the World's Population Exposed to Additional Month of Extreme Heat Due to Climate Change**
A new study has found that half of the world's population, approximately 4 billion people, experienced an additional 30 days of extreme heat last year due to climate change caused by human activity. The study, conducted by World Weather Attribution, Climate Central, and the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, analyzed the period from May 1, 2024, to May 1, 2025. According to the study, 'days of extreme heat' are defined as days where temperatures exceed 90% of the temperatures recorded in the same location between 1991 and 2020. The study found that in a world without human-induced climate change, there would have been 67 fewer days of extreme heat. The study's lead author, Frederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London, said, 'With every barrel of oil burned, every ton of carbon dioxide released, and every degree of warming, more people will be affected by heatwaves.' The study highlights the need for early warning systems, public awareness, and city-specific climate action plans to mitigate the effects of heat stress and solar radiation. Improving building design, including shading and ventilation, and adjusting behaviors such as avoiding strenuous activities during peak heat, are essential. However, adaptation alone will not be enough. The study warns that the only way to stop the increase in the severity and frequency of heatwaves is to gradually and rapidly transition away from fossil fuels.

**Incendi Canada: 'Wildfire Plume' Threatens Global Climate and Health**
A massive 'wildfire plume' of toxic smoke from the devastating Canadian wildfires season 2025 has been visible from space, threatening global climate and health. The Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite has captured a giant cloud of smoke over 3,000 kilometers long. A 'wildfire plume' is a vertical column of smoke, ash, and heat that affects local weather, public health, and continental climate dynamics. The main effects of this phenomenon are: 1. Large-scale air pollution, with fine particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and toxic gases that can cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems. 2. Fire-generated clouds, known as pyrocumuli, which can reach the stratosphere and facilitate the global dispersion of pollutants. 3. Climate and solar radiation impacts, with smoke particles forcing negative radiative cooling, temporary surface cooling, and altering atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns. 4. Lightning and secondary fires, where pyrocumuli can generate electrical charges, leading to dry lightning and new ignition sources. Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a climate scientist, said, 'This is a critical situation that requires immediate attention and action to mitigate the effects on global climate and health.'

**New York Proposes Limiting Large-Scale Dairy Farms to Mitigate Environmental Impact**
A proposed law in New York aims to limit the expansion of large-scale dairy farms by reducing permits for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). The law, proposed by Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal and Senator Jabari Brisport, seeks to mitigate environmental impacts and promote a more accessible market for small-scale agricultural operations. However, critics argue that it could harm established local farms. The current threshold for a farm to be classified as a large CAFO in New York is 700 mature cows. Jay Matteson, the agricultural coordinator for Jefferson County, claims that the law is unnecessary and could have devastating consequences for certain family-owned farms in the north of the state, which exceed the 700-head limit. 'Despite appearing large by Jefferson County standards, they are small businesses and essential to our communities,' Matteson said. The law would not directly impact CAFOs operating under existing permits, but generates uncertainty among agricultural workers about the treatment of renewable or expired permits. The environmental impact of industrial farms is central to the debate, with large-scale operations responsible for around 32% of human-generated methane emissions, a key factor in global warming. Rosenthal defended the project, stating that it would protect the environment and strengthen small farmers, although these claims have been disputed by detractors.

**New Technology Aims to Mitigate Climate Change by Enhancing Cloud Formation**
A new approach to mitigate climate change involves using electrical discharges and innovative technologies to enhance cloud formation and cooling, based on James Lovelock's CLAW-hypothesis. The idea is to create ionized aerosols that can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), promoting cloud formation and cooling. This can be achieved through Corona-discharges at tree leaves, the use of lightning protection to increase ionized aerosols, and the application of static rear-side foils to clean solar modules and dissipate heat. While the scientific basis for using Corona-discharges to enhance cloud formation is supported by experimental studies, the application to trees and the integration with lightning protection and solar module technologies is still speculative. There are uncertainties regarding scalability, environmental impacts, and long-term effects on the climate. Further research is needed to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and environmental implications of these approaches.

**How cities are adopting solar energy for sustainability and energy security.**
Cities are adopting solar energy to reduce emissions, enhance energy security, and address urban heat island effects. Rooftop installations, building-integrated photovoltaics, and large-scale solar projects are effective ways to generate solar energy. Governments provide incentives such as tax credits and feed-in tariffs to make solar investments more financially viable. Tokyo has introduced a mandatory solar power installation policy, requiring major housing suppliers to integrate solar power generation into new buildings. The policy is expected to lower household electricity costs and support disaster resilience. Solar energy is becoming integral to urban sustainability efforts, with cities implementing policies to support widespread adoption.

**Climate Change and Energy Supply Security: Separating Fact from Fiction**
The impact of climate change on energy supply security is a topic of discussion, particularly in relation to renewable energy and supply security. Peter Hoffman from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) has shown that weather patterns and supply security are connected. The PIK researchers have been studying typical large-scale weather patterns in Central Europe and how their frequency has changed in relation to climate change. Frank Kaspar, head of the Hydrometeorology department at the German Weather Service (DWD), stated that these large-scale weather patterns (high pressure over Central Europe) have not increased in frequency, and in fact, have decreased slightly over the past few decades. This means that there is no evidence to suggest that climate change is leading to an increase in 'Dunkelflaute' (a period of low solar radiation and calm winds). Kaspar emphasized that weather extremes can still impact supply security, and that the DWD provides weather data for various sectors, including energy supply. He also noted that the DWD analyzes whether certain changes are already visible, and that in many cases, the development of reality matches what climate models predict. Kaspar also highlighted the importance of thinking on a European scale when it comes to supply security, particularly during periods of 'Dunkelflaute', when other regions in Europe may have above-average wind power generation. Georg Bischof from Siemens Gamesa questioned whether climate change is undermining the wind resources on which we rely, which would impact supply security and economic calculations for wind power.

**Solar arrays help boost Colorado grassland productivity in dry years**
A four-year study in a semi-arid grassland in northern Colorado found that grasses growing in the shade of solar arrays were more productive than those growing in full sun during dry years. The study suggests that solar panels can create microclimates that reduce water stress for plants, leading to increased productivity. The researchers, led by Alan Knapp, aim to ensure an ecologically informed solar energy future. They found that the 'aridity mitigation potential' hypothesis, which suggests that growth benefits from reduced water stress outweigh potential reductions in growth from shading, holds true. The study's findings have implications for sustainable solar development in grasslands, particularly in areas with limited precipitation. Future work will focus on native shortgrass prairies, which will provide new information about how solar panels affect plant water use, soils, and grazing management in an ecosystem with even greater aridity.

**El Mojo and Baldío Gallardo to be Surrounded by Solar Panels as Part of Large-Scale Renewable Energy Project**
The rural barrios of El Mojo and Baldío Gallardo in Jerez, Spain, may soon be surrounded by solar panels as part of a large-scale renewable energy project. Jinko Power, a Chinese energy firm, has submitted plans for three photovoltaic plants covering over 459 hectares of land, with a total installed power of 108 megawatts. The project is currently being reviewed by the Andalusian government, and if approved, it will join other solar and wind energy projects in the area. 'We are committed to promoting renewable energy and reducing our carbon footprint,' said a spokesperson for Jinko Power. The project has been designed to minimize its impact on the environment and to ensure the efficient transmission of electricity to the grid. 'We believe that this project will not only benefit the local community but also contribute to the global effort to combat climate change,' added the spokesperson. Other companies, such as Eolia Renovables and Benbros, are also planning to build solar and wind energy projects in the area, which will further increase the region's renewable energy capacity.

**Revolutionizing Water Use in Agriculture with AI**
In a context affected by water scarcity and climate variability, agriculture faces the challenge of remaining productive without compromising natural resources. The use of artificial intelligence in irrigation systems is transforming agriculture by optimizing water consumption, improving yields, and contributing to sustainability in times of water scarcity. According to an analysis by the agricultural consulting platform Agrotech Campus, smart irrigation based on artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most promising technologies for the future of agriculture. This innovative system integrates IoT sensors, digital platforms, and machine learning algorithms that allow for automatic and precise monitoring, analysis, and adjustment of irrigation. Unlike traditional methods that rely on manual estimates, these systems respond in real-time to variables such as soil moisture, ambient temperature, solar radiation, and weather forecasts, ensuring that each crop receives the exact amount of water it needs. The benefits include reduced water consumption, improved crop health, reduced risk of water-related diseases, and more homogeneous and profitable production. Additionally, the use of predictive models allows for more efficient irrigation strategies that adapt to changing environmental conditions, reducing waste and protecting the soil from erosion and nutrient loss. The environmental impact is also significantly reduced, as the use of resources is minimized and inefficient practices are avoided, contributing to a more sustainable agriculture that protects the ecological balance without sacrificing productivity.

**Penguins' Waste Helps Cool the Antarctic, Study Finds**
A study has found that the waste left behind by a penguin colony helps to cool the Antarctic, and this works in a way that is opposite to what you might think. While cow emissions are commonly seen as a major contributor to climate change, penguin waste has the opposite effect. A study by Communications Earth & Environment found that penguin guano (excrement) plays a significant role in cooling the Antarctic and combating climate change. The researchers, led by Matthew Boyer, set up a measurement station near a large Adelie penguin colony (around 60,000 birds) on the Antarctic Peninsula. They found that the penguin guano has a direct, causal relationship with a cooling effect on the Antarctic climate. However, many penguin species are threatened, and Matthew Boyer notes that a decline in penguin populations could have feedback effects, such as reduced cloud formation and increased ice melt. This is in contrast to geo-engineering approaches, such as solar radiation management, which involve spraying sulfates into the stratosphere to cool the planet, but require significant organizational and energy-intensive efforts. The natural world often exhibits the highest level of engineering, making it even more worthy of protection, and penguins and their waste are a prime example of this.

**Is solar radiation management worth the risk for climate-vulnerable countries?**
The Paris Agreement set a goal to limit earth's warming to 1.5 °C, but the planet has already passed that limit. Despite efforts to halt global warming, greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Researchers are exploring sunlight reflection methods (solar radiation management or SRM) to artificially cool the climate. SRM aims to reflect more sunlight off the Earth and back into space, but it is not a substitute for emission reductions and has potential risks, such as ozone depletion and uneven global distribution of effects. The Global South is most vulnerable to climate change and would potentially benefit the most from SRM, but also has the most to lose if it fails. The Degrees Initiative is working to increase participation of the Global South in SRM research and ensure informed representation of developing countries. A global forum on SRM was convened in Cape Town, South Africa, to ensure a balanced representation from the Global South and the Global North. The Global South is better positioned to form its own opinion on whether to deploy SRM, but internationally-balanced governance is crucial to address questions of power and risk. Switzerland is seeking to take on a leading role in the governance of SRM by placing the issue on the agenda of the United Nations.

**Ensuring a Fair and Transparent Approach to Solar Radiation Management in Africa**
The increasing interest in 'Solar Radiation Management' (SRM), a set of large-scale interventions to lower global temperatures by increasing the amount of sunlight reflected back into space, has raised concerns about its potential economic and social impacts in Africa. The continent's policymakers and academics must ensure that discussions around SRM in Africa are guided by a set of principles that emphasize transparency, informed decision-making, and highlighting biases, power dynamics, and governance gaps surrounding this potential tool. Given the uncertainty surrounding SRM, African leaders must push towards a transparent and fair approach to researching governance of SRM methods. This includes recognizing the unequal power dynamics between those funding research in this field and those working to increase control over it. This gap will widen if governments, NGOs, and charitable organizations do not address the fact that private sector entities have begun to develop SRM. This is already happening to some extent, with powerful actors in the global north dominating the field, both in support of and opposition to SRM. Efforts to pursue new research in the global south and understand their political perspectives are encouraging, but still insufficient to overcome forms of colonial participation. To overcome these forms of participation, it is essential to facilitate knowledge exchange, rather than pushing towards predetermined outcomes.

**Playing with the Sun to Fight Global Warming? - TIme News**
Solar geoengineering, also known as Solar Radiation Management (SRM), is a technology that aims to reflect sunlight back into space to cool the Earth. The leading SRM techniques include Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI), Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB), Surface Albedo Modification, Space-Based Reflectors, and Cirrus Cloud Thinning. While SRM has the potential to rapidly cool the planet and protect vulnerable ecosystems, it doesn't address the root cause of climate change (greenhouse gas emissions) and raises ethical and governance dilemmas. Critics argue that SRM could create 'false hopes' and distract from the urgent need to reduce emissions. The risks of SRM include potential disruptions to precipitation patterns, damage to the ozone layer, and uneven distribution of benefits and risks across different regions. Dr. Claudia Wieners, a climate physics professor, suggests a temporary moratorium on SRM deployment to allow for a thorough assessment of the scientific and political implications. Ultimately, the future of SRM will depend on balancing its potential benefits with the inherent risks and ensuring that it is not used as a substitute for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

**Playing with the Sun to Cool the Earth: Climate Necessity or Gamble?**
The year 2024 was the hottest ever recorded globally. Emissions of CO2 continue to rise, and the effects of climate change are becoming more evident. Glaciers are melting, sea levels are rising, and extreme weather events such as droughts and floods are becoming more frequent. The goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C seems increasingly unachievable. What can be done? Technologies for solar radiation management (SRM) are gaining interest, despite being considered taboo in the past due to ethical concerns. SRM involves deliberate and large-scale interventions to reduce global warming. The most studied method is injecting aerosols into the atmosphere, which can reflect solar radiation back into space, reducing temperatures on the ground. Other options include painting streets and roofs white, deploying giant mirrors in space, and dispersing microparticles in cirrus clouds. However, these technologies have raised controversy, with some arguing that they address symptoms rather than causes of climate change. The scientific community is unanimous in stating that drastic and urgent reductions in CO2 emissions are necessary to combat climate change. SRM could provide a 'Plan B' to mitigate some effects of climate change, but it also raises fundamental questions, such as who should decide when and where to implement SRM, and who would be responsible in case of negative side effects.

**Could Geoengineering Really Combat Climate Change? | OilPrice.com**
Governments worldwide are exploring geoengineering as a potential solution to combat climate change. However, the efficacy and potential risks of Solar Radiation Management (SRM) are still unclear, with concerns about unintended consequences. The U.K. has announced plans to conduct small-scale outdoor geoengineering experiments as part of a $66.7 million government-funded programme. Mark Symes, head of the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria) programme, explained, 'The uncomfortable truth is that our current warming trajectory makes a number of such tipping points distinctly possible over the next century... This has driven increased interest in approaches that might actively cool the world in a short timeframe in order to avoid those tipping points.' However, many environmentalists and scientists are concerned about the potential impact of conducting SRM experiments, with some calling it a 'dangerous distraction' from cutting emissions.

**UK to Block Sunlight to Fight Global Warming**
The UK government is investing £50 million in a geoengineering project to block a portion of the sun's rays from reaching the Earth, aiming to combat global warming. The project, led by Professor Mark Symes, will conduct outdoor experiments to launch aerosol particles into the stratosphere for solar reflection, a process known as Solar Radiation Management (SRM). Scientists believe that SRM can help reduce the worst effects of climate change, but critics oppose the technology due to potential environmental repercussions. Experts say this type of foundational research is critical for understanding the full implications of SRM and how it might be deployed responsibly. According to Professor Jim Haywood, large-scale deployment of SRM may become viable within the next ten years when its efficiency has been proven. Dr. Sebastian Eastham highlighted the geopolitical significance of SRM, stating that it will impact international relations and must bring together global voices to assess its consequences.

According to the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria), the small-scale experiments will provide crucial data to assess the potential of geoengineering. However, experts warn that solar radiation management (SRM) could have unintended consequences, including altering rainfall patterns and potentially reducing the urgency to address the root cause of climate change, burning fossil fuels. As Professor Mark Symes, leading the Aria programme, said, 'the looming threat of climate change is a key reason for probing geoengineering techniques.'

**Government approves £50,000,000 experiment to dim the sun**
The UK government has approved a £50 million experiment to dim the sun and combat global warming. The Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria) will conduct small-scale, rigorously assessed outdoor geoengineering experiments to explore the potential of bouncing away sunlight. Techniques to be explored include spraying aerosolised particles into the stratosphere and using seawater sprays to make clouds brighter and deflect solar radiation. However, experts warn that solar radiation management (SRM) could inflict serious, unintended consequences, such as disrupting weather patterns. Professor Mark Symes, leading the Aria programme, said, 'The uncomfortable truth is that our current warming trajectory makes a number of such tipping points distinctly possible over the next century.' He added that no toxic substances will be released and local communities will be consulted, but the proposals are controversial, with some senior scientists calling SRM 'barking mad'.

**ENMOD and Geoengineering: A Threat to Global Security?**
The Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques (ENMOD) has not been updated since 1978. ENMOD aims to prevent the use of environmental modification techniques (EMTs) as a means of destruction, damage, or injury to another State Party. However, the Convention has limitations and ambiguities. The article III(1) clarifies that ENMOD only applies to the military or hostile use of EMTs, leaving room for the use of EMTs for peaceful purposes. The Convention also does not address the issue of EMTs being used in non-international armed conflicts (NIACs). The rise of geoengineering has raised concerns about the potential risks and uncertainties of these technologies. Geoengineering refers to the deliberate alteration of the Earth's climate system to mitigate the effects of climate change. The technologies involved in geoengineering include solar radiation management (SRM) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR). SRM aims to compensate for the effects of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations by reducing the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the Earth. CDR, on the other hand, aims to address the root causes of climate change by removing CO2 from the atmosphere. However, the implementation of geoengineering on a large scale raises concerns about its potential risks and uncertainties. The use of geoengineering technologies could be seen as a threat to global security, and their development and deployment could exacerbate existing conflicts or create new ones. The lack of international regulation and oversight of geoengineering technologies raises concerns about their potential misuse. The article concludes that the debate on ENMOD and geoengineering is ongoing, and that there is a need for international cooperation and regulation to address the potential risks and uncertainties of these technologies.
