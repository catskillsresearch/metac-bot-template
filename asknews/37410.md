**New Orleans Prison Escape: Eight Recaptured, Two Remain at Large**
Eight of the ten inmates who escaped from a prison in New Orleans have been recaptured, but two remain at large. According to The Associated Press, two of the fugitives, Leo Tate (31) and Jermaine Donald (42), were captured on Monday after a high-speed police chase in Walker County, Texas. 'They simply surrendered,' said Lieutenant Wade Roberts of the Huntsville Police Department. Another fugitive, Lenton Vanburen Jr. (26), was found sitting on a bench in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, after a tip from an anonymous caller. Five people, including three family members, have been arrested for allegedly helping Vanburen, and face charges of 'accessory after the fact,' which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison. Two fugitives, Derrick Groves (27) and Antoine Massey (33), are still at large and considered highly dangerous. Groves is a convicted murderer and faces additional charges for assaulting a corrections officer, while Massey has a lengthy criminal history and is being sought by authorities in St. Tammany Parish for kidnapping and rape. A $20,000 reward has been offered for information leading to their capture. The escape, which occurred nearly two weeks ago, exposed critical security flaws in the prison system. The inmates were able to force open a faulty door, escape through a hole behind a toilet, scale a fence with barbed wire, and flee under the cover of darkness. An independent investigation by the federal monitor of the 2013 consent decree on the New Orleans prison system warns of a deteriorated security situation in the facility. The report states that inmates were smoking marijuana without consequence, manufacturing homemade weapons, and in many cases, manipulating their cell locks. The monitors recommend reinstating a maximum-security unit, which was eliminated in 2022 by the current sheriff, Susan Hutson, who has been criticized for her decisions in the past two years.

**Louisiana AG confident remaining jailbreak fugitives will be recaptured after officials make 14th arrest**
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill is confident that the two remaining escaped inmates, Antoine T. Massey and Derrick Groves, will be recaptured. Murrill stated, 'I am absolutely confident that they will be recaptured, and we just are going to continue our very methodical work to get them back in custody.'

The eight re-arrested inmates include Lenton Vanburen Jr., Leo Tate, and Jermaine Donald. Murrill warned that Massey and Groves are 'armed and dangerous.' The Orleans Parish Sheriff, Susan Hutson, has called for a long-term investment in plumbing upgrades at the Orleans Justice Center, citing issues with flooding and 'severe plumbing issues.' Hutson has temporarily suspended her re-election campaign to focus on addressing the crisis. The FBI is offering rewards of up to $5,000 for information leading to the arrest of the escaped inmates.

**Reward Increased to $50,000 for Capture of Two Remaining Fugitives in New Orleans**
The FBI and Crime Stoppers of New Orleans have increased the reward for the capture of the two remaining fugitives, Derrick Groves and Antoine Massey, to $50,000 each. The two men escaped from the Orleans Justice Center on May 16. Groves, who was awaiting sentencing for two homicide charges, and Massey, who has a history of escape attempts, are considered a high risk to the community. Massey has escaped from custody three times before and was known to cut off his electronic ankle monitor. Cameron Lindsay, a former federal prison director, stated, 'Reclusos como Massey deberían estar en las zonas más seguras de la cárcel, bajo vigilancia constante y con rondas documentadas cada 30 minutos.' So far, 14 people have been arrested for allegedly collaborating with the fugitives before or after the escape, and the other six inmates who escaped have been recaptured.

**Search continues for four-time killer, serial escapee after New Orleans jailbreak**
The search for two remaining escapees from the Orleans Justice Center continues, two weeks after the May 16 jailbreak. Derrick Groves, awaiting sentencing for a double homicide, and Antoine Massey, a known escape artist, are still on the run. Massey had escaped custody three times before and was no longer eligible for an ankle monitor due to his habit of cutting them off. Cameron Lindsay, a former federal prison warden, expressed concern that Massey was housed in a first-floor cell, saying 'He would be housed in the most secure location within the jail... All staff would be apprised of this individual, and given his incredibly high risk for escape, I would require documented frequent checks at least once every 30 minutes on an irregular schedule.' The other eight escapees have been recaptured.

**Top prosecutor says 2 remaining New Orleans jail escapees may be in other cities: "They can't hide forever"**
Two inmates, Antoine Massey and Derrick Groves, who escaped from a New Orleans jail nearly two weeks ago may be in other cities, according to Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill. Eight of the 10 escapees have been recaptured, but Murrill said, 'They can keep running, but they can't hide forever.' Investigations into the escape are ongoing, with at least 13 people arrested in connection with the breakout. Murrill attributed the escape to a combination of factors, including the court system, jail staffing and infrastructure issues. She also highlighted the need for 'hardening' at the facility, including replacing locks and light bulbs, and efficiently moving cases through the court system. The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office has announced 'significant flooding' problems at the jail, and the attorney general has spoken with the sheriff about the issues.

**Mass Escape in New Orleans Sparks Search Operation and Bets on Recapture**
A massive escape in New Orleans, USA, has sparked a large-scale search operation and an unusual phenomenon: people are making bets on who will be the first to be recaptured. On May 16, 2025, 10 inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Prison by digging a hole behind a toilet in their cells, with the help of a maintenance employee, Sterling Williams. Williams was arrested on May 20, 2025, and faces multiple charges, including 10 related to the escape and one for malfeasance. According to investigators, Williams was coerced by one of the fugitives, Antoine Massey, who had previously escaped from the prison. Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson expressed her concern: 'The escape of 10 individuals is unacceptable and deeply concerning to me as your sheriff. This was a coordinated effort, aided by members within our own agency who chose to break the law.' A Polymarket website began accepting bets on who would be recaptured first, with Antoine Massey, Leo Tate, and Lenton Vanburen being the most likely to be caught, according to users. Since the escape, authorities have recaptured five of the fugitives, but the search continues for the remaining five, some of whom are linked to serious crimes such as second-degree murder and domestic abuse. The situation has caused concern among officials, with the district attorney, Jason Rogers Williams, admitting to feeling personally threatened, as well as the lawyers who initially imprisoned the inmates and have since left the city with their families due to fear of retaliation.

Ten inmates escaped from the New Orleans Parish Jail in the early hours of May 16, 2025, by removing a toilet and a sink from their cell and squeezing through a gap behind it.

**Ten Inmates Escape from New Orleans Prison, Leaving Behind Mocking Graffiti**
Ten inmates, considered violent, escaped from a prison in New Orleans, Louisiana, on the night of May 16, leaving behind a series of mocking graffiti for the prison staff. The escapees, who had been hiding behind a small hole in the wall near the toilets, were able to climb out of the prison through a maintenance area. The sheriff, Susan Huston, revealed that the inmates had been in flight for over eight hours before the alert was raised. Before disappearing, the escapees left several messages on a wall, including 'To Easy LOL', 'I'm/We Innocent', and 'Attrapez-nous quand vous le pouvez' ('Catch us when you can'). Three of the escapees have already been recaptured, while seven remain at large. The authorities are concerned that the remaining escapees may try to settle old scores or find witnesses related to their trials. The sheriff has opened an investigation into the escape, suggesting that the inmates may have received outside help. 'This incident once again demonstrates the urgent need to renovate our facilities,' she said. The sheriff has already requested additional funding to replace old cell doors, including the one that was forced open during the escape. She also pointed out the chronic understaffing at the prison, which holds around 1,400 inmates. 'We are desperately short of personnel, which compromises the safety of everyone,' she added.

Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson stated that the department is working with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to search for the escaped inmates. 'We are actively working with our partners to ensure the public's safety and to bring these individuals back into custody,' Hutson said.
