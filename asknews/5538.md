**Regulatory Update: Senate Votes to Block California’s EV Mandate**
The U.S. Senate voted 51–44 to rescind California's authority to enforce its Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) regulation, which required all new light-duty vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035. The bill aims to repeal gas vehicle bans in California and 30% of the U.S. auto market, citing job loss concerns and unrealistic regulatory burdens. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta have denounced the measure and announced plans to mount a legal challenge, calling it an infringement on states' rights under the Clean Air Act. The law does not fully eliminate the authority of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which still maintains regulatory control over in-use emissions and certain specialized programs. The fate of the resolutions remains uncertain in the Senate, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Senate Parliamentarian have both concluded that California's EPA waivers are not subject to repeal under the Congressional Review Act. Legal experts note that California's authority to set stricter emissions standards is enshrined in the Clean Air Act and has historically withstood court challenges. The California standards, including ACC II and ACT, remain in effect, and private fleets in California and Section 177 states no longer have an obligation to acquire ZEVs. However, the manufacturer-driven ACT and ACC II rules are still in place, with litigation pending.

**Special Depreciation for Electric Company Cars to Boost E-Auto Sales**
Bundesfinanzminister Lars Klingbeil has proposed a special depreciation for electric company cars to boost the sale of E-Autos. This would be a good news for private buyers as well. According to the draft law, companies that purchase new, purely electric vehicles between July 1, 2025, and December 31, 2027, will be able to claim particularly generous depreciation rules. In the year of purchase, 75% of the acquisition costs can be claimed as a tax deduction. In the following year, a further 10% can be deducted. In the subsequent years, the rate decreases: 5% in the second and third year after purchase, 3% in the fourth year, and 2% in the fifth year. This special depreciation also applies to electrically powered commercial vehicles, trucks, and buses. Klingbeil himself describes the measure as an 'Investitions-Booster.' The draft law also includes other investment incentives, such as a special depreciation of up to 30% on other movable assets, such as machines or office equipment, in the period 2025-2027. From 2028, a gradual reduction of the corporate tax rate is planned, from the current 15% to 10% by 2032. The financial consequences for the state budget would be significant, with estimated tax revenue losses of around 48 billion euros by 2029, with the special depreciation for electric vehicles accounting for a significant portion of this amount.

**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**Trump administration blocks California's electric vehicle mandate**
The California dream of a fully electric state has been shattered by the federal government. Since 1970, California has set its own rules for emissions, which are stricter than the federal government's. However, this has been challenged by the Trump administration, which has blocked the state's mandate to sell a certain percentage of electric vehicles by 2035. The norm is 35% in 2026, 68% in 2030, and 100% in 2035. California Governor Gavin Newsom maintains that the state will still meet its climate goals, citing its 'legal responsibility under federal law to protect the community and reduce major pollutants to levels required by federal law.' According to Mary Nichols, former president of the California Air Resources Board, the state could consider stricter emissions limits for factories and oil refineries to make up for the difference. The state could also encourage public transportation or impose penalties on gas-powered vehicle owners, as seen in Europe.

**Mexican Senate Proposes Reforms to Boost Electric Vehicle Market**
The Mexican Senate is analyzing a package of reforms to encourage the development of electric vehicle infrastructure at the federal, state, and municipal levels, aiming to boost the country's electric vehicle market and reduce pollution. The proposed reforms modify the General Climate Change Law to require authorities to promote the construction of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. By 2040, all new vehicles sold or leased should be zero-emission, and by 2035, all government-owned or leased vehicles should be electric or zero-emission. According to Senator Agustín Dorantes, 'despite Mexico's exponential growth in electric vehicle sales, they only represented 1.62% of the market in 2024, with over 24,000 new vehicles sold.' Dorantes added that while Mexico struggles to reach 130,000 electric, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, other countries have already surpassed this number. China, for example, sold 8.4 million electric vehicles in 2023, making it the world's largest market for electric vehicles. The proposed reforms also aim to accelerate the transition to electromobility by modifying the General Mobility and Road Safety Law to require local laws to establish timelines and stages for this transition.

**California's Gavin Newsom Proposes Asset Test for Medi-Cal Eligibility**
California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a 'new asset test' to limit access to the Medi-Cal free healthcare program. This measure aims to reject applicants with assets exceeding $2,000. The state will evaluate bank accounts, check for a second car, and inspect cash reserves to determine these assets. The asset test was previously eliminated in 2024 for low-income individuals and those with disabilities, but Newsom has decided to reinstate it. Medi-Cal applicants must have gross income between 213% and 322% of the federal poverty level. The test will resume on January 1, 2026, sparking opposition from non-profit groups like Disability Rights California, who see it as a 'dangerous vision' for California's spending, causing 'tremendous harm' and not aligning with the needs and desires of most Californians, as stated by the organization.

**California Governor Proposes Wealth Check for Medicaid Applicants**
California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a new budget plan that includes a 'wealth check' for applicants of the state's Medicaid program, Medi-Cal. According to the plan, only applicants with assets worth less than $2,000 will be eligible for the program. This is another measure taken by Newsom to address the state's budget shortage. The plan aims to reduce the program's costs, which have increased by $37.6 billion from 2014-2015 to 2024-2025, from $17.1 billion to $53.7 billion. The number of Medi-Cal beneficiaries has increased from 12.7 million in 2019-2020 to 15 million in 2024-2025. Newsom's proposal would reintroduce the 'wealth check' to limit the eligibility for Medi-Cal, which was previously required for low-income seniors and people with disabilities. The state would review applicants' bank accounts, cash, and other assets to determine their eligibility. If approved, the 'wealth check' measure would take effect on January 1, 2026. According to the California Department of Health Care Services, reinstating the 'wealth check' and reducing the 'Home Supportive Services' program would save the state $94 million in the upcoming fiscal year, $54 million in the next fiscal year, and $79.1 million annually thereafter.

**California Governor Proposes Reintroducing 'Asset Checks' for Medi-Cal Applicants**
California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a new budget plan that would reintroduce 'asset checks' for all applicants of the state's Medi-Cal program. Only those with assets worth less than $2,000 would be eligible for the benefits. This is another measure taken by Newsom to address the state's budget shortage. Two weeks ago, he proposed another budget plan to limit the access of undocumented immigrants to Medi-Cal. Medi-Cal is the California version of the federal Medicaid program. According to Newsom's revised budget plan, the funding cost for Medi-Cal has increased by $37.6 billion from $17.1 billion in 2014-2015 to $54.7 billion in 2024-2025. The number of Medi-Cal beneficiaries has increased from 13.7 million in 2019-2020 to 15 million in 2024-2025. Newsom proposes to limit the eligibility for Medi-Cal by reintroducing 'asset checks' to solve the problem of rising costs. In the past few decades, California has required low-income elderly and disabled people to undergo 'asset checks' to be eligible for Medi-Cal. This means that a single applicant with assets worth more than $2,000 is not eligible. For married couples, the asset limit is $3,000. The state will review the applicant's bank accounts, cash on hand, and whether they own a second car, among other data, to determine if they have $2,000 in assets. However, in 2024, California abolished asset checks and allowed all income-eligible people to apply for certain Medi-Cal projects regardless of their total assets. According to the California Department of Health Care Services, if asset checks are reinstated and another welfare program, 'Home Supportive Services', is reduced, the state is expected to save $94 million in the upcoming fiscal year, $54 million in the next fiscal year, and $79.1 million annually thereafter. If Newsom's proposal is approved, the 'asset check' measure will take effect on January 1, 2026.

**Speed Governor Market to Grow at 5.5 Percent CAGR by 2032: Enhancing Road Safety and Fuel Efficiency in a Changing Automotive Landscape**
The Speed Governor Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5 percent from 2025 to 2032, driven by increasing awareness of road safety, fuel efficiency, and emission control. Speed governors are electronic or mechanical devices that limit a vehicle's maximum speed, improving road safety and reducing fuel consumption. They are commonly used in commercial fleets, passenger cars, school buses, and government service vehicles. Governments in many countries have made speed governors mandatory for certain vehicle categories, especially heavy trucks and passenger transport vehicles. The market is segmented by type (electronic, adaptive, variable, and other) and application (passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, heavy commercial vehicles, and others). Key companies in the market include Continental, Vodafone Automotive, Autokontrol, and SABO Electronic Technology. The adoption of speed governors is high in the commercial vehicle sector, particularly in trucking and delivery companies. The devices help reduce accident risk, improve fuel economy, and reduce wear and tear on tires, brakes, and engines. In the future, the market is expected to evolve towards smart, connected, and adaptive solutions, with integration with GPS and telematics systems, and the use of intelligent speed assistance (ISA) in all new vehicles. As governments strengthen road safety frameworks and fleet operators seek more efficient ways to manage risk, the demand for reliable, advanced speed control technologies will continue to rise.

**California ISO Approves 2024–2025 Transmission Plan to Support Grid Reliability and Future Demand**
The California Independent System Operator (ISO) Board of Governors has approved the 2024–2025 Transmission Plan, which outlines 31 proposed infrastructure projects to support grid reliability and future demand. The plan aims to accommodate projected increases in electricity demand, particularly in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area, driven by increasing electrification and electric vehicle usage. The total estimated cost of the projects is approximately $4.8 billion, with full implementation expected over a 10- to 15-year period. The plan includes five reconductoring projects to increase transmission capacity without constructing entirely new lines, and reflects updated projections of load growth, with the state's year-over-year peak demand growth rate forecast to increase from 0.99% to 1.53%. According to data provided to the ISO, California is projected to require over 76 gigawatts (GW) of additional capacity by 2039. 'The plan follows a stakeholder engagement process that included public meetings and opportunities for feedback,' said the ISO. The plan was developed in coordination with the CPUC, the California Energy Commission, and other regulatory agencies.

**Newsom's 100% EV dream is stuck in traffic**
California's goal to ban sales of all new gas or diesel-powered passenger cars and light trucks by 2035 is facing challenges. According to the California New Car Dealers Association's 2025 Auto Outlook Report, just 20.8% of new cars were zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) in Q1 2025, a decline from 22% in 2024. Robb Hernandez, the association's chairman, said, 'Dealers sell what customers want to buy. No mandate can force consumers to choose otherwise.' Tesla's market share decreased to 43.9% in Q1 2025, down from 55.5% in Q1 2024, due to declining registrations. The state's expired EV tax credit, which excluded Tesla, has not been extended. Consumer Reports found that car buyers can still benefit from federal EV tax credits and rebates from local utility providers. The next governor may not continue Newsom's signature issue, as former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has pivoted towards the oil industry in his campaign for governor. The 35% goal for 2026 and the 100% EV mandate by 2035 may be postponed due to these challenges.

**US Senate Rejects California's 2035 Zero-Emission Car Plan**
The US Senate has voted to reject California's 2035 zero-emission car plan, which was championed by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom. The plan, which was passed by the state legislature in 2022, requires all new cars sold in California to be 'zero-emission' by 2035. California is the state with the largest number of electric vehicles in the US, and has been benefiting from a stricter environmental standard system than federal law for over half a century. The Senate's resolution revokes the Biden administration's exemption for 2035's ban on internal combustion engine cars. The only Democratic senator to vote in favor was Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who said, 'This would affect the entire country because of their market share.' Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah added, 'But Gavin Newsom doesn't have the power to screw over the other 49 states.' The text has been sent to the White House and is expected to be signed into law by Trump. California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the Republican decision, saying it would 'give China the upper hand in the US auto industry.' The dispute is likely to end up in court. Trump has repeatedly called climate change a 'scam' and has expressed a desire to drill for oil at will during his 2024 campaign. He has also been a vocal critic of electric vehicles and has abandoned the goal of selling 50% electric vehicles in the US by 2030, which was set by his predecessor Biden.

**U.S. Senate Blocks California’s Electric Car Mandate in Historic Vote**
The U.S. Senate has voted to block California's electric car mandate, which aims to phase out gas-powered cars by 2035. The decision, which was made along party lines, could upend California's efforts to clean its air and reduce greenhouse gases. California officials have vowed to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the move is illegal and will harm public health. The mandate requires 35% of new 2026 model cars sold in the state to be zero-emissions, increasing to 68% in 2030 and 100% in 2035. California Governor Gavin Newsom said, 'Zero-emission vehicles are here to stay.' The state faces a $12 billion deficit and may now have to rely on voluntary efforts to clean up cars and diesel trucks. Experts say the move sets a dangerous precedent and could trigger a high-stakes legal battle between California and the federal government.

**Senate Could Block California's Self-Imposed Emission Standards**
California's plan to ban the sale of new diesel- and gasoline-only-powered vehicles by 2035 is facing a challenge in the Senate, where Republican senators are targeting the waivers that allow the state to enforce stricter emissions rules. If the waivers are blocked, the push for an EV transition could slow or stall. California's Governor Gavin Newsom has laid out plans to increase the percentage of zero-emission passenger vehicles, with a goal of 100% by 2035. The used-car market would not be affected by the law. Some automakers have expressed relief at the possibility of a relaxation of the California emissions standards, while others, such as SEMA, have spoken out against the EV mandate, citing concerns about jobs for small businesses. California lawmakers have indicated a willingness to sue if the waivers are rescinded or blocked.

**Senate Republicans want effort to block vehicle-emission rules in California. Here's what to know**
The US Senate is set to vote on a measure that could block California's plan to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The rule, which requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, has been approved by the federal government and is supported by several other states. However, Senate Majority Leader John Thune claims that the rule is an 'improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority' and would 'endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation's energy supply.' California Governor Gavin Newsom and state air regulators argue that the measure is illegal and will likely sue if it advances. The rule would require electric vehicles to make up 43% of new sales by 2027, 68% by 2030, and 100% by 2035. Several automakers, including Honda, Ford, and Volkswagen, have signed deals with California to follow some of the state's tailpipe emission standards, but have not committed to complying with the 2035 mandate. The National Automobile Dealers Association has urged the Senate to pass the measure, while the Safe Roads Coalition has argued that the medium- and heavy-duty truck rule is unfeasible and should be blocked. Thune has also claimed that the nation's grid cannot handle California's plans, but Newsom's administration argues that the state is on its way to building out an electric grid and charging infrastructure that can support many more electric vehicles.
