**Serbian Students Demand Early Elections, Threaten to 'Radicalize the Protest'**
Protests in Serbia have been ongoing for over six months, with students demanding the immediate dissolution of parliament and early parliamentary elections. If their demands are not met by mid-May, they threaten to 'radicalize the protest'. The students plan to release a list of their candidates for the elections within a week. President Alexander Vucic has responded to the students' demands, saying that they have 'stolen six months from Serbia, ruined the country, and now want to turn faculties into party committees and municipal committees, which is a crime according to the Constitution and Serbian laws'. Vucic also stated that the students will have to wait for the elections, but only he, as the president, can appoint them. The protests began in November last year after a tragic incident in the second-largest city in Serbia, Novi Sad, where a concrete canopy collapsed, killing 16 people, including children. The students initially demanded that the authorities hold those responsible accountable, and then began to make political demands, including a change of government. The current government, led by President Vucic, has been in power for 13 years. The students' list of candidates is expected to include people they trust to fulfill their demands, not the students themselves. According to a survey by the CRTA research center in Belgrade, 59% of citizens support the students' protests, and 44% are willing to vote for the list provided by the students. The authorities are opposed to the students' demands, with Vice-Premier and Minister of Internal Affairs Ivica Dacic stating that there is no reason for early elections, as the government has a stable majority in parliament. Experts believe that the students' protests are being fueled from outside, with Western powers and special services financing and instructing radical young people. The protests have lost momentum, with no new significant events occurring in the past two months. The opposition is fragmented, and it is unclear what kind of opposition the students will support. The summer season will make it difficult for the students to gather large crowds, and the authorities are unlikely to respond nervously to their demands as they did in the winter.

**Czech President Announces Parliamentary Election Date**
Czech President Petr Pavel announced that the country's parliamentary election will be held on October 3 and 4, citing the 'Constitution' and 'Czech Chamber of Deputies Election Act'. The decision still needs to be signed by the Prime Minister and published in the 'Collection of Laws' before the election is officially announced. According to previous election regulations, each political party's election expenses cannot exceed 90 million Czech koruna (approximately NT$1.2 billion). Pavel previously stated that he would decide on the election date by May, but did not want to announce it too early to avoid parties circumventing the legal election expenditure limits. The deadline for submitting candidate lists is July 29, and regional authorities must decide by August 15 whether to allow participation in the election. This year's Czech parliamentary election also introduces 'overseas absentee voting', where overseas voters must register with the Czech embassy or consulate to be added to the voter roll, and their ballots will be sent to their overseas address. The Czech last held a parliamentary election in 2021. The Czech Chamber of Deputies has 200 seats, and at the time, the 'Together' (SPOLU) alliance and the 'Pirates and Mayors' (Piráti a Starostové) alliance won a total of 108 seats, securing a majority in the parliament. After the election, the leaders of the five parties in the two alliances formed a coalition government, with Petr Fiala, the chairman of the People's Party (ODS) in the Together alliance, serving as Prime Minister.

**Guinea's Prime Minister Announces Elections by December 2025**
Guinea's Prime Minister Amadou Oury Bah stated that elections could take place before December 2025. 'Everything is in place for it to happen at the end of the year, in December,' he said. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of voter registration, stating that 'everyone is mobilized for enrollment, both inside the country and in the capital, because that's what will be decisive.' The junta, led by General Mamadi Doumbouya, initially committed to holding a constitutional referendum and transferring power to elected civilians by the end of 2024, but these deadlines were not met. The junta has announced a constitutional referendum for September 21, and several high-ranking officials have publicly expressed support for General Doumbouya's potential candidacy, despite his initial promise not to run. The opposition and civil society in Guinea criticize the junta's increasingly authoritarian rule, which has led to the arrest, disappearance, and exile of many opponents, as well as the repression of dissenting voices and the suspension of opposition parties.

**Costa: Serbia is 'completely committed' to EU accession**
European Council President Antonio Costa met with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic in Belgrade, emphasizing the need for Serbia to be more in line with the EU. Costa stated that Serbia is 'completely committed' to its accession process to the EU. He also addressed Vucic's criticism for attending the Victory Day parade in Moscow last week, saying 'We cannot rewrite history and we fully understand that Serbia is celebrating its own liberation.' Costa also mentioned the ongoing war in Ukraine, saying 'We cannot celebrate our own liberation 80 years ago and condemn another country's occupation today.' Vucic promised Costa that Serbia will make additional efforts to join the EU faster. Serbia has been under pressure after a series of protests led by students in November 2024, which were sparked by a tragic accident in Novi Sad. Vucic has been criticized for his close ties with Russia and China, and for not joining Western sanctions against Russia due to Serbia's dependence on Russian energy. Instead, Serbia supported a UN resolution condemning Russia's attack on Ukraine.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic stated that in the event of the refusal to form a new government, parliamentary elections may take place in May. 'I think that in the next 10-12 days, approximately until the 17th, the parliament should finally confirm the resignation of the government and its chairman.

If the government is not formed, it is likely that the elections will take place in early May,' Vucic said in an interview with Radio and Television of Serbia.

Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucetic resigned on January 28, stating that the ongoing street protests are organized and controlled from abroad with the goal of a state coup.

**What awaits Serbia? The decision will arrive within 10 days**
Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić announced that a decision will be made within 10 days on whether to form a new government or hold parliamentary elections, likely in April.

The Law on Government states that if the National Assembly does not elect a new government within 30 days, the President of the Republic must dissolve the Assembly and call for elections. The technical government will only be able to carry out current affairs and cannot propose laws or appoint civil servants.

**Serbian President Announces Possibility of Early Elections Amid Protests**
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic announced the possibility of early elections after the resignation of Prime Minister Mihailo Vucetic, a key ally, amidst protests. In a televised address on Tuesday evening, Vucic stated that his party would have ten days to decide whether to form a majority government or hold early parliamentary elections. 'New elections can take place in April. There can be no talk of a temporary government,' he said. This statement marks a sharp turn for Vucic, whose party easily won the early elections in 2023 but has been facing increasing pressure lately. Protests, which began with small gatherings in Novi Sad, have grown and spread to the capital, Belgrade. Ministers of Construction, Transport, and Infrastructure, and Trade have already resigned due to an incident, but it has not helped to quell the protests. 'I took this step to ease the tension,' Vucetic said, announcing his resignation. However, it seems that this has not calmed the students leading the protests.

**Serbian President Considers Holding Unprecedented Elections in April**
Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić stated that a decision to form a new government or hold early parliamentary elections in April will be made in the near future, following the resignation of Prime Minister Miloš Vujović amidst anti-government protests. According to Reuters, Vučić made this announcement during a press conference after an extraordinary cabinet meeting. 'New elections may take place in April. A temporary government cannot be discussed,' he said.
