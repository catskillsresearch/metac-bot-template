**Ukraine and Russia's History of Failed Peace Talks**
Ukraine and Russia have a history of failed peace talks, with Russia repeatedly violating international and bilateral agreements. Since the 2014 annexation of Crimea, efforts to end the war have been ongoing, but unsuccessful. Russian President Putin has proposed a new round of peace talks in Istanbul on May 15, but European leaders have rejected the proposal unless Russia and Ukraine agree to a ceasefire first. Ukrainian President Zelensky has also expressed similar views. US President Trump has tweeted that Putin does not want to sign a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to discuss ending the 'bloody war' in Turkey. Zelensky has called for a ceasefire to begin on Monday, saying that extending the killing is meaningless. It is unclear whether Putin will attend the talks personally, as he has not met with Zelensky since 2019 and has questioned Zelensky's legitimacy as president. Russia has never achieved a lasting ceasefire since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but has reached short-term agreements several times. However, these agreements have been repeatedly broken, with both sides accusing each other of violating them. From a longer historical perspective, Russia has repeatedly violated international agreements aimed at protecting Ukraine's security since the Soviet Union's collapse. The Budapest Memorandum, signed in 1994, committed Russia, Ukraine, the US, and the UK to respecting Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and borders. However, Russia has repeatedly violated this agreement, including its 2014 annexation of Crimea and ongoing aggression against Ukraine. Two Minsk agreements, signed in 2014 and 2015, also failed to bring peace. Despite these agreements, Russia has continued to violate them, and the conflict remains ongoing.

**Putin Proposes Direct Negotiations with Ukraine, Delaying Ceasefire**
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed direct negotiations with Ukraine on May 15 in Istanbul, delaying the possibility of a ceasefire. Putin stated that Russia is ready for talks 'without any preconditions' and that these conversations should focus on the 'deep causes of the conflict.' However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has already agreed to a ceasefire 'in all its forms' starting on Monday. In response to the ultimatum from Ukraine and its European allies for a 30-day ceasefire, Putin requested a bilateral meeting with Ukraine in Turkey. 'The Russian Federation is ready for negotiations without preconditions. We propose that they start on May 15 in Istanbul,' Putin said. French President Emmanuel Macron downplayed Putin's proposal, stating that an unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations by definition. Macron also emphasized that negotiations cannot take place while civilians are being bombed. 'There can be no dialogue if, at the same time, civilians are being bombed. A ceasefire is needed now, so that negotiations can begin. For peace,' Macron said on social media.

**World Awaits Putin's Decision on Immediate Ceasefire**
The world is waiting for Vladimir Putin to make a clear decision to immediately and unconditionally stop the war, said Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. He was commenting on Putin's proposal for bilateral negotiations with Ukraine from May 15. 'In response to our appeal, the Russians proposed peace talks from May 15. However, the world is waiting for a clear decision on immediate and unconditional ceasefire. Ukraine is ready. There will be no more victims,' Tusk wrote on social media. The leaders of the UK, France, Germany, and Poland, after an online meeting of the Coalition for Ukraine in Kiev on Saturday, emphasized that if Russia refuses to stop the war, sanctions against Russia will be strengthened, and support for Ukraine will increase. Their position is coordinated with the US. US President Donald Trump reacted positively to the events of May 10: 'A potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine! Think of the hundreds of thousands of lives that will be saved when this endless 'bloody bath' comes to an end,' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday morning Kyiv time.

**Putin Proposes 'Serious Negotiations' to Address War with Ukraine**
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed 'serious negotiations' to address the 'roots' of the war with Ukraine, a proposal that was accepted by Ukrainian leaders. Putin wants to address the 'roots' of the conflict to achieve 'a solid and lasting peace'. The negotiations will take place on May 15 in Turkey. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the proposal, saying 'the world has been waiting for this for a long time (...) It doesn't make sense to continue the massacre even for a single day.' However, Zelensky emphasized that a 30-day ceasefire is necessary for any type of negotiation. 'First, a 30-day ceasefire, then everything else,' said Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president's office. The reactions to Putin's proposal have been varied, with US President Donald Trump calling it a 'potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine.' French President Emmanuel Macron was more cautious, saying it's 'a first step, but not enough.' Macron also demanded an immediate ceasefire. Putin announced that he will speak with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday to host the bilateral negotiations.

**Russia Rejects Ceasefire Proposal, Insists on Bilateral Talks**
Russia has rejected the proposal to cease fire on May 12, instead insisting on holding bilateral talks on May 15 as a precondition. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated that Vladimir Putin's statement, made the previous night, was misinterpreted by the Ukrainian government. She claimed that Putin 'clearly stated that first, we need to discuss the root causes, and then we can talk about a ceasefire.' The leaders of the 'coalition of the willing' had warned Russia of increased pressure and support for Ukraine if Putin did not agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. French President Emmanuel Macron, who initiated the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Donald Trump, stated on Twitter: 'President Zelensky has taken on the commitment to not impose any conditions. We expect a clear response from Russia. When guns are speaking, negotiations do not take place. We are not discussing the possibility of bombing the population at the same time. A ceasefire is necessary for negotiations to begin. For the sake of peace.'

**An elusive peace: Charting ceasefire attempts in Ukraine**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed a new round of ceasefire negotiations in Istanbul on May 15, but European leaders have rebuffed the proposal without an unconditional ceasefire first being enacted by Russia and Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also expressed a similar view. Despite months of prolonged negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been achieved since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 22, 2022. Several short-term agreements have been put in place, but both nations have repeatedly accused each other of violating these agreements. Russia has also breached several pacts designed to secure Ukraine after the fall of the Soviet Union, including the Budapest Memorandum and the 1997 joint Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership. Zelenskyy said, 'drone attacks were ongoing' during Putin's 'Easter truce' in April 2025, and Ukraine accused Russia of violating its own ceasefire some 734 times during the May 10, 2025, truce.

**Putin Ignores 30-Day Ceasefire, Resumes Attacks on Ukraine**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ignored the 30-day ceasefire proposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and has instead resumed attacks on Ukraine. Putin reiterated the need to 'eliminate the root causes of the conflict', which includes ending the 'nazi' and 'coupist' nature of the current Ukrainian leaders, reducing the Ukrainian army, preventing Ukraine's accession to NATO, and ending the supposed 'Russophobia' policy of Kiev against the pro-Russian population in eastern Ukraine and against their culture and traditions. Putin considers these conditions necessary to guarantee 'a lasting peace'. The Russian presidential advisor on foreign policy, Yuri Ushakov, stated that the negotiations in Istanbul will start from the point where they were interrupted in March 2022, taking into account the current situation on the ground. Ushakov also mentioned that the composition and level of the Russian delegation will be announced later. Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, stated that 'Putin has made it clear: first conversations about the root causes and then about a ceasefire'. Zelensky has warned that there will be no negotiations until a ceasefire is declared on land, sea, and air. The head of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, Andriy Yermak, reiterated that 'first a 30-day ceasefire and then everything else'. Putin proposed that Kiev resume direct negotiations without preconditions, stating that 'it makes sense to eliminate the deep causes of the conflict and move towards the restoration of a lasting and long-term peace from a historical perspective'. He also mentioned that a real ceasefire, respected by both Russia and Ukraine, would be the first step towards a sustainable peace.

Macron emphasized that 'there can be no negotiations while arms are speaking': 'There can be no dialogue if, at the same time, civilians are being bombed.

Zelensky also mentioned that Ukraine's delegation will meet with British, French, and American representatives in London on April 23 to push for a unconditional ceasefire and a genuine and lasting peace. The ceasefire agreement during the Easter holiday seemed to have no practical effect, with both sides accusing each other of violating the agreement.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed bilateral talks with Kyiv for the first time in years, saying Moscow is open to any peace initiatives. However, he criticized Ukraine's initial reaction, calling it a 'game with fates, with people's lives.'

Zelenskiy confirmed that Ukraine is sending a delegation to London to meet with the US and other Western countries on Wednesday. Putin's proposal comes as he faces pressure from Washington to show a willingness to make peace in Ukraine. US President Donald Trump has expressed optimism about a potential deal, saying 'hopefully' the two sides will make a deal 'this week.'

Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed bilateral talks with Ukraine to halt attacks on civilian targets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has expressed readiness for discussions, emphasizing Kyiv's commitment to striking only in defense. The talks, set to take place in London following a Paris meet, aim to establish an unconditional ceasefire as a first step towards lasting peace.

According to Putin, 'Moscow is open to peace talks,' while Zelenskiy has reiterated Ukraine's commitment to finding a peaceful solution. The Easter truce declared by Moscow has been marred by mutual accusations of violations, casting a shadow over its impact.

The United States, Russia, and Ukraine have agreed to a 'technical ceasefire' following bilateral technical-level talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The agreement includes measures to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes. The US will also help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems. Additionally, the US and Russia agreed to develop measures for implementing a 30-day ban on strikes against energy facilities in Russia and Ukraine, starting on March 18, 2025. The US reiterated President Trump's imperative that the killing on both sides of the conflict must stop, and will continue facilitating negotiations between both sides to achieve a peaceful resolution.

**US and Ukraine Agree on 30-Day Ceasefire, Putting Pressure on Russia**
The US and Ukraine have agreed on a 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended if Russia agrees. The ceasefire will come into effect immediately if Russia approves it. The US will also resume its military aid to Ukraine and restart its intelligence cooperation. This move strengthens Ukraine's position in potential negotiations. The sudden breakthrough in the bilateral talks is a surprise, as both sides had initially set modest goals. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has taken a bold step by proposing a partial ceasefire, which initially focused on halting aerial and naval attacks. This had been discussed in 2024, as both sides saw it as a cost-effective measure. To put pressure on Russia, Ukraine launched a record 337 unmanned aerial vehicles against Russia on Tuesday morning, disrupting an important oil pipeline to Europe. The ceasefire was later expanded to include ground fighting, and the exchange of prisoners and the return of Ukrainian children from Russia were also agreed upon. This move has helped Ukraine to overcome Trump's criticism that they are the main obstacle to ending the war. Now, Putin is under pressure to show that his peace efforts are more than just propaganda. The success of the Jidda agreement depends on whether it marks the first step towards peace or hardens the fronts between East and West. Russia has responded with new drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. However, the Russian position is not the only uncertainty. The agreement raises numerous open questions, including the monitoring of the ceasefire, territorial concessions, and the future security architecture for Ukraine and Europe. The US role in defining its role in the conflict is crucial. The lack of security guarantees in the Ukrainian-US agreement is a concern, and the planned signing of a raw materials agreement is not a substitute. The European proposal to send a 'peacekeeping force' seems vague, and Moscow has rejected it. Additionally, a pure freezing of the conflict at the current front line does not guarantee peace, as Ukraine may accept certain territorial losses, but Russia's maximal demands go beyond the 'realities on the battlefield.' Putin's goal is to reverse the entire NATO expansion since the end of the Cold War, which means that the US government will have to consider how to counter the Kremlin's ambitions.

**Russia Open to Ceasefire Talks with Ukraine, But Only with Progress on Final Peace Agreement**
According to Bloomberg, a Moscow source revealed that Russia is open to discussing a temporary ceasefire with Ukraine, but only if progress is made on a final peace agreement. The source stated that all parties must have a clear understanding of the framework principles of the final peace agreement in order to reach a consensus on the ceasefire. Russia has insisted on determining the specifics of the final peacekeeping mission, including which countries will participate. This proposal was reportedly made to the US during a meeting in Saudi Arabia last month. Bloomberg described this as the first positive signal from Russian President Putin in response to US President Trump's call for a ceasefire. Kremlin spokesperson Peskov refused to comment on the matter. The US and Russian delegations met in Riyadh on February 18, and the US State Department announced that they had reached four points of agreement on resolving 'delicate issues' and ending the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The two sides held their first round of talks on improving bilateral relations at the US consulate in Istanbul on February 27, lasting over 6 hours to address difficulties in normalizing diplomatic relations. Putin stated that the initial contact with the new US government has brought 'certain hope', but warned that some Western elites are trying to sabotage the US-Russia dialogue.
