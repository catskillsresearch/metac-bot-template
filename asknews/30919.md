**Módolo: '2025 will be a very difficult year for economic activity'**
Economist Cristian Módolo has stated that 2025 will be a 'very difficult year for economic activity' due to the government's need to pay the cost of controlling inflation. Módolo presented a new report on the national and regional economy, analyzing the impact of recent changes in the exchange rate regime and the consequences of the macroeconomic course on the provincial productive fabric. He described the recent opening of imports for used machinery as a 'nuclear bomb' for much of the industry in Santa Fe and Córdoba. Módolo noted that the national government decided to 'urgently' turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) when it ran out of reserves and had to use dollars backing deposits to pay for imports. 'They sold it as the exit from the currency board, but in reality, that opening was partial because it only applies to physical persons, the 97% of whom do not have income to buy dollars,' he said. In fact, the change made a few weeks ago was 'a devaluation, new debt, and more adjustment.' The modification had an immediate and direct impact on prices, with inflation jumping to 3.7% in March and expected to remain at least at that level in April. The government's narrative of disinflation maintained through exchange rate delay and carry trade is beginning to weaken. 'Prices skyrocketed and the government will try to make the economy the anchor, from now until the end of the year, the real economy will pay the cost of sustaining the new plan to reach the elections without the inflation getting out of control, there will be more chainsaw and more blender,' Módolo said. The large urban agglomerations will continue to be the most affected by the economic scheme. 'The government makes a narrative about the decline in poverty, but when one looks at the evolution since 2017, sees that in Rosario the index passed from 20% to 32% in recent years,' described the economist. Furthermore, in the context of the deepening of the fiscal adjustment, 'the government began to touch in 2025 programs that it had tried to maintain last year, such as the Food Card.' Paradoxically, while workers fall into poverty, they become large contributors as soon as they emerge. 'Today the difference between the salaried worker who pays Income Tax and the one who does not cover the basic basket is $300,' explained Módolo, who emphasized that, due to the slowdown in activity, today the national and, through coparticipation, provincial revenue is sustained by the income tax on the fourth category. Módolo also stated that the current economic scheme presents its greatest weakness in the financial exchange sector; the lessons that President Milei wanted to avoid from Macri's experience led him to commit errors in the design of the exchange rate policy, which threatened the survival of the model.

**Argentina's Economy Expected to Grow, but with Higher Inflation and Strong Dollar**
According to a report by FocusEconomics, Argentina's economy is expected to grow, but with higher inflation and a strong dollar. The report projects an inflation rate of 44% in 2025 and 96% in 2026. The economy has grown at an average rate of over 6% in the first two months of 2025, with key sectors such as mining, manufacturing, retail trade, and financial services leading the growth. The report also notes that the inflation rate has decreased to 47.3% in April, the lowest level since April 2021. FocusEconomics' panelists predict that prices will increase by 43.9% on average in 2025 and 24.8% in 2026. They also project that the monetary policy rate will be 26.93% by the end of 2025 and 18.56% by the end of 2026. The consensus estimates that the peso will close 2025 at $1329.6 per dollar and 2026 at $1559.6. In the medium term, the macroeconomic fundamentals show a favorable evolution. Between 2024 and 2026, a fiscal surplus is projected at an average of 0.2% of GDP, a reduction in public debt to 77.6% of GDP, and an average annual inflation rate of 96.2%, which shows a clear downward trend.

**Argentina's Population Aging and the Transformation of Family Structures**
A report by the Universidad Austral warns of a profound transformation in the structure of Argentine households. The country's aging population is also undergoing a structural change. The aging index has doubled in three decades, from 29 in 1991 to 60.55 in 2025. Meanwhile, the percentage of people over 85 years old has doubled in 20 years, with a marked feminization of the phenomenon: there are 228 women for every 100 men in this age group. CABA, Santa Fe, and La Pampa are the most aged jurisdictions in the country. Another expanding phenomenon is the growth of single-person households. 'In 1991, only 13% of households were single-person households. Today they represent 25%', highlights the study. Poverty is also taking on a new face. 'Poverty in Argentina has a child's face', states the report. In 2024, 60% of the country's poor are under 30 years old. 52% of children under 14 are poor, and nearly 12% are in a state of indigence. Although levels have improved compared to 2020, indicators are still below those recorded in 2016. The researchers emphasize the need to urgently review public policies. 'The social changes that affect family structures are not anecdotal: they are signals that appeal to the State, society, and companies. Rethinking family policies that integrate aspects of population, education, housing, health, care, and employment based on this new reality is urgent', conclude the authors of the report.

**Argentina's Economic Projections: Inflation and GDP Growth**
A recent report by FocusEconomics, which surveyed almost 50 banks and consultancies, predicts that Argentina's inflation will reach 30.1% in 2025, up 1 point from the previous estimate, and the dollar will reach $1330 by the end of the year, also higher than the previous estimate. The report also forecasts that the country's GDP will grow 4.9% in 2025, up 0.1 points from the previous month, and 3.5% in 2026. The economic activity maintained its positive trend in February, with a 5.7% year-over-year increase, driven by mining, manufacturing, finance, and commerce, although the agricultural sector showed weakness. The report also noted that the production industrial continued to be in positive territory, with a 5.2% year-over-year increase in March, although lower than the 5.6% of February, due to declines in machinery, chemicals, food, and autos. The report also mentioned that the external sector, exports fell 2.5% year-over-year in March, mainly due to lower sales of agricultural products and fuels, while imports grew 38.7% driven by the real appreciation of the peso and the elimination of restrictions. The trade balance was superavitary in $300 million, although much lower than the $2200 million of March 2024. The superavit accumulated in 12 months also decreased to $15,300 million. For 2025, the consensus of FocusEconomics expects an increase of 3.4% in exports and 17% in imports, with a projected trade surplus of $11,000 million, which would decrease to $10,600 million in 2026. The report emphasized that the inflation, on the other hand, fell in April to 47.3% year-over-year, down from 55.9% in March, its lowest level since April 2021. The report also mentioned that the Central Bank reduced the reference rate from 32% to 29% in January, accumulating a decrease of 104 points since the end of 2023. The consensus expects new cuts as inflation continues to fall, with a projected rate of 26.93% by the end of 2025 and 18.56% for 2026. In the foreign exchange market, since mid-April, the BCRA has left behind the 'crawling peg' and allows the peso to float between $1000 and $1400 per dollar. By May 16, the official was at $1143.2 and the parallel at $1165, both with a monthly appreciation.

**Milei: Argentina is an 'Excellent Opportunity to Buy' Due to its Low Prices**
President Javier Milei closed the seventh edition of the AmCham Summit 2025 in Buenos Aires, where he presented his administration's achievements and criticized 'populist governments'. He emphasized the importance of investing in Argentina, stating, 'It's a marvelous case of growth and it's the opportunity to take advantage of it because in these conditions, in 30 years, Argentina could become one of the world's first powers, where two-thirds of that improvement occurs in the first 10 years. Therefore, it's an excellent opportunity to buy because Argentina is very cheap and Argentina is going to rise like a diver.' Milei also defended his economic policies, including the reduction of public spending by over 30% without increasing taxes, and the elimination of 19 taxes. He claimed that his government's fiscal adjustment did not hinder economic growth, citing a 6% growth rate and the reduction of poverty by over 10 million people. Additionally, he highlighted the importance of the Ministry of Human Capital, which he defined as key to promoting economic growth through improvements in nutrition, health, education, and labor reintegration. He also defended the policy of deregulation, stating, 'We have had a Ministry of Desregulation since mid-last year. We could call it the Ministry of Growing Returns, the ministry that simplifies people's lives, the ministry that boosts growth.' Finally, he reaffirmed his ideological vision, stating, 'Our agenda is to be the freest country in the world. Free countries are 12 times richer than repressed ones, have 50 times fewer extreme poor, and grow twice as fast.'

**Argentina's Economy: Forecasts Revised Upwards Following IMF Agreement**
Following the new agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the removal of the currency control, various consultancies and banks have revised their forecasts for the official dollar, inflation, and GDP upwards. According to the LatinFocus Consensus Forecast, the GDP is expected to grow by 4.8% this year, and 3.5% in 2026. The inflation projection for the end of 2025 is 29.1% (2.5 points higher than the previous estimate), and 18.8% for 2026. The dollar official major is expected to reach $1306 by the end of 2025 (a 14.3% increase from yesterday's close), while the blue is expected to be at $1437. For 2026, the expected prices are $1510 and $1572, respectively. The experts predict that the peso will depreciate to $1306.4 per dollar by the end of 2025 and $1509.8 by the end of 2026. 'The growth of the GDP for 2025 should be more than double the Latin American average, driven by the financial support from the IMF, lower price pressure, and lower interest rates, and less government intervention in the economy,' explained. 'However, it is likely that the dry climate will limit agricultural production,' they added. 'The inflation will continue to decrease in the future thanks to a high base of comparison, fiscal moderation, deregulation, and reduced import restrictions. However, the dry climate and peso depreciation will exert upward pressure,' warned.

**Argentina's Economic Recovery Halted by Salary Anchor**
The economic recovery in Argentina is expected to grow between 4 and 5% this year, but the consumption will continue to be uneven. The massive consumption will remain behind and with little chance of full recovery due to the salary anchor imposed by the government. According to the INDEC, the private sector's salary index in March showed a 2.2% monthly increase, but this was lower than the 3.7% inflation rate. As a result, the real income decreased by 1.5% in the third month. 'The salary income of the first months of the year was meager, given the slowdown in the disinflation process and a more rigid salary policy,' says the Fundación Capital (FC). The FC estimates that the purchasing power would have decreased by 0.4% in real terms in April. In the first quarter, the private sector's registered salary would have decreased by 1.9% in real terms, contrary to the recovery that was taking place in the second half of last year. These numbers put a brake on the massive consumption recovery. In April, Scentia, which measures the evolution of sales in supermarkets and wholesalers, detected a slight improvement after several months of decline. The month's reading showed a 0.1% increase compared to the previous year, which 'is a significant change after many months,' said the consultant. This measurement ended with a 13.9% decline in 2024 and in 2025 it accumulates a 6.5% decline. The government's decision to limit the salary negotiations to prevent them from pressuring inflation has led to the announcement that they will not homologate the commercial agreement. Commerce had closed the salary negotiations with increases of 1.9% in April, 1.8% in May, and 1.7% in June. 'After the decrease in the purchasing power of the period January-April (-1.9% real estimated), the fifth month of the year with some reopenings in the salary negotiations could show a neutral to slightly positive result, in a framework where the IPC would return to the 2-2.5% range,' says the FC. 'Looking ahead, with the authorities reinforcing the salary anchor, the path of recovery of the purchasing power looks limited. Thus, the real salary will transit in 2025 at a limited level, without exceeding that of late 2024,' they add. The estimate is that the purchasing power of the private sector registered will continue 20 points below the 2017 average and 35 points in the public sector. If the calm exchange rate and disinflation persist, 'the private consumption would verify a progressive improvement in the second half of 2025, driven by greater certainty, the stimulus of credit and 'disciplined' prices of some durable and semi-durable goods (reduction of tariffs, reduction of restrictions on imports).' By the end of the year, consumption will be slightly below the level of the first half of 2023 (-1.2% in deseasonalized terms) and 3.7% below the maximum level reached at the end of 2017. In this scenario of moderate rebound, consumption will continue to move at two speeds. Durable goods will have a better dynamic, driven by credit and a greater recovery of income from the high-income quintiles. On the other hand, massive consumption will show a more modest evolution, with meager salaries and lower available income after paying services.

**Four out of Ten Argentinians Lack Savings Capacity**
According to the 'Monitor de Humor Social 2024', 64% of Argentinians attribute their negative mood to the country's economic crisis and its impact on their personal finances. The inflation rate in January 2025 was 84.6%, as reported by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos (INDEC). The survey also found that 40% of respondents perceived their financial situation as bad or very bad, with emotions dominated by fatigue (40%) and concern (42%). However, 69% of respondents expressed optimism that things will improve in 2025, up from 59% in 2023. Only 20% of respondents expressed concern about the inflation rate in 2025, down from 44% in the previous survey. According to Quiddity, a private consulting firm, 'when there is even a hint that inflation is not under control, expectations about the future fall again.' The survey found that 3 out of 10 Argentinians spend more than they earn, and 4 out of 10 have no savings capacity. Only 28% of respondents said they can save money, compared to 56% in countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. For 2025, respondents aim to stop having to cut expenses to make ends meet, but this goal can only be achieved with controlled inflation and salaries that match market prices.

**Argentina's Poverty Rate Drops Dramatically in Second Half of 2024**
Argentina's poverty rate has decreased dramatically in the second half of 2024, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC). The poverty rate fell to 38.1% in the second half of 2024, down from 52.9% in the first half of the year. This represents a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty, with over 8 million people escaping poverty, and 4.6 million no longer living in extreme poverty. President Javier Milei celebrated the news, saying 'The poverty fell very strongly. The decrease in inflation, the growth of economic activity, and the policies promoted by the Ministry of Human Capital have taken more than 8 million people out of poverty.' The decrease in poverty is seen as a boost for Milei ahead of the upcoming legislative elections. However, some experts warn that the economy needs to experience a further slowdown in price growth and a recovery in purchasing power to sustain the decline in poverty rates. Additionally, the government is concerned about avoiding a dollar flight, with the Central Bank of Argentina selling over $1.15 billion in March to maintain the stability of the US dollar.

Argentina's poverty rate has dropped to 38.1% in the second half of 2024, a decrease of 14.8 percentage points from the first half of the year, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (Indec). The poverty rate in urban areas has also decreased, from 52.9% in the first half of 2024 to 38.1% in the second half. The employment rate has reached a record high, with 13.596 million people employed, and the real salary growth has exceeded 3% compared to the levels before Javier Milei's government. The decrease in poverty is attributed to the economic recovery, job creation, and real salary growth. The inflation rate has also decreased, from 12.8% in 2023 to 2.7% in the last available data. The economy has shown a 'V-shaped' recovery, with a 0.6% growth in January and 0.8% in December, according to JP Morgan. The bank maintains its growth forecast of 5.5% for 2025, but warns of 'upside risks'. The external balance has also improved, with a surplus of $1,000 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and a total surplus of $6,300 million for the year.

**Argentina's Poverty Rate Drops to 38.1% in Second Half of 2024**
Argentina's poverty rate has decreased to 38.1% in the second half of 2024, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC). This is a significant drop from the 52.9% recorded in the first half of the year, a reduction of almost 15 points in just six months. The decrease in poverty is attributed to the government's efforts to control inflation, recover the purchasing power of salaries, and reinforce social programs. The INDEC report also shows a decrease in the poverty rate compared to the 41.7% recorded at the end of 2023. Economists had previously projected a poverty rate of around 38-39% for the end of the year. The government's economic policy, which includes a balanced budget, monetary order, and reduction of unproductive spending, has helped to contain inflation and start a recovery process. The reduction of poverty is a positive sign in a context where the government had to implement a severe adjustment to avoid a more severe crisis. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, such as consolidating this improvement in a framework of economic growth and employment recovery.

**Poverty in Argentina Decreases to 38.1% at End of 2024**
According to the Indec, poverty in Argentina decreased to 38.1% at the end of 2024, down from 52.9% in the first half of the year. This decline is attributed to the deceleration of inflation and the recovery of the economy, salaries, and social programs such as the Asignación Universal por Hijo (AUH) and Tarjeta Alimentar. The indigence rate, which measures the portion of the population unable to afford basic food expenses, decreased to 8.2% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Leopoldo Tornarolli, an economist at the Centro de Estudios Distributivos, Laborales y Sociales (Cedlas), stated, 'It is expected that the poverty rate will be below 40% for the second semester, below the 41.7% recorded at the end of 2023.' The Observatorio de la Deuda Social Argentina (ODSA) estimated a poverty rate of 38-39% for 2024, while the nowcast of the Universidad Torcuato Di Tella estimated a rate of 36.8% for the second half of the year.

**Argentina's Poverty Rate Drops to 37% in Second Half of 2024, According to Experts**
According to experts, the poverty index could have closed last year at 37%. Indigence is expected to range between 8% and 10%, a significant decrease from 18.1% in the first half of 2024 and 11.9% in the second half of 2023. This reflects two distinct periods in the year. In the first months of 2024, poverty and indigence skyrocketed due to the strong devaluation of the peso in December 2023, inflation, economic activity decline, job reduction, and salary and social program adjustments. In contrast, the second half of the year saw an improvement driven by inflation deceleration, partial economic activity recovery, and increased household income, although with differences by sector. A key factor was the increase in government assistance, particularly through the Universal Child Allowance (AUH) and the Food Card, which were fundamental in reducing indigence, a policy maintained by the previous government. In the City, poverty and indigence rates in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA) had a strong decline in the last quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, according to the Institute of Statistics and Census of the City (Idecba) based on data from the Quarterly Survey of Occupation and Income (ETOI). The survey found that 24.2% of the 3,086,000 people living in the city are poor, a significant decrease from the 30.2% poverty rate at the end of 2023. The number of poor people decreased from 928,000 to 746,000, a decrease of 182,000. The indigence rate, which is the percentage of people who not only cannot cover their income with the Total Basic Basket (CBT), but also the Food Basic Basket (CBA), decreased from 12.2% to 6.5%, meaning that the number of indigents decreased from 376,500 to 200,590, resulting in 176,000 people leaving indigence. President Milei stated that 'poverty decreased from 56% to 33% according to the latest quarterly data. That translates to 10 million people who left the poverty line.' He argued that this decrease was driven by the decrease in inflation, sustained real wage and pension increases, and the increase in AUH in real terms and the Food Plan.' The University of Di Tella estimates that the poverty rate in Argentina would have been below 37% in the second half of last year. If confirmed, this would be a significant decrease from the 52.9% measured in the first half of 2024. This would be the lowest level since the first half of 2022 (36.5%).

**Argentina's Poverty Rate Expected to Decrease in Second Half of 2024**
According to private consultants, the poverty rate in Argentina is expected to decrease in the second half of 2024, driven by the deceleration of inflation, a slight recovery of economic activity, and an increase in household income. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos (INDEC) will release the official data on poverty and indigence for the second half of 2024 on Monday. Experts project that the poverty rate will be around 37%, down from 52.9% in the first half of 2024. The indigence rate is expected to be between 8% and 10%, a significant decrease from 18.1% in the first half of 2024. A University of Di Tella study suggests that the poverty rate may be even lower, at around 35%. In Buenos Aires, the poverty rate decreased from 30.2% in 2023 to 24.2% in the last three months of 2024, with 182,000 citizens moving from poverty to the middle class. The indigence rate in Buenos Aires also decreased from 12.2% to 6.5%.

**Argentina's Poverty Rate Expected to Drop to 37% in Second Half of 2024**
According to projections, the poverty indices have decreased compared to the first half of last year, marked by devaluation and recession. The National Institute of Statistics and Census (Indec) will release the poverty index for the second half of 2024 on Monday, which could have dropped to 37% due to the decline in inflation. In contrast, indigence is expected to range between 8% and 10%, a significant decrease from the 18.1% in the first half of 2024 and 11.9% in the second half of 2023. According to previous estimates, the data would reflect two distinct periods in the year. In the first months of 2024, poverty and indigence skyrocketed due to the strong devaluation of the peso in December 2023, the increase in inflation, the decline in economic activity, the reduction in employment, and the adjustment in salaries and social programs. In the second half of 2024, there was an improvement driven by the deceleration of inflation, a slight and partial recovery in economic activity, and an increase in household income, although with differences according to sectors. A key factor was the increase in government assistance, particularly through the Universal Child Allowance (AUH) and the Food Card, which were fundamental in reducing indigence, a policy maintained by the previous government. According to the University of Di Tella, the poverty rate in Argentina would have been below 37% in the second half of last year. This would be a significant decrease from the 52.9% measured in the first half of 2024. It would be the lowest level since the first half of 2022 (36.5%). As President Javier Milei mentioned in his speech for the opening of ordinary sessions, 'The poverty rate decreased from 56% to 33% according to the last quarterly data. This translates to 10 million people who have left the poverty line.' He added, 'This decline was driven by the decrease in inflation, the sustained increase in real wages and pensions, and the increase in AUH in real terms and the Food Plan.' 'In short, adjusting to policy is not only not recessionary, it is expansive. And it eliminates poverty,' he concluded, and exclaimed, 'Do you want to end poverty? End the bureaucratic work of politics.'

**Argentina's Poverty and Indigence Rates Expected to Show Signs of Improvement**
The National Institute of Statistics and Census (Indec) is set to release new data on poverty and indigence in Argentina for the second half of 2024. Experts, including Agustín Salvia from the University of Catholic Argentina, project that the numbers will show signs of improvement. 'This trend indicates a partial recovery, reducing the numbers compared to the depressed levels of 2023', Salvia said. The estimated poverty rate is between 36% and 39%, and the indigence rate could drop to between 9% and 10%, compared to the 12-13% of the previous year. However, analysts warn against excessive optimism, as the comparison between the third quarter of 2023 and 2024 does not show significant differences. The inflation and stability in the macroeconomic context are contributing to the more optimistic numbers, but employment and real purchasing power remain stagnant, posing a continuous challenge to social well-being.

**Argentina's Poverty Rate Estimated to Decrease in 2024**
Experts estimate that the poverty rate in Argentina at the end of 2024 will be between 37% and 40%, lower than the 41.7% recorded in 2023. This would mean that the first year of President Javier Milei's government, marked by a relaxation of controls, a price adjustment, and a significant reduction in public spending, has ended with a lower poverty rate than that left by Alberto Fernández and Cristina Kirchner. According to five sources consulted by LA NACION, the number of poor people could have decreased by around 9.5 million, from 26 million to 16.5 million. However, experts caution against making direct comparisons between trimesters, as the data can be distorted by the inclusion of Aguinaldos (extra income) in odd-numbered trimesters. The Government claims that Milei has reduced poverty, but experts are more cautious, pointing out that the employment situation and real wages have not improved significantly. 'It is 99% sure that the poverty rate will be lower than that left by Alberto Fernández and Cristina Kirchner,' said Martín González Rozada, director of the Maestría en Econometría at the Universidad Di Tella. 'The second semester of 2024 could show the greatest decline in the series that started in 2016,' added González Rozada, who estimates a poverty rate of 35% in the fourth quarter and 37% in the second semester.

**Poverty in Argentina: Milei's Estimate vs. Experts' Projections**
President Javier Milei estimated that poverty has fallen to 36%, due to the 'strong economic recovery', but experts disagree on the social scenario. Milei stated, 'We received a poverty rate of 57% monthly, and today it would be 36%, that is, we lowered poverty by 21 percentage points.' However, according to the latest consolidated data from the INDEC, in the third quarter of 2024, poverty was 40.1% and indigence was 9.7%. Projections indicate that there are over 17 million poor people, of which 4.1 million are indigent. The City of Buenos Aires is the district with the lowest poverty rate in Argentina, at 15.3%. The loss of nearly 185,000 jobs in 2024 would be a key factor in explaining the social deterioration, according to the Observatorio de la Deuda Social Argentina de la UCA. Leopoldo Tornarolli, from the Centro de Estudios Distributivos Laborales y Sociales, estimated that the measurement at the end of 2024, which will be released in March, will place poverty around 41%, similar to the second half of 2023. According to the department of Econometría of the Universidad Torcuato Di Tella, in the last semester of 2024, poverty was 36.7% when the official report of the INDEC indicated that during the first semester it reached 52.9%. For the consultant LCG, the poverty level was 38.4% in the third quarter of 2024. Similarly, the Observatorio de la Deuda Social de la UCA defined the poverty level for the third quarter of 2024 as 38.3%, with a decrease of 0.3 points compared to the same quarter of 2023 and 16.5 points compared to the peak of 54.8% in the first quarter of 2024.
