**Drought declared in the UK after driest spring for nearly 100 years as water levels in rivers and reservoirs run low | Daily Mail Online**
The north west of England has been declared in drought due to low water levels in reservoirs and rivers following one of the driest springs on record. The Environment Agency (EA) said that despite recent rain, water levels remain low, and no other areas of the country are in drought. A spokesman for the EA said, 'The north west of England has entered drought status due to low water levels in reservoirs and rivers. No other areas in England are in drought and we continue to monitor the situation closely.' Experts warn that the drought conditions will become more intense in the UK with climate change, putting strain on water resources. Dr Jess Neumann, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, said, 'The 2025 drought is serious – reservoir levels are well below what they should be at this time of year. Water is becoming a scarce resource and the UK supply is under significant stress.' The Government has announced plans to fast-track the approval of major new reservoirs to address the issue. However, officials admit that new reservoirs will not come online for a decade or more, and that drinking water supplies will run out in the next decade without action to boost water infrastructure.

**Drought declared in the UK after driest spring for nearly 100 years**
The Environment Agency (EA) has declared a drought in the north west of England due to low water levels in reservoirs and rivers following one of the driest springs on record. The agency said that Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire, and Cumbria and Lancashire have moved from 'prolonged dry weather' to 'drought' status. Despite recent rain, water levels in the region remain low, and the EA is regulating the region's water company, United Utilities, to operate within their agreed action plan to make use of available water while protecting the environment. Experts warned that drought conditions would become more intense in the UK with climate change, putting strain on water resources. Dr Jess Neumann, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, said that the North West had seen the driest spring in nearly 100 years, leading to low water levels in reservoirs and rivers. 'The north west of the country is reliant on reservoirs to source around two-thirds of its water supply. The 2025 drought is serious - reservoir levels are well below what they should be at this time of year. Water is becoming a scarce resource and the UK supply is under significant stress,' she said.

**Government fast-tracks new reservoirs to secure water supply**
The UK government has announced plans to fast-track the construction of two new reservoirs, the Fens Reservoir in Cambridgeshire and the Lincolnshire Reservoir, to secure the country's water supply. According to Water Minister Emma Hardy, this change will 'slash red tape to make the planning process faster' and 'secure our water supply for future generations'. The reservoirs, which are expected to be completed in 2036 and 2040, will provide more resilience to future droughts in a dry and water-scarce region. Dr Glenn Watts, water science director at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, said that reservoirs can help protect against drought impacts by collecting excess rainfall during wet periods. With climate change expected to bring hotter, drier summers, the chances of drought could increase in the decades ahead. The government and water companies have proposed building nine new reservoirs by 2050, which could provide an additional 670 million litres of water per day. 'They would provide more resilience to future droughts in a part of the country that is already dry and where there is high demand for water,' said Dr Watts. 'With climate change likely to bring hotter, drier summers, the chances of drought could increase in the decades ahead,' the Met Office warns.

**Government steps in to deliver new reservoirs amid water supply...**
The UK Government has stepped in to take control of the planning process for two major new reservoirs in East Anglia and Lincolnshire, designating them as 'nationally significant' to improve water resources for over three quarters of a million homes. Environment Secretary Steve Reed aims to streamline and fast-track the delivery of the two new reservoirs, the first for more than 30 years, to address rapid population growth, crumbling assets, and a warming climate that threaten to outstrip drinking water supply by the middle of the next decade. Water Minister Emma Hardy said, 'We are intervening in the national interest and slashing red tape to make the planning process faster to unblock nine new reservoirs.' The two reservoirs are expected to be completed by 2036 and 2040, respectively, and will provide up to 253 million litres of water per day for over 750,000 homes.

**Government intervenes over new reservoirs amid water supply fears**
The UK government has intervened in the planning of two major reservoir projects in East Anglia and Lincolnshire to address growing concerns over the country's water supply. Environment Secretary Steve Reed has designated the projects as 'nationally significant,' allowing central government to take control and expedite their construction. The reservoirs, which will provide water for over 750,000 homes, are expected to be completed by 2036 and 2040. Water Minister Emma Hardy said, 'We are intervening in the national interest and slashing red tape to make the planning process faster to unblock nine new reservoirs.' Without new reservoirs, population growth, aging infrastructure, and climate change could cause drinking water demand to exceed supply by the mid-2030s. Water companies across England have committed to bringing nine new reservoirs online by 2050, which will supply an additional 670 million litres of water per day.

**Plan for mega-reservoir escalated to Government level amid water supply concerns**
The UK Government has escalated plans for a mega-reservoir in the Fens to a national level, citing concerns over water supply in the East of England. Environment Secretary Steve Reed has deemed the Fens Reservoir and Lincolnshire Reservoir 'nationally significant' and taken them under the Government's wing, streamlining the planning process to speed up their development. Anglian Water considers the East of England the 'driest part of the UK, and one of the fastest growing', and has welcomed the Government's prioritization of the projects. Sian Thomas, Director of Strategic Asset Management, said, 'Our vision for the reservoirs goes beyond simply creating a new public water supply. This is a significant investment in England’s water infrastructure and a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver lasting benefits for people, place and the environment.'

**Dramatic photos show impact of low rainfall on Lake District reservoir**
Dramatic photos taken by Garry Moore have shown the impact of low rainfall on Thirlmere Reservoir in the Lake District. The reservoir, which was at 62% capacity earlier this month, has been affected by low river levels and planned maintenance. The Environment Agency (EA) has warned of a'medium' risk of drought in England this summer, citing the country's driest start to spring in 61 years. According to Richard Thompson, EA's deputy director of water, 'The changing climate means we will see more summer droughts in the coming decades.' The last two years were among the wettest on record for England, but drier conditions at the start of this year have made a drought a possibility, and the EA is urging preparedness.

**Warning issued as north west sees driest start to a year for almost a century - Manchester Evening News**
The north west of England has experienced its driest start to a year in almost a century, with reservoir levels plummeting to 69% full. The Environment Agency (EA) has warned that without sustained rainfall, England is at a 'medium' risk of drought this summer. Reservoirs in Cumbria, including Haweswater and Thirlmere, are 62% full due to low river levels and planned maintenance. The EA has urged water companies to take action to cut leaks and help customers save water. A spokesperson for Water UK said, 'Following the driest start to spring in nearly 70 years, water companies have been taking two actions: first, they are setting new records for repairing leaks; and second, they are moving water across their regions to relieve the driest areas.' Environment Agency deputy director of water, Richard Thompson, said, 'The changing climate means we will see more summer droughts in the coming decades. We need to be prepared.' United Utilities has asked people to 'use water wisely' due to lower than usual reservoir levels.

**Lake District plans to return waters to natural states**
United Utilities has submitted plans to remove infrastructure, weirs, and dams from three Lake District waters: Crummock Water, Chapelhouse Reservoir, and Overwater. The company aims to return the sites to their 'natural states' after stopping water abstraction in 2023. The proposals include removing the weir at Crummock Water, which would lower levels by approximately 1.35m (4.4ft) and help manage storm water runoff. The changes are expected to restore salmon habitats and natural flows along becks and rivers. 'It is hoped the changes would restore salmon habitats and natural flows along becks and rivers,' according to the article. The plans are a step towards preserving the natural state of the Lake District waters.

**Reservoirs reach rare milestone for first time in years — but the sudden change is raising new questions**
The region's reservoirs have reached a rare milestone, with water levels at 46% of capacity as of March 18, expected to hit 50% by the end of the month. This is the most water they've held since July 2022, more than triple the level from the same time last year. The Sau reservoir has seen the biggest increase, rising from 7% to 37%, and the Darnius-Boadella reservoir has risen from 17% to 36%. Long-term forecasts for Catalonia are hopeful, with more moisture expected throughout the spring, which could spell an end to drought restrictions. However, droughts are expected to become more common and severe due to human-caused pollution, which destabilizes weather patterns and leads to extreme weather events.

**Volga-Baltic Navigation 2025: Key Structures to Operate from April 30 to November 15**
According to Dmitry Glushakov, all navigable hydraulic structures will be operational from April 30 to November 15 for the 2025 navigation season. This includes the Nizhne-Svirsky, Verkhne-Svirsky, Shexninsky, and Vytegorsky locks. The Volkhovsky lock is expected to operate from May 5 to October 31. Glushakov notes that water levels are expected to be at multi-year average levels, with 'no serious changes in route dimensions or depths expected.' The North-Western Hydrometeorological Center predicts water levels on the main Volga-Baltic route to be close to average multi-year levels, with the following expected levels: Lake Ladoga, Lake Onega, the Svir River, and the Neva River will be at levels close to the average multi-year levels; the Vytegor, Belyusov, and Novinkin reservoirs will be at normal levels, with water levels maintained at levels close to the Normal Pool Level; the Shexninsky reservoir and the Shexna River will be at normal levels, with water levels maintained at levels close to the Normal Pool Level.
