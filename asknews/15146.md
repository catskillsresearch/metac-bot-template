**UK Defense Spending to Increase to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, 3% by 2034**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a significant increase in the country's defense spending, aiming to reach 2.5% of the country's GDP by 2027 and 3% by 2034. The plan includes the development of 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines, the production of 7,000 long-range missiles, and the creation of new drone and cyber defense units. The goal is to make the British military 'more integrated and lethal than ever' and to 'lead' in the face of increasing threats from Russia and other countries. Starmer emphasized that the increased spending is necessary to address the 'greatest threat since the Cold War', which includes war in Europe, new nuclear dangers, and daily cyber attacks. He also stated that the plan is in line with the country's social goals, as it will also lead to economic growth and a 'defense dividend' for the British people. However, critics argue that the plan is not ambitious enough and that some European countries are already aiming for 3.5% or 5% of their GDP for defense spending. Starmer also used the opportunity to criticize Nigel Farage's party, Reform UK, for its pro-Russian foreign policy, saying that there is 'no sharp difference' between them.

**As upbeat Indian economy closes gap with Japan, Germany, the real test will be at the podium**
India's economy is expected to surpass Japan's and close the gap with Germany, becoming the third-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP. According to the IMF, India's nominal GDP is projected to reach $4.19 trillion by FY26, while Germany's is expected to be $4.74 trillion. India's growth is driven by domestic consumption, services, and digitization, with a robust current account buffer and a rising trade surplus. However, challenges such as job creation, fiscal slippage, and institutional bottlenecks loom large. Experts warn that India must invest in human capital, strengthen its fiscal fundamentals, and deepen financial inclusion to truly consolidate its position in the top three. If India can achieve an 8% nominal GDP growth rate and maintain a stable rupee, its economy could cross $6.8 trillion-$7 trillion by 2030, firmly establishing it as the world's third-largest economy.

**Sensex, Nifty end lower amid renewed global trade concerns**
The Sensex and Nifty ended lower due to renewed global trade concerns, the Russian-Ukraine conflict, and a sharp jump in Brent crude oil prices. Experts noted that foreign fund outflows also dented investors' sentiment. Despite this, the Indian market has demonstrated resilience, underpinned by robust institutional inflows and selective sectoral strength. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments Limited, said, 'The domestic market continued its consolidation phase for the third consecutive week, influenced by renewed concerns over a potential tariff war and escalating geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine.' The Indian economy expanded at a faster pace than expected in the last quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal, with a 6.5 per cent growth rate in the year, and a GDP of USD 3.9 trillion. The Gross GST collections remained above the ₹2 trillion mark for the second straight month, rising 16.4 per cent in May to over ₹2.01 lakh crore.

**UK PM: We can't ignore Russian threat**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that Britain cannot ignore the threat posed by Russia, citing the conflict in Ukraine as an example. The UK will increase military spending to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. This move is part of a broader effort to deter Russia and bolster Europe's defenses. NATO chief Mark Rutte is expected to discuss a commitment to spend at least 3.5 percent of GDP on defense at an upcoming meeting. Robert Jenrick, a Conservative Party spokesman, called for the government to be more ambitious and raise spending to 3 percent of national income by 2029, stating, 'We think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation.'

**Time to be more frugal: why the economic growth is slowing down**
The Russian economy is experiencing a slowdown in industrial production and a decrease in demand from households, which may lead to a vicious cycle of declining production, reduced government revenue, and decreased consumer demand, warns economist Oleg Vyuigin, professor at the Higher School of Economics. The decline in industrial production and decrease in demand from households are a result of the high interest rate set by the Central Bank, which has reduced commercial banks' lending to the production sector. The ban on investment loans and the high cost of working capital loans have also had a negative impact on some heavily indebted companies. Additionally, the effect of the government's policy of advancing enterprises in the defense industry at the beginning of the year has weakened, and the growth of non-oil and gas revenues of the federal budget has slowed down. The economist believes that the Central Bank has the opportunity to lower the interest rate and ease financial restrictions on production activity, but this would require the government to abandon its expansionary budget policy, which has led to inflationary risks. The budget stimulus is coming to an end, and the parameters of the federal budget for 2025 indicate that there will be a period of stagnation or even a decline in economic activity. The Ministry of Finance has proposed amendments to the budget, which would increase the planned deficit to 3.8 trillion rubles. The economist concludes that the government needs to be more frugal in its budgetary desires and abandon the model of supporting the economy through increased budget spending on the defense industry, which has led to inflationary consequences.

**Britain to Invest 1.5 Billion Pounds in Munitions Production**
The British government plans to invest 1.5 billion pounds (approximately 1.8 billion euros) in the construction of at least six new factories to boost munitions production. The Ministry of Defence in London announced that the investment will be used to increase the production of ammunition and provide the military with more weapons with greater range. Defence Minister John Healey stated that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has shown that a military is only as strong as the industry behind it. The government aims to strengthen the industry to deter enemies and make the country safer and stronger. According to Healey, the UK will increase its defence spending to 2.5% of its GDP by 2027, with a further increase to 3% planned for 2029. He expects the UK to reach 3% of GDP for defence spending by 2034. Premier Minister Keir Starmer wrote in a guest article for the 'Sun' that the country is facing threats from Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and that it is essential to prepare for a conflict to prevent it. He stated, 'We are directly threatened by states with developed military forces, so we must be prepared to fight and win.'

**Russia Aims to Return to Soviet-Era Milk Consumption Levels**
Russia may return to the level of milk consumption during the Soviet era in the next decade, according to Yakub Zakriev, general director of Health & Nutrition. Zakriev stated, 'In 2024, milk consumption per capita in Russia reached 250 kg, the highest level in almost 30 years. If we maintain the current growth rate of 3-5% per year, we can return to Soviet levels in 8-14 years.' Zakriev noted that in the late 1980s, the average annual milk consumption in the USSR was around 390 kg. He also mentioned that the current global average milk consumption is around 116-118 kg per capita per year, and Russia's consumption is more than double that. Zakriev emphasized that further growth will depend on a balanced pricing policy, expansion of product assortment, and government support for agricultural businesses. According to the Russian Ministry of Agriculture, Russia's raw milk production may reach 39 million tons by 2030, creating a basis for increased domestic consumption and export to new markets.

**Russia's Financial Safety Net Shrinks by 75% in Less Than Three Years**
The Russian economy is deteriorating due to the ongoing war against Ukraine and Western sanctions. The National Welfare Fund (NWF), a key financial instrument for supporting the Russian budget, has shrunk almost fourfold since the start of the full-scale invasion. According to official data, the liquid part of the NWF was $145 billion at the beginning of July 2022, $78 billion a year later in July 2023, and only $39 billion as of May 1, 2025, resulting in a loss of around 75% of the financial cushion in less than three years. The main source of funding for the fund remains oil exports, but it is also under significant pressure. Due to sanctions, Russia has lost access to many traditional markets and new ones are more expensive and less efficient. The situation is complicated by the forecasted low price of Brent crude oil at $64 in 2025 and $60 in 2026. This creates critical risks for the budget, which is oriented towards oil and gas revenues. Already, problems are being felt in key sectors. For example, the state corporation 'Rosatom' projects for 2025 are underfunded by 80%, 'Russian Railways' is experiencing a decline in cargo volumes, and the metal, construction, and resource extraction industries are showing a decrease in production. Most corporations have stopped paying dividends, indicating a deep crisis. Despite this, Moscow is trying to maintain the appearance of stability, but real economic indicators suggest the opposite. If current sanctions and increased control over their circumvention are maintained, Russia may lose the remaining NWF by 2026. As a reminder, despite the Kremlin's confident statements about economic stability, the situation inside the country is rapidly deteriorating. The Russian economy is, in fact, becoming increasingly unstable due to military spending, international sanctions, and questionable state statistics. Experts from the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics (SITE) have prepared a document highlighting that the current financial model of Russia is maintained only by short-term injections into the military-industrial complex, but such support does not have a long-term perspective. 'It was a great day,' said no one, as the Russian economy continues to deteriorate.
