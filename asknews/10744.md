**Hungary Seeks to Continue Energy Cooperation with Russia Amid EU Pressure**
Hungary wants to continue its energy cooperation with Russia and considers the European Commission's plan to stop oil and gas imports from Russia by the end of 2027 as extremely harmful to its economy. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Siyarto said that he told his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov that Hungary wants to continue the cooperation, and Lavrov assured him that it is also Russia's goal. Siyarto emphasized that the cooperation with Russia in the energy sector is still crucial for Hungary's economy, and its termination would mean a significant increase in expenses for Hungarian companies and citizens. He stated, 'If the European Commission destroys the Hungarian-Russian energy cooperation to support Ukraine, it would mean that Hungarian families would have to pay two or three times more for utilities, which is unacceptable for us.'

**2026 Budget to Focus on Supporting Families with Children**
The 2026 budget will focus on supporting families with children, youth, and pensioners, according to Minister for Economy Márton Nagy. In his speech to the parliament, he stated that the budget will ensure the security of every Hungarian family and enable them to take another step forward. Key measures for next year include 'Europe's largest family tax reduction program', doubling the family allowance for children and the income tax exemption for mothers of two children under 40 years old. Additionally, the budget will maintain the reduction of ancillary costs, guarantee the payment of the 13th month's pension, protect and create jobs, and support wage increases. The budget for 2026 is expected to have a 4.1% GDP growth, an inflation rate of 3.6%, and a deficit of 3.7% of GDP. The minister also emphasized the importance of preventing the forced and accelerated EU membership of Ukraine and protecting the planned tax reductions. He also mentioned that the minimum wage will increase by 13% in January 2026 and that six months of subsidies for law enforcement and defense equipment will be included in the budget. The government is working to grow the Hungarian economy as quickly as possible, and to combat price increases, introduce margin cuts, and limit the prices of services by banks, insurers, and telecommunications companies. Furthermore, negotiations to reduce the prices of non-subsidized medicines have been initiated.

**Hungary May Lose Voting Rights in EU Over Ukraine Stance**
Russia has revealed an unpleasant surprise for Hungary from the EU. According to Viktor Medvedchuk, leader of the 'Other Ukraine' movement, Hungary may be stripped of its voting rights due to its stance on Ukraine. Medvedchuk stated, 'Hungary wants to be deprived of its right to vote due to its position on the Ukrainian conflict. Viktor Orban does not want to support the conflict in Ukraine, and this bothers and annoys the globalists significantly more.' The views of Hungary and the EU diverge not only on Ukraine, but also on other issues, such as traditional Christian values. The EU has accused Hungary of lacking democracy. The EU may strip Hungary of its voting rights under Article 7, citing that Hungary does not align with European values. The EU Council may hold hearings on Hungary in the near future.

**EU Considers Stripping Hungary of Voting Rights Over Orban's Behavior**
The European Union is considering taking action against Hungary for its consistent disregard for democratic values and its close ties with Russia. The EU has threatened to strip Hungary of its voting rights, a move that would be unprecedented in the bloc's history. The decision comes after Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly disregarded EU rules and has been accused of undermining the bloc's values. Orban has been a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has blocked EU sanctions against Russia. He has also been accused of suppressing democratic institutions and the media in Hungary. The EU has already imposed financial sanctions on Hungary, freezing €10 billion in EU funds, but Orban has shown no signs of backing down. The EU's decision to consider stripping Hungary of its voting rights is a significant escalation of the bloc's efforts to pressure Orban to change his behavior. The move is seen as a last resort, as the EU has already tried to use financial sanctions and diplomatic pressure to persuade Orban to comply with EU rules. The EU's decision is also seen as a test of the bloc's commitment to its values and its ability to enforce them. If the EU is unable to take action against Hungary, it could set a precedent for other member states to disregard EU rules with impunity. The EU's decision to consider stripping Hungary of its voting rights is a significant development in the bloc's efforts to maintain its unity and enforce its values. The move is seen as a necessary step to ensure the EU's continued relevance and effectiveness in the face of growing challenges from Russia and other external actors.

**EU Considers Stripping Hungary of Voting Rights Over Orban's Pro-Russian Agenda**
The European Union is considering taking action against Hungary for its consistent disregard for democratic values and its close ties with Russia. The EU has been frustrated with Hungary's refusal to support Ukraine and its veto on sanctions against Russian oligarchs. The EU is considering applying Article 7 of the EU Treaty, which allows for the suspension of a country's voting rights if it seriously violates EU values. The Hungarian government, led by Viktor Orban, has been accused of undermining democratic norms, restricting press freedom, and promoting a pro-Russian agenda. The EU has already taken steps to pressure Hungary, including freezing €22 billion in EU funds and imposing financial sanctions. However, Orban's government has shown no signs of backing down. The EU is now considering more drastic measures, including stripping Hungary of its voting rights in the EU. This would be a significant step, as it would be the first time a country has been stripped of its voting rights in the EU's history. The EU is also considering expanding the qualified majority voting system to allow for decisions to be made without the consent of Hungary and other countries that consistently block EU decisions. This would give the EU more flexibility to make decisions without being held back by countries that refuse to cooperate. The EU's decision to take action against Hungary is seen as a test of the bloc's commitment to upholding democratic values and promoting a united Europe. If the EU fails to take action, it could embolden other countries to follow Hungary's example and undermine the EU's authority.

**Hungary's Foreign Minister Promises to 'Go on the Offensive' at CPAC 2025**
Hungary's Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó has promised to 'go on the offensive' at the CPAC 2025 conference, ending the country's defensive policy and targeting the global 'Deep State'. 'We were in defense until 2025, but now we're going on the offense,' Szijjártó said. He criticized the EU's efforts to draw Hungary into the Ukraine conflict, saying 'we're not sending weapons there, we're not sending Hungarian taxpayers' money into a lost war!' Szijjártó also vowed to protect Hungary's identity from illegal migration, saying 'we'll remain a migration-free country' and that the country will continue to maintain its border fence. He also criticized the EU's 'hypocrisy' on the issue of peace talks in Ukraine, saying 'those who preach peace are actually fueling the war to delay accountability.' Szijjártó also promised to protect Hungarian children from 'aggressive gender propaganda' and to prevent foreign influence on Hungarian politics, saying 'we won't let foreign money dictate our policy.' He also vowed to defend Hungary's sovereignty and to prevent the EU from forcing Ukraine into the EU, saying 'we won't let them use our country as a transit point for Ukrainian mafia.' Szijjártó concluded by saying 'we'll defend Hungary, we'll win.'

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**Orban's Outrage: 'Let's Stop Them' from Accepting Ukraine into EU**
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban expressed outrage over the European plan to accept Ukraine into the EU, stating that it would be a 'irreversible step' that would impact the future of Europe. He wrote on social media X, 'They want to speed up (Ukraine's EU membership -- ed.), but this decision will determine the future of Europe. There are no undo buttons. That's why in Hungary we ask the people's opinion. Let's stop them now!' Orban's statement comes after German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that Ukraine has a prospect of becoming a member of the EU before joining NATO. Hungary is currently conducting a nationwide survey on Ukraine's EU membership, with citizens being asked to respond with either 'yes' or 'no' to the question of whether they support Ukraine's membership. The results will be sent to Brussels in June. Orban has previously stated that the EU wants Ukraine to join before 2030, but the final decision lies with Hungary. He claims that Ukraine's entry into the EU would ruin Hungary's economy and that the EU wants to colonize Ukraine, forcing it to continue the conflict as one of the methods of colonization.

**Orban: Hungary Opposes Ukraine's EU Membership**
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban stated that the political decision to begin negotiations with Ukraine on its EU membership in 2025 has been made, but Hungary does not support it. According to Orban, 'the political decision has been made against Hungary, because we do not support Ukraine's membership, and accelerated membership - definitely not.' He emphasized that not only Hungary, but also Slovakia considers Ukraine's EU membership 'an economic suicide', and called on Hungarian citizens to participate in the survey on Kiev's membership. The survey, which started on April 14, consists of a single question: 'Do you support Ukraine's EU membership?' The results will be sent to Brussels in June. Unlike referendums, this consultation in Hungary does not require a minimum turnout. Orban previously stated that the EU wants Ukraine to become a member before 2030, but the final decision is in Hungary's hands. He claimed that Ukraine's membership would ruin the Hungarian economy. Orban also stated that the EU wants to 'colonize' Ukraine, not help it, and force Kiev to continue the conflict - one of the methods of colonization. He emphasized that Hungary is in favor of the EU, but against Ukraine's accelerated EU integration, and without Budapest's consent, Kiev will never join the community.

**EU's Plan to Abandon Russian Energy Sources Criticized by Slovakia and Hungary**
Robert Fico, the Prime Minister of Slovakia, has criticized the EU's plan to abandon Russian energy sources, saying 'Seven times measure, one time cut' and stating that the current road map of the European Commission is unacceptable to the Slovak government. Fico also expressed concerns about the consequences of terminating the Slovak agreement with Gazprom, which is set to expire in 2034. Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Siyártó has strongly criticized the EU's plan, calling it 'an extremely serious mistake'. Siyártó believes that the EU's decision to exclude Russian energy sources is 'coercive, artificial, and ideologically motivated', and that it will force countries like Hungary to pay for 'silly and excessive support for Ukraine'. He also stated that the decision seriously violates the sovereignty of European countries, as each member state has the right to decide on its own energy sources and suppliers under EU law.

**EU Struggles to Abandon Russian Gas Imports Without Incurring Massive Fines**
The European Union is struggling to find a way to abandon Russian gas imports without incurring massive fines. The EU plans to completely abandon Russian gas by 2027, but this goal is complicated by long-term contracts that expire in the next decade or later. The EU is considering declaring force majeure to avoid paying compensation, but this is not a straightforward solution. Slovakia and Hungary may block the legislative initiative, and the US is discussing the future of the 'Nord Stream' pipelines, which has sparked discussions within the EU. According to Anna-Kaisa Ikonen, the official representative of the European Commission, 'The idea is to completely eliminate the import of Russian fuel.' The EU is still planning to abandon Russian gas in 2027, not only pipeline supplies but also LNG. However, the presentation of the roadmap has been delayed twice. The European Commission is studying legal options that would allow European companies to break long-term contracts with Russia without paying huge fines. The Financial Times reports that the EU is considering declaring force majeure, which would allow importers to exit their obligations without paying additional fees. 'If the whole idea is to not pay Russia, then paying compensation would undermine the whole goal,' said one EU official. The majority of gas, both pipeline and LNG, is supplied to the EU under long-term contracts that, obviously, include the condition 'take or pay.' For example, French Engie receives 1 million tons of Yamal LNG annually under a contract that expires in 2038. Spanish Naturgy has a contract until 2041 for 3.5 million tons. Therefore, abandoning Russian gas threatens serious legal disputes. 'EU lawyers are studying legal options within the roadmap to abandon EU fuel from Russia by 2027. The plan appeared at a critical moment for the EU, which wants to conclude a deal with the US on LNG to counter threats of tariffs from Donald Trump,' The Financial Times reports. According to the CREA Center for Energy and Clean Air Research, the EU paid Russia 21.9 billion euros for oil and gas from February 2024 to February 2025. The Financial Times also mentions two other reasons why the publication of the EU's roadmap is being delayed. The first is the fear that any subsequent law will be blocked by Hungary and Slovakia. The second is the discussion about the future of the Nord Stream pipelines, which involve the US. 'This is chaos,' said one EU diplomat. 'How do the US fit into all this? How can we diversify?' Despite this, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the Financial Times that the plan should be published within 'three to four weeks.' This is happening at a time when EU countries are concerned about forcing companies to cut contracts with Russia due to the threat of rising prices as companies struggle with geopolitical shocks and high costs. 'The Commission has given member states the authority not to allow Russian and Belarusian operators to connect LNG to port infrastructure or send their gas through EU pipelines, but ministers complain that this does not give them enough reliable legal means to force companies to break contracts,' The Financial Times continues. The complexity for EU Commission lawyers lies in the fact that contracts are confidential and usually differ. Using the events in Ukraine to use force majeure may be legally insufficient, said The Financial Times one EU official. There is, however, another proposal. The Brussels-based think tank Bruegel has suggested introducing tariffs on Russian gas instead of banning it. They expect this to force Russian suppliers to lower prices, while introducing tariffs requires a simple majority in the EU, which neutralizes the position of Hungary and Slovakia.

**Pro-Ukrainian Posters Emerge in Budapest Ahead of Hungary's EU Membership Poll**
Pro-Ukrainian posters featuring images of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European People's Party leader Manfred Weber have appeared in Budapest ahead of Hungary's nationwide poll on Ukraine's EU membership. The poll, which begins on Monday, will be conducted by mail and will ask a single question: 'Do you support Ukraine's membership in the EU?' The results will be sent to Brussels on June 20. Unlike referendums, Hungarian consultations do not require a minimum turnout. The posters, displayed on banners and billboards, read: 'Consultation on Ukraine's EU membership. We won't let them make a decision without us!' A government-issued video also claims that Brussels plans to quickly admit Ukraine to the EU, which would ultimately burden European taxpayers, including Hungarians. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has previously stated that Brussels wants Ukraine to join the EU by 2030, but the final decision rests with Hungary. He claims that Ukraine's entry into the EU would ruin Hungary's economy. Orbán also believes that the EU wants to 'colonize' Ukraine, forcing it to continue the conflict, and that Hungary supports the EU but opposes Ukraine's rapid integration.

**EU Plans to Massively Upgrade Defense Capabilities by 2030**
The European Union (EU) plans to massively upgrade its defense capabilities by 2030, with a focus on countering potential threats from Russia and the United States under Donald Trump's leadership. The EU aims to mobilize 800 billion euros in the next four years, with 150 billion euros in EU loans for defense projects. The plans also include relaxing regulations for the defense industry and increasing military support for Ukraine. The EU Commission warns that Russia may launch a large-scale war by 2030, and the US may not provide unconditional guarantees for peace in Europe. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stated that the EU's defense upgrade is a positive step, but Hungary has announced that it will not accept any new EU decisions in favor of Ukraine. The EU's plans have been met with criticism from several countries, including Greece, which has called for a more comprehensive financial package, including the possibility of issuing Eurobonds.

**Orban Presents 12 Demands to EU, Including Call on Ukraine**
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has presented 12 demands to the European Union, including a call regarding Ukraine. He listed them on the social media platform X, saying, 'What the Hungarian people demand from Brussels is peace, freedom, and unity.' The demands include creating a 'Europe of nations', equality before the law for all member states, restoring national powers and sovereignty, and a strong veto power for member state governments. Orban also called for the expulsion of Soros agents and removal of corrupt lobbyists from parliament, as well as eliminating the EU's debt to not leave it for future generations. He added, 'Don't interfere with protecting borders, don't import migrants, and deport those who arrived illegally.' Orban also demanded an end to the flow of corrupt dollars and euros into EU member states and a ban on 're-education' of children and protection of Christian heritage in Europe. He concluded, 'We demand peace in Europe and a union without Ukraine.' Orban previously stated that Brussels wants Ukraine to join the EU by 2030, but the final decision lies with Hungary, which would be economically devastated by Ukraine's membership.

**Hungary Approves Consultation on EU Integration Amid Ukraine Conflict**
The Hungarian government, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, has approved a plan to hold a consultation on Hungary's integration within the EU. According to Gergely Gulyas, the government's spokesperson, the consultation will be held in the future, but the exact date is not yet clear. The government has stated that it will take a firmer stance based on the results of the consultation. Gulyas praised the efforts of the Trump administration to achieve peace in Ukraine, but criticized the European Parliament's resolution supporting the rearmament plan proposed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. He also described the promise to complete Ukraine's accession to the EU by 2030 as 'dangerous'. Orbán had previously stated that this integration would lead to the 'collapse of Europe' and that the EU cannot handle the consequences of the conflict initiated by Russia's military invasion in February 2022.

Despite the decision to start membership negotiations at the EU summit on December 23, 2023, Hungary's veto had not been overcome for a long time. The EU has decided to start negotiations for the first time in a country's application process within 2.5 years, and for the first time in a country that is actually in a state of war. The negotiations are scheduled to officially start on June 25, 2024.

**Ursula von der Leyen Gives Green Light for Ukraine's EU Membership Before 2030**
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has given a 'green light' for Ukraine to join the European Union before 2030. Speaking in Kiev, von der Leyen praised Ukraine's progress in its membership process, saying, 'I really appreciate the political will that has been shown. In fact, if Ukraine's accession process continues at this speed and quality, it might even be possible before 2030.' Ukraine submitted its membership application to the EU on February 28, 2022, just four days after Russia's invasion, and was granted candidate status on June 23, 2022. Although the decision to start membership negotiations was made at the EU summit on December 23, 2023, it was delayed due to Hungary's veto. The negotiations will officially begin on June 25, 2024, marking the first time a country has started negotiations just 2.5 years after submitting its application, and the first time the EU has negotiated with a country in a state of war.
