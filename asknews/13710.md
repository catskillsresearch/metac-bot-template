**Moscow and Kiev Agree to Prisoner Exchange, But Remain Divided on Key Conditions**
A second round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine ended just an hour after they began in Istanbul on Monday, according to Turkish officials. The meeting came a day after a massive Ukrainian drone attack on Russian strategic bombers with nuclear capability. Recent statements from high-ranking officials who participated in the meeting reflect that both sides remain deeply divided on key conditions to end the war. 'We made a fairly general proposal: a concrete ceasefire of two or three days in some areas of the front,' said Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky in a press conference after the talks. Ukraine proposed to Russia to hold a new round of dialogue 'between June 20 and 30,' announced Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov on Monday. 'We propose to the Russian side to organize a meeting before the end of the month, between June 20 and 30,' Umerov said in a press conference. A 30-day unconditional ceasefire, the release of prisoners, and a meeting between Zelensky and Putin are the three objectives that Ukraine seeks to resolve the conflict with Russia, Umerov commented. Kiev showed openness to the possibility of Donald Trump attending the leaders' meeting. The talks -- the second direct contact of this type between the two sides since 2022 -- began with almost two hours of delay, without explanations for the delay. The climate in Russia was one of indignation at the start of the talks, with influential military bloggers demanding that Moscow launch a strong retaliatory strike against Kiev after Ukraine perpetrated a massive attack on Russian long-range bombers with nuclear capability in Siberia and other regions. 'We all want the same thing: to stop the war,' Ukrainian President Zelensky said in a press conference in Vilna, Lithuania. He also assured that Ukraine's European partners were aware of the drone operation that weakened Russia. 'Everything we do with our partners strengthens Europe. It is necessary to impose sanctions on Russia, including secondary and tariffs.' Otherwise, 'Putin will continue to play,' he added. Zelensky also urged Trump to take a firmer stance against the Kremlin. 'We really hope that Trump will take strong measures. We hope that he will support sanctions to force Russia to end the war or, at least, to move to the next stage, that is, a ceasefire,' he said. Zelensky also argued that the Russian president should not receive any reward for the invasion of Ukraine. 'Putin should not receive any reward for his aggression: if he is allowed to decide who enters or does not enter NATO, his appetite will increase.' And he emphasized: 'The key to a lasting peace is clear: the aggressor should not receive any reward for the war. We must ensure that diplomacy is not empty.' Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelensky announced that a new exchange of prisoners with Russia is being prepared, after the second round of direct negotiations between the two sides in the Turkish city. 'We exchanged documents through the mediation of the Turkish side, and we prepared a new release of prisoners of war,' he said during the press conference in Vilna. The first round of talks between Moscow and Kiev, held on May 16, allowed for the exchange of 1000 prisoners on each side. According to Ukrainian negotiator Umerov, Russia and Ukraine agreed to exchange all their severely wounded or under 25-year-old prisoners of war, as well as 6000 corpses of soldiers killed in combat for each side. Additionally, Kiev reported that during the negotiations in Istanbul, it handed over to Moscow a list with hundreds of Ukrainian children who, according to Ukrainian authorities, were 'deported' by Russia, and demanded their repatriation. 'It is about hundreds of children that Russia deported illegally, forcibly displaced or retains in the temporarily occupied territories,' said Andrii Yermak, head of the presidential administration, in his Telegram account.

**Putin 'is preparing for more war,' GOP senator warns after meeting with Zelenskyy and Macron**
Two senior U.S. senators, Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, have warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling at the peace table while preparing for a new military offensive in Ukraine. The senators, who met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron, said that the next two weeks could shape the future of the war. They are pushing for a bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose 500% tariffs on countries that continue buying Russian oil, gas, uranium, and other exports. Graham said, 'What I learned on this trip was he's preparing for more war,' and Blumenthal called the sanctions 'bone-crushing' and said it would place Russia's economy 'on a trade island.' The senators said that failing to act now could pull the U.S. deeper into conflict later and that NATO treaty obligations could one day compel American troops into battle. They also expressed their hope that their findings will shift momentum in Washington and help bring a skeptical President Donald Trump on board.

**NATO Must Be Prepared for Battle with Russia 'Tonight' - German General**
German General Carsten Breuer, inspector of the German military, stated that NATO must be prepared for a battle with Russia 'already tonight'. In an interview with the BBC, Breuer said, 'According to analysts' estimates, a direct military conflict between NATO countries and Russia will occur in 2029. However, when asked if there are any guarantees that the conflict will not happen before 2029, Breuer replied, 'No, so we must be ready for it tonight.' Breuer also suggested that Russia may target the Suwalki Corridor, which borders Lithuania, Poland, and Belarus simultaneously.

**Boris Johnson: I Believe in Trump's Statements**
Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated that he believes in the possibility of following the statements made by US President Donald Trump. Johnson emphasized that he is against trade wars and prefers tariffs over free trade. He also stated that Trump's policies are not a surprise, as they can be changed through democratic means. Johnson added that Trump is trying to attract investment to the US and bring production back to the country. Johnson also emphasized the need to reduce tariffs globally and to take measures against countries that engage in unfair competition within the framework of WTO rules. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo stated that the current situation between the US and China is a trade war between two major powers with different political and economic systems. Azevedo noted that the US was once the world's largest trading nation, but China has now taken its place. He stated that the US will try to address the asymmetries and differences in tariffs between the two countries. Azevedo predicted that the tension between the US and China will not be resolved in the near future and will have a global impact, affecting trade imbalances, investment flows, and financial markets. Johnson said, 'Trump's policies are not a surprise, as they can be changed through democratic means. He is a very clear man.' Johnson also stated that Trump is trying to attract investment to the US and bring production back to the country, saying, 'He has the right to try.'

**Germany's Chief of Staff Warns of Possible Russian Attack in 2029**
Germany's Chief of the General Staff, General Carsten Breuer, has stated that Russia is likely to attack in four years. According to him, Russia produces around 1,500 main battle tanks per year and significantly increases its military forces. 'Not all tanks are sent to war in Ukraine, but they also go to reserves and new military structures that are always directed against the West,' he said. Breuer also mentioned that in 2024, Russia produced 4 million 152mm artillery shells, not all of which are intended for the front in Ukraine. 'There is an intention and accumulation of reserves for a possible future attack on the Baltic countries,' he added. Breuer estimated that the attack could happen in 2029, but warned that it could happen earlier. 'This is what the analysts estimate - in 2029. So we must be ready for 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it will not happen before 2029? I would say no, it's not. So we must be ready for battle today,' he emphasized. Breuer named the Suwalki Gap - a section on the border of Poland, Lithuania, Russia, and Belarus - as one of the most vulnerable zones in case of aggression. 'The Baltic states are indeed vulnerable to the Russians, aren't they? And when you're there, you really feel it... during the negotiations we conduct there,' he said. According to him, Estonians compare their situation to feeling heat, seeing flames, and smelling smoke, while in Germany 'you probably see only a little smoke on the horizon.' Breuer also stated that Russia sees the war in Ukraine as 'a continuation' of a broader conflict with NATO and 'tries to find ways to penetrate our defensive lines and test them.' As examples of such actions, he mentioned attacks on underwater cables in the Baltic Sea, cyberattacks on public transportation, and the appearance of drones over critical infrastructure in Germany. Breuer called on NATO allies to urgently increase their defense potential. 'What we need to do now is really take action and say to everyone: 'Hey, increase... invest more in this, because we need it. We need it to be able to defend ourselves, and therefore to increase the deterrent potential,' he emphasized.

**Ukraine, Russia war escalates before peace talks**
The war between Ukraine and Russia escalated before peace talks, with Ukraine blowing up a Russian highway bridge and launching a bold attack on nuclear-capable bombers deep inside Siberia. At least seven people were killed and 69 injured in the bridge attack. Ukraine's Defence Minister Rustem Umerov will sit down with Russian officials at the second round of direct peace talks in Istanbul on Monday. Despite the attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, 'We are committed to finding a peaceful solution.' Russia launched 472 drones at Ukraine overnight, the highest nightly total of the war so far. US President Donald Trump has demanded Russia and Ukraine make peace and has threatened to walk away if they do not. The two sides will present their respective documents outlining their ideas for peace terms in Turkey, but it is clear that after three years of intense war, Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart.

**Portnikov Predicts War to Continue Until 2032**
According to political observer Vasily Portnikov, the hot phase of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which typically lasts 7-10 years, may continue until 2032. After that, a phase of conflict with possible battles and bombings may begin. Portnikov emphasized the need to prepare for a peaceful next phase of the conflict, which could last at least 10-15 years, by receiving help from the Americans and Europeans, improving Ukrainian policy and mobilization, and enhancing Ukraine's military-industrial complex. 'We need to prepare and prepare for a war that is still very short in terms of the nature of this conflict. This is only the first stage. There will be a second, third,' Portnikov warned. He believes that there are no objective grounds for the war to end in the near future, but suggested that under favorable circumstances (Russia's economic situation and US pressure), the fighting may stop in this or the next year. 'The war will not end in our lifetime. The fire will stop,' he stressed.

**Portnikov Predicts War Will Last Until 2032**
According to political analyst Vitaliy Portnikov, the large-scale war between Russia and Ukraine may continue until 2032. He stated that the hot phase of the war, which has been ongoing for 7-10 years, will eventually give way to a phase of conflict with possible battles and bombings. Portnikov emphasized the need to make efforts in the coming years to ensure that the next phase of the conflict is peaceful and lasts for at least 10-15 years. 'We need to prepare for a war that is still very short in terms of the nature of this conflict, very. This is only the first stage. There will be a second, third,' Portnikov warned. He believes that there are no objective preconditions for the war to end in the coming years, but suggested that under favorable circumstances (Russia's economic state and US pressure), the fighting may stop in this or the next year. 'The war will not end in our lifetime. The fire will stop,' he emphasized.

**Why do U.S./EU media hide this truth about the war in Ukraine?**
According to Eric Zuesse, the only way for the US and its allies to avoid a total defeat in the war in Ukraine is by directly going to war against Russia. However, this would not necessarily prevent a nuclear war, as the loser in the conventional war may initiate nuclear war against the winner. Zuesse questions why the stakes in this war, including the possibility of annihilation of civilization, are not being discussed in US-and-allied media. He also criticizes the media for censoring alternative viewpoints, including his own, and suggests that this is not a democracy but rather a dictatorship. Additionally, Zuesse mentions that the US Government's desire to conquer Russia and China is foreclosing peaceful paths for America's economy to grow. He argues that the media's censorship of alternative viewpoints is a sign of a flawed democracy.

**DEM Parti Co-Chair Hatimoğulları: Women Will Build Peace**
Tülay Hatimoğulları, the Co-Chair of the Democracy and Freedom Party (DEM Parti), participated in a women's march in Diyarbakır, organized by women's organizations for 'social peace and democratic solution'. Hatimoğulları stated, 'Peace that has not been a part of women's history has never been a lasting peace.' The march, held under the slogan 'Women are marching for social peace and democratic solution', brought together women from various parts of Turkey in Diyarbakır's Yenişehir district. In her speech after the march, Hatimoğulları emphasized that women will build peace, saying, 'War is violence. War is the militarist system's reproduction of itself in our daily lives. Throughout history, peace that has not been a part of women has not been a lasting peace. Let the whole world hear that; we women will definitely build peace in these lands. My friends who spoke before me listed the common demands of women in this process. I would like to add two things with your permission. Firstly, women must be the main part of the commission that will be formed in parliament. And women from all colors of Turkey must definitely be there. Yes, this has a leg in parliament. But the most important and essential leg is the society itself.'

The party emphasized that the ballots must never become a substitute for bullets, and that playing brinkmanship with nuclear consequences is not brave. 'There is nothing brave about playing brinkmanship with nuclear consequences. After three to four days of death and destruction, fortunately, we saw a ceasefire and people breathed a sigh of relief, finally,' the party said.

**Border Wars and the Return of Fear**
The threat of war is rising in Europe and beyond, as countries like Poland, South Korea, and Japan consider acquiring nuclear capabilities to deter more powerful neighbors. The new European commitment to defense and Russia's unshakeable wish to control Ukraine have revived an awareness that war is a possibility for comfortable and relatively wealthy states. The article cites various examples of tensions and conflicts, including the war in Ukraine, the potential invasion of Taiwan by China, and the deteriorating relations between France and Algeria. The author argues that Western states must prepare for the possibility of war and be willing to fight and win it to preserve their democratic politics. The article also mentions the growing instability and tension in Europe, including the rise of far-right nationalism in Romania and the potential for secessionist movements in Belgium and Scotland.

**A War of Values With Russia | by Anders Fogh Rasmussen - Project Syndicate**
Former NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen argues that Russia's war against Ukraine is a 'war of values' between democracy and authoritarianism. He notes that Putin's intentions were clear long before the 2022 invasion, citing his meddling in elections and sabotage of infrastructure. Rasmussen writes that our 'half-hearted response' to Putin's invasion of Crimea in 2014 was a turning point, allowing Putin to sense that our democratic resolve would falter. He warns that if we fail to stand up for democracy in 2025, we risk repeating the historic mistake of 2014. Rasmussen also highlights Russia's desperation to maintain its strategic influence, citing the recent threat to aim nuclear missiles at Danish warships if Denmark joins NATO's missile-defense system. 'This was obviously an outrageous threat against a country that has no intention of attacking Russia,' Rasmussen writes. 'But it also reflects a more fundamental factor in the Kremlin's foreign policy: desperation to maintain Russia's strategic influence at a time of unprecedented challenges to its authority.'

**Is the 'Amizade' of Trump and Putin the Gateway to the 3rd World War? Understanding What's at Stake**
The global geopolitical landscape is shifting, with the US and Russia drawing closer, while Europe is concerned and trying to protect itself. This delicate balance has some analysts warning of a possible global conflict. The US President, Donald Trump, has even mentioned the possibility of a 'Third World War' in his televised argument with the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky. While no one expects a conflict of this scale to erupt soon, this time it's not being dismissed. 'Every war is unthinkable until it happens. Just before the Ukraine war started in 2022, analysts said a war in Europe was unthinkable at that time. The First and Second World Wars were unthinkable until they happened,' reflects Raquel Gontijo, a professor of International Relations at PUC Minas. The world has changed since the Second World War, and the start of a conflict will likely be different. There is at least one contemporary parallel with the dangerous scenario of the 1930s, notes the professor. 'An analogy that has been made is that, in the period before the Second World War, the UK perceived the territorial expansion of Germany and adopted an appeasement policy, allowing it to expand and thinking that a peaceful configuration would be reached later. Clearly, that did not happen.' The parallel with this case is Russia and its expansionist ambitions. The peace agreement that the US is trying to broker between Russians and Ukrainians favors Putin, who would grab at least a quarter of Ukrainian territory. What comes next is a mystery. 'What does Russia want? Just a part of Ukraine? The whole of Ukraine? More expansion in Eastern Europe? Where does this end? We don't know,' concludes the professor. The professor of international law at UFMG, Lucas Carlos Lima, analyzes the situation with caution. 'It depends a lot on what is meant by Third World War. If the sense is a conflict with a high number of participants, including nuclear powers, the risk exists. But, at the same time, there are many efforts to mitigate the risks. States are not economically or politically interested in a larger-scale conflict.' It is at this point that the apparent approach of Trump and Putin worries. In the field of international relations, movements are rarely transparent, and all that can be done is infer intentions from the actors. There are analysts who see in Trump's attacks on Zelensky and, consequently, in the affection for Putin, a attempt to distance Russians and Chinese. Others, that it is a personal issue of Trump, admired by Putin's power. Or, still, a political calculation to increase his prestige as one who ended a long war and saved resources for his country. 'The Trump administration has changed its position on the Ukraine war. This does not necessarily mean a general and unrestricted approach to Putin. Firstly, the intention may be to reduce American presence in the European conflict. Secondly, to reduce tensions with the Russian administration, which was approaching a proxy war. Thirdly, the approach may also serve to end Russian isolation, which automatically brought Moscow closer to Beijing,' reflects the professor Lucas Carlos Lima. In the way, is Europe. After Trump's attacks on Zelensky, European leaders rallied around the Ukrainian and announced billions of dollars to reinforce the continent's defense. The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that 'Europe faces a clear and present danger on a scale that none of us has experienced in our adult life.' Even between China, the US and Russia, Europe is a major military and economic force, one of the protagonists in the global political game. 'The problem is that it is not a country, but several overlapping blocks. Sometimes coordination fails, and each country will have its own interpretation, with governments more to the right, others more to the left. Acting as a block is difficult,' notes the professor Raquel Gontijo. To Latin America, for now, remains to watch the dance of the great powers, in a moment when a greater short-term threat to Brazil than a war is the economic one, under the specter of Trump's taxations.

**The World's Forgotten Conflicts: A Call to Action**
The world has forgotten about the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, which began in February 2022, and is now focusing on the war in Israel, which started on October 7, 2023. According to the Institute for Economics and Peace, there are currently 56 wars involving 92 countries around the world, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths, including many children. The author notes that the fact that people in Europe and Spain live longer and better lives may contribute to the fact that conflicts in distant countries, such as Sudan, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Syria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, seem far away and insignificant. However, the author emphasizes that every death caused by war should be a concern for humanity, and that the consequences of war, including bloodshed and destruction, could one day affect us all. As the author says, 'quizás un día lo encontremos a la puerta de nuestra casa' (perhaps one day we will find it at our doorstep).

**UK 'will be at war in next five years' as official claims we 'need conscription right away' - Daily Star**
Liberal Democrat MP Mike Martin, a former British Army officer, believes there is a 'good chance' the UK will be involved in a war 'before the next election' and thinks conscription is necessary 'right away'. Martin, who has a PhD in war studies, stated that 'we're not at a stage yet where you can replace people with drones' and that 'drones are fine, as far as they go, but you still need people to occupy villages, hold ground, and all the rest of it'. This warning comes as experts predict the likelihood of 'World War 3' and Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has warned that the risk is 'extraordinary' and that 'World War III has already begun'. Dimon pointed to the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as cooperation between US enemies Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, as reasons for his grim outlook. He also stated that the world's collection of nuclear weapons is 'the biggest risk mankind faces', ahead of climate change.

**Experts Predict Global War by 2035 and Escalating Tensions between US and China**
A survey conducted by Atlantic Council found that 40% of 357 experts from 60 countries believe that there will be another global war by 2035, defined as a conflict between major economic powers. The experts, from various sectors including private, non-profit, academic, government, and multilateral institutions, also predicted that the current tensions between the US and China could escalate and become more dangerous. Additionally, 48% of the respondents expected that at least one actor would use nuclear weapons in the next decade, and 45% believed that a conflict could develop in space. Other concerns included environmental degradation, a 'war between powers', and the decline of trade due to protectionism. The survey also found that women were more pessimistic about the prospects of democracy, with 46.5% predicting that the current 'democratic recession' would worsen and become a 'democratic depression'. Furthermore, 61% of women surveyed predicted that nuclear weapons would be used in the next decade, and 32% believed that women's rights would be restricted. However, the experts were optimistic about the impact of biotechnology, with 53% seeing it as 'something positive'.
