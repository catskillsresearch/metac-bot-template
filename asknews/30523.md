**Avian Flu Confirmed in Don Benito, Extremadura**
The Junta de Extremadura has confirmed the detection of the H5N1 subtype of 'influenza aviar' (avian flu) in several dead geese found on a farm in Don Benito, Badajoz. This is the first reported case of 'influenza aviar' in wild birds in Extremadura in 2025. According to the Junta, there are currently no indications of outbreaks in domestic poultry. The Junta has recommended minimizing contact with birds showing clinical symptoms or found dead in the field. As a preventive measure, the Junta has prohibited the presence of domestic poultry and other captive birds at agricultural events, exhibitions, and cultural celebrations in the Don Benito area. The Junta has assured the public that animal health services will remain vigilant and implement protocols to prevent and detect new cases, if any.

**Avian Influenza Outbreaks in Mammals More Than Double in 2024**
According to a new report by the OMSA, there were 1,022 outbreaks of the disease in 55 countries in 2023, while in 2024 the number was 459. The spread of avian influenza has caused the death of several people who came into contact with infected birds. In addition, outbreaks in mammals such as cattle, dogs, and cats have become more frequent, increasing the possibility of the virus adapting and infecting humans, although the risk of this transmission remains low. 'It's worrying because we're seeing a change in the epidemiological pattern of the virus,' said Emmanuelle Soubeyran, director-general of the OMSA, to the French news agency. Several health experts have already warned that avian influenza represents a pandemic threat, given the virus's ability to mutate and spread, for example, between dairy farms in the United States. The report highlights that the virus is 'more than just an animal health crisis: it's a global emergency that destabilizes agriculture, food security, trade, and ecosystems.' The report emphasizes the importance of vaccination in interrupting epidemics in birds, reducing the risk to mammals and humans. Emmanuelle Soubeyran notes that vaccines are not suitable for all situations and calls for more investment in biosafety, surveillance, and global collaboration, which she considers essential to combat the threat. The first outbreak of avian influenza caused by H5N1 occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, and was controlled through the mass culling of 1.5 million domestic birds. In 2003, a new wave of outbreaks began, and since 2015, the disease has affected more than 60 species of mammals, including dogs, cats, and pigs. The virus, carried by wild birds, infected sea lions in South America and minks in Europe. Between October 2024 and January this year, more than 840 cases of the disease were detected in Europe, mainly in Hungary and Italy. Human-to-human transmission of the virus does not occur easily, but when it does, the infection can lead to a severe clinical picture. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were 81 reported human infections last year, the highest number of cases since 2015.

**Bird flu cases spreading faster and with greater impacts - report**
A new report by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) shows that bird flu cases are spreading faster and having greater impacts on mammals, ecosystems, trade, and food security. In 2024, bird flu instances affecting mammals doubled to 1,022 outbreaks, while poultry outbreaks reached 943 and non-poultry species had 2,570 outbreaks, leading to the loss of over 82.1 million poultry. The virus has affected new species of wild birds, domestic poultry, and an increasing number of mammal species, including livestock and pets. WOAH warns that avian influenza has evolved beyond an animal health crisis into a global emergency, threatening agriculture, food security, trade, and ecosystems. The risk for human health is also a concern, with 67 confirmed human cases and one death in the US. The WOAH recommends vaccination as a solution or complement to traditional control measures, citing France's nationwide vaccination campaign in ducks as a successful example. Some countries have also started vaccinating humans at risk of contracting bird flu, such as poultry farm workers.

**Avian Flu Outbreaks in Mammals Double in 2024, Posing Greater Risk to Humans**
In 2024, there was a doubling of avian flu outbreaks in mammals, posing a greater risk to humans. According to the OMSA, this is a major concern. The World Health Organization (OMSA) has its headquarters in Paris and is working to address the global emergency. Donald Trump has also spoken out about the need for increased security measures to prevent the spread of avian flu. The OMSA has reported that there is a growing risk of avian flu outbreaks in wild birds, mammals, and humans. The organization is also concerned about the increasing resistance to antibiotics and the need for global collaboration to address the biosecurity threat. The World Health Organization (OMSA) has warned that the risk of avian flu is becoming a major concern for human health, particularly in light of the changing climate and the potential impact on global food security.

**Brazil Analyzes New Suspected Cases of Avian Flu**
The Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture reported on Thursday (22) that there are approximately nine suspected cases of avian flu in the country. The cases emerged after the detection of the H5N1 avian flu virus in a commercial farm in Montenergo, Rio Grande do Sul, last Friday (16). The virus has been circulating since 2006, mainly in Asia, Africa, and northern Europe. Following the announcement, China temporarily suspended the purchase of Brazilian chicken meat. According to the Ministry, the official veterinary service concluded the cleaning and disinfection of the area where a focus of avian flu was confirmed in a commercial poultry breeder. This marks the beginning of the 28-day sanitary vacuum period, as stipulated in international protocols. If no new foci are registered during this interval, Brazil can self-declare itself free of the disease in that region. 'This period is essential to prove, in a technical and transparent manner, the containment of the virus. At the end of this period, if there are no new occurrences, Brazil can self-declare itself free of the disease in that region. This not only strengthens the credibility of our sanitary system, but also represents a fundamental step for the reopening of markets and normalization of exports. It is a procedure provided for in international protocols, and we are conducting this process with the utmost rigor and responsibility,' explained the Secretary of Agrodefense, Carlos Goulart. The Minister of Agriculture, Carlos Fávaro, emphasized that 'with the strength of the system and transparency in procedures' it will be possible 'to prove the containment of the focus and negotiate with our commercial partners protocols that avoid the total blockade of exports.' The sanitation action of the focus began on May 16 and was concluded on Wednesday (21). All hazardous material was properly handled, removed, and destroyed under the supervision of the official veterinary service, in accordance with the guidelines of the National Contingency Plan. The Ministry also reported that, within a 10 km radius of the farm where the focus was detected, there are 540 rural properties. Of these, in addition to the affected farm, two operate with commercial poultry. All establishments have been inspected. The operation mobilizes 25 teams composed of technicians from the official veterinary service, the Ministry, and the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Sustainable Production, and Irrigation of Rio Grande do Sul (Seapi). The work also has the support of the Montenegro City Hall, the Military Police, and the Fire Department. Regarding exports, the Ministry updated, on Thursday, the status of the suspensions: The Ministry continues in dialogue with the sanitary authorities of the importing countries, offering all necessary technical information in a quick and transparent manner. The goal is to ensure sanitary safety and facilitate the resumption of exports as soon as possible. Finally, the Ministry reiterates that the consumption of poultry meat and eggs remains safe, without risk to public health.

**La Influenza Aviar en México: Un Llamado Urgente a la Prevención y la Acción Rápida**
The recent death of a three-year-old girl due to the avian influenza A (H5N1) in Gómez Palacio, Durango, is a disturbing reminder of the fragility of our public health system in the face of zoonotic diseases. This is the first reported human case in Mexico, and although the risk of contagion is considered low, health authorities have taken preventive measures such as epidemiological cordoning and testing of close contacts. However, this tragic event should serve as a warning about the need to act quickly and effectively to prevent the situation from getting out of control. If we do not take the necessary precautions, we could face a wider outbreak that not only affects the human population but also the agricultural sector, with severe economic and health consequences. It is in these moments that collaboration between health, environmental, and agricultural authorities is more crucial than ever. Maintaining vigilance in poultry farms and high-risk rural areas, reinforcing biosecurity protocols, and promoting a culture of prevention are fundamental actions to prevent uncontrolled spread. Vaccination is one of the most effective strategies to prevent diseases, not only those affecting humans but also to prevent animal-to-animal and animal-to-human transmission. Prevention is not an option, it is a necessity. Although the risk of human contagion from avian influenza is still low, history has shown that public health threats should not be underestimated. Let us remember that health is everyone's responsibility. Staying informed, getting vaccinated when necessary, and following official recommendations is vital to protect ourselves and avoid more severe consequences. Prevention is the path to keeping Mexico healthy and prepared for any health threat. ' La prevención no es una opción, es una necesidad.' (Prevention is not an option, it is a necessity.)

**First Avian Influenza Focus Detected in Extremadura**
The National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza in Algete has confirmed the presence of avian influenza in geese in the municipality of Don Benito. The geese were found dead on the Doña Blanca farm, and official veterinary services from the Don Benito Veterinary Office took samples that tested positive. This is the first detected focus of avian influenza in wild birds in Extremadura in 2025. According to the authorities, the H5N1 subtype detected has a low zoonotic capacity, meaning it is unlikely to transmit to humans. However, it is recommended to minimize contact with birds showing clinical symptoms or found dead in the field. As a preventive measure, the presence of domestic birds or other captive birds will be prohibited in animal concentration centers in the Don Benito area, as defined by the Animal Health Law. The regional government wants to reassure the public that animal health services are vigilant and implementing protocols to prevent and detect new cases, if any.

**Mounties investigating after 2nd ostrich dies on B.C. farm facing cull order | CBC News**
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are investigating the death of a second ostrich on a B.C. farm, where 400 birds have been ordered killed due to avian flu concerns. The farm's spokesperson, Katie Pasitney, said the ostrich had a 'clear entry wound and a clear exit wound' and that the farm is working with the RCMP. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has ordered the cull, citing the need to prevent the spread of avian flu, but the farm and its supporters argue that the surviving ostriches are 'happy and healthy' and should be allowed to live. The CFIA says that a single laboratory-confirmed case of H5 avian influenza is sufficient to declare a premises infected, and that operational plans for the humane depopulation will not be shared with the public in advance.

**Brazil Faces Economic Consequences as Bird Flu Outbreak Hits Commercial Poultry Farm**
Brazil, the world's largest exporter of chicken, is dealing with its first confirmed outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) in a commercial poultry farm. The case, commonly known as bird flu, was identified last Friday in the southern municipality of Montenegro, near Porto Alegre, according to the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. Approximately 17,000 birds died in the affected facilities, with nearly all the breeding hens raised on the site succumbing to the disease or being slaughtered as a preventive measure. In response, the federal government declared a 60-day zoosanitary emergency in Montenegro and activated a national contingency plan. Despite the rapid response, economic consequences are already being felt, with a growing number of countries, including China, South Korea, South Africa, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and EU members, suspending imports of Brazilian chicken. China's decision alone could cost Brazil around $100 million per month, experts warn. Brazil had previously detected the virus in wild birds in the state of Espírito Santo in May 2023, but only in non-commercial birds. 'A national ban is a more serious situation,' said Leandro Gilio, professor of Insper Agro Global, who analyzes Brazil's role in global agribusiness. 'Most countries that import chicken end up buying it from places with localized outbreaks of bird flu and usually restrict regions or specific farms. Brazil now needs to demonstrate a certain level of control and that the disease has not spread to other regions of the country,' he added.

**Mpox: Our response to the Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in August 2024 due to a sharp rise in cases across Central Africa. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been the hardest hit, reporting over 18,000 confirmed cases. Elrha, a global health organization, quickly mobilized to support the response, recognizing the need for a rapid and impactful approach. They identified a gap in social and behavioral science (SBS) research and convened experts in Kinshasa, DRC, to redefine the role of SBS in outbreak response. Three new research projects were selected for funding to strengthen the mpox response, focusing on community engagement, vaccine acceptance, and research uptake for ethical community participation. Elrha aims to support a community-driven, evidence-based response, bridging gaps and fostering collaboration between local, regional, and global partners.

**Global Health Alert: WHO Declares Continued Public Health Emergency Amidst Escalating Mpox Crisis in 2025 | Health**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reaffirmed that the ongoing Mpox crisis continues to meet the criteria of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). From January 2022 to January 2025, nearly 130,000 confirmed Mpox cases and over 280 deaths have been reported across 130 countries, with 61% of cases emerging from the WHO African Region. Despite efforts to contain the outbreak, WHO experts highlight geopolitical instability, concurrent health emergencies, and a significant shortfall in financial resources as critical obstacles. The WHO's Mpox Global Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan is being extended to continue guiding containment efforts, but the organization warns of critical funding shortages that could jeopardize ongoing progress. The WHO Committee has advised sustained vigilance and collaboration to curb the outbreak and prevent further spread, with the Incident Manager expressing gratitude to all partners involved in the response.

**Five Years Since COVID-19 Was Declared a Pandemic**
Five years ago, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The declaration was made by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who stated, 'We have considered that the Covid-19 can be classified as a pandemic.' At the time, less than 4,300 people had died worldwide. Since then, millions have died, but in March 2020, lockdowns, hospital overcrowding, and economic collapse were not yet on the horizon. John Zarocostas, a veteran journalist, recalls that the word 'pandemia' changed the situation, and governments began to take action. The WHO has since declared two more Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC), both for mpox epidemics. The organization is now working on an international agreement to prevent and prepare for future pandemics, which is expected to be finalized in May.

**Five Years After COVID-19 Pandemic Declaration, WHO Works Towards Preventing Future Pandemics**
It has been five years since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting a global response. On March 11, 2020, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'We have considered that the COVID-19 can be classified as a pandemic.' However, the WHO had already raised its highest level of alert on January 30, 2020, declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the new coronavirus detected in China in December 2019. The PHEIC did not have the same impact on public opinion. Ghebreyesus also mentioned 'the threat of a pandemic' on March 9, but the shock came two days later. Since then, the WHO has declared the PHEIC twice, both times for mpox epidemics. The organization is now working on an international and binding agreement on pandemic prevention and preparedness to avoid repeating the same mistakes. The negotiations are ongoing, with a final session scheduled for April 7-11. In the meantime, the WHO has updated its regulations, allowing the Director-General to declare a 'pandemic emergency' as of September 2024.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox an international public health emergency, citing the continuing rise in cases and geographic spread of the disease. The decision was made after the WHO's emergency committee met on February 25, 2025, and advised WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus that the situation still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). According to the WHO, the mpox upsurge continues to meet the criteria of a PHEIC, with cases rising and its geographic spread widening. The WHO has confirmed nearly 128,000 mpox cases across 130 countries since 2022, including 281 deaths. The current outbreak is mainly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where more than 13,000 cases and 43 deaths were confirmed last year, and over 2,000 cases have been confirmed in the first five weeks of this year.

**WHO Declares Monkeypox Outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the monkeypox outbreak still meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as defined by the International Health Regulations (IHR). This announcement comes after the third meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee on the mpox outbreak, which took place on February 25, 2025. The committee advised the Director-General to extend the PHEIC, citing the continued increase in numbers and geographic spread, as well as the 'severe disruption' in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the 'insufficient funding' to implement the response plan. The Director-General accepted the committee's advice and also accepted the revised interim recommendations provided by the committee to countries experiencing outbreaks of smallpox, which will guide national efforts to prevent and control the spread of the disease. The full report of the meeting will be issued next week. The monkeypox outbreak was first declared a PHEIC on August 14, 2024, after cases were identified in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighboring countries. 'The situation is still serious and requires continued attention and action,' said Dr. Tedros. 'We must work together to prevent and control the spread of this disease.'

**Mpox Outbreak in Africa: WHO Maintains Highest Alert Level Amid Ongoing Conflicts and New Variant**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has maintained its highest alert level for the Mpox outbreak in Africa due to ongoing conflicts hindering necessary countermeasures and the emergence of a new variant, Klade Ib. The WHO had declared a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' (PHEIC) in August 2024, citing the increasing number of infections, geographical spread of the virus, and tense security situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to the WHO, the new variant is a major concern, and the alert level is intended to prompt governments to increase surveillance and allocate funds for control efforts, although it has no concrete consequences.
