**Silver Surges: Breaking out of Triangle Pattern to New Highs in 2025**
Silver's price surge in 2025 is driven by several factors, including industrial demand growth, persistent supply deficits, safe-haven appeal, monetary policy, and speculative demand. The Silver Institute projects solar demand could dominate global silver reserves by 2050, with estimates suggesting 85-98% of current reserves could be used. The gold-to-silver ratio, currently around 1:92, suggests silver is undervalued compared to gold. According to a market analyst, if silver breaks out over the October 2024 highs ($31.80), it could see the iShares Silver Trust ETF (SLV) make a run to test the highs from April 2011 ($48.35), with a potential pullback expected before reaching all-time highs. 'I'm not expecting a major pullback, as SLV could consolidate within a well-defined trading range before it takes out the all-time highs. After that....the sky is the limit.'

**Is the Euro Ready to Challenge the Dollar in 2025?**
The dollar's reign over global finances is waning. A convergence of economic changes and political decisions has weakened the once-powerful currency and fueled American inflation, while the White House has adopted an unorthodox policy of abandoning the strong dollar policy. This has created a cocktail of uncertainty and tension around its global hegemony. The euro, the only currency with the capacity to assume the international monetary throne, has found an unexpected ace in the hole to challenge the dollar's dominance. In reality, it's never been more possible in decades. However, can it take advantage of this opportunity? The dollar has weakened significantly in 2025, falling by nearly 10% so far this year. Essentially, it's due to the escalating tariffs. Although, above all, and looking to the future, it's due to the growing concern about the US fiscal trajectory and the credibility of Washington's politics. A weaker dollar means that the US imports, in practice, inflation through external purchases; from electronics to energy. Everything gets more expensive in dollars and affects American pockets. As the US increases tariffs, from Chinese machinery to European steel, its surcharges act as fuel for the dollar's depreciation and the rise in prices. Consumers are already feeling the pressure, and the Federal Reserve remains on high alert. Therefore, the battle against inflation and the battle against financial instability that Washington has always defended with the dollar as a safe haven has ironically disappeared. Like a self-inflicted punishment. And Europe and the rest of the world have taken note. The euro is now in a position, more than ever, to emerge from the shadow of the dollar. Never in its quarter-century history has it been so disposed to gain influence and international weight. The conditions are ideal. The dollar still dominates the majority of central bank reserves, but its leadership is declining, and its participation in reserve assets has fallen to 58%, the lowest level in decades. The euro, on the other hand, is making subtle movements that suggest it will increase its current weight of 20%. Changes are on the horizon. Recent surveys, such as the Official Forum of Monetary and Financial Institutions, attest to this. Central banks, according to their demographic study, consider the euro more and more as their preferred form of diversifying their investments with increases in their holding of European currency. Especially those in Asia and Latin America, who see the euro as a more and more credible plan B. And in the short term. In contrast to gold, a refuge from volatilities like the current one, but unable to finance trade or pay bills. The European currency can take on this mission. Even the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, emphasizes these days that it's 'the moment of the euro globally', although she highlights that 'it must earn that prestige' externally before leaving a warning sign: the fracture of the monetary order created by the dollar is a historic opportunity for the monetary zone. But where should the geostrategic leap be seen? Above all, in the energy and commercial fields, where the dollar still shows its hegemonic power as a currency for oil contracts, aircraft sales, or cross-border payments. Despite the emerging role of the euro in international trade, it is the nominative currency of a quarter of global transfers. With a tendency to increase, according to market operators. It is, in fact, the second currency on the podium, with almost 30% of business invoices, a share that could increase with speed this year given the unpredictability generated by American economic policies in capital markets and asset reassignment. Each new wave of tariffs, now under suspicion of legality as American courts have just assured, is a drama for a US fiscal and debt trajectory of impossible sustainability in the medium term. All of this has almost erased the dollar's status as a safe-haven value. The great challenge of the euro, however, is enormous. It will not be hegemonic without the 'petro-euros' barrel of oil choosing. Something unimaginable until now, but which is beginning to pose as a non-despicable idea of a commercial war that leaves the dollar without lifelines from the US Treasury. In short, the euro is the only currency with global influence to dethrone the dollar from its global throne. That time, past - and recent - in which it has exhibited its enormous liquidity and a special connivance with Wall Street has passed to reveal a sudden deterioration of the traditional balance between its monetary strength and American geopolitical action abroad. The guardians of the European currency should address this exceptional challenge and inaugurate with the euro as a banner a multipolar exchange order.

**US Dollar/TL Trades Flat at 39.2040 Amid Powell's Announcement**
The US dollar/TL is trading at 39.2040, maintaining a flat trend since the start of the week. The dollar/TL, which rose on Friday, is currently being watched by investors for the announcement of US Federal Reserve Chairman Powell. The dollar/TL has been trading at 39.2040 since the start of the week, after starting the week's first trading day flat. On Friday, the dollar/TL showed an upward trend, closing the day 0.3% above its previous close at 39.2100. As of 10:05 am today, the dollar/TL is trading flat at 39.2040. At the same time, the euro/TL is being sold at 44.7880 with a 0.7% increase, and the sterling/TL is being sold at 53.1610 with a 0.5% increase. The dollar index is also trading at 98.9 with a 0.4% decrease. The increasing risk perception due to the possible talks between the US and China, which have become more uncertain after the two countries' mutual accusations, is making it difficult for asset pricing. The uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's protectionist trade measures continues to be the main source of uncertainty for the global economy, while there are still questions about the inflationary effects of tariffs. In this context, the announcement of US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell today will be the focus of investors, who will be looking for clues about the Bank's future policies. Meanwhile, concerns about the US economy's financial situation continue, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying that the country will never default. Bessent's statements may have alleviated some of the growing concerns, but they are still causing investors to be cautious. Today, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data to be announced in the Eurozone and the US, as well as US Federal Reserve Chairman Powell's announcement, will be followed.

**US Dollar Losing Dominance as World's Reserve Currency**
The US dollar is losing its dominance as the world's reserve currency, with a decline in its share of global currency reserves from 65% in 2014 to 58% in 2024. Analysts believe that this trend is driven by the increasing use of alternative currencies, such as the euro, yuan, and cryptocurrencies. Donald Trump's administration is seen as a key player in this shift, with some speculating that the decline of the dollar is a deliberate strategy to mask the true intentions of the US. The dollar's decline could be a result of the US's desire to create a new financial system, with the US dollar remaining at the center but with a greater emphasis on digital currencies and innovative financial instruments. The US is also developing its own digital currency, which could be a way to regain control over the financial system. The article suggests that the US is preparing for a multi-polar world, where several currencies will coexist and compete for influence. The dollar will likely remain the dominant currency, but the euro and yuan will gradually gain more importance, especially in regional trade blocs. Cryptocurrencies will also play a significant role in this new system, offering new possibilities for cross-border payments and investments. However, the article warns that this transformation must be done smoothly and without leading to financial crises and geopolitical conflicts.

**The Euro’s Chance to Replace the Dollar**
Moody's downgrading of the US credit rating is a symbolic event, but the analysis should worry us more, as it predicts a public sector deficit of 9% in 2035 without fiscal reform. This could lead to a global debt crisis. The dollar weakened against its G-10 counterparts, while the euro jumped 1% to $1.1274. Strategists at Morgan Stanley and Société Générale consider an exchange rate of $1.20 per euro achievable, while Deutsche Bank predicts a rise to $1.30. The role of the dollar as a reserve currency is being questioned due to huge budget deficits and reliance on foreign investors. Fink said, 'In the short term, Europe will definitely be one of the winners, but I measure the future viability of the EU by whether it will succeed in creating a genuine capital markets union and a genuine banking union.' The dollar's collapse could trigger a world financial crisis and make the euro an attractive alternative for investors. If the euro became the world's new reserve currency, Europe would be flooded with money and dominate world markets.

**Opinion: Is the US dollar losing its shine on the global stage?**
The US dollar's dominance as the world's reserve currency is being threatened by current policy settings and investors' decreasing enthusiasm for funding the US's growing twin deficits. The dollar has fallen more than 10% since the US tariff proposals in early April and has stayed down despite the S&P 500's recovery. Historically, the US dollar has moved in long cycles, and recent moves have raised questions about whether another turning point has been reached. The article suggests that a partial unwind of US asset ownership is underway as investors diversify into other markets, and non-US assets may continue to outperform for a while longer. The author notes that some diversification away from the US is prudent, if not essential, in an increasingly multipolar backdrop.

**Trump Endorses Bitcoin Act: US Ready to Buy 1 Million BTC**
Donald Trump has officially endorsed the Bitcoin Act, a revolutionary bill proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, which provides for the gradual purchase of one million Bitcoins by the US government. This symbolic and substantial figure would mark the US's decisive entry into the world of digital gold reserves. According to the proposal, this move will not incur new costs for taxpayers, as it will be funded through existing funds at the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury. The goal is twofold: on the one hand, to ensure a strategic BTC reserve to strengthen the US's financial position in the long term, and on the other hand, to prepare the nation for a new monetary era, where cryptocurrencies can play a role of stability comparable to (if not superior to) that of gold. Trump's public and decisive support for this initiative highlights the growing willingness of his administration to integrate Bitcoin into the nation's geopolitical strategy, a unprecedented turn in American political history. The plan is part of a broader strategy on the crypto ecosystem. The Bitcoin Act is not an isolated action. It is part of a larger plan to reform digital assets promoted by the Trump administration. The three main pillars of this plan are: The GENIUS proposal aims to regulate stablecoins such as USDT and USDC, anchoring them to the US dollar and preserving the dollar's dominance in the future digital economy. This legislative action is seen as a proactive attempt to control tokenization financial mechanisms, in order to prevent other states or private platforms from imposing alternative standards. Trump, through this approach, wants to centralize the geopolitical role of the dollar and at the same time ensure that the United States maintains leadership in the new economy driven by cryptocurrencies. The purchase of one million BTC is not just an economic issue, it's also a strategic challenge to the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) that have been promoting de-dollarization policies in recent years to reduce dependence on Western currencies. A US public Bitcoin reserve would offer an immediate counterweight and a neutral platform for international monetary interactions. This move, if implemented, would mark the end of the dollar's exclusive dominance as the only reserve currency and could open the way to a multipolar monetary order. In this context, Bitcoin is configured as a balancing tool, capable of ensuring integrity, transparency, and resistance to inflation in a increasingly fragmented global context. According to some rumors, Trump himself has already purchased personally BTC worth $3 million, anticipating the legislative evolution. If confirmed, this information would strengthen the idea that Bitcoin represents today a new frontier of political and financial power. Trump's support for the Bitcoin Act represents a turning point in US economic policy. The project of acquiring one million BTC by the government, combined with the regulation of stablecoins and the structuring of the crypto market, outlines an organic, aggressive, and pragmatic strategy. The meaning of this move goes beyond the economy: it concerns sovereignty, diplomacy, and control of the global monetary infrastructure. Bitcoin is emerging as a strategic asset of the state, and not just a marginal tool. Meanwhile, new crypto projects like BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) make this new paradigm accessible to retail investors, democratizing access to the benefits of the Bitcoin revolution.

**Why the end of the US dollar's reign is just a mirage**
The predicted collapse of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency is not happening, but there is a shift underway. The dollar is not being replaced, but US dollar-denominated assets are losing their dominance in global portfolios. According to the article, it's essential to distinguish between depreciation and de-dollarisation. The author notes that the dollar's decline is not a sign of its impending collapse, but rather a natural adjustment in the global economy. 'It's a mirage,' the article states, emphasizing that the dollar's reign is not coming to an end anytime soon.

**Will Dollar Stay King in Next Rate Cycle?**
The U.S. dollar's dominance in the global currency market is being challenged as central banks around the world adjust their policies in response to inflation and slowing growth. The Federal Reserve has held its position by emphasizing inflation control and data dependence, while other major central banks have cut their base rates. The dollar's share of global foreign exchange reserves has been declining, and alternative currencies such as the euro and the renminbi are gaining traction. Technical signals, including a potential double-top pattern on the DXY, suggest that the dollar's near-term momentum may be shifting. Traders should keep an eye on key FX pairs such as USD/JPY, EUR/USD, and USD/CAD, as well as the policy gap between the Fed and the ECB, to stay ahead of the market. As the dollar's foundations shift, traders should stay grounded in the data and let technicals, macro trends, and policy signals guide their view.

**Is dollar's reign ending?**
The US dollar's dominance in the world monetary and financial order is under scrutiny. The dollar's 'exorbitant privilege' status as the world's reserve currency is at risk due to a decline in the USD index (DXY) and concerns over tariff policies. The dollar has lost some ground to non-traditional currencies, with most Group of 10 currencies appreciating against it. Factors such as uncertainty over tariff policies, concerns over stagflation, and foreign investors rebalancing their portfolios have weighed on the dollar. The dollar's share of global reserves has declined from 71% in 2000 to 57.8% in 2024. China's yuan has gained prominence, with its share of global reserves increasing to 2.3% in 2020-2024. The yuan's lack of full capital account convertibility and concerns over transparency present challenges to its broader adoption. The rise of BRICS and its potential to create a common currency could provide a multipolar currency system. However, there are limitations to the use of local currencies for broader financial needs. The gold standard is unlikely to return, but there are signs pointing to a return to some kind of monetary gold standard. The United States' unsustainable debt path could lead to a self-inflicted demise of the US dollar over time.

**The Future of the US Dollar: A Threatened Dominance**
The US dollar's dominance in the global economy and financial system is being threatened by the Trump administration's aggressive trade policies. The dollar's value has fallen by 8.2% in 2025, and many analysts predict further declines. The dollar's role as a reserve currency is being questioned, and some experts believe it may lose its status as the world's leading currency. The US has benefited from being the world's reserve currency for 100 years, but the Trump administration's policies may be ending this era. The dollar's dominance is due to its widespread use in international trade, finance, and reserves. However, the Trump administration's tariffs and trade policies are causing concern among investors and analysts. The dollar's value is also being affected by the US's growing trade deficit and the impact of tariffs on the economy. Some analysts believe that the dollar may eventually lose its status as the world's leading currency, while others predict that it will continue to be the dominant currency. The situation is complex, and many factors are at play. The dollar's value is influenced by a variety of factors, including interest rates, inflation, and economic growth. The Trump administration's policies are also having an impact on the global economy, and the dollar's value is being affected by the resulting uncertainty. The situation is being closely watched by investors and analysts, and many are predicting further declines in the dollar's value.

**The Future of the US Dollar: A Challenging Time**
The US dollar has been the dominant global currency for over a century, but its position is being challenged by the rise of other currencies, such as the euro. The author argues that the dollar's strength is due to the US's economic power, but this power is being undermined by the country's trade deficits and debt. The author suggests that the US is trying to change the global trade system to favor American interests, but this goal is being hindered by the dollar's attractiveness as a safe-haven asset. The author argues that the US needs to reduce the dollar's attractiveness by limiting capital flows and reducing its role as a global reserve currency. The author also criticizes the US's recent economic policies, which have led to a decline in the middle class and an increase in inequality. The author suggests that the current economic system is unsustainable and that a new system is needed. The author concludes by saying that the dollar will remain dominant until a new currency or system emerges.

**‘Will the dominance of the dollar come to an end?’**
The dominance of the US dollar in the global economy has been a topic of discussion for decades, with some arguing that it may be coming to an end due to growing pushback from countries around the world. However, despite the decline of the dollar's share of foreign exchange reserves, it is unlikely to be replaced as the world's reserve currency in the near future. According to the IMF, the dollar made up 57.8% of allocated reserves at the end of 2024, down 7.3 percentage points in the past decade. Central banks have been diversifying their reserves, with the euro remaining stable as the second reserve currency, and a basket of non-traditional currencies increasing from 2.5% to 4.6% of reserves. The Chinese renminbi, which was once seen as a potential replacement for the dollar, now makes up only 2.2% of reserves. Additionally, central banks have been accumulating gold as a reserve asset, with China and Russia increasing their holdings in 2024. While some analysts predict the end of the dollar's dominance, it is unlikely to happen for years to come.

**Trump's Trade War and Tax Cuts Threaten the US Dollar's Status as a Global Reserve Currency**
The devaluation of the US dollar since Trump's announcement of tariffs could signal the end of the US's dominance in the international financial system. The uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies is unsettling investors, who are now less interested in the previously reliable US government bonds. The US debt-to-GDP ratio could rise to 220% by 2055, shaking the confidence in the dollar as a global reserve currency. Trump's trade war and planned tax cuts are straining the state budget, while capital inflows into the US are supporting the dollar and weakening the export industry. As one expert might say, 'The dollar's status as a global reserve currency is under threat.'

**Geo-economic and Currency Multi-polarity - Daily Times**
The US dollar's dominance as the global reserve currency is being challenged by new geopolitical, technological, and economic factors. The dollar's status as the primary reserve currency after World War II and the Bretton Woods Conference is being questioned by emerging economies and alternative payment channels. Recent geopolitical realignments have fueled de-dollarization movements, with several governments investigating alternatives to limit their exposure to dollar weaknesses. The euro, Chinese yuan, International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights (SDR), and cryptocurrencies are being considered as potential alternatives to the US dollar. However, the euro faces structural challenges, the renminbi has limitations due to strict capital controls and regulatory scrutiny, and cryptocurrencies are volatile and subject to regulatory concerns. The dollar's widespread network effects, military prowess, and geopolitical power contribute to its strength, making it difficult to displace. The future of global currency arrangements is likely to be a gradual shift toward increased multipolarity in currency usage, with various reserve currencies emerging. Policymakers, investors, and international institutions must remain vigilant for these emerging tendencies and adjust their economic policies and financial systems accordingly.

However, this dominance is not guaranteed to continue indefinitely. The US dollar's value is linked to the country's economic performance, and a decline in the US economy could lead to a decline in the value of the dollar. Additionally, the increasing use of alternative currencies, such as the euro and the yuan, could also erode the dollar's dominance. The article highlights the importance of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, in maintaining the dollar's value and stability. However, the article also notes that the Federal Reserve's independence is under threat from the Trump administration's attempts to exert control over the bank's decisions. The article concludes that the future of the dollar's dominance is uncertain and that it is possible that other currencies could challenge its position in the future.

**Would De-Dollarization Hurt the U.S. Economy? - CEOWORLD magazine**
The U.S. dollar (USD) is the world's reserve currency, providing stability as a benchmark for global economies. However, some emerging market economies and nations like China and Russia might prefer their native currencies to hold global weight. Proponents of cryptocurrency argue against a dominant currency, while opponents of fiat currency prefer gold and silver. The USD's status as the global reserve currency is unlikely to change soon, given its reliability and economic strength. The U.S. is the largest economy in the world, with a GDP of $30.34 trillion, and the USD's share of global payments reached 49.1% in 2024, a 12-year high. De-dollarization could have a huge impact on the U.S., affecting markets and the reputation of the dollar as a reliable currency. Gradual dollar diversification could favor emerging market investors, while sudden de-dollarization might suggest a pivot to gold, natural resources, or other non-fiat stores of value. 'The USD is very strong right now,' according to SWIFT, and 'the Chinese yuan reached their all-time high in 2024 representing 5% of global payments, still far from USD's dominance.'
