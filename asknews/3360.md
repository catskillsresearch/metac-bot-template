**2.8 Billion People Worldwide Lack Access to Suitable Housing, UN Report Finds**
According to the United Nations' Habitat Programme annual report for 2024, approximately 2.8 billion people worldwide lack access to suitable housing. Of these, 1.1 billion people live in poor or informal settlements, which is 'the main challenge for sustainable urban development', as stated in the report. Around 90% of the population of these poor settlements live in Africa and Asia, where there is a shortage of housing units of around 170 million. Anna Claudia Robisch, Executive Director of the United Nations' Habitat Programme, said in the report that 'climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters continue to force millions of people to leave their homes in search of safety, stability, and better living conditions.' The report estimates that 318 million people are homeless, equivalent to the population of the United States. Globally, 'one in four people lives in conditions that harm their health, safety, and well-being', according to the United Nations' Habitat Programme report. Only 14% of urban residents and 40% of rural residents have access to clean water, and two in five people do not have access to sanitation services. The report states that 'safe and managed sanitation is a fundamental element of human development and is often used as a measure of progress in reducing poverty, diseases, and premature deaths.' Anna Claudia Robisch called for 'rethinking urban policies, land use, laws, and financing to prioritize housing and basic services as key drivers of climate action and sustainable development.' By 2040, it is expected that 2 billion urban residents will be exposed to significant temperature increases. The United Nations' Habitat Programme member states adopted the programme's strategic plan for 2026-2029, which focuses on access to housing, land, and basic services, such as clean water and sanitation.

**6 In 10 Americans Fear Social Security Will Vanish Before They Retire, As 2033 Insolvency Clock Ticks Louder - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)**
A recent survey by DepositAccounts found that 59% of working-age Americans fear that Social Security will not exist by the time they retire, with 70% of Generation X sharing this concern. The anxiety is driven by the program's main trust fund's depletion in 2033, which would leave incoming payroll taxes covering only 79% of promised checks. Jaime Eckels, a certified-financial-planner, warned that the countdown has moved from abstract to immediate for many savers, saying, 'It's not that far away. We're creeping up on it.' However, not all gauges are as bleak, with the 2025 Retirement Confidence Survey finding that about half of workers remain at least 'somewhat confident' that the government will pay benefits of equal value to today's. Despite this, 60% of workers worry about cuts to Social Security benefits. Analysts stress that insolvency does not equal disappearance, with LendingTree's Matt Schulz saying, 'The truth is that it's highly, highly unlikely Social Security 'won't be available.'

**80% of People with Obesity are Women, Says Nutritionist**
According to Daisy Rivas, a nutritionist at the Te칩filo D치vila hospital, there is a high percentage of obesity in the country, with at least 10-13 out of 15 patients she sees per week suffering from obesity, and the majority of them are women. Rivas emphasizes that this problem affects people of all ages, from children to adults and the elderly, with around 80-90% of patients presenting with obesity. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 1 billion people (1 in 8) worldwide suffer from obesity, a figure that was expected to reach 2030 but has already become a reality in 2024. Rivas highlights the importance of education in preventing obesity, suggesting that parents, especially mothers, learn and teach their children how to eat a balanced diet. She also warns against the dangers of processed and ultra-processed foods, as well as fast food, which can lead to weight gain and other health problems. Rivas recommends consulting a nutritionist for a personalized treatment plan, rather than following 'miracle diets' that can cause imbalances and harm. The Ministry of Public Health (MSP) promotes strategic lines of action through public policies and intersectoral interventions to address obesity as a national problem.

**Basque Country Faces Labor Shortage of 17% by 2036**
According to a study by Laboral Kutxa, the Basque Country (Euskadi) will face a labor shortage of 17% by 2036, with 171,000 job openings that cannot be filled. The study, 'Empleo y Transici칩n Demogr치fica en la CAPV y Navarra: Horizonte 2036', projects that the region will not have enough workers to meet the demand, even in the most optimistic scenarios. The director of the Department of Studies at Laboral Kutxa, Joseba Madariaga, explained that the region's population is aging and the birth rate is low, with an average of 1.3 children per woman. Madariaga stated that 'although migrations contribute to maintaining the population, the combination of low fertility and high longevity is driving a significant demographic aging.' To address this issue, Laboral Kutxa recommends prolonging the working life, attracting and retaining migration, and accelerating professional requalification programs. The study also highlights the importance of adopting proactive policies and collaboration between the public and private sectors to ensure the sustainability of the labor market and the competitiveness of the regional economy.

**From burnout to balance: a lesson in self-care for future doctors**
The American Association of Medical Colleges projects a shortage of up to 86,000 doctors by 2036, despite a surge in new medical students. To combat burnout and attrition, a mind-body medicine elective course was developed to help students cultivate self-awareness and long-term self-care. The course, which includes exercises such as gratitude journaling and nature walks, helps students build resilience and learn to lean on others. Studies have shown that graduates of the course are more likely to use these practices themselves and recommend them to patients. However, the course is an elective and many students never discover it. The author, a medical student, credits the course with helping her cope with the challenges of medical school and becoming a better caregiver. She argues that programs like Mind-Body Medicine are essential for trainees to build resilience and that without a structured focus on cultivating these skills, we risk losing yet another generation of physicians.

**Turkey sees sharp rise in obesity**
Turkey is experiencing a sharp rise in obesity, with 66.8% of its population affected, according to a 2022 WHO report. By 2030, it's estimated that 27 million people in Turkey will be obese, or one in three. Experts attribute this trend to insufficient nutrition, social inequality, unhealthy food supplies, and a lack of coherent policy strategies. Hacer Foggo, a Turkish poverty researcher, said the growing number of obese children can be linked to extreme poverty, while Bulent Sik, a food researcher, sees a direct link between the rise in child obesity and the widespread consumption of highly processed foods with low nutritional value and a high sugar content. Sik also warned of the use of toxic chemicals in food production, such as pesticides and certain additives that are related to hormonal imbalances and weight gain. Turkey's Health Ministry has launched a national public health campaign to combat obesity, but experts say the effort has drawn criticism for stigmatizing overweight individuals and overlooking the country's broader economic struggles. 'Political decision-makers are responsible for creating solutions,' said Sik. Both Sik and Foggo support a nationwide free school meal program, citing the need for adequate guidelines for healthy eating and restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy foods.

**Trump's Cuts to USAID Will Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under the age of five. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.'

**80 Of The Most Inspiring Weight Loss Before And After Pics (New Pics)**
According to a recent Lancet study, 2.11 billion adults worldwide are overweight or obese, and if global responses fail, half the population may be obese or overweight by 2050. To combat this, it's essential to celebrate those who have successfully lost weight and transformed their lives through physical activity and good nutrition. Bored Panda presents an inspiring list of people who have overcome obesity and shared their journeys. Registered dietician Samantha Gollup notes that weight may not always be an indicator of good health, and weight shaming and diet culture can be complex issues. 'It's not just about the number on the scale, it's about overall health and well-being,' Gollup said. 'We need to focus on promoting healthy habits and self-acceptance rather than weight loss.'

**Global Obesity Crisis: A Devastating Epidemic**
According to the World Obesity Atlas 2025, approximately 3 billion adults will live with obesity or overweight by 2030, representing about 50% of the global adult population. This increase is not only a health problem but also an economic and social challenge that threatens to collapse healthcare systems and affect global productivity. The countries most affected by obesity in adults are Samoa American (with a projection of up to 77%), Nauru and Tokelau (both with a 72% rate), followed by the United States (44%), Mexico (30%), and Spain (15%). The data can be explained by a combination of factors, including unhealthy diets, limited access to fresh and healthy foods, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles. As the obesity crisis expands, so do its consequences in public health, with 1.6 million premature deaths related to high body mass index (BMI), equivalent to 15% of all premature deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The report also highlights the growing trend of childhood obesity, with alarming rates: 19.7% of children and adolescents in the United States, 30% in Mexico, and 18.6% in Spain. The economic cost of this pathology is estimated to be between 3% and 4% of the global GDP annually, if significant measures are not taken. The report emphasizes the need for immediate action, including policies to regulate the advertising of ultra-processed foods to children, promote urban environments that encourage physical activity, and incentivize access to healthy foods at affordable prices. Additionally, healthcare professionals need to receive the necessary training to offer evidence-based and comprehensive treatment. 'Soluciones ya!' (Solutions now!) is the call to action, as the evidence presented in the Atlas reinforces the need for structural change in how healthcare systems and governments address obesity.

**2025's Most Overweight and Obese Cities in the U.S.**
According to a study by WalletHub, nearly 42 percent of U.S. adults are classified as obese, with some areas of the country struggling more than others. The study compared 100 of the most populated U.S. metro areas across 19 key indicators tied to weight problems, including physically inactive adults, projected obesity rates by 2030, and access to healthy foods. The findings highlight the need for collective action to address the obesity epidemic, which is costing an estimated $190.2 billion annually in medical treatments and $4.3 billion in productivity losses due to work absenteeism. As one expert notes, 'change must happen not just individually but collectively.'

**60% of adults will be overweight by 2050; experts reveal 4 ways to reverse this trend**
A study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) analyzed data from 204 countries and found that the number of overweight and obese people has increased from 929 million in 1990 to 2.6 billion in 2021. If current trends continue, by 2050, 3.8 billion adults (around 60% of the world's adult population) will be carrying excess weight. The study highlights several factors contributing to this trend, including a predicted 121% increase in obesity among children and adolescents. However, co-author Jessica Kerr emphasizes that 'Much stronger political commitment is needed to transform diets within sustainable global food systems.' Key strategies include policy shifts and individual commitment to pave the way for a healthier future.

**One in three children could be overweight by 2050: a study sounds the alarm**
A study published in The Lancet warns that nearly 60% of adults and one-third of children and adolescents will be overweight or obese by 2050 if governments do not take immediate action. The study, which includes data from 204 countries and territories, estimates that the number of people affected by obesity and overweight has tripled among adults over 25 years, from 731 million to 2.11 billion, and more than doubled among children and adolescents aged 5-24, from 198 million to 493 million. 'Without urgent policy reforms and concrete actions, 60% of adults, or 3.8 billion people, and nearly a third (31%) of children and adolescents, or 746 million, will be overweight or obese by 2050,' the study warns. To address 'one of the greatest health challenges of the 21st century,' the authors recommend adopting five-year action plans (2025-2030) with key measures such as regulating the advertising of ultra-processed foods, integrating sports infrastructure and playgrounds into schools, encouraging breastfeeding and balanced diets from pregnancy, and developing nutrition policies tailored to each country. 'In 2050, one in three young people suffering from obesity, or 130 million, will live in two regions: North Africa and the Middle East, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean, with severe health, economic, and social consequences,' the authors note.

**More than half of adults will be obese or overweight by 2050, study finds**
A new study published in The Lancet warns that more than half of adults and almost a third of children and young people will be obese or overweight by 2050, representing over 3.8 billion adults and 746 million children and adolescents. The researchers attribute this to a 'monumental societal failure' to tackle the problem, which has already more than doubled over the past three decades, affecting over 2.1 billion adults and 493 million young people. The study's lead author, Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, stated, 'The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental social failure.' The researchers emphasize the need for governments to focus on improving access to healthy diets, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where health systems are struggling to cope with the coming disease burden. According to the World Obesity Atlas, 79% of adults and 88% of children with obesity and overweight will be living in low- and middle-income countries by 2035, highlighting the urgent need for action.

**1.13 Billion Adults to be Affected by Obesity by 2030, Warns World Obesity Federation**
According to a report by the World Obesity Federation, 1.13 billion adults worldwide will be affected by obesity by 2030, representing 50% of the total population. This is up from 2 billion (40%) in 2015 and 1.6 billion (36%) in 2010. The report also highlights that the Samoa American is the country with the highest percentage of adults with obesity (77%), while Vietnam has the lowest (2%). The president of the World Obesity Federation, Sim칩n Barquera, stated, 'It is clear that obesity is on the rise and it is also clear that many countries are not prepared to face what is a growing problem for populations.' Barquera emphasized that obesity is a 'serious disease in its own right' and a 'driver' for non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and stroke. He also noted that 'more people die from obesity than in traffic accidents each year.' The report recommends five key policies to combat obesity, including taxes on sugary drinks, taxes on high-fat, high-sugar, and high-salt foods, subsidies for healthier foods, restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy foods to children, and taxes and incentives to promote physical activity.

**THE LANCET: More than half of adults and a third of children and adolescents predicted to have overweight or obesity by 2050**
According to a new analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study BMI Collaborators, published in The Lancet, over half the world's adult population (3.8 billion) and a third of all children and adolescents (746 million) are forecast to be living with overweight or obesity by 2050. The study predicts a substantial (121%) rise in obesity among young people globally, with the total number of children and adolescents with obesity predicted to reach 360 million by 2050. The study estimates that the global prevalence of overweight and obesity in young people rose substantially between 1990 and 2021, doubling in both children and younger adolescents (from 8.8% to 18.1%) and older adolescents (from 9.9% to 20.3%), affecting 493 million young people in 2021. The authors stress that 5-year action plans (2025-2030) are urgently required to curb the rise in obesity and help inform new goals and targets for the post-2030 Sustainable Development Goal-era. 'Preventing obesity must be at the forefront of policies in low- and middle-income countries,' said Dr Kerr. 'Policy action in these regions must balance the challenges of overnutrition with undernutrition and stunting, with interventions ranging from support for nutritional diets and regulating ultra-processed foods to promoting maternal and child health programmes that encourage pregnant women to follow a healthy diet and breastfeed.'
