**Inside The Collapse Of Yale Entertainment: Creditors Out Over $50 Million Following Failed Attempt At Restructuring**
Yale Entertainment, a film production company, has filed for bankruptcy with over $50 million in debts. The company's co-founders, Jordan Beckerman and Jordan Yale Levine, admitted to creditors that they had no operating cash flow, no capacity to service debts, and no viable path forward without an immediate infusion of outside capital. The company's financial struggles were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, industry-wide strikes, and a changing marketplace for independent films. Creditors were asked to invest an additional 10% of their existing principal in exchange for a 20% return and priority repayment, but the restructuring plan was not viable. The company's bankruptcy has left many investors and creditors out of pocket, with some alleging financial mismanagement and deceptive fundraising practices. Beckerman and Levine have denied these allegations, stating that they had every intention of honoring corporate guarantees and that the bankruptcy was a last resort. The situation has raised concerns about the financial risks of investing in independent film companies and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the industry.

**129-Year-Old Paper Giant to Cease Operations, Leaving Hundreds Jobless**
Kabel Premium Pulp & Paper GmbH (KPPP), a leading paper producer in Germany, announced that it will cease all operations by June 1, 2025. According to Artı49, the company's closure in Hagen, where it has been producing for 129 years, will result in 426 workers losing their jobs. KPPP, which filed for bankruptcy in March 2025, had significantly reduced its production capacity and transferred most of its employees to a short-time work program during this period. Prof. Dr. Peter Neu, who is overseeing the company's bankruptcy process, stated that various solutions were sought to keep the company afloat, but no investor could be found who would both preserve the traditional structure and maintain the current employment. The closure of KPPP highlights the structural problems that have been plaguing the German paper industry for a long time. The decline in demand for paper due to the rapid digitalization and the increase in energy costs are severely affecting the sector's competitiveness.

**China's Electric Vehicle Market in Crisis: 'We Will All Go Bankrupt'**
The strong competition in the electric vehicle market in China has led to a price war that is affecting small and medium-sized enterprises in the country. China is the leader in electric vehicle sales, ahead of other countries in the region and even the United States. The Chinese multinational BYD has been a reference in the sector and has been able to compete with Tesla this year, with sales of 4.27 million vehicles in 2024, a 30% increase from the previous year. However, the president of Great Wall Motor, Wei Jianjun, expressed concern about the future of the industry. 'If things continue like this, we will all go bankrupt by the end of the year,' he said. The situation also affects suppliers. The government's support has allowed Chinese manufacturers to reduce prices and gain market share both domestically and internationally. However, this strategy has only benefited large companies, allowing them to capture a larger market share. This situation can lead to the closure of many other companies that have not been able to cope with this strategy if the current situation continues.

**Aroma Begins Laying Off Workers Amid Financial Difficulties**
Aroma, a leading juice producer in Turkey, has begun laying off workers at its Bursa factory due to financial difficulties. The company had previously filed for a Konkordato, a type of bankruptcy protection, in December 2024. According to Elif Özge Yalçın of Cumhuriyet, some workers were laid off 'without notice' while others are facing the threat of being fired. This comes as 250 workers who refused to sign a collective labor agreement are on strike. İbrahim Gül, a worker who was laid off without notice, criticized the Konkordato administration and the Tekgıda-İş Sendikası union on social media, saying 'it was a great day' for the company's management, but 'a bad day' for the workers. The economic fluctuations have affected many large companies, making it difficult for them to access cheap financing. Aroma's financial difficulties have led to the company being placed under a one-year moratorium by the court.

**Bryansk Meat Processing Plant on the Brink of Bankruptcy**
The director of the bankrupted 'Tsar-Meat' meat processing plant in Bryansk, Muhhtar Badyrhanov, has filed for personal bankruptcy and is trying to liquidate the company's assets. The plant's second owner, AO 'New Height', has offered a unprecedented settlement agreement to Badyrhanov, which would cancel his 2.5 billion ruble debt in exchange for his resignation as director and transfer of his 49.5% stake in the company. However, Badyrhanov has refused the offer. As a result, the plant is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the second owner warns that this will lead to the loss of over 1,000 jobs, financial losses for the region, and reputational damage for the ruling party. The plant's production capacity allows it to produce over 500 tons of sausage products, 80 tons of semi-finished products, and tens of thousands of meat cans per month. The plant was once a significant taxpayer in the region, but now it is in a poor state, with tax payments decreasing from 84 million rubles in 2018 to 59 million rubles in 2023. Badyrhanov's official monthly income has also decreased from 546,000 rubles in 2021 to 56,000 rubles in 2024. 'The procedure of personal bankruptcy will delay the removal of the director from managing the company's finances, which will have a disastrous effect on the company's state,' said a representative of 'New Height'. If the company goes bankrupt, it will be a clear financial collapse, with the possibility of stopping production and laying off employees, as well as the impossibility of attracting investments.'

**Bryansk Meat Processing Plant on the Verge of Bankruptcy**
The largest meat processing plant in Bryansk, OOO 'Bryansk Meat Processing Plant' (BMPP), is on the verge of bankruptcy due to the actions of its owner, Muhhtar Badyrkhanov. The plant's new owner, AO 'New Height', has accused Badyrkhanov of attempting to declare bankruptcy to avoid paying off debts of 2.7 billion rubles. According to Oleg Sheykin, a representative of the new owner, Badyrkhanov has been trying to bankrupt the plant for over a year, but there are no real grounds for bankruptcy. The financial situation at the plant is worse than at similar enterprises in the industry, but it can be saved with investments promised by the new owner. 'New Height' is willing to invest 500-1 billion rubles in the plant's renovation and equipment, as well as increase employee salaries by 30-40%. Sheykin believes that Badyrkhanov's actions are driven by his ambition and a desire to control the plant's finances for as long as possible. The plant's production capacity allows it to produce over 500 tons of sausage products, 80 tons of semi-finished products, and tens of thousands of meat cans per month. In the past, the plant was one of the most financially significant in the region, but its financial situation has deteriorated significantly. According to independent experts, the plant's financial situation is worse than that of similar enterprises in the industry. 'New Height' has offered Badyrkhanov a settlement agreement, but he has refused, citing no counter-proposals. Sheykin believes that Badyrkhanov's behavior is a 'typical example of abuse of power' and that a civilized court would reject his claim for fictitious bankruptcy.

**China’s murky bankruptcies expose hazards for foreign investors - The Business Times**
A Chinese pork producer, Dalian Chuming Meat Processing, filed for bankruptcy in 2021, but its investors, including US-based Energroup Holdings, were surprised to learn that the company was still operating almost four months after the court declared its liquidation complete. The company's assets were auctioned off and debt repaid, but investors claim that Chuming violated Chinese regulations by failing to obtain shareholder consent for the bankruptcy, refusing to allow shareholders to examine its accounts, and continuing to operate after liquidation. Shareholders, including Alan Hill, who lost US$100,000, say they have not been able to obtain any redress through Chinese courts. The case highlights the potential misuse of China's bankruptcy process and the heightened risks it poses for investors as insolvencies rise during the country's economic downturn. Chinese courts handled some 30,000 bankruptcy cases last year, up from 10,132 in 2020, and lawyers say that malicious bankruptcy filings have increased as China's economy has slowed. 'I feel cheated,' Hill said. 'I would have liked to have that money to pass on to my children.'

**China's murky bankruptcies expose hazards for foreign investors**
China's bankruptcy laws are being criticized for being opaque and vulnerable to malicious filings, leaving foreign investors at risk. The case of Chuming Meat Processing, a Chinese pork producer, highlights the issues. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2019, but continued to operate and even passed a health and safety inspection in 2024. Shareholders, including Alan Hill, who invested $100,000 in the company, claim that Chuming violated Chinese regulations by failing to obtain shareholder consent for the bankruptcy and continuing to operate after liquidation. Hill said, 'I feel cheated. I would have liked to have that money to pass on to my children.' Lawyers and investors have expressed concern about the potential misuse of China's bankruptcy process and the heightened risks it poses for investors as insolvencies rise during the country's economic downturn. Chinese courts handled some 30,000 bankruptcy cases last year, up from 10,132 in 2020. 'Now, you could say there are a lot' compared with a couple of years ago, said Zhu Xinpeng, a lawyer at Shanghai Rongying Law Firm. The Chinese government has been criticized for not doing enough to protect private companies from malicious bankruptcies.

**The Worst Deal Ever: Eric Baker's $4 Billion Mistake**
Eric Baker, co-founder of StubHub, bought the company back for $4 billion in 2020, just four weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, causing a significant decline in ticket sales. Baker's company, Viagogo, was also affected by the pandemic, with analysts estimating that at least 90% of its revenue was lost. Baker's deal to buy back StubHub is considered one of the worst deals in history. Baker's background is impressive, having attended Harvard and Stanford, and working at McKinsey and Bain Capital. However, his decision to buy back StubHub was seen as a mistake, as the company's revenue plummeted due to the pandemic. Baker's company, Viagogo, was also criticized for its high ticket prices and hidden fees. The article concludes that Baker's deal to buy back StubHub was a costly mistake, and that the future for his company looks bleak. 'It's indeed unfortunate to invest $4 billion in a company just four weeks before the shutdown of the entire sector,' said Eric Fuller, a consultant and expert in the ticketing market. 'I think StubHub will soon have to file for bankruptcy if they don't get rescue packages quickly.' (StubHub declined to comment; a company spokesperson said in April that the company is not bankrupt.)
