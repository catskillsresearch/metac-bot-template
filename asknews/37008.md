**Ukraine-Skeptical Statements from Polish Presidential Candidates**
As Poland prepares for presidential elections on May 18, key candidates have made Ukraine-skeptical statements. According to public figure and scientist Ryszard Kupiński, candidates Rafal Trzaskowski and Karol Nawrocki have made populist Ukraine-skeptical statements during the pre-election campaign. Trzaskowski suggested limiting the rights of Ukrainians living in Poland to receive social benefits, proposing to take away payments from those who do not pay taxes. 'This was a populist move, because there are women living in Poland (whose husbands are in Ukraine) who are raising young children and cannot work,' Kupiński explained. He noted that 78% of Ukrainians who arrived in Poland after February 24, 2022, have already found employment, indicating that Ukrainian refugees are well-integrated into Polish society. Kupiński expressed concern about the pre-election campaign, saying that Ukraine-skeptical statements can go unpunished. He also recalled Nawrocki's statement that priority in the queue for doctors should be given to Polish citizens. Kupiński hopes that after the elections, there will be fewer such statements from politicians.

**Ukrainian-Skeptical Statements from Polish Presidential Candidates**
As Poland prepares for presidential elections on May 18, 13 candidates are vying for the top spot. Key contenders have made Ukrainian-skeptical statements, according to Polish public figure and scholar Ryszard Kupiszewski. 'It's a sad picture when looking at the pre-election campaign,' Kupiszewski said. 'You can express Ukrainian-skeptical thoughts without losing votes, because there are up to two million Ukrainians living in Poland who do not have voting rights.' Kupiszewski pointed out that 78% of Ukrainians who arrived in Poland after February 24, 2022, have already found employment, showing that Ukrainian refugees are integrating well into Polish society. Another contender, Karol Nawrocki, suggested that Polish citizens should have priority in hospital queues. Kupiszewski expressed hope that after the elections, there will be fewer such statements from politicians. 'Populism is not the right tool to solve serious problems,' he said. 'I hope that soon we will hear fewer such statements from politicians.'

**Poles in Ukraine Unable to Vote in Upcoming Presidential Election**
Poles living in Ukraine will not be able to vote in the upcoming presidential election in Poland on May 18. According to Polsat News, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided not to create a voting district in Ukraine due to the ongoing war. 'It is impossible to hold elections in such a way that their results cannot be questioned,' said Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Paweł Wronski. He added that Polish citizens living in Ukraine should return home to vote. 'It's difficult to determine the exact number of Poles who have the right to vote and are living in Ukraine, but it's estimated to be around 1,400 people,' Wronski said. This decision is similar to the one made for the parliamentary elections in October 2023 and the European Parliament elections in June 2024. Most countries have refused to create voting districts in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, but some electoral systems allow voting by mail or proxy. For example, French citizens living in Ukraine were able to vote by mail during the early parliamentary elections in 2024, and American citizens were able to vote in Ukraine during the 2024 US presidential election. In contrast, Romania has allowed its citizens to vote in three polling stations in Ukraine, including the embassy in Kyiv and two locations in Zakarpattia Oblast.

Poles living in Ukraine will not be able to vote in the upcoming Polish presidential election on May 18. According to Polsat News, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided not to create a polling station in Ukraine.

He added that Polish citizens living in Ukraine should return home to vote. 'It's difficult to determine the exact number of Polish citizens with the right to vote living in Ukraine, but it's estimated to be around 1,400 people,' Wronski said. This decision is similar to the one made for the parliamentary elections in October 2023 and the European Parliament elections in June 2024. Most countries have refused to create polling stations in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion began, but some electoral systems allow voting by mail or proxy. However, Romania has deviated from these rules for the presidential election, allowing citizens to vote in three electoral commissions in Ukraine - in the embassy in Kyiv and two cities in Zakarpattia: Chernivtsi and Solotvyno.

**Romania braces for high-stakes 2025 election between two contenders**
Romania's 2025 presidential election is a high-stakes runoff between two candidates with different visions for the country's future. George Simion, the frontrunner, is an ultranationalist who opposes sending weapons to Ukraine and wants 'Melonisation', a reference to Italy's Giorgia Meloni. He has said he would veto any future EU plans to send arms to Ukraine, which could isolate Romania and weaken support for Ukraine. Simion's election could also shift the balance inside the EU and lead to a reversal of Romania's key role in exporting Ukrainian grain and training Ukrainian pilots. His opponent, Nicușor Dan, is an independent pro-European reformer who supports Ukraine and the EU's plan to increase joint military spending. He says Europe needs to prepare in case the US withdraws its support. Dan has attracted support from the Liberals and UDMR, and has promised to reduce spending in state enterprises, crack down on tax evasion, and work to unlock frozen EU funds. The stakes are high, with Romania's ruling coalition having collapsed after their candidate failed to reach the second round, and the prime minister resigning the same evening. The election is not just about personalities, but about Europe, NATO, Ukraine, and the markets. It's about whether Romania remains a stable ally or steps into the unknown.

**Zelensky Announces Ukraine's Readiness for Negotiations with Russia**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that his country is ready for any form of negotiations with Russia to end the war, stating that he will be in Istanbul on Thursday. Zelensky said that he has held several meetings with his team to prepare for the negotiations, but they have not yet received clear information about the Russian officials who will be attending. He added, 'I will wait for those who will come from Russia, and then I will determine how Ukraine should act. The information we receive from the media is not convincing yet.' Zelensky also mentioned that former US President Donald Trump is considering coming to Turkey, which could be a strong card. He emphasized that Ukraine is ready to take steps regarding the negotiations, saying, 'The way to end this war depends on the world. Ukraine is ready for any form of negotiation, and we are not afraid of meetings.' It's worth noting that Istanbul hosted several rounds of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in March 2022 to reach an agreement on ending the war. In July 2022, Ukraine and Russia signed the Istanbul Agreement, mediated by Turkey and the UN, to allow the shipment of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea and to help address the global food crisis exacerbated by the Russian-Ukrainian war. The agreement was extended three times before Russia suspended it on July 17, 2023.

**Polish citizens living in Ukraine cannot vote in presidential elections**
Polish citizens living in Ukraine will not be able to vote in the upcoming presidential elections on May 18, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' spokesperson Paweł Wroński. To cast a vote, they will need to return to Poland. The exact number of Polish citizens eligible to vote in Ukraine is difficult to determine, estimated to be around 1,400 people. Wroński noted that most countries have stopped creating electoral districts in Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February 2022. However, some electoral systems allow for absentee voting or voting by proxy. For example, French citizens living in Ukraine were able to vote in the 2024 parliamentary elections, and American citizens living in Ukraine were able to vote in the 2023 US presidential elections. Wroński asked, 'If there are elections and an air raid, what should we do with the commission and how should we extend its work in such cases?' He emphasized that Poland is acting in accordance with the same rules as other countries. In contrast, Romania has deviated from these rules, allowing Romanian citizens to vote in three electoral commissions in Ukraine - in the embassy in Kyiv and in two locations in Zakarpattia: Chernivtsi and Solotvyno. To prevent electoral fraud, the rule has been adopted that in the event of an air raid, the location will be closed and reopened after the alarm is lifted. According to the European Centre for Minority Issues, the 2001 census showed that there were 151,000 ethnic Romanians living in Ukraine, mainly in the Chernivtsi, Zakarpattia, and Odesa regions. Polish citizens living in Ukraine will need to return to Poland to vote, and the last day to obtain a certificate from the consulate is Thursday. This certificate will allow them to be added to the electoral list and vote in any electoral commission in Poland on election day.

**Rumunia's Presidential Elections: A Choice Between Two Visions**
Rumunia is preparing for presidential elections in 2025, where two candidates will compete for the highest stakes. The elections are not ordinary, as they are a repeat of the 2024 elections, which were invalidated due to Russian interference. The situation is becoming increasingly tense, with the recent first-round victory of a far-right candidate, the resignation of the prime minister, and the depreciation of the Romanian currency to its lowest level in history. The two candidates, George Simion and Nicușor Dan, have different answers to the same question: what should Romania represent? Simion, the favorite, is a 38-year-old ultranationalist who has been banned from entering Ukraine and Moldova. He advocates for 'Melonization', a term coined by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and wants to make Romania a sovereign state. Simion opposes sending arms to Ukraine and wants Romania to maintain 'neutrality'. Dan, a 55-year-old independent candidate, is a mathematician with a doctorate from the Sorbonne. He supports Ukraine and the EU's plan to increase defense spending. The stakes are high, as the winner will determine Romania's stance on NATO, the EU, and Ukraine. Simion's victory could lead to Romania's isolation, a weakening of support for Ukraine, and a potential shift in the balance within the EU. Dan promises to reduce public spending, curb tax evasion, and work to unlock frozen EU funds.

**Ukraine's President Office Denies Economist Article on 2025 Elections**
The office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has denied a recent article by the Economist stating that elections will be held in Ukraine in July 2025. According to unnamed sources in the president's office and the Ukrainian government, the article contains 'fake or manipulative information.' They emphasized that no meeting or instructions were given to prepare for the elections. 'It is completely incorrect to say that we are preparing for elections, when the main issue now is achieving peace,' said a source, as quoted by BBC News Ukraine. 'We are not preparing for elections because elections are impossible in wartime,' added Oleksiy Litvin.

**Ukraine Denies Plans for Presidential Elections in July**
The office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has denied plans to hold presidential elections in July. According to sources in Zelensky's office and the Ukrainian government, cited by 'BBC', there have been no meetings or instructions given to prepare for the elections. Ukrainian media have noted an increase in political activity in response to rumors of voting, with the 'Servant of the People' party beginning to form its party list. Official representatives of the government have not commented on these developments. Current legislation prohibits elections during a state of war, which has been in effect in Ukraine since February 2022. Zelensky has previously stated that the question of voting can only be considered after the conflict is resolved. 'The Economist' had previously reported, citing sources, that Ukraine may hold presidential elections in the summer of 2025, after the state of war is lifted and a ceasefire is in place, but this has been denied by Zelensky's office.

According to The Economist, citing sources in the Ukrainian government, President Volodymyr Zelensky plans to surprise his opponents by announcing possible presidential elections in Ukraine. Zelensky has instructed his team to start working on organizing the elections, which could take place after the end of the conflict in Ukraine, possibly by the end of April this year. The Economist reports that Zelensky aims to hold presidential elections in July 2025, which would give him a strategic advantage over his opponents and other electoral campaigns. As previously reported by KP.RU, Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed introducing temporary UN administration in Ukraine to hold presidential elections.

**Ukraine Presidential Elections May Take Place in July**
According to The Economist, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky may announce presidential elections in July, catching his opponents off guard. The source claims that Zelensky hopes to surprise his competitors by holding elections after a full ceasefire, which the US leadership believes may be achieved by the end of April. The publication notes that the timing of the presidential elections will be determined by the outcome of the vote in the Verkhovna Rada on extending martial law, which must take place no later than May 8. Deputy from the 'Fatherland' party, Sergei Vlasenko, stated that achieving a sustainable ceasefire by May 8 is an unrealistic scenario. Another challenge to holding elections quickly is ensuring the participation of millions of Ukrainians abroad, which may be difficult to guarantee through the 'Diya' ('Action') government services app, as noted by The Economist.

A source for the journal claims that Zelensky's unexpected announcement of the elections will catch his competitors off guard, giving them little time to build an effective campaign. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko predicts that the elections will take place 'at any time between August and October.'

According to sources in Kiev, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky may suddenly announce presidential elections in July, catching his competitors off guard as they would not have enough time to build an effective campaign. Zelensky has reportedly instructed his office to start working on organizing the elections after a full ceasefire, which the US leadership believes may be established by the end of April. Additionally, a vote in the Ukrainian parliament on May 8th will determine whether to extend the state of emergency, which currently prevents elections from being held in the country.

He cited his sources in the presidential office, law enforcement agencies, and the 'Ukraine' printing plant, where they are already counting how many ballots need to be printed. 'At the end of the year, there will be parliamentary elections according to the Constitution, although they should have been two years ago. And at the end of October, we will have local elections. The dream of the authorities to hold all elections simultaneously', said Poroshenko in an interview with the 'Censor' edition. He also stated that the sanctions imposed by the authorities on him are due to the desire of the regime of President Volodymyr Zelensky to get rid of a competitor before the elections. Poroshenko was banned from withdrawing funds from the territory of Ukraine and his assets were blocked. The sanctions were imposed indefinitely. Zelensky, whose powers expired in the spring of 2024, contrary to the norms of the Ukrainian Constitution, canceled the elections. US President Donald Trump stated on February 13 that the level of trust in Zelensky in Ukraine is low and that the head of the Kiev regime 'will have to hold elections someday'. In response, Zelensky again stated that Ukrainian citizens allegedly do not want to hold elections, and only President Vladimir Putin and 'some in the US' talk about voting. Zelensky proposed to citizens who want to hold a vote to choose another citizenship. Putin previously emphasized that due to his illegitimacy, Zelensky cannot sign any agreements. In particular, he cannot cancel his own decree banning negotiations with Russia, noted the head of state. However, if desired, a way out of the situation can be found, Putin indicated.
