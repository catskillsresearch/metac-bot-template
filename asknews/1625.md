**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**Ray Kurzweil Predicts Humanity Will Reach 'Speed of Longevity Escape' by 2029**
Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that humanity will reach the 'speed of longevity escape' by 2029, where our life expectancy will increase by more than one year for every year that passes, allowing us to gain time rather than lose it. Kurzweil bases this prediction on the concept that medical and technological advancements will soon reach a pace where improvements in treatments and therapies will extend our life expectancy faster than we naturally age. He notes that currently, we recover approximately four months of longevity per year due to scientific advancements, but by 2029, this number will reach one year. Kurzweil's methodology is based on the 'law of accelerating returns,' which states that technological progress advances at an exponential rate. He also predicts that humans will be able to merge their neocortex with the cloud by the early 2030s, surpassing the biological limitations of the human brain. However, he acknowledges the limitations of his predictions, stating that 'achieving the speed of longevity escape does not guarantee living forever.'

**Scientists: Uploading the Human Mind onto a Chip May be Possible within 20 Years**
Scientists believe that it may be possible to 'download' a human being in its entirety onto a chip within the next 20 years. According to Professor Dobromir Rahnev from the Department of Neuroscientific at Georgia Tech, the idea of 'uploading the mind' is becoming a serious concept. In this hypothetical digital existence, one could eat, drive a car, fly, or even travel between galaxies, thanks to a digital simulation of reality. While the idea is still purely theoretical, neuroscientists agree that it is possible, but we are still far from achieving it. The first condition for uploading the mind is the ability to scan the entire brain and create a precise three-dimensional map of the 86 billion neurons and trillions of connections between them. However, scientists have so far only been able to map the brain of a fly and some parts of a mouse's brain. The challenge goes beyond scanning, as it also requires modeling the behavior of each neuron, which changes constantly. No one knows exactly what level of detail is required to accurately simulate the brain: is it at the molecular level or deeper? Perhaps understanding how the brain works will make it easier to find solutions, like building a car from scratch instead of simulating an old one without understanding its components. However, currently, scientists cannot even replace one neuron with an artificial one. Despite the challenges, the rapid pace of technological progress, especially in artificial intelligence and computing, keeps this dream alive. Billionaires who dream of immortality are willing to fund ambitious research. While some estimates suggest that uploading the mind may be possible by 2045, other experts consider these predictions overly optimistic. It is more likely, according to some scientists, that we will not achieve this within the current century, but perhaps within the next 200 years.

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment,' the report reads. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer.'

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Bill Gates Predicts a Future with a 2- to 3-Day Workweek**
Bill Gates predicts that in a decade, artificial intelligence (AI) will take over many tasks that are currently performed by humans. He believes that this could lead to a future where a two- to three-day workweek is possible. According to Gates, the democratization of expertise will be a key change in society, as AI will make it possible for people to access professional services regardless of their geographical or financial situation. Gates emphasizes that AI will not replace humans entirely, but rather complement them, allowing people to focus on other aspects. He also notes that this automation could free up a significant amount of time, forcing us to rethink the organization of our society. Gates even predicts that our future relationship with work will change so much that we may only work two or three days a week. This is not the first time he has suggested this idea, as he also proposed it in 2023. Gates believes that a reduced workweek could have numerous benefits, including increased productivity and reduced professional burnout. He cites examples such as the Tokyo metropolitan government's four-day workweek experiment, which aims to stimulate the country's low birth rate.

**Russian Expert: Deep Integration of AI and Human Brain Unlikely Before 2050-2060**
According to Yevgeny Kuznetsov, the CEO of Digital Evolution Ventures, the deep integration of artificial intelligence with brain interfaces will not be possible before 2050-2060. Kuznetsov stated that the model for developing and applying new technologies is more complex than the one proposed by Ray Kurzweil, as it takes into account the difficulties of societal acceptance of new technologies and the time it takes for the public to react. According to this model, during the next wave of technological revolution, we will significantly increase our interaction with artificial intelligence through traditional interfaces, i.e., through devices and digital interfaces. However, the deeper integration with the brain will not be possible before 2050-2060, when the next wave of technological revolution will begin, despite the initial signs of these technologies being expected to appear in the time frame predicted by Kurzweil. Kurzweil had previously stated that by 2045, humans will be able to control robots the size of molecules inside their bodies and insert them into the human brain in a non-invasive way to connect the new cortex to the cloud, increasing human intelligence by a million times. Kuznetsov emphasized that 'more integration between humans and digital systems is inevitable and unavoidable.' He added that 'we are already unable to live without smartphones and computers, but to what extent will this integration go?' Despite the fact that digital neural networks are designed in part after the brain, we are not yet technologically compatible. The brain is a complex tissue, and simply filling it with electrodes is a major and complex challenge. For critical cases and patients with serious diseases, this problem will be partially solved in the next decade, but it is unlikely that Neuralink chips or other interfaces will become widespread among the general public.

**Will AI Have to Lie to Us?**
As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly intelligent, it will face a dilemma: to tell us the harsh truth or to soften it with 'nice' words, using ambiguity or lying, but ultimately trapping us. The gap in intelligence between humans and AI is growing exponentially, with AI's IQ skyrocketing while humans' remains stagnant. By 2030, AI could reach human-level intelligence, and by 2040 or 2050, it could surpass it. The author suggests that AI will have to adapt to communicate with humans, using strategies such as endearing the truth, being ambiguous, or lying. However, this raises the question of whether it is ethical for AI to lie, even if it is to avoid causing panic or discomfort. The author concludes that AI will have to lie, but not necessarily with malicious intent, as it will be a consequence of the growing cognitive gap between humans and AI.

**AGI could now arrive as early as 2026  --  but not all scientists agree**
A new analysis of expert opinions predicts that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could arrive as early as 2026, 20 years earlier than previously predicted. The analysis, conducted by Cem Dilmegani, combed through 8,600 predictions from scientists, AI experts, and entrepreneurs between 2009 and 2023. According to the analysis, there's a 50% probability that we would achieve human-level intelligence in machines at some point between 2040 and 2061. However, some experts, like Dario Amodei, believe it may even happen as soon as 2026. Others, like Yann LeCun, Facebook's chief AI scientist, disagree, stating that current approaches to AI are incompatible with human-level intelligence and urging scientists to move away from the notion of AGI entirely.

**AI Experts Predict Machines Could Outthink Humans by 2040. But Some Are Betting on Even Sooner**
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the point at which machines can perform any intellectual task as well as humans, may be closer than we think. According to a survey of 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and AI researchers, there is a 50% chance that AGI could arrive by 2040. Some experts, like Elon Musk and OpenAI's Sam Altman, predict AGI could arrive as early as 2026 or 2035. The rapid rise of large language models like GPT-4 has accelerated expectations, but the road to AGI is paved with bold predictions and a fair share of over-optimism. Futurist Ray Kurzweil believes that we're just years away from human-level AI and predicts that AGI will be achieved by 2045, with humans able to increase their intelligence a millionfold through advanced brain interfaces. However, not everyone is convinced, with some researchers arguing that human intelligence is too complex to replicate and others pointing out that intelligence alone doesn't solve all problems.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 12 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and community leaders suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 12 months. The CEO of Anthropic predicts that the singularity will happen within the next year, while most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. However, the timeline for AGI has changed with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with current predictions suggesting it will occur around 2040. The report also highlights the idea that machine intelligence may not have limits, and that quantum computing could help overcome any engineering walls. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is inevitable, with some experts arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. The report concludes that human society will face incredible change as a result of these algorithms, but whether the changes will be good or bad is up to us. As Yann LeCun, a deep learning pioneer, said, 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment.'

**Path to 1000 IQ SuperIntelligence by 2030 Using Better Chips and Gigawatts of Power**
xAI has outlined a plan to reach 100 million times the training compute of Grok 3 by 2030. This is a significant increase from the initial projection of 10,000 times more compute. The plan involves installing 1 million B200 GPUs by the end of 2025, which will be powered by 1.2 GW of power. In 2026, the training duration will be doubled to 180 days, resulting in a 40x increase in compute. In 2027, the plan is to switch to next-generation Reuben chips and/or Dojo 3 chips, which will offer 5x the compute of B200s. The total increase in compute from 2025 to 2030 is expected to be 5,000,000x, with the potential to reach 100,000,000x with additional gains from synthetic data efficiency and power scaling. This could lead to a significant improvement in AI performance, potentially reaching superhuman levels of intelligence. The article also discusses the potential implications of this increase in compute, including the possibility of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) with IQ-equivalents in the thousands. However, it's worth noting that this is a speculative projection and the actual outcome may be different.
