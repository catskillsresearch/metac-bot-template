**Balochistan Engages Religious Scholars To Promote ‘Family Planning’ Efforts - Daily Parliament Times**
The Balochistan government has launched a new initiative to promote family planning efforts by engaging 150 religious scholars across 31 districts. These scholars, designated as Family Planning Assistants, receive honorariums and Islamic literature emphasizing the Islamic legitimacy of responsible family planning, reproductive health, parental responsibility, and child welfare. Maulana Mula Dad, one of the scholars, says, 'We deliver our message through the lens of Islamic values – that every individual is entitled to a healthy life, proper education, and financial stability.' The initiative aims to promote healthier families and create a sustainable balance between population growth and available resources. The province's population has grown from 1.2 million in the early 1950s to 14.8 million in 2023, with an annual growth rate of 3.2%. If this trajectory persists, the population could double by 2045, placing unsustainable pressure on employment, housing, education, and healthcare services. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns that if growth remains above 2%, the province will require 6.5 million new employment opportunities, one million homes, and over 7,000 educational institutions by 2040.

Deputy Minister of Information and Culture Atilkulla Azizi addressed the gathering, saying, 'Recently, several biased media outlets spread false stories claiming that poetry meetings were canceled. However, we are now witnessing a colorful and culturally significant event in historic Kandahar. Isn't this a strong and worthy response to these unfounded accusations?' Azizi also confirmed Afghanistan's commitment to promoting poetry and literature, stating that the government does not aim to suppress literature, but rather supports poets and organizes poetry festivals. 'The Islamic Emirate does not aim to restrict or suppress literary expression. On the contrary, we actively work to support poets and organize more effective poetry festivals. In accordance with the directive of the Supreme Leader of Afghanistan, the Ministry of Information and Culture is authorized to annually evaluate the work of poets, their contribution to national literature, and award those who have made significant contributions,' Azizi emphasized.

**Race Against Time: Kabul's Groundwater May Run Dry by 2030**
According to a report by The Japan Times, Kabul's groundwater is at risk of running dry by 2030 due to population growth, climate change, and unregulated water extraction. Experts estimate that up to 80% of Kabul's groundwater is contaminated, and more than 100,000 unregulated wells extract water in the city, resulting in a 76-million-cubic-meter annual deficit. The Islamic Emirate's Ministry of Energy and Water has proposed a plan to transfer water from the Panjshir River, which would require a budget of $300 to $400 million. As The Japan Times notes, 'the situation in Kabul is clearly deteriorating' and urgent action is needed to address the water shortage.

**Islamic Emirate Faces Challenges in Domestic and Foreign Policy**
The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan faced significant challenges in 1403, including uncertainty over the constitution, the formation of a permanent cabinet, and gaining international recognition. Despite efforts to establish good relations with some countries, the international community emphasized its conditions for normalizing relations, including respect for human rights, an inclusive government, and the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking. Officials of the Islamic Emirate have stated that direct interactions with countries signify recognition, but the world insists on fundamental changes in the Islamic Emirate's policies. Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, said, 'It is the responsibility of the ruling authorities to show whether they want Afghanistan to reintegrate into the international system or not.' Vasily Nebenzia, Russia's permanent representative to the UN, emphasized the importance of forming a truly inclusive government. The caretaker government has rejected the world's demands, calling them interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs. The government has also called on world nations to lift sanctions against Islamic Emirate officials and release Afghanistan's frozen assets. Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Islamic Emirate, said, 'The issue of an inclusive government is an Afghan matter. Afghanistan will decide based on its national interests in every field.' Domestically, the drafting of a constitution remains uncertain, and the Ministry of Justice has been engaged in secondary laws. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned the issuance of arrest warrants for the leader of the Islamic Emirate and the Chief Justice of the Islamic Emirate, calling it unjust, biased, and politically motivated.
