**Toto Wolff: Second Place in Constructors' Championship is 'Irrelevant'**
Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff says that being in second place in the constructors' championship is 'irrelevant' to the team. According to Wolff, the current standings are just a snapshot and do not reflect the team's true performance. He notes that the difference between second and fourth place is only five points, with Red Bull in third place. Wolff emphasizes that the team's focus is on performing well in each individual race, understanding tire behavior, and developing the car for next year. He also mentions that the team's performance has been inconsistent, with a strong showing in hot weather but struggling in cooler temperatures. Wolff says that the team will evaluate their performance and make adjustments as needed. 'We will see how it goes in Barcelona and the following races,' he says. 'But definitely, it's not the performance we had before Miami.'

The Spanish Grand Prix of the Formula 1, corresponding to the 9th date of the 2025 calendar, will take place this weekend at the Barcelona circuit with the participation of the 20 drivers from the 10 teams, including Franco Colapinto, who will be driving an Alpine for the third time this season. The schedule has all instances planned for the afternoon in Europe, so in Argentina, due to the time difference (+5), it will be in the morning. Colapinto will face two practices on Friday and a third on Saturday, the day when the classification for the final on Sunday at 10 will take place. Each stage will be broadcast live on TV only through Fox Sports and on the Disney+ Premium digital platform. The sports channel can also be tuned in on Flow, DGO, and Telecentro Play. Colapinto had a good participation in the last GP in Monaco, finishing 13th, and has secured his best position in the season so far. He is still without points in the standings and shares the last place with Jack Doohan, his teammate, as well as Fernando Alonso (Aston Martin) and Gabriel Bortoleto (Sauber). The leader of the championship is Australian Oscar Piastri (McLaren) with 161 points, followed closely by his teammate Lando Norris with 158 points. Max Verstappen (Red Bull) is third with 136 points. In the constructors' table, McLaren is leading with 319 units, followed by Mercedes with 147 and Red Bull with 143.

**Franco Colapinto to Compete in Spanish Grand Prix**
Argentine driver Franco Colapinto will participate in the Spanish Grand Prix of the 2025 Formula 1 season, his third consecutive event, driving an Alpine car. Colapinto, who turned 22 on Tuesday, will face the first day of practices on Friday, followed by two more practices on Saturday, and the qualifying round on the same day at 10am. The event will be broadcast live on Fox Sports and Disney+ Premium. Last week, Colapinto had a positive performance in the Monaco Grand Prix, finishing 13th in the street circuit. This comes after a difficult weekend for the French team, Alpine, where Pierre Gasly crashed out of the race due to a loss of brakes and collided with Yuki Tsunoda. Colapinto, who started 18th after a poor qualifying performance, managed to gain two positions due to penalties against Lance Stroll and Oliver Bearman. He has yet to score points in the season, sharing the last place with Jack Doohan, his teammate, and Fernando Alonso and Gabriel Bortoleto. The current leader of the championship is Oscar Piastri with 161 points, followed by his teammate Lando Norris with 158 points. Max Verstappen is in third place with 136 points. In the constructors' table, McLaren is leading with 319 points, followed by Mercedes with 147 points and Red Bull with 143 points. Alpine is in ninth place with 7 points, all scored by Pierre Gasly.

**Formula 1: Tight Battle for the Top Between McLaren's Piastri and Norris**
The Formula 1 season continues with the upcoming Barcelona circuit in Spain, where McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the championship by just three points over his teammate Lando Norris. Norris, who won the championship in Monaco, will face a tough test in Barcelona to see if he can regain his lead in the championship. Red Bull is also a strong contender, as the circuit tends to favor high-speed curves, which suits their car. However, the introduction of a new FIA rule, which requires teams to modify their front winglets to withstand more aerodynamic load, may complicate things for some teams. Mercedes, who struggled in Monaco, hopes to improve in Barcelona and maintain their second place in the constructors' championship. With 66 laps to go on Sunday, the outcome is uncertain, but every change can make a difference in the championship. As James Vowles and Fred Vasseur, team principals of Williams and Ferrari, said, 'every change can represent the loss or gain of championships.'

Lando Norris, also a McLaren driver, took second place, while George Russell of Mercedes completed the podium in third place. On the other hand, Charles Leclerc and Pierre Gasly, who finished fifth and 16th respectively, were disqualified after it was found that their cars were 1 kilogram under the minimum weight limit at the end of the race. Lewis Hamilton, who had won the Sprint race on Saturday and finished sixth in the main race, was also disqualified due to a block protector on his car being below the minimum allowed thickness. 'It's a shame for the team and for me,' Hamilton said, 'but we'll learn from this and come back stronger.'
