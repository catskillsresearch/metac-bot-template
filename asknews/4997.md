**Emerging Markets Outperform Wall Street as Dollar Weakens**
Emerging markets have outperformed Wall Street over the past five months, with the MSCI Emerging Markets index rising by +7.6% compared to the S&P500's +0.5% and the Dow Jones's -4.2%. The growth is attributed to a decrease in commercial tensions and a weaker US dollar. According to UBS Global Research, a weaker dollar is crucial, as a decline of over -5% in the dollar has historically been correlated with a median outperformance of 11% of emerging market stocks compared to US stocks. However, UBS notes that much of the optimism has already been priced in, and further gains will require continued earnings growth and stable commercial dynamics. A resurgence of commercial tensions or weak earnings could weigh on macroeconomic fundamentals and slow the rally. Investors are increasingly looking to diversify outside the US, with UBS predicting a gradual shift towards a broader international equity exposure. However, this process is expected to develop over time. UBS maintains a neutral stance on emerging markets overall, but sees selective opportunities for active investors focused on fundamentals. The bank expects the central bank to start easing interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2025, provided fiscal conditions remain stable. Political developments will be a key factor in market performance in 2026. The MSCI Emerging Markets index has been trending upwards for about two years, with the first signs of rebalancing coming with the stable recovery of the 1,000-point level. A break above the 1,200-point area would project targets around 1,400/1,500 points.

**The perfect portfolio for a first-time investor | Trustnet**
Ben Seager-Scott, chief investment officer at Forvis Mazars, recommends a simple and well-balanced portfolio for first-time investors. He suggests a 60% allocation to global equities, 30% to bonds, and 10% to alternatives, specifically gold. This offers maximum diversification in the smallest number of funds possible. Seager-Scott emphasizes the importance of taking a long-term approach, ideally 10 years, and adjusting the portfolio as risk tolerance changes. He also recommends using broad index-based approaches in equities and bonds, such as the SPDR MSCI All Country World UCITS ETF and the iShares Core FTSE 100 UCITS ETF, to cover a wide range of markets and names. Additionally, he suggests allocating 20% to a global bond fund, such as the Vanguard Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF, and 10% to an inflation-linked bond fund, such as the Royal London Index Linked Bond fund, to mitigate the risk of inflation. Finally, he recommends a 10% allocation to iShares Physical Gold as a simple and effective alternative. 'If you are looking for true diversification, you need to cover as many names in your portfolio as possible. Broad index-based approaches are probably the best way of doing this in equities and bonds,' he said.

**Emerging Markets Dominate 14% of Global IPO Revenues in 2024**
Emerging markets have taken over 14% of global IPO revenues in 2024. Between 2020 and 2024, there were over 800 initial public offerings (IPOs) on emerging market exchanges, peaking at 218 listings in 2022 before dropping to 192 deals in 2024. The Middle East region raised $2.4 billion from 14 IPOs in the first quarter of 2025. According to a report by Magnit, a research firm, companies in the financial technology and integrated finance sectors are preparing for large funding rounds before going public. Frha Al-Nahlaoui, Director of Research at Magnit, said, 'Companies in the fintech sector have started collecting late-stage funding rounds exceeding $100 million, as part of structural and organizational preparations for public listings.' She added that the development of products in the capital markets, simplification of listing procedures, and competition among exchanges to attract promising companies, as well as the participation of sovereign markets, have all contributed to the momentum in IPOs. The Saudi market accounted for around 90% of IPOs in the Middle East and North Africa region in the first quarter of 2025, driving growth in sectors such as real estate, technology, and healthcare.

**Family Offices: Where Are They Investing?**
According to Terry Smith, 'There are two types of people when it comes to predicting stock market movements: those who can't and those who know they can't. It's safer and more profitable to be in the second group.' Family offices, which manage large family fortunes, are shifting their investments towards developed market equities, debt private, and fixed income from rich countries to diversify. A recent UBS report found that 53% of family office investment portfolios will be invested in North America this year, with a significant increase in Asia-Pacific investments over the next five years. The report also found that 64% of family offices worldwide rely on active management to improve portfolio diversification, and that technology is a growing area of interest, particularly in healthcare and electrification. The main risk concern for family offices over the next 12 months is the global trade war. 'I invest disciplinarily every month, I collect and invest in a row to benefit from the magic of compound interest,' says an investor. 'If you're suffering from heavy losses, don't get out, everything will turn around, but don't have a soft spot for these moments if you need to recover from big falls: you can't get off a Ferrari and expect to get back to the origin with a bike in the same time frame.'

**Artificial General Intelligence Market Opportunities in Diverse Applications from Cybersecurity to Healthcare with Regional Insights and Projections**
The global Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) market is valued at US$ 3.2 Bn in 2023 and is expected to reach US$ 26.9 Bn by 2031, with a CAGR of 31.3% during the forecast period of 2024-2031. The market is driven by advancements in AI and machine learning technologies, particularly in natural language processing and machine learning algorithms. However, the substantial financial investment required for AGI development remains a major challenge, limiting investment to well-capitalized organizations. The North American AGI market is projected to dominate revenue share, supported by proactive government initiatives aimed at accelerating AI adoption across various sectors. Recent developments include Meta's plan to develop AGI that would surpass human intelligence, using approximately 350,000 Nvidia AI chips by the end of 2024. The AGI market is segmented by offering, technology, deployment, processing, application, company size, end user, and business model.

**The Beginner's Roadmap to Investing in AGI**
InvestorPlace's Eric Fry believes that the imminent arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within the next 12 to 24 months will change everything for investors. He has developed a three-step process for finding companies that will survive and thrive on The Road to AGI. Fry suggests 'investing alongside AGI' by focusing on companies that provide key parts of the infrastructure that will accelerate AI technology toward AGI, such as AI chip companies, data centers, and industries that provide the physical infrastructure and building blocks of AGI facilities. He also emphasizes the importance of investing in non-tech companies that will adopt and apply AI to reap huge gains in efficiency, productivity, and profits. Fry believes that the stocks within these categories are the only ones to buy right now and has 41 different investment recommendations that have reached over 1,000% gains on his track record.

**The Beginner’s Roadmap to Investing in AGI**
Futurist Eric Fry believes that the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within the next 12 to 24 months will revolutionize the business world. He suggests that investors should focus on companies that are adapting to this seismic shift by investing in AI technologies. Fry proposes a three-step approach: investing 'in' AI, investing 'alongside' AI, and investing in 'stealth' AI. Companies that provide key infrastructure for AI, such as Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, are good investments. Additionally, companies that will benefit from the rise of AGI, such as data centers and companies that provide raw land for data centers, are also good investments. Furthermore, non-tech companies that will adopt and apply AI to increase efficiency and profits, such as companies in the biotech sector, are also good investment opportunities. Fry emphasizes that only companies that adapt quickly to this change will survive, and he has 41 investment recommendations that have reached over 1,000% gains on his track record.

**AGI kicks off 2025 with strong Q1 results**
Alliance Global Group Inc. (AGI) reported strong first quarter results, with a 66% year-on-year increase in net income to P11 billion. The growth was driven by robust contributions from its real estate, spirits manufacturing, and hospitality businesses. AGI president and CEO Kevin Tan said, 'AGI started the year with notably strong results in the first quarter even amidst domestic and global challenges.' He attributed the success to efficient cost management measures and prudent business practices. The company's property arm Megaworld registered a 16% year-on-year jump in attributable net income to P5.1 billion, while Emperador, the global brandy and whisky conglomerate, ended the quarter with a 7% growth in net income to P1.85 billion. Travellers International, AGI's leisure and tourism arm, posted a 42% growth in EBITDA to P2.1 billion. Tan expressed optimism for the balance of the year, saying, 'We have laid out exciting plans across our various business segments, ready to take advantage of the resilient consumer spending and a resurgence in global economic activity.'

**Deglobalization and International Investment Trends**
Dr. Rory Knight, chairman of Oxford Metrica and Jakota Capital AG, argues that the recent outperformance of international developed market (IDM) equities over U.S. equities may be a return to the form seen in the first decade of the millennium. He suggests that U.S. financial institutions have under-allocated to equities outside the United States, and that this strategy has paid off over the last 15 years. However, with the factors driving the differential performance between the U.S. and the IDMs having significantly changed, and the era of globalization coming to an abrupt halt, it is time for investors to reconsider their international portfolio policies. The benefits of international investing in the new world order include performance anomaly reversal, natural diversification, reduction in portfolio concentration, a wider alpha opportunity set, and current undervaluation in IDMs. Dr. Knight also examines how key geopolitical risk vectors, such as China-U.S. competition, are shaping investor confidence and outlook. He predicts macro-divergence, increased inflation, and a weaker dollar, all translating into greater equity market volatility. However, he believes that markets will look beyond the transitory impact of the structural changes being imposed by the new U.S. administration. Dr. Knight recommends that investors increase their allocations to IDMs from the current average levels of around 6 percent to around 15 percent, and proposes a highly focused approach that seeks out individual stocks in these markets, taking into consideration their growth opportunities and natural protection from inflation and currency risks.

**Making Good Investment Decisions for Sustainable Returns**
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has warned investors against Ponzi schemes, following the collapse of CBEX, a digital investment platform that promised 100% profit after 30 days. The SEC Director-General, Dr. Emomotimi Agama, said that the CAC registration and EFCC certificate are not enough to show that an investment firm has been registered in Nigeria. He advised investors to verify before investing in any scheme and to invest in legitimate opportunities such as the capital market, fixed deposits, and government bonds. The capital market has shown growth, with the stock market section of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) appreciating by N3.73 trillion in the first four months of 2025. Analysts attributed the growth to impressive 2024 performance by listed companies and the recovery of some companies in their first quarter ended March 31, 2025. The Managing Director of Globalview Capital Limited, Mr. Aruna Kebira, said that the stock market in the first four months of 2025 witnessed the tanking of inflation figures and CBN retaining interest rate at 27.50 per cent, making it a good investment destination. He also mentioned that the release of both the UFS and AFS of issuers into the market was another booster, as 80% cannot be classified as lacklustre. 'We saw the banking sector pushing their limits with relish and are happy doing so,' he said. Analysts at Cordros Research stated that, 'We believe the domestic equities market might respond positively to the MPC's decision to pause interest rate hikes as investors assess the likelihood of policy easing in the medium term.'

**Keys to a winning global portfolio in times of uncertainty**
The first months of 2025 are developing with a lot of uncertainty and volatility, with US President Donald Trump's changes in mood and policies not pleasing the market. Despite the good performance of the market over the past five years, with the global equity market having doubled its value, experts believe that this could be sustainable in the long term. Andrés Pedreño, responsible for sales in Iberia at Wellington Management, says that 'this could be sustainable in the long term. Confidence in the US is falling, and I think it could be a good time to diversify globally.' With the current macroeconomic conditions, there is a rotation towards non-US markets, and experts believe that a more global approach is needed to protect and adapt to changes. According to Samuel Álvarez, analyst at Orienta Wealth, 'it is convenient to diversify the risk of concentration in the US, especially with the 'Seven Magnificas'. Diversifying towards less popular sectors, such as small caps, emerging markets, and Europe, is a suitable strategy for this environment.' Experts believe that the global equity market offers a more consistent profile of returns and risks over the long term, and that it protects better in times of volatility. They also advise to reduce expectations of returns for the next years and focus on a long-term vision. Wellington Management has a unique investment approach, with no CIO or global head of investments, but rather a community of boutiques, where each team is independent in its strategy. One of these teams is the Global Quality Growth team, created 14 years ago and very recognized in Spain. They use a systematic and disciplined investment process to select high-quality companies with attractive growth potential, based on four pillars: growth, quality, return on capital, and potential revaluation. The result is a global portfolio, typically composed of between 60 and 90 companies, diversified by sectors and geographic regions, which, in their opinion, has the potential to outperform the MSCI AWCI, their reference index. Experts agree that after years of good results for passive management, now is the time to bet on active management. In a more volatile environment, a good manager can take advantage of additional opportunities that indices do not capture. They also warn that although recent returns have been high, it is prudent to reduce expectations of returns for the next years and focus on a long-term vision.
