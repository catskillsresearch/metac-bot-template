**Bitcoin (BTC) enters a new era of strategic assets: global trends in 2025 and the value of blockchain cloud mining**
Bitcoin (BTC) has become a strategic asset for global economies, with the United States establishing a 'Bitcoin Strategic Reserve' and other countries promoting the legalization of Bitcoin mining and green energy. This has led to a surge in demand for Bitcoin, with major financial institutions adjusting their asset allocation models and investors re-evaluating the value anchoring of Bitcoin. Cloud mining platforms like BlockchainCloudMining are benefiting from this trend, with users turning to compliant and safe cloud mining channels to participate. The platform uses distributed mining pool technology and advanced algorithms to optimize mining efficiency, making it easy for users to start BTC mining with minimal entry barriers. The platform's daily income is stable and transparent, and supports withdrawal to various mainstream wallets. BlockchainCloudMining has already taken the lead in deployment, with its Nordic and Central Asian cooperative mines based on renewable energy such as hydropower and wind power. The platform's profit model has entered the intelligent stage, using AI algorithms for computing power allocation and dynamic power regulation to maximize profits.

**Why stablecoin regulation might be the best thing for crypto**
The U.S. Senate is advancing the Genius Act, a landmark legislation that sets clear rules for stablecoins, aiming to bring stability and institutional trust to the crypto market. Analysts predict the stablecoin market could hit $2.5 trillion by 2030, up from $150 billion today. This regulation opens the door for traditional banks and finance giants to enter the stablecoin game, with full regulatory blessing. FOHLE, a wallet service, is already ahead of the curve, planning to integrate regulated coins in a compliant and user-friendly way, ensuring simplicity for users and compliance under the hood.

**Bitcoin's Global Impact: A Revolution in Finance**
Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, is revolutionizing global finance. In May 2025, its market value reached $2.2 trillion. Backed by blockchain, Bitcoin offers secure and decentralized transactions, attracting investors and governments. It has transformed the financial system with its blockchain technology, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs. In 2024, Chainalysis reported a 30% increase in crypto transactions in Latin America, while Sub-Saharan Africa showed notable growth in DeFi usage. Globally, it moved over $1.9 trillion in transactions in 2024, according to Fortune Business Insights. In the US, more than 150 institutions have exposure to Bitcoin, with $132.98 trillion in ETFs and $30 trillion in public company holdings, according to Crypto Times. This surge is due to favorable legislation and the approval of ETFs. Nigeria stands out in Africa, with nearly 50% of its population using cryptocurrencies to combat inflation, according to Chainalysis' 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index. El Salvador, a pioneer in Latin America, adopted Bitcoin as a legal currency in 2021, using the Lightning Network for remittances that represent 24% of its GDP. Bhutan uses hydroelectric energy to mine Bitcoin sustainably, accumulating significant reserves through Druk Holding and Investments. Countries like Argentina and the UAE are also advancing, driven by economic instability and clear regulations, respectively. Despite its success, Bitcoin faces challenges. Research by the United Nations University (2023) found that mining consumed 173.42 TWh of electricity between 2020 and 2021, equivalent to the consumption of countries like Pakistan. However, 60% of mining already uses renewable energy, according to Cambridge. Optimistic projections, such as those by Galaxy Digital, estimate that Bitcoin could reach $185,000 in 2025. Its global impact, with trillions in motion, solidifies it as a key player in future finance, although its success will depend on regulations and sustainability.

**How to Start Investing in Cryptocurrencies and How They Work**
Cryptocurrencies have experienced significant growth in recent times due to various factors, including government recognition as a legal currency. However, they have also faced setbacks, such as the recent 'cryptowinter' episode. Despite this, more people are investing in cryptocurrencies, seeking a 'safe' and 'reliable' option for short- and long-term investments, despite their extreme volatility. Investing in or buying cryptocurrencies is easier than it seems, as they are virtual currencies controlled by digital wallets or exchanges. The most popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, have shown significant price fluctuations in recent hours. To invest in cryptocurrencies, one can use online platforms, known as exchanges, which offer virtual wallets and mining services for a commission. Some popular exchanges include Binance and Coinbase. It is essential to note that cryptocurrencies are volatile and their value can change rapidly. In Mexico, the Banco de MÃ©xico has prohibited financial institutions from using or allowing operations with cryptocurrencies. In Peru, the Banco Central de Reserva has stated that it will not regulate the use of cryptocurrencies, citing their instability. In Colombia, over 500 sites accept cryptocurrency payments, and the country ranks 14th in cryptocurrency adoption. In El Salvador, the government has repealed the law that made Bitcoin a legal currency, citing concerns about its stability.

**Crypto fever**
The Pakistani government's enthusiasm for cryptocurrency adoption has created a disconnect between existing policies and recent plans unveiled by the Pakistan Crypto Council. The council aims to create a strategic reserve of cryptocurrency and allocate two gigawatts of electricity to AI and cryptocurrency businesses, but the State Bank does not recognize cryptocurrencies as legal tender. The government's efforts to mainstream cryptocurrency adoption are shrouded in confusion, and several questions have arisen, including how the government can use cryptocurrencies to create a strategic reserve and why it is allocating national resources to businesses that engage in technically illegal activities. The Pakistan Crypto Council has announced a high-level meeting on policy measures following public criticism of its disjointed strategy, but it must satisfy critics with coherent policies to support its plans.

**Gov. Ron DeSantis Signs Bill Recognizing Gold, Silver as Legal Tender in Florida**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a bill, HB 999, recognizing gold and silver as legal tender in the state. This makes Florida the 11th state to enact such laws, with several others considering similar measures. According to State Rep. Bill Bankson, the legislation aims to 'eliminate the tax burden and make it a functional means of transaction between willing parties.' DeSantis stated that 'outdated regulations and unnecessary sales taxes' have prevented many Floridians from entering the gold and silver markets for years. The law must still be ratified by the state legislature and would take effect on July 1, 2026, if approved.

**Trump Media and Technology Group to Raise $2.5 Billion for Bitcoin Treasury**
The Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has announced plans to raise $2.5 billion in debt to build a 'Bitcoin Treasury'. This move follows the example of US software company Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has used a combination of stock sales and convertible bonds to raise funds for its Bitcoin holdings. TMTG aims to follow a similar strategy, which minimizes the risk of default while allowing investors to profit from the volatility of the asset. Meanwhile, several US banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and US Bank, are exploring the development of a joint dollar stablecoin to compete with existing players like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). Additionally, the Dubai Land Department has launched a platform for tokenizing real estate, allowing investors to purchase fractional ownership rights in Dubai properties starting at $540. The project aims to digitize $16 billion worth of Dubai's real estate market by 2033. Furthermore, the Sui blockchain was hacked, resulting in a loss of $220 million, which was partially recovered through a vote by SUI stakeholders. The incident has sparked debate about the decentralization of the Sui network. Finally, traditional banks are now offering services for buying and storing cryptocurrencies, providing a more convenient and secure option for investors.

**Wall Street Closes a Bullish May, Awaiting Clarity on Tariffs**
Wall Street closed a very bullish May, awaiting clarity on tariffs. The monthly balance has been positive, but uncertainty has increased: no one knows for sure what is legal and what is not. The Section 232, Section 301, and Section 122 tariffs are complicating trade negotiations between the US and many countries. The uncertainty over the outcome of these tariff negotiations is causing concern about the high debt. The PCE index has improved its predictions, the deflator of consumption in April, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has confidence in the consumer, and expectations of inflation. Companies and other markets are also affected, with a possible impact of between 100 and 150 million dollars, affecting the West Texas Brent, euro, ounce of gold, and the yield of the 10-year American bond, as well as bitcoin.

**El Salvador Abandons Bitcoin as Legal Tender**
El Salvador has abandoned its plan to make Bitcoin a legal tender, following a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The country's President, Nayib Bukele, had introduced Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2021, making El Salvador the first country in the world to do so. However, the plan was met with criticism from the IMF and international media, citing the risks of financial instability and market volatility. Despite this, Bukele remained committed to the project, even buying Bitcoin daily and promoting it on social media. However, the project failed to gain traction, with only 7.5% of Salvadorians using Bitcoin by the end of 2024. The country's economy was also struggling, with a high level of debt and a reliance on imports from neighboring countries. The IMF deal requires El Salvador to reduce its Bitcoin-related economic activities, including its participation in the Chivo-Wallet. Bukele has vowed to continue promoting El Salvador as a hub for cryptocurrency, despite the criticism from the IMF and the international community.

**El Salvador Abandons Bitcoin as Legal Tender, Making it Optional for Businesses**
El Salvador's Congress passed a law to modify the country's Bitcoin law, making it optional for businesses to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. This move comes after the country's central bank announced that it would no longer consider Bitcoin as a legal tender, making it the first country to do so. In 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender, but it has been met with criticism from economists and international organizations, including the IMF, which warned of the risks to financial stability and credibility. The country's president, Nayib Bukele, has defended the move, saying that it would help to promote financial inclusion. However, the majority of Salvadorans have not adopted Bitcoin, with a recent survey showing that only 8.1% of people used Bitcoin for payments in 2024, the lowest record since Bitcoin became a legal tender. Stacy Herbert, the director of the National Office of Bitcoin of El Salvador, claimed that Bitcoin is still a legal tender in the country, but this has been disputed by some media outlets.

**El Salvador: Bitcoin's Reign Comes to an End**
El Salvador has made history as the first country to recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender and the first to reverse its decision. On January 30, the Parliament reformed the Bitcoin Law, which came into effect on September 7, 2021, modifying six articles and repealing three others. This was done to meet the requirements imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and to obtain a loan to finance the country's economic stability. Companies and public institutions that were previously required to accept Bitcoin payments are no longer obligated to do so, but it will be possible to use the cryptocurrency voluntarily for private transactions. The IMF had previously expressed concerns about the use of Bitcoin, citing risks to the country's financial integrity and exposure to price fluctuations. The country's president, Nayib Bukele, who was a strong supporter of Bitcoin in 2021, has not ruled out the possibility of reintroducing it as a legal tender in the future.

**El Salvador Repeals Bitcoin as Legal Tender**
El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender, has repealed this decision. On January 30, 2025, the parliament voted to amend the law, making the acceptance of Bitcoin as a payment method voluntary for merchants. This decision marks the end of an ambitious experiment that began in September 2021 and drew international attention. The main reason for this change is the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) demands for financial support. El Salvador needs urgent financial assistance, and the IMF made the abolition of the Bitcoin law a condition for a $1.4 billion loan. This agreement aims to strengthen the country's fiscal sustainability and reduce the risks associated with Bitcoin. The law change includes several key points: Bitcoin is no longer referred to as a 'currency', acceptance as a payment method is now voluntary, and taxes cannot be paid in Bitcoin. Additionally, the obligation to exchange Bitcoin for dollars at ATMs has been abolished. These changes aim to significantly reduce the role of Bitcoin in the Salvadoran financial system. Despite the initial praise for the innovative step, the practical implementation of Bitcoin as a legal tender was problematic. Only a small percentage of transactions were actually made in Bitcoin, and the majority of the population is skeptical of the cryptocurrency. The high volatility of BTC makes it impractical as a daily payment method for many people. Critics had warned of the risks associated with using Bitcoin as an official payment method, including its high volatility, potential dangers to the country's economic stability, and concerns about transparency and money laundering. The IMF had repeatedly expressed its concerns about these risks and urged El Salvador to reconsider the Bitcoin status. Bitcoin remains legal in El Salvador, but its use is now voluntary. Companies and individuals can continue to accept Bitcoin as a payment method, but they are no longer required to do so. Interestingly, the government under President Bukele continues to hold its strategy of buying Bitcoin for the state reserves, showing that the country has not completely abandoned the cryptocurrency despite the legislative changes.

**El Salvador Abandons Bitcoin as Legal Tender After Failed Experiment**
El Salvador, which made headlines in 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender, has repealed the law and removed Bitcoin as a legal tender. The decision was made to comply with an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which provided a $1.4 billion loan to El Salvador in December 2024. The law, which was amended on January 29, 2025, still recognizes Bitcoin as a legal tender, but removes the obligation to accept payments in Bitcoin. This effectively removes Bitcoin's status as a legal tender. Despite President Nayib Bukele's efforts to promote Bitcoin, a survey by the Central American University in 2024 found that 92% of Salvadorans do not use Bitcoin for transactions. A nurse, Juana Enriquez, 55, commented, 'I used to use Bitcoin, but it was too complicated and risky. It's not suitable for low-income workers who just make enough to live on.' Economist Rafael Lemus stated, 'Bitcoin no longer has the force of law as a legal tender. We originally intended to make Bitcoin a legal tender, but the government's efforts to enforce it were unsuccessful.' El Salvador's ambassador to the US, Milena Mayorga, argued that the law change is 'an adaptation to the situation.' President Bukele continues to buy Bitcoin, and the country has a Bitcoin office and Bitcoin law, and Bitcoin can still be used in El Salvador. According to the National Bitcoin Office, El Salvador holds approximately 6,050 BTC, equivalent to around Â¥95 billion.

**El Salvador Eliminates Bitcoin as Legal Tender**
The Salvadoran parliament has approved a reform that eliminates Bitcoin's status as a legal tender, marking a significant shift from the country's historic decision in 2021 to adopt the cryptocurrency as its official currency. The legislative changes, approved at the end of January, eliminate the obligation to accept Bitcoin in El Salvador, making its use completely voluntary. The government still owns over 6,000 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $577.38 million, and continues to accumulate them. Despite the limited adoption of Bitcoin in the real world, with only around 8% of Salvadorans reporting using it for payments in 2024, conversations about integrating Bitcoin into national and corporate reserves are gaining momentum, especially after US President Donald Trump hinted at its possible inclusion in US strategic reserves.
