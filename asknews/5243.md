**Trump's Visit to Saudi Arabia: Will it Mark a New Era of Normalization with Israel?**
US President Donald Trump is expected to visit Saudi Arabia as part of a tour of three Gulf countries (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE). The visit will focus on economic cooperation, investments, arms sales, and artificial intelligence. Trump is expected to sign deals worth over $100 billion, including the sale of F-35 fighter jets to the Saudi air force. The visit is seen as a priority for Trump's administration to strengthen the strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia. Trump has expressed his confidence that Saudi Arabia will join the Abraham Accords, a normalization agreement between Israel and several Arab countries. However, the Saudi government has stated that normalization with Israel is conditional on progress in the Palestinian issue, including recognition of a Palestinian state. The current tensions in the region, particularly due to the war in Gaza, may hinder any progress in this direction. Nevertheless, there are indications of a growing cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Israel, particularly in the field of defense. The Saudi government has been easing its diplomatic restrictions with Israel in recent years, although it has not yet announced full normalization of relations. The upcoming visit of Trump to Saudi Arabia may see direct discussions on normalization, in the context of pushing the 'Deal of the Century' American initiative. The current regional situation, particularly the Iranian threat and its allies in the region, may push Saudi Arabia to take stronger steps towards military cooperation with Israel to secure its interests. Normalization may include enhanced cooperation in regional security, with the fight against the Houthis in Yemen being a key priority. Saudi Arabia, under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is seeking to achieve its Vision 2030, a ambitious plan to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil. One of the key pillars of this vision is to achieve regional stability, where Saudi Arabia seeks to resolve the issues that may hinder the development of the region economically. Saudi Arabia has started this path since five years ago, seeking to calm tensions in Yemen, and in March 2023, the kingdom signed a historic agreement with Iran with Chinese mediation, reflecting a strategic shift towards regional stability. The March 2023 agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran was a major step towards easing tensions between the two countries, which had been strained for decades due to regional competition and proxy wars in several areas such as Yemen, Iraq, and Syria. The signing of the agreement under Chinese auspices represents a significant shift in Saudi policy, which had previously relied on the US to counter Iranian expansion in the region. This agreement contributes to improving the security and economic situation within the kingdom, and enhances the chances of investments and reduces tensions that may affect the plans of Vision 2030. In this context, Saudi Arabia may consider normalization with Israel as a key step towards strengthening its relationship with the United States. Since the signing of the Abraham Accords between Israel and Arab countries such as the UAE and Bahrain under American pressure, Saudi Arabia has found itself in a position that may require rapprochement with Tel Aviv to ensure the strengthening of the strategic alliance with Washington. Normalization with Israel may be seen as a way for Saudi Arabia to document its security relationship with the United States, which remains a key ally in the face of regional challenges. This move may enhance cooperation in technological, defense, and economic fields, in line with the goals of Vision 2030. On the other hand, normalization with Israel may be seen as a 'concession' by Saudi Arabia to the US, as American pressure on the kingdom to reach normalization agreements with Israel increases, especially in the face of the geostrategic changes in the region. This may strengthen the alliance between Saudi Arabia and the US, at a time when security challenges from Iran are increasing, and also enhance Saudi Arabia's ability to attract Western investments and advanced technology within the framework of Vision 2030.

**A Change in the Middle East: Israel's Response to Hamas and the Consequences**
The 19 months since October 7, 2023, have marked a significant change in the Middle East. Prior to that date, the region was characterized by a state of military silence, with Israel's security forces relying on a theory that terrorism was afraid of a strong Israeli military response and therefore would not act against Israel. However, Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, Syrians, and Iraqis were not part of this theory. They were all receiving Iranian arms and funding, preparing for the 'D-Day' invasion of Israel, which would be complemented by Iran's acquisition of atomic weapons. However, the silence had a deceptive quality, as not all participants knew the hidden rules of the game, and some acted independently, sometimes hindering the planned development. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia, the most Western countries in the Gulf, saw the silence as an opportunity to develop their countries peacefully, taking advantage of the enormous income from oil before the world stopped needing it. They sought good relations with the State of Israel as a key to fortifying their peaceful plans. The UAE and Bahrain were the first to take this path. Saudi Arabia, the most representative country of the Muslim world, took its time, but its leaders were already expressing their intention to normalize relations with Israel. The public expressions of Saudi Arabia sparked fear in Iran and its allies, who would lose all excuses for not normalizing relations with Israel, including the lack of a solution to the Palestinian problem. This fear led Hamas to act on October 7, 2023, knowing that a strong Israeli military response would automatically lead to a unified anti-Israel position from the Arab and Muslim world, weakening the normalization process. The event on October 7, 2023, was a miracle for Israel, as the 'daydream' in which the Israeli leadership was enveloped exploded with the death of 1400 people and the kidnapping (by Hamas) of 255 living and dead Israelis. Hamas 'got drunk' with the success of October 7, 2023, and Muslim multitudes saw with their own eyes (with the help of Hamas videos) how 'the Jews' were humiliated and defeated. There were massive demonstrations of support for Hamas in Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Lebanon, and other Arab countries. Israel, confused, began to correct the situation on October 7, 2023, while thinking about how to react to the Hamas invasion. Recovering the invaded territory was relatively easy, but recovering the hostages was a difficult task that would prolong the military victory against Hamas. However, the Israeli people reacted almost homogeneously, supporting the government and the army. The young generation of Israelis 'roared' their desire to participate in the effort to restore national pride lost by Hamas. Since that crucial moment, Hamas has counted its enormous losses, but not only Hamas...also Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Syrians who saw the disaster of their army, the Houthis who are bombed again and again, and even Iran, whose installations were bombed not less than twice. Not only did the Israeli people demand action, but the army itself recovered and demonstrated its military quality throughout the Middle East. Along with the gradual recovery of the hostages (almost 200 of the original 255), the death of 60,000 Palestinians (a considerable part of them Hamas terrorists), the death of the Hezbollah military leadership in Lebanon, and thousands of Hezbollah terrorists, Israel has established its troops in the south of that country, in the northwest of Syria, and, of course, in the Gaza Strip itself, which has been destroyed to the point of being uninhabitable for its own population. The Israeli response is not yet over...but we are on the way to it...The Hamas issue is in its final stages...the Houthis are on their way...and, of course...Iran...whose dying gasps are heard from a distance...before receiving the final blow to its Atomic Plan...But the most significant thing is the change in the bitter consciousness of the Israeli population that there is no need to wait for peace in the Western sense of the word...and the most that can be expected is that the Muslim and Arab enemy will respect us for our military strength and resilience.

**Israel Continues to Bomb Gaza, Hamas Rejects US Proposal**
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan said that Israel's refusal to allow a delegation from the Arab League to visit the West Bank is a 'confirmation of its extremism and refusal of any serious attempts to achieve peace'. The delegation was planning to visit the West Bank as part of a bid to resolve the Gaza crisis. Meanwhile, the Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz has ordered the military to continue its operations in Gaza 'regardless of any negotiations'. Hamas has rejected a proposal by US envoy to the Middle East, Steve Wietkoff, saying it is 'not acceptable at all'. However, Hamas has said it is willing to make some changes to the proposal. The Israeli military has continued to bomb various areas in Gaza, resulting in a new massacre near a humanitarian aid distribution center in Rafah, southern Gaza. The UN has condemned the Israeli actions, saying that aid distribution in Gaza has become a 'death trap'. The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza has reported that at least 33 people have been killed and over 232 injured in the Israeli bombing near a US aid distribution center in Rafah. The Israeli Defense Minister has said that the military will continue to operate in Gaza 'regardless of any negotiations'. Hamas has accused Israel of committing a 'fascist' act and has called for an international investigation into the massacre. The UN has also called for an immediate and binding decision to stop the Israeli 'bloodshed' and has called for an international investigation into the crimes committed against civilians.

**Arab Ministers Condemn Israel's Refusal to Allow Visit to West Bank**
Arab ministers from the committee formed by the Arab-Islamic Summit on the Gaza Strip have condemned Israel's refusal to allow them to visit the West Bank, calling for an end to the genocide in Gaza. The ministers, including Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, Bahraini Foreign Minister Abdullatif Al Zayani, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, and Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit, made the statement during a press conference in Amman following a video conference with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Al Saud said that Israel's refusal to allow the visit 'confirms its extremism and rejection of peace', adding that the war on Gaza has shown that military solutions are useless and will not bring security to any party. Safadi said that 'the refusal is a reflection of Israel's isolation and extremism', adding that 'the extremist Israeli government, which commits massacres in Gaza, kills children and women, and destroys hospitals and uses starvation as a weapon, is also the same government that prevents a political delegation from visiting the occupied West Bank'. The committee was formed on November 11, 2023, and includes foreign ministers from Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, Turkey, Indonesia, Nigeria, Palestine, and the Arab League and Islamic Organization secretaries-general. Yesterday, Israeli officials said that Tel Aviv had prevented Arab foreign ministers from reaching Ramallah to discuss the strengthening of a Palestinian state on Sunday, according to the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. The Gaza Strip is suffering a humanitarian and relief crisis since Israel closed the crossings on March 2, preventing food, medicine, aid, and fuel from entering, while its army escalates the genocide it commits against Palestinians in the Strip. Since October 7, 2023, the US has supported Israel in committing genocide in Gaza, killing over 178,000 Palestinians, mostly children and women, and leaving over 11,000 missing, in addition to hundreds of thousands of displaced people.

**Arab League Meeting with Palestinian Leadership: A Positive Step towards Peace**
The Secretary-General of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, stated that the meeting between the Arab Islamic Committee and the Palestinian leadership is a positive step, revealing many new and positive positions. Aboul Gheit said that the meeting comes in the context of preparations for the United Nations conference in New York, and is a continuation of the efforts made in Madrid to expand the recognition of the Palestinian state. In this context, Bahrain's Foreign Minister, Abdul Latif bin Rashid Al Zayani, emphasized the need to stop the war in the Gaza Strip immediately, release the hostages and detainees, and speed up the delivery of humanitarian aid. Al Zayani stressed the Arab rejection of forced displacement of Palestinians, and the need to rebuild Gaza. He said that the 'Bahrain Declaration' during the summit in May 2024 was not just a declaration, but a unified and joint Arab position, and a diplomatic plan of action to deal with the challenges we face. He added that Bahrain will continue, during its two-year term on the Security Council, to work towards recognizing the Palestinian state and its full membership in the United Nations. Jordan's Foreign Minister, Ayman Safadi, said that Israel's decision to ban the Arab delegation from visiting Ramallah is a sign of its arrogance and extremism, and its disregard for international law. Safadi added that the Israeli government, which commits massacres in Gaza, kills children and women, destroys hospitals, and uses starvation as a weapon, is the same government that bans a political delegation from entering Ramallah, which works to stop the war and achieve just and comprehensive peace, ensuring the security of all. He pointed out that the Israeli government continues its war on dignity and its illegal steps of settlement and land confiscation, and continues to kill all chances of achieving just and comprehensive peace. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, said that Israel's refusal to allow the Arab delegation to visit Ramallah is a confirmation and a demonstration of its extremism and refusal of any serious attempts to achieve peace and diplomacy. He added that it is clear that Israel wants only violence, and this increases our determination to strengthen our diplomatic efforts and to face this isolation and to reject it.

**Ahmed Aboul Gheit Defends Arab-Israeli Relations Amid Widespread Outrage**
Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Secretary-General of the Arab League, has defended the relationships between Arab countries and Israel, despite widespread outrage and rejection of normalization. Aboul Gheit argued that cutting ties with Israel 'is not a wise decision' at this time, and that maintaining official channels is necessary for facilitating mediation efforts and ceasefire negotiations. However, the Arab street has seen normalization as a political cover for the ongoing massacres in Gaza, which have resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians, mostly women and children. Aboul Gheit's statements came as public pressure mounted on Arab governments, particularly those that have signed the Abraham Accords, such as the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, and Morocco. These countries have faced harsh criticism for not taking concrete steps to stop the massacres or freeze their political and military cooperation with Israel. Aboul Gheit emphasized that 'peace requires dialogue', ignoring the sentiments of millions who see normalization as a betrayal of the Palestinian cause and a compromise on the historical rights of the Palestinian people. In contrast, activists and observers have seen Aboul Gheit's statements as a complete submission to international pressures and a whitewashing of the shameful positions of some Arab regimes, at the expense of innocent blood.

**Arab Committee Meets in Amman to Discuss Gaza Developments**
Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, arrived in Amman, Jordan on Saturday evening to attend a meeting of the Arab committee tasked with addressing the Gaza situation. According to a statement by the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'the participation is part of supporting the political and diplomatic efforts to stop the aggression on Gaza.' The committee will discuss the latest developments of the Israeli aggression on Gaza and explore ways to support efforts to end the war and lift the siege on the Gaza Strip. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry stated that the meeting was originally scheduled to precede a visit to Ramallah, but the committee decided to postpone the visit after Israel refused to allow the delegation to enter the Palestinian territories through its airspace, which Amman considered 'a deliberate obstruction' to Arab action. The committee, formed in November 2023, consists of foreign ministers from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Bahrain, Turkey, Indonesia, Nigeria, Palestine, and the Arab League Secretary-General and the Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. The meeting comes as the Israeli war on Gaza continues, leaving over 178,000 dead and injured, and 11,000 missing, according to Palestinian data. Israeli forces have also escalated their actions in the West Bank, resulting in the deaths of at least 972 Palestinians, injuries to thousands, and the arrest of over 17,000 others since October 7, 2023.

**Israel refuses entry to Arab ministers visiting Ramallah, slams Palestinian statehood push**
Israel has blocked the entry of Arab ministers visiting Ramallah, denouncing the Palestinian Authority's push for statehood. An Israeli official stated, 'The Palestinian Authority, which refuses to condemn the October 7 massacre, intended to host a meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the establishment of a Palestinian state.' Israel views such a state as 'a terrorist state in the heart of the Land of Israel.' This move comes amid efforts to revive the two-state solution, following Israel's approval of 22 new settlements in the West Bank, widely condemned by the United Nations. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said, 'We will build a Jewish Israeli state in Judea and Samaria,' rejecting international calls for Palestinian statehood. Saudi Arabia has stated that it will not normalize relations with Israel unless an independent Palestinian state is established.

**Arab League Condemns Israel's Blockade of Gaza Committee's Delegation**
The Arab League strongly condemned the Israeli occupation authorities' decision to prevent the Arab Islamic Committee's delegation on Gaza from visiting Ramallah in the West Bank, where they were scheduled to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. The committee's delegation was denied entry, despite being cleared to visit. Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit expressed his strong condemnation of this decision, stating that it reflects a blatant disregard for international law and a desire to isolate the Palestinian people and their leadership. The Arab League announced that Aboul Gheit will visit Amman, Jordan, on Sunday, as part of the Arab Islamic Committee's delegation, which will meet with Jordan's King Abdullah II. The committee was established by the Arab Islamic Extraordinary Summit held in Riyadh on November 11, 2023, and includes foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Palestine, Turkey, Indonesia, and Nigeria, as well as the Arab League Secretary-General and the Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. The committee aims to lead a diplomatic effort to stop the Israeli war on Gaza, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, support a two-state solution, and recognize the Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. Since its establishment, the committee has visited 14 countries, including China, Russia, the UK, France, Spain, and has successfully mobilized international support for the Palestinian cause, including backing UN resolutions related to the issue.

**Arab ministers condemn Israel 'ban' on planned West Bank visit**
The foreign ministers of several Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and Bahrain, condemned Israel's decision to block their planned visit to the occupied West Bank. The ministers had intended to meet with Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas in Ramallah, but Israel announced it would not cooperate, citing concerns that the meeting would promote the establishment of a Palestinian state. An Israeli official stated, 'Such a state would undoubtedly become a terrorist state in the heart of the Land of Israel. Israel will not cooperate with such moves aimed at harming it and its security.' The Palestinian Authority's foreign ministry expressed 'grave concern' and called Israel's decision a 'blatant violation of its obligations under international law as an occupying power.' The move comes as Israel announced the creation of 22 new Jewish settlements in the West Bank, considered illegal under international law. Firas Maksad, managing director for the Middle East and North Africa at Eurasia Group, said Israel's rejection of the visit indicated 'how far Saudi and Israel have moved from normalisation to diplomatic confrontation.'

**Rubio Expects Several Arab States to Normalize Relations with Israel This Year**
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed optimism about the possibility of several Arab states signing the Abraham Accords, which normalize relations with Israel, 'this year'. Rubio stated in a congressional commission that 'we have an Abraham Accords bureau working on identifying a certain number of states and I think we're going to have good news, certainly before the end of the year, with several countries ready to join this alliance'. Rubio did not provide information on which and how many states are involved. The Abraham Accords, backed by Donald Trump, led to the normalization of Israel's relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco in 2020. However, many others have refused to participate, particularly Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Lebanon. Trump expressed 'hopeful fervor' that Saudi Arabia would normalize its relations with Israel during his recent visit to Riyadh, but the Saudis have stated that they will not normalize relations without the creation of a Palestinian state.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio believes that more Arab nations could normalize relations with Israel this year, following the Abraham Accords led by former US President Donald Trump. Rubio stated, 'I think we may have good news, certainly before the end of this year, of a number of more countries that are willing to join that alliance.' Saudi Arabia, considered the ultimate prize for Israel, has expressed interest in normalizing relations, but has set conditions, including an end to the Gaza war and movement towards a two-state solution with the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a longtime critic of a Palestinian state, has moved ahead with another major offensive in Gaza, despite enthusiasm for Saudi normalization.

**Arab League Stands Firm on Arab Peace Initiative**
Arab League Assistant Secretary-General Hossam Zaki stated that the Arab Initiative for Peace is still on the table and represents a comprehensive vision for resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. He emphasized that the initiative offers Israel a clear proposal: recognition, peace, and normal relations with 57 Arab and Islamic countries in exchange for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Zaki acknowledged that the current Israeli extremism makes implementing the initiative challenging, but it does not diminish its importance. He noted that some Arab countries have taken steps towards normalization, while others have retreated from their previous positions. However, the collective Arab position remains committed to the initiative's core principles. The Arab League balances the diverse views of its member states, striving to maintain a minimum level of consensus on major issues, including the Palestinian cause.

**Arab League Summit in Baghdad Focuses on Gaza War and Syrian Future**
The 34th ordinary session of the Arab League summit opened in Baghdad on Saturday, with the Israeli war in Gaza and the future of Syria at the forefront of discussions. This is the first summit hosted by Iraq since 2012. The 22 member states' leaders and high-ranking officials are meeting at the Republican Palace in the highly secured Green Zone of the Iraqi capital. This edition is the first ordinary meeting since the ousting of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, replaced by Ahmed al-Charaa. It comes days after the US announced their intention to lift sanctions against Damascus. The Gaza situation is the most urgent issue on the summit's agenda, with nearly 20 months of blockade and Israeli bombings causing a humanitarian catastrophe. Since October 7, 2023, Israel has been conducting an ongoing military operation in the Palestinian enclave, resulting in over 53,000 deaths, mostly women and children. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Israel is also facing accusations of genocide before the International Court of Justice due to its actions in the Gaza Strip. Other regional conflicts, such as those in Yemen, Sudan, Libya, and Somalia, as well as the fragile stability of Lebanon, will also be discussed. The ongoing nuclear negotiations between Iran and the US are also expected to be addressed. The summit is taking place as Syria, now led by Ahmed al-Charaa, aspires to a full reintegration into the Arab fold. The summit's agenda includes eight priority axes related to Arab national security, including the war in Gaza, the fight against terrorism, the dispute over the Ethiopian dam, the Syrian Golan Heights occupation, and Iranian presence on disputed Emirati islands. Participants will also examine the evolution of the situation in Jerusalem, the question of Palestinian prisoners and refugees, UNRWA funding, and Palestinian reconstruction efforts. Climate change, considered one of the major threats to humanity by many scientific studies, will also be on the agenda. The summit will conclude with the Baghdad Declaration, reflecting a unified Arab position on regional issues. The location of the next summit and several regional and international appointments will also be decided.

**Witcoff Predicts Normalization of Relations Between Israel and Arab Countries**
US diplomat David Witcoff predicts that Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Syria may soon normalize relations with Israel by joining the 'Abraham Accords'. 'I predict that relatively soon we will see potential for normalization of relations [with Israel] with Lebanon and even with Syria. From their side, there is a clear positive reaction. This could also happen with Libya,' Witcoff said. He added that Saudi Arabia is also considering joining these agreements if the situation in Gaza is resolved. According to him, 'the situation in Gaza will be resolved in some form in the very near future, and this will open the way for normalization.' Additionally, Witcoff noted that Armenia and Azerbaijan, which are close to finalizing a bilateral conflict resolution, may also want to join the 'Abraham Accords', although both countries have had diplomatic relations with Israel since 1992. Witcoff is confident that up to six new countries may join the agreements in the coming months. The 'Abraham Accords' were reached in 2020-2021, when Israel established diplomatic relations with Bahrain, the UAE, Morocco, and Sudan with US mediation. Prior to this, only Egypt and Jordan had official relations with Israel. Former US President Trump previously assured that Saudi Arabia would soon join the 'Abraham Accords' and also called on Syrian authorities to conclude 'Abraham Accords' with Israel and prevent the resurgence of ISIS.

**Trump's envoy predicts more Arab countries to join 'Abraham Accords' with Israel**
US President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, predicts that more Arab countries will normalize relations with Israel, also known as the 'Abraham Accords.' Witkoff stated, 'We think [we] will have some, or a lot of announcements, very, very shortly, which we hope will yield great progress by next year.' The comments come as Israel continues its war on the Gaza Strip, where over 52,600 people have been killed, mostly women and children, since October 2023. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

**The Mirage of Israeli-Saudi Normalization**
The normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia remains a distant dream, fueled by wishful thinking rather than political realities. The absence of Saudi Arabia, the most influential Arab state, from the Abraham Accords has been a major obstacle. The Biden administration's unconditional support for Israel's war on Gaza and its brutal military campaign in Lebanon has alienated many Arab and Muslim states, making a new normalization agreement even less likely. Meanwhile, China has taken advantage of Washington's loss of credibility, negotiating a historic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023. Despite the evolving situation on the ground, the US administration continues to believe that an agreement between the world's largest oil exporter and Israel is still achievable on its terms. However, many observers believe that the Saudi government will remain cautious and that the normalization of relations with Israel will not happen without significant concessions to the Palestinian cause.

**Hamas Calls on Arab Countries to Reconsider Normalization with Israel**
Representatives of the terrorist group Hamas have called on Arab countries to reconsider their stance on normalizing relations with Israel. According to 'The Times Of Israel', a high-ranking member of Hamas' political bureau, Basm Na'im, stated that Arab states, both those that have already established diplomatic ties with Israel and those considering it, should abandon this step. Na'im claimed that Israel is not demonstrating sufficient commitment to fulfilling agreements, which could lead to their collapse. The statement comes amid a prisoner exchange between Hamas and Israel, where three Israeli civilians held captive since October 7, 2023, were released, and Israel freed 183 Palestinian prisoners in response.
