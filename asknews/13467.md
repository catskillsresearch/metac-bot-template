**The geopolitics of Trump and Nigeria's 'cards'**
The article discusses the changing international relations order and its implications for Nigeria. With the US imposing tariffs on traditional allies and threatening to annex Greenland and Canada, the international rules-based order (RBO) is being dismantled. The article suggests that Nigeria should prepare for a new era of geopolitics where strong men and deals determine international relations. To have the required 'cards' to play, Nigeria should adopt a strategic approach to governance that prioritizes science and technology development in consonance with certain foreign policy alignments. This includes reclassifying the Federal Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology (FMIST) to a 'Grade A' ministry, increasing domestic manufacturing of military technology, and following through with the economic diplomacy initiative introduced by Gen. Ike Nwachukwu in the 1980s. The article also suggests that Nigeria should enhance relations with Taiwan and China, and use foreign policy cards to meet domestic political commitments. Specifically, it recommends that Nigeria should renew the 1994 bilateral Agreement for Investment Protection and Promotion (IPPA) with Taiwan, and add semiconductor and advanced computing technology manufacturing in Nigeria as an item in the agreement. Additionally, the article suggests that Nigeria should support the current Raw Material Research and Development Council (RMRDC) Amendment Bill, which seeks to amend RMRDC Act 2022 and mandate 30 percent local processing of raw materials before export. This can lead to the development of rare earth and critical minerals in the country, which can be strategically aligned to provide inputs for advanced technology and semiconductors manufacturing, thereby providing Nigeria with additional geopolitical cards.

**Iran Warns Europe of 'Snapback' Consequences, Threatening Nuclear Agreement**
Iran has warned European countries (France, Germany, and the UK) of the consequences of activating the 'snapback' mechanism to reimpose UN sanctions, considering this move would face a firm and proportional response from Iran, which could lead to irreversible consequences on the 2015 nuclear agreement (JCPOA). Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that activating 'snapback' would undermine the chances of reaching a diplomatic solution and effectively end European participation in the nuclear agreement. He also mentioned that Iran may reconsider its commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty if sanctions are reimposed. In response, European countries have informed the UN Security Council that they are prepared to activate the 'snapback' mechanism before October 18, 2025, the deadline for the expiration of UN Resolution 2231, if Iran continues to violate nuclear agreements, particularly enriching uranium to 60%, a level close to military use. These tensions arise amidst European concerns about Iran's support for Russia in the Ukraine war, detention of foreign nationals, and development of its ballistic missile program. In contrast, Tehran asserts that its nuclear program is peaceful and that it is ready to return to its commitments if sanctions are lifted in a verifiable manner, according to the Tehran Times website. These developments demonstrate the fragility of the diplomatic path and the likelihood of escalating tensions between Iran and the West, threatening regional and global stability.

**Countries Meet at UN to Discuss 'Killer Robots' Amid Growing Concerns**
Countries will meet at the United Nations on Monday to revive efforts to regulate autonomous weapons controlled by AI, which are increasingly used in modern warfare. Experts warn that time is running out to set limits on new lethal technologies. Autonomous and AI-assisted weapons systems are playing a more significant role in conflicts from Ukraine to Gaza. However, progress towards establishing global norms governing their development and use has not kept pace. Non-binding international norms are still virtually non-existent. Since 2014, countries that are part of the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) have met in Geneva to discuss a possible ban on fully autonomous systems that operate without significant human control and regulate others. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has set 2026 as a deadline for countries to establish clear standards on the use of AI weapons. However, human rights groups warn that there is no consensus among governments. Alexander Kmentt, head of arms control at the Austrian Foreign Ministry, said, 'Time is really running out to put some barriers in place so that the nightmare scenarios that some of the most prominent experts are warning about do not become a reality.' The UN General Assembly meeting in New York on Monday will be the first meeting of the organization dedicated to autonomous weapons. Although not legally binding, diplomats want the talks to increase pressure on military powers that resist regulation due to concerns that norms could reduce the advantages of technology on the battlefield. Campaign groups hope that the meeting, which will also address critical issues not covered by the CCW, including ethical and human rights concerns and the use of autonomous weapons by non-state actors, will push states to agree on a legally binding instrument. They see it as a crucial test to determine if countries can overcome divisions before the next round of negotiations on the CCAC in September. 'This issue requires clarification through a legally binding treaty. The technology is advancing very quickly,' said Patrick Wilcken, Amnesty International researcher on military, security, and policing issues. 'The idea of not wanting to rule out the delegation of life-or-death decisions... to a machine seems extraordinary.' The New York conversations come after 164 states supported a UN General Assembly resolution in 2023 calling on the international community to urgently address the risks posed by autonomous weapons. While many countries support a globally binding framework, the United States, Russia, China, and India prefer national guidelines or existing international laws, according to Amnesty. 'We are not convinced that existing legislation is insufficient,' said a Pentagon spokesperson to Reuters, adding that autonomous weapons could, in fact, pose a lower risk to civilians than conventional weapons. The governments of India, Russia, and China did not respond to requests for comment. In the absence of regulation, autonomous systems are proliferating. Experts at the Future of Life Institute have tracked the deployment of approximately 200 autonomous weapons systems in Ukraine, the Middle East, and Africa. The Russian forces have deployed around 3,000 kamikaze drones, Veter, capable of detecting and attacking targets autonomously, according to their data. Meanwhile, Ukraine has used semi-autonomous drones in the conflict. The Ukrainian government declined to comment. Israel has used AI systems to identify targets in Gaza. Its mission in Geneva stated that it supported multilateral talks and used data technologies in full compliance with international law. However, Human Rights Watch said that critical issues of accountability under international law remain unresolved and warned in a report last month that unregulated autonomous weapons pose a series of threats to human rights and could trigger an arms race if not controlled. Activists like Laura Nolan, of Stop Killer Robots, are concerned that there are currently few measures to ensure that defense companies develop AI-powered weapons responsibly. 'Generally, we do not trust that industries will self-regulate... There is no reason to believe that defense or technology companies are more trustworthy,' she said.

**King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center Signs Agreements to Distribute 600,000 Food Baskets in Yemen**
The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSrelief) signed two agreements with two civil society organizations to distribute 600,000 food baskets in Yemen for the years 2025-2026. The total weight of the food baskets is 35 tons and 640 kilograms. The agreements aim to reduce food insecurity and improve the living conditions of families in crisis and emergency situations in the governorates of (Hodeidah, Taiz, Aden, Lahj, Al-Dhalea, Abien, Shabwa, Socotra, Hadhramout, Al-Mahra, Marib, Al-Jawf, Hajjah, and Saada). Additionally, the center's volunteer medical team in Aden performed 115 surgical operations for liver patients and 125 endoscopic operations. They also provided 40 patients with external consultations and gave 6 educational and training lectures to local medical staff as part of the volunteer medical project for liver and biliary tract surgery. In Hadhramout, the center implemented a vocational training program in the field of solar products in the cotton directorate as part of the project to empower Yemeni women in renewable energy projects, in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The program provided 200 women with 17-day theoretical and practical training in life skills and business management, enhancing their overall capabilities. Furthermore, 16 trainers from the technical, veterinary, and agricultural institute were trained to provide technical and administrative support to the beneficiaries of the vocational training in the field of solar products, and to announce the launch of the production phase, which includes the manufacture and assembly of 10,500 units of solar ovens and lamps, to be distributed to the most needy families in the cotton directorate.

**The Invisible Pact that Prevents Global Nuclear War: How the Treaty Works**
Beyond armies and threats, there exists a pact that has been acting as a brake on nuclear catastrophe for over half a century. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (TNP) is the diplomatic network that protects the planet from a devastating scenario. With 191 signatory countries, it represents the largest global consensus to keep atomic power in check. The TNP, in force since 1970, establishes a commitment between nuclear-armed states and those without nuclear arms. The former - Russia, the US, China, France, and the UK - agree not to transfer technology or promote its expansion, while the latter renounce manufacturing or acquiring nuclear arms. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitors compliance with these commitments, preventing nuclear energy for civilian purposes from being diverted to armament. The TNP emerged during the Cold War, when the two superpowers, the US and the USSR, understood that a nuclear confrontation would mean mutual assured destruction. Surprisingly, even in that climate of rivalry, they managed to negotiate an agreement that remains in force today. Since 1995, the treaty has been extended indefinitely, and by May 3, 2023, 182 non-nuclear states had verification agreements with the IAEA. In 2024, nine countries possess nuclear arms, according to Statista: Russia (4,580 warheads), the US (4,044), China (500), France (290), the UK (225), India (172), Pakistan (170), Israel (90), and North Korea (50). Only the first five are considered nuclear-armed states within the TNP. The other four never joined or withdrew from the treaty, remaining outside the global pact's control. As IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said, 'The TNP is a cornerstone of international security, and its continued effectiveness is essential for preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.'

**Denmark to Ban Solarium Use for Under 18s**
The Danish government and several other parties plan to ban solarium use for people under 18 years old. According to Lea Wermelin, health spokesperson for the Social Democrats, this will be part of the Cancer Plan 5 and is expected to come into effect from 2026. She points out that Denmark has one of the highest rates of breast cancer in the world, and the number of young people using solariums is increasing. 'When it comes to breast cancer, Denmark is one of the countries in the world with the highest incidence. And unfortunately, there are many young people and an increasing number of young people who use solariums,' she said. The current law does not have an age limit for solarium use. The Cancer Society has been working to limit the use of solariums among young people for several years. The society's director, Jesper Fisker, welcomes the government's initiative to introduce an age limit. 'An age limit is a clear good idea, as solarium use increases the risk of breast cancer by 20 percent. I hope that the age limit will send a strong signal to the population that a trip to the solarium is a bad idea,' he said. According to the Cancer Society, around 275 people die of breast cancer every year. It is also the most common type of cancer among young people, and three out of four cases of breast cancer among solarium users under 30 can be explained by solarium use. The Health Board advises against using solariums altogether, as it increases the risk of breast cancer and common skin cancer, and can cause permanent damage to eyes and skin. The risk increases the younger you are when you start using solariums,' the board said. The Danish Solarium Association argues that introducing age verification will lead to higher costs and that some solarium centers will close. This could lead to users, regardless of age, being referred to private solariums, which is a step backward for safety, according to the association's chairman, Henrik Marx.

**China to Strengthen Ties with Latin America and the Caribbean**
China reaffirmed its commitment to strengthening its alliance with Latin America and the Caribbean through the China-CELAC forum, aiming to promote South-South cooperation, joint development, and peace in a world marked by geopolitical tensions. According to Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Miao Deyu, the relationship with the region is based on mutual respect and multilateralism principles. 'The people of Latin America and the Caribbean want to build their own homes, not the backyard of others (...) They seek independence and not a new Monroe Doctrine,' he emphasized. Miao highlighted the progress made in the last decade, including free trade agreements with five Latin American countries, visa exemption agreements with seven nations, and the opening of air cargo routes between Chinese cities and Mexico City. China is the second-largest trading partner of the region, with an estimated $500 billion in trade for 2024. The China-CELAC summit will adopt the Beijing Declaration, reaffirming the commitment to peace, development, and cooperation, and present the 2025-2027 Action Plan, prioritizing sectors such as infrastructure, energy, technology, mining, and agriculture.

**Iran to Continue Diplomatic Efforts to Ensure Peaceful Nature of Nuclear Program**
Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman, Ismail Bekayi, stated on social media that 'Iran is fully prepared to continue its diplomatic efforts to ensure the 'peaceful nature' of its nuclear program, which has been proven numerous times.' The fourth round of indirect talks between Iran and the US is currently taking place in Muscat, Oman. Bekayi emphasized that Iran will continue to defend its legal rights to peaceful nuclear energy under the NPT framework. He also stated that Iran is committed to ensuring the peaceful nature of its nuclear program and will continue to work with the same determination to end the unjust and inhumane sanctions imposed on its people for a long time. The expectations of the parties in the talks are that they will first build mutual trust and then create a framework for an agreement on Iran's nuclear program. The US wants Iran to stop producing high-grade enriched uranium, which it believes is used for atomic bomb production. Iran, which claims that its nuclear program has always been peaceful, is willing to limit its program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, but is demanding guarantees that the US will not back down. Iran has stated that it will not accept the dismantling of its uranium enrichment centrifuges, a complete halt to uranium enrichment, or the reduction of enriched uranium stockpiles below the levels agreed upon in the 2015 agreement.

**Iran and US Resume Nuclear Talks in Oman**
The United States and Iran began a new round of negotiations over Tehran's nuclear program in Oman on Sunday (11), while the Iranian Foreign Minister declared that his country's right to enrich uranium is not negotiable. The Iranian Foreign Minister, Abbas Araqchi, will negotiate in Muscat with the US envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, in a context marked by Washington's demand to end any type of uranium enrichment in that country. 'The fourth round of indirect negotiations between Iran and the United States began a few minutes ago in Muscat, with Oman's mediation', reported the Iranian news agency Isna. 'The enrichment capacity is one of the honors and achievements of the Iranian nation', declared the Iranian Foreign Minister in a video released just before the start of the negotiations, adding that it is a 'non-negotiable' issue. The Iranian Chancellor said he hopes this round of negotiations with the United States will reach a 'decisive moment'. Without diplomatic relations since 1980, Iran and the United States have held three sessions of negotiations mediated by Oman since April 12 on the sensitive issue of Iran's nuclear program. The goal of the meetings is to conclude a new agreement to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting the numerous sanctions that paralyze its economy. Iran defends that its objectives are exclusively civilian, although the United States and other Western countries fear that the country is trying to develop an atomic bomb and warn that the country is approaching the level of uranium enrichment necessary for this. 'The more we advance, the more consultations and analyses we need, and the more time the delegations need to consider the issues raised', said Araqchi on Friday. US Vice President JD Vance estimated on Wednesday that the negotiations were 'on the right track'. In 2015, Iran and six major powers (United States, Russia, China, France, United Kingdom, and Germany) had already reached an agreement on this, but it was washed away when Trump, in his first term, withdrew from the pact in 2018. Since then, Iran has retreated from its commitment to limit uranium enrichment to 3.67%. Currently, it occurs at 60%, close to the 90% needed for military purposes. Its nuclear reserves are a source of concern for Western powers.

'An age limit is a clear good idea, as solarium use increases the risk of breast cancer by 20 percent. I hope that the age limit will send a strong signal to the population that a trip to the solarium is a bad idea,' he said. According to the Cancer Society, around 275 people die of breast cancer every year. It is also the most common type of cancer among young people, and three out of four cases of breast cancer among solarium users under 30 can be explained by solarium use. The Health Board advises against using solariums altogether, as it increases the risk of breast cancer and common skin cancer, and can cause permanent damage to eyes and skin. The risk increases the younger you are when you start using solariums,' the board said. The Danish Solarium Association argues that introducing age verification will lead to higher costs and that some solarium centers will close. This could lead to users, regardless of age, being referred to private solariums, which is a step backward for safety, according to the association's chairman, Henrik Marx.

**Solar Geoengineering: A 'Plan B' for Climate Change?**
The year 2024 was the warmest on record globally, with the effects of climate change becoming increasingly apparent. The Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C is becoming more elusive. This has given new momentum to the research of technologies that modify the Earth's solar radiation (SRM) to counteract climate change. SRM technologies were previously taboo due to ethical concerns and the fact that they do not address the root causes of climate change. Private foundations and countries like the US, UK, and China have invested millions in SRM research. Companies like 'Make Sunsets' have already begun outdoor experiments, with more projects planned for this year. The upcoming SRM conference in Cape Town will discuss the scientific, social, and political aspects of solar geoengineering. Gernot Wagner, a climate economist, notes that the question is no longer 'if' but 'when' SRM technology will be used. SRM can reduce temperatures, but it does not reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making it a 'Plan B' for climate change. Critics argue that SRM creates false hopes and distracts from the need to reduce emissions. The technology also raises concerns about unintended consequences, such as health risks and acid rain. A group of over 500 scientists has signed an international appeal calling for a ban on SRM. However, some researchers argue that SRM should be researched and tested in a controlled environment. The Swiss government has proposed a resolution at the UN Environment Assembly to conduct a benefit-risk analysis of SRM, but it was withdrawn due to opposition from some countries. The debate on SRM continues, with some advocating for a moratorium on the technology until its risks and benefits are better understood.

**Early warning sign: This week's energy summit presages a difficult COP30**
The recent International Energy Agency summit in the UK, which was attended by policymakers from 60 countries, has raised concerns about global commitment to decarbonisation ahead of the COP30 meeting in Brazil. China, a key player in managing global energy security, was not present, and the US government's prioritization of fossil fuels and cancellation of clean energy support has sent a worrying message. The European Union and the UK have shown close cooperation on this issue, but their credibility as climate leaders is impacted by their own decarbonisation efforts and partnerships. The US has pulled out of climate diplomacy and cancelled support for clean energy, making it harder for civil society to support climate action overseas. China's disengagement is also a concern, as it is key to global solar manufacturing and lithium battery production. The article concludes that a gaping hole is emerging in climate leadership, and higher levels of ambition are needed, including updated nationally determined contributions from states to reduce their emissions in line with the Paris agreement.

**Geoengineering Solar: A Risky Solution to Climate Change?**
The Planetary Sunshade Foundation, a private initiative based in Los Angeles, proposes deploying a massive sunshade in space to reflect sunlight and reduce the greenhouse effect on Earth. This geoengineering technique, also known as solar radiation modification (SRM), aims to reflect part of the solar radiation back into space to reduce global warming. However, scientists warn of the risks and potential consequences of such an approach. 'The problem is an ethical risk. The possibility is that [geoengineering solar] will be used as an excuse to not leave fossil fuels,' says Alex Godoy Faúndez, a Chilean researcher and member of the Chilean government's climate change advisory committee. 'Another aspect has to do with inequality, because changing the climate balance is changing the planet's energy equilibria,' he adds. The scientist also notes that a unilateral application of geoengineering could harm many countries and affect agriculture and food security. In 2022, over 400 scientists and experts from 60 countries signed an open letter calling for an international agreement to prevent the unilateral use of geoengineering. 'We advocate for alternatives that are safer and more effective with a just energy transition, conservation of ecosystems, promotion and investment in clean technologies, and a global climate justice,' concludes Alex Godoy Faúndez. The geoengineering solar project has been met with a strong rejection from the scientific community and local communities, who fear the potential risks and consequences of such an approach. 'The problem is that this type of technological solution is driven by the mentality of Silicon Valley, which is to manage problems with technology rather than addressing the causes,' says Silvia Ribeiro, a journalist and advisor to the HOME platform, which monitors the impacts of technology on the environment.

**Tunisia Signs Four Contracts for 500 MW of Solar Electricity by 2027**
Tunisia has taken a significant step towards its energy transition. On March 25, 2025, the Minister of Energy and Mines, Fatma Thabet Chiboub, oversaw the signing of four agreements for the production of 500 MW of solar photovoltaic electricity. These contracts are part of the national energy strategy, which aims to reach 35% of renewable energies in the electricity mix by 2030, in order to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. According to the Secretary of State for Energy Transition, Wael Chouchane, the total value of investments related to these projects is 1.2 billion Tunisian dinars. The projects include a 198 MW project in El Khadna (Mazzouna delegation, Sidi Bouzid governorate), as well as three other projects of 100 MW each: one in El Ksour (Gafsa), one in Manzel Habib (Gabès), and the last one in Mazzouna (Sidi Bouzid). The contracts will now need to be approved by the Council of Ministers and Parliament, before a start date in 2026. The projects are expected to be operational by 2027. The signing ceremony was attended by diplomatic representatives from several partner countries, including France, Germany, the UK, Japan, the EU, and Norway (via its ambassador accredited in Algeria). This initiative marks a turning point for Tunisia, which seeks to diversify its energy sources and strengthen its energy independence while respecting its environmental commitments.

**Trump's Withdrawal from the Paris Agreement: A Financial and Geopolitical Game-Changer**
Donald Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement has not only had a geopolitical impact, but also a significant financial benefit for American taxpayers. The US has been shouldering a disproportionate share of the budget of the UNFCCC Secretariat, contributing around 22% to its financing. The operating costs of the Secretariat for the 2024-2025 cycle are estimated to be over $96 million. The Green Climate Fund (GCF), the financial arm of the Paris Agreement, has long relied on US contributions. The latest commitment by the Biden administration of $3 billion for the second replenishment of the GCF (2024-2027) underscores the significant financial obligations. According to Trump's executive order, international agreements like the Paris Climate Agreement 'redirect American tax dollars to countries that do not need or deserve financial support in the interest of the American people.' India and China, for example, receive billions in climate 'social aid' while increasing their consumption of fossil fuels to meet the growing energy demand, which is expected to continue until at least the middle of the century. Trump's action has stopped the flow of billions of dollars into the UN bureaucracy, which aims to save the world from a dystopian future based on pseudo-science and manipulated predictions. The withdrawal of the US has also weakened the climate agenda, as developing countries have been slow to follow the Paris Agreement's goal of reducing CO2 emissions. The politicians of the Third World are happy to accept U.N. handouts for 'green' energy projects, but they shy away from the pressure of climate communists to give up the fossil fuels needed for economic growth. Without American money, the UN's ability to force developing countries to adopt strict measures for 'decarbonization' is significantly restricted. The much-vaunted moral authority of the Paris Agreement has long been tainted by the hypocrisy of Western elites, who urge the global South to install wind turbines and solar panels while their own countries continue to lead a 'carbon-rich' lifestyle. The US withdrawal from the climate club further undermines the seal of virtue and will likely encourage countries of the global South to design their own energy strategies without worrying about diplomatic and financial retaliation - and without worrying about being ethically short-sighted.

**Duncan McLaren's Proposal for Solar Geoengineering Research: A Symmetrical Approach and International Agreement**
Duncan McLaren, a British geographer, has proposed a way to make solar geoengineering research more acceptable despite its high risks. McLaren suggests that a symmetrical approach to injecting sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere could mitigate the risks of solar geoengineering. However, many experts are skeptical about the feasibility of this approach. The US is seen as a plausible country to implement solar geoengineering due to its widespread network of military bases. McLaren also proposes an international agreement to ban the use of solar geoengineering, but allow for research. This agreement would create a space for discussion and debate about the risks and benefits of solar geoengineering. McLaren emphasizes the need for ethical guidelines and regulations for solar geoengineering research, citing the American Geophysical Union's recommendations for responsible research. The EU has also proposed a moratorium on solar geoengineering and a global governance framework to prevent its use. McLaren believes that these guidelines are necessary to ensure that solar geoengineering research is conducted in a responsible and transparent manner.

**Countries Lag Behind in Submitting Climate Plans**
Only 10 out of nearly 200 signatories to the Paris Agreement of 2015 have submitted their updated strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, according to the UN Climate database. The UK, Switzerland, and Brazil, the host of the upcoming COP30 in November, have deposited their updated documents, but others are missing, including China, India, and the European Union. They are, however, expected to do so within the year. The US plan, submitted under the Biden administration, is likely to be ineffective due to Donald Trump's re-election, who has announced a new withdrawal of his country from the Paris Agreement. Ebony Holland, from the International Institute for Environment and Development, believes that this withdrawal is 'clearly a setback' for climate diplomacy and may explain the caution of other countries. 'There are clearly major geopolitical changes underway that are complicated for international cooperation, especially on big issues like climate change,' she observes. The Paris Agreement requires signatories to regularly review and update their commitments to reduce carbon emissions, known as 'determined national contributions' (DNCs). These documents outline, for example, how a country plans to develop renewable energy or phase out coal. These strategies are intended to reflect each country's share of the effort to keep global warming well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. However, according to the UN, previous plans are leading the world, already 1.3°C warmer, towards a catastrophic warming of 2.6°C to 2.8°C. 'It is clearly a setback for climate diplomacy and may explain the caution of other countries,' said Ebony Holland. 'There are clearly major geopolitical changes underway that are complicated for international cooperation, especially on big issues like climate change,' she added. The UN Climate database has set deadlines for the submission of DNCs, but the delay in depositing these documents does not incur a penalty. 'It is reasonable to take a bit more time to ensure that these plans are of the highest quality,' said Simon Stiell, the UN Climate Secretary-General. More than 170 countries have indicated that they plan to submit their plan this year, with a majority expected to do so before COP30. 'At the latest, the secretariat team must have received them by September,' added the Secretary-General of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Some countries need to clarify their vision, acknowledges Linda Kalcher, executive director of the European think tank Strategic Perspectives. However, 'what is worrying is that if too many countries are late, it can give the impression that they do not have the will to act,' she fears. The European Union is also facing a rise in far-right parties hostile to climate policies. The bloc of 27 countries plans to deposit its plan 'well before' COP30 and intends to remain 'a leading voice for international climate action,' a spokesperson said. China, the world's largest polluter turned largest investor in renewables, is also expected to unveil its plan this year. For now, few strategies are up to par, according to Climate Action Tracker, which criticizes the latest updates from the United Arab Emirates, the United States, New Zealand, and Switzerland. Only the UK is doing well, according to this research group.

**US Withdrawal from Paris Climate Agreement: A Blow to Global Climate Diplomacy**
US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement has dealt a significant blow to global climate diplomacy. Despite this, climate scientists remain optimistic, citing the growing competitiveness of renewable energy and batteries. The US is responsible for 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with a per capita emissions rate twice that of Germany. The other 194 countries party to the Paris Agreement are unlikely to follow the US out of the agreement, according to Niklas Höhne, founder of the New Climate Institute. Instead, they will focus on submitting more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by the next climate conference in November in Belém, Brazil. China's influence on the international climate stage is expected to grow, while the EU will face challenges in building progressive coalitions without the US as a partner. The loss of US funding for climate finance is a significant setback, but the new funding goal of $300 billion by 2035 is not immediately at risk. However, if the Trump administration pressures multilateral development banks to reduce their climate finance, this goal could be in jeopardy. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg has pledged to fill the funding gap, at least in part, through his foundation. Climate scientists remain optimistic that the US will continue to reduce emissions, albeit at a slower pace than under the previous administration. Many US states, including California, are committed to ambitious climate goals and will continue to pursue them. However, Trump's decision to abandon all support for electric vehicle incentives and to stop the payment of $7.5 billion for the expansion of charging infrastructure is a significant setback for the transition to electric vehicles. The picture in the energy sector is mixed, with Trump pushing for the promotion of fossil fuels and the cancellation of offshore wind farm projects, while local and regional regulations are driving the growth of solar and wind power on land. The growing demand for artificial intelligence is also driving an increase in energy consumption, leading to a renewed focus on nuclear power.

**US Withdrawal from Paris Agreement: A Blow to Climate Diplomacy**
The United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement is a blow to climate diplomacy, forcing other actors like Brazil, China, and the European Union to step up and maintain the pace of negotiations. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015 to combat climate change, has been ratified by almost the entire international community, with exceptions like Iran, Libya, and Yemen. The US has attempted to withdraw from the agreement twice, with the first attempt in 2017 having little impact due to the agreement's rules. The current withdrawal, announced by President Donald Trump, will be faster, according to observers. Frances Colon, from the Center for American Progress, says the agreement 'exceeds the United States.' However, international experts suggest that other countries will have to increase their efforts. China is 'concerned' about the new US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, according to a Foreign Ministry spokesperson. 'Climate change is a common challenge faced by all humanity, and no country can remain insensitive or solve the problem alone,' said spokesperson Guo Jiakun. The China and Brazil, which will host the COP30 conference in November, are two of the main partners of the BRICS group, which will have to face the challenge of Trump. The BRICS group, led by Brazil, aims to build and not worsen things, according to Brazilian diplomat Eduardo Saboia. However, Brazil also defends its right to continue exploring its hydrocarbon resources, a measure it considers justified, given its clean energy generation, mainly due to its water resources. A similar attitude is defended by President Trump, who guarantees that he is not against renewable energies, but wants to keep all options open. 'This may be a year of leadership for the global South,' says Tim Sahay, co-director of the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab at Johns Hopkins University. The position is also maintained by India, whose Prime Minister Narendra Modi defends the 'leadership' of his country in solar and wind energy, while maintaining the exploration of coal and not hiding his geopolitical affinity with Trump. During the first US withdrawal, the Chinese maintained the Paris Agreement and did not renounce their long-term goals. Currently, China produces more than half of the world's electric vehicles, 70% of wind turbines, and 80% of solar panels, which has drastically reduced costs, even for countries that export it. 'China's performance in implementing green technologies can be a lifeline,' said Li Shuo, an expert at the Asia Society Policy Institute. In the COPs, Beijing is an indispensable negotiator, informally leading the negotiations with rich countries on behalf of a group of developing countries. The European Union has a long tradition of climate leadership and has reduced its emissions by 7.5% between 2022 and 2023, ahead of other major rich countries. It is also the main international financier in the fight against climate change. However, countries like Germany have asked the European Commission to slow down the energy transition in sectors such as the automotive industry. Other small actors are showing good will, such as Colombia, which is leading international efforts to gradually eliminate oil, coal, and gas, although they are its main source of external revenue.

**China, EU, and Brazil to Take the Lead on Climate Change After US Withdrawal**
The United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change is a significant blow to global diplomacy, leaving other actors such as China, the European Union, and Brazil to take the lead in maintaining momentum for climate negotiations. China is 'concerned' about the new US withdrawal, said a Foreign Ministry spokesperson, adding that 'the climate crisis is a common challenge facing all humanity, and no country can remain insensitive or solve the problem alone.' China and Brazil, which will host the COP30 climate conference in November, are key partners in the BRICS group of emerging economies. Brazil's president, Eduardo Saboia, said, 'The BRICS come to build, not to worsen things.' However, Brazil defends its right to continue exploiting its oil and gas resources, which it believes is justified given its significant renewable energy generation capacity. India also maintains a similar position, with its prime minister, Narendra Modi, defending the country's leadership in solar and wind energy while continuing to exploit coal and maintaining its geopolitical ties with Trump. China has remained committed to the Paris Agreement and has made significant progress in deploying green technologies, producing over half of the world's electric vehicles, 70% of wind turbines, and 80% of solar panels. The European Union has a long tradition of climate leadership and has reduced its emissions by 7.5% between 2022 and 2023, making it the largest international financier in the fight against climate change.
