**US Stock Market: 'New Correction Unlikely!' - JP Morgan**
Despite the recent downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody's, the US stock market is expected to continue its upward trend. According to JP Morgan, a pullback is possible, but a correction is 'unlikeley'. The analysts point to three factors: the ongoing trade negotiations between the US and China, the positioning of market participants, and the recent decrease in buying activity by individual investors. The S&P 500 has already recovered its losses from the 'Liberation Day' and is now up 12.6% compared to last year, but the market is still overvalued, with the Buffett Indicator at 211% and the Shiller-KGV at 36.6. JP Morgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, remains skeptical about the growth prospects of the US economy, warning of a possible recession. The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI) has dropped by 1.0% to 99.4, the largest decline since March 2023, which is seen as a warning signal.

**The next great job churn is already starting**
The US job market is experiencing a shift due to artificial intelligence, with employment growth slowing in tech-centric areas such as the San Francisco Bay Area. According to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller indices, home prices in Dallas and Tampa are growing at a slower rate, indicating reduced interstate migration. Meanwhile, job growth in Buffalo and Pittsburgh is above the pre-pandemic pace due to reduced outmigration from the Northeast and Midwest. The decline in employment in the San Francisco Bay Area, despite massive investment in AI, is attributed to the impact of AI on labor demand, particularly in white-collar jobs such as software engineers. Boston, another knowledge job-centric metro area, is also showing signs of labor market softness. Researchers at Louisiana State University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology predict that metro areas with high educational attainment and high costs of living will be the most vulnerable to AI disruption. However, it's possible that an AI shock will lead to more balanced economic development across the US, but this may take time, particularly while interstate migration remains constrained by a dysfunctional housing market.

**US Leading Economic Index Falls by 1.0% in April, Marking Largest Monthly Decline Since March 2023**
The US Leading Economic Index (LEI) released by the Conference Board (CB) fell by 1.0% in April, marking the largest monthly decline since March 2023. This is a more significant drop than expected by analysts and an acceleration from the 0.8% decline in March. According to Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, CB's chief economist, 'Consumer expectations have become increasingly pessimistic each month since January 2025, while the contribution of building permits and average manufacturing industry hours has become negative in April.' However, she notes that 'although the six-month growth rate of the Consumer Confidence Index has become more negative, it has not fallen enough to trigger a recession signal.' The LEI is a composite of ten prospective measures, including initial unemployment claims, new ISM orders, and changes in the S&P 500 stock price. Historically, the LEI and S&P 500 have moved in tandem, but they have diverged since the end of 2022. The accelerated decline in the LEI last month corresponds to the drop in the benchmark index after the 'day of liberation.'

**Market likely to open lower amid negative global sentiment**
The Indian stock market is expected to open lower on Monday due to negative global sentiment. The GIFT Nifty May 2025 futures were trading 61 points lower in early trade. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth Rs 17,669.11 crore in the secondary market during May 2025, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net buyers to the tune of Rs 5,187.09 crore. However, global markets were down due to Moody's decision to downgrade the U.S. sovereign credit rating from AAA to AA1, citing concerns over the country's rising debt burden. The Dow Jones futures were down 196 points on Monday, and Asian markets traded mostly lower, influenced by the U.S. credit downgrade and mixed economic data from China. The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for May came in at 50.8, down from 52.2 in April. The S&P BSE Sensex declined 200.15 points or 0.24% to 82,330.59, and the Nifty 50 index fell 42.30 points or 0.17% to 25,019.80.

**What To Expect in the Markets This Week**
This week, investors will focus on several key events, including earnings reports from major retailers such as Home Depot, Lowe's, Target, and TJX Cos., as well as housing market data for April and speeches from Federal Reserve officials. Market watchers will be looking for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that tariffs could drive prices higher. Several tech, travel, and medical companies are also scheduled to report, including Palo Alto Networks, Snowflake, and Intuit. The Federal Reserve has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market. Investors will also be following home-seller data, jobless-claim numbers, and the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. As one analyst noted, 'The market is looking for signs of consumer weakness, and these earnings reports will be a key indicator of that.'

**Dogecoin Creator Warns of Global Economic Bubble: 'The World's Economy Needs to be Destroyed'**
Billy Markus, the co-creator of Dogecoin, warned about a global economic bubble in a recent post on X. He stated that the historic high in US housing prices is unsustainable, but that 'the world's economy needs to be destroyed' to pop the bubble. According to a graph shared by Markus, the Case Shiller House Price Index, which tracks US housing prices, reached a record high of 299.9 in 2025, surpassing the 135-year historical record. The increase in housing prices is attributed to high demand and low supply. Economists note that this index has historically been at a high level, similar to 2006, when the housing market bubble burst and contributed to the 2008 global financial crisis, which is also cited as one of the reasons for the creation of Bitcoin. Markus stated, 'The US housing market has reached its most inaccessible level in history.' Some users on X disagreed with Markus' statement, arguing that the increase in housing prices is not solely due to demand and supply, but also due to inflationary environment, increasing construction costs, and other economic factors. Markus, also known as 'Shibetoshi Nakamoto' in the crypto community, is a well-known figure in the Dogecoin space. His comments have sparked a new debate in the economic community.

**Case-Shiller: U.S. Home Prices Rise in February as Tight Supply Supports Market**
The FHFA House Price Index rose 0.1% in February, with annual appreciation at 3.9%. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index also showed a 3.9% annual increase in February. Regionally, New York led all major metros with a 7.7% annual increase, followed by Chicago (7.0%) and Cleveland (6.6%). Despite mortgage rates holding in the mid-6% range and affordability remaining a key constraint, limited inventory continues to support prices. Analysts note that much of the annual appreciation occurred earlier in the 12-month window, with recent months showing flatter performance. Home prices are likely to continue their slow upward trend in the near term, supported by persistent supply constraints and stable demand.

**US Home Prices Slow Down in February, According to S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index**
The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index, which tracks national home prices, reported a 3.9% increase in February compared to the same month last year. This marks a slowdown in the rate of home price growth, which was 4.1% in January. The 20-city composite index, which tracks home prices in major US cities, also rose 4.5% in February compared to the same month last year. This was slightly below the market expectation of a 4.6% increase. New York saw the largest year-over-year increase in home prices, with a 7.7% rise. Chicago and Cleveland also saw significant increases, with 7% and 6.6% respectively. Tampa was the only city to see a decline in home prices, with a 1.5% decrease.

**Northeast city sees biggest gain as home sales prices rise again**
The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index reported accelerating home price growth in major US metros, with New York City experiencing a 7.7% annual gain in January, followed by Chicago and Boston with 7.5% and 6.6% respectively. However, Tampa, FL, showed the lowest return with a 1.5% decline. The market has been affected by rising mortgage rates, which peaked at 7.04% in November, but have since leveled out in the 6.6% to 6.7% range. Analysts suggest that a dearth of affordable homes and economic uncertainty may impact the spring market, but also present opportunities for buyers. According to Jones, the best time to sell a home is around April 13, but economic uncertainty could interfere with the spring market.

**S&P CORELOGIC CASE-SHILLER INDEX RECORDS 4.1% ANNUAL GAIN IN JANUARY 2025**
The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index recorded a 4.1% annual gain in January 2025, a slight increase from the previous reading in December 2024. The 10-City Composite saw an annual increase of 5.3%, while the 20-City Composite posted a year-over-year increase of 4.7%. New York reported the highest annual gain among the 20 cities with a 7.7% increase in January, followed by Chicago and Boston with annual increases of 7.5% and 6.6%, respectively. Nicholas Godec, Head of Fixed Income Tradables & Commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said, 'Home price growth continued to moderate in January, reflecting a clear two-part story across the past year.' He added, 'The National Composite Index posted a 4.1% annual gain, with the bulk of appreciation -- 4.8% -- occurring in the first half of the year. Prices declined 0.7% in the second half, as high mortgage rates and affordability constraints weighed on buyer demand and market activity.' The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index remains historically elevated, and long-term homeowners have continued to build equity, but the current cycle highlights how sensitive home prices are to changes in financing conditions and buyer affordability.
