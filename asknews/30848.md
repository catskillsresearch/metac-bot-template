**Netanyahu Expresses Desire to Abandon US Military Aid**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed his desire to gradually abandon US military aid, according to Israeli newspaper Maariv. Netanyahu made the statement during a session of the Israeli parliament's security and foreign affairs committee, which comes amidst 'tensions' in his relationship with the US administration. Netanyahu said, 'We receive around 4 billion dollars annually to purchase arms, I believe we will be able to do without it, just like we did with economic aid.' The reason behind Netanyahu's statement is unclear, but it comes at a time when the relationship between Trump and Netanyahu is strained, with reports in Hebrew media that Trump has cut off contact with Netanyahu due to suspicions that the Israeli leader is manipulating him. In a separate issue, Netanyahu has promised a new law that will only pass through the committee, claiming that it will enlist 10,500 ultra-Orthodox Jews in the military over the next two years. However, the promise was met with skepticism by the leader of the Israel Beitenu party, Avigdor Lieberman, who said, 'This is less than 30% of the annual enlistment goal, how can you consider it an achievement?' Ultra-Orthodox Jews have been protesting against military service since the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in June 2024 that they must be conscripted, and banned financial aid to institutions that refuse to serve in the military.

Netanyahu stated, 'We receive around 4 billion dollars annually to purchase weapons, I believe we will be able to do without it, just like we did with economic aid.'

**New Poll Shows Significant Decline in Netanyahu's Popularity**
A new poll in Israel has shown a significant decline in the popularity of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to its lowest levels since the beginning of this year. This decline comes after the Yemeni Houthi group's attack on Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv and the Israeli army's failure to rescue captives from Gaza. According to the poll, the governing coalition would receive 48 seats in the 120-seat Knesset if elections were held today, which is the lowest level for the coalition since the beginning of 2025, as reported by Maariv newspaper.

**Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu needs PA in 'day after' Gaza**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to launch a new round of intensive warfare in the Gaza Strip to defeat Hamas, but his strategy has been criticized for lacking an effective alternative to Hamas and ignoring the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Netanyahu has stopped all international humanitarian aid entering the Strip, but this move has been ineffective in stopping Hamas's administrative functions. The US President, Donald Trump, has reached an agreement with the Houthis in Yemen to stop targeting international shipping, but this does not include stopping missile launches against Israel. Trump is also continuing talks with Iran over a nuclear agreement and is planning to reach an agreement with Saudi Arabia on a non-military nuclear capability. However, these talks do not seem to support Israel's plan to renew a full-scale war in the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu's war plans are also facing domestic difficulties, including a shortage of new recruits for the IDF and difficulties with reservist call-ups. The writer expresses concern that Netanyahu's strategy will not lead to a successful outcome and that a miracle or a change of heart by the prime minister is needed.

**Netanyahu: Israel Will Annex 30% of West Bank, No Disagreement with Trump**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that 'Tel Aviv will be able to annex 30% of the West Bank' and emphasized that there is 'no disagreement' with US President Donald Trump. Netanyahu made this statement during a meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee, saying that 'there has been no change in my position since the 'Deal of the Century' announced by Trump regarding annexation.' He added that 'Palestinians will be able to manage their lives, and we will be able to annex 30% of the land' in the West Bank. Netanyahu said, 'I have heard in the media that I and Trump are different.' He added, 'Trump and I speak every few days, and he has said that we see the same thing, and I don't think you will hear about a Palestinian state, and the talk about a rift between us on TV channels has political reasons.' Netanyahu also stated that 'we did not ask for permission to attack the Houthis, nor did we ask for permission for our military plans in Gaza, as the Americans volunteered to intervene with the Houthis, and they said they would take care of themselves when that stops.' He added that Trump will not recognize a Palestinian state and put Israel's security at risk. Netanyahu also announced that 10,500 Haredim will be recruited to the army over the next two years.

**Netanyahu Considers Early Elections Amid Ultra-Orthodox Threats**
According to Israeli news site 'Times of Israel', Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering dissolving the coalition government and holding early elections, citing threats from ultra-Orthodox parties. A senior minister told 'Times of Israel' that Netanyahu is aware that there is no solution to the issue of conscription of ultra-Orthodox Jews in the Israeli military, and is trying to buy time. The minister said, 'Netanyahu knows that there is no solution to this issue. He is trying to gain time, and will eventually say: I have not retreated on this important issue.' Netanyahu is expected to win the elections with the support of reserve soldiers and non-soldiers who cannot coexist with the current unequal military conscription system. In February, Defense Minister Israel Katz said that only 7% of ultra-Orthodox Jews responded to conscription requests. Katz described the current situation in Israel as 'not indicating any real response to conscription orders.' Despite the current Knesset term lasting until 2026, all indications suggest that elections may be held by the end of 2025 if Netanyahu decides to pursue this scenario.

**Netanyahu Embroiled in Controversies as Israeli Government Passes Laws and Approves Budget**
In recent news, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been involved in several controversies. He has filed a defamation lawsuit against the Democrats party chief, Yair Golan, who accused him of 'selling Israel's security for money' in the Qatargate scandal. Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the Shin Bet head's ouster, with opposition leader Yair Lapid warning that 'crazy incitement' against Ronen Bar could lead to 'political murder.' Additionally, Netanyahu's aide, Jonatan Urich, has been accused of having no security clearance, and the Prime Minister's Office has dismissed the report as 'fake news.' Meanwhile, the Israeli government has passed several laws, including one that greatly boosts political control over the appointment of judges. The Knesset has also approved the 2025 budget, staving off elections. In other news, former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has registered a new political party ahead of the 2026 elections, and the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hasharon has said it will defy an order to shut a new mall on Shabbat amid Haredi threats.

**Ditching ceasefire, Netanyahu uses Palestinian lives to buy pro-war allies' votes**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has deliberately violated the Gaza ceasefire agreement, unleashing massive bombing raids that have killed many women and children. According to Haaretz military analyst Amos Harel, 'it appears that the decision to return to fighting was not merely a security move,' but rather a ploy to bolster Netanyahu's fragile coalition and ensure his survival. Netanyahu is exploiting the war in Gaza to attract the Otzma Yehudit party, headed by Itamar Ben-Gvir, and to pass the 2025 budget, which is crucial for his continued rule. Analyst Avi Bar-Eli notes that the timing of the military plan's implementation is linked to the coalition crisis facing Netanyahu, and that the government is scheduled to bring the economic adjustments bill to a vote on Wednesday, with a series of votes to approve the 2025 budget set to conclude next Monday. Netanyahu's ultimate goal is not to achieve a military victory but rather to consolidate his power by pushing Israel toward an authoritarian regime based on fueling perpetual wars on multiple fronts.

**Netanyahu's Nightmare: The 2025 Budget and the Collapse of His Government**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces a significant challenge as the Knesset must vote on the 2025 budget for the occupied territory before the end of the current month. If the vote is not approved within this deadline, the parliament will be automatically dissolved and early elections will be held within 90 days. The proposed budget suffers from a significant deficit of around 8.5% of the national income, due to the increasing military spending to fund wars in the region. Despite this deficit, the religious parties insist on increasing spending to reach $32.43 billion, the highest in the history of the occupied territory. To address this situation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich aims to impose new taxes worth $10 billion, in addition to taxes on undistributed corporate profits worth $2.8 billion. If these taxes are not approved, the deficit will worsen and exceed 20%, posing a significant threat to economic stability. The religious parties, particularly Shas and Yisrael Beiteinu, have made the exemption of the 'Haredim' (ultra-Orthodox Jews) from military service a condition for their approval of the budget. This issue has sparked a deep conflict within the society, with secular and liberal parties considering this exemption a violation of the principle of equality among citizens, as the burden of fighting falls on their children alone. The government is under pressure to include the Haredim in the mandatory conscription system, especially with the growing need for more soldiers. If they are forced to join, they will strongly oppose the budget, exacerbating the current crisis and making it more complex. Netanyahu also faces a real crisis with his political allies, as some of them voted against the budget in the first reading, including the Likud and the National Union parties. If they continue to reject the budget, it will be difficult to achieve the necessary parliamentary majority to pass it. This is the real nightmare that haunts Netanyahu; if the budget fails, his government will collapse. His chances in any future elections seem slim, which may mean the end of his political career. Moreover, his downfall will strip him of the immunity he currently enjoys, and he will face prosecution for corruption charges within the occupied territory, and possibly international prosecution for war crimes.

**War or Bankruptcy: Netanyahu's High-Stakes Gamble with Israel's Future**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is facing a crisis that could lead to urgent parliamentary elections if the Knesset does not approve Israel's 2025 budget by March 31. The budget, which amounts to 619 billion shekels ($171.56 billion), is stalled due to sharp divisions between coalition parties, particularly the Haredi ones, over various items and issues. If the budget is not approved, the Knesset will be dissolved, and elections will be announced within 90 days, likely in July, effectively removing Netanyahu from the political scene. As one of the parties noted, 'the state budget for 2025 is not approved by the evening of March 31, the Knesset will be dissolved and parliamentary elections will be announced immediately within 90 days, most likely in July.'
