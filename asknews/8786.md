**Lithuanian MP: Baltic States Will Never Recognize Russian Annexation of Crimea**
Lithuanian MP Emanueleis Zingieris stated at the Black Sea Security Forum in Odessa that the Baltic states will never recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea, even if the United States calls for it. He emphasized that support for Ukraine will remain unchanged, as its resistance is crucial for the security of the Baltic states. Zingieris said, 'Baltic countries will never recognize the annexation of Crimea, even if the Americans ask us to. We were under Soviet occupation for 50 years, and the West never recognized the occupation of the Baltic states. Our embassies functioned and issued passports in Washington, on 16th Street. We then tried to emulate the experience of Finland, which in November 1939 lost 26,000 lives, while Russia lost 126,000. But they survived, and we did not. People then concluded that it's better to fight and die on the battlefield than to end up later in a Siberian GULAG.' The question of Crimea in Ukraine peace talks is a contentious issue. US President Donald Trump presented a 'final proposal' for a peaceful resolution to the Russian-Ukrainian war, which includes 'de jure' recognition of Russia's control over Crimea and 'de facto' recognition of Russia's occupation of parts of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Ukraine will not recognize the annexation of Crimea and that all rumors about Trump's 'proposals' are not official information and do not represent the position of the United States.

**UK's North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Involvement in Ukraine Conflict**
The UK's North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been actively involved in the conflict in Ukraine, with the UK's Prime Minister, Kier Starmer, stating that a 'new era' has begun in relations between London and Brussels. The UK has been working closely with other NATO member states to develop a unified response to the conflict, including the creation of a joint expeditionary force (OEF) to enhance the capabilities of the UK and other Northern European countries. The OEF has been involved in several exercises and operations, including the 'Baltic Defender' exercise in 2019, which involved 20 ships and over 3,000 troops. The UK has also been working to develop a system to track and monitor Russian ships in the Baltic Sea, and has imposed sanctions on 93 oil tankers that it believes are transporting Russian oil. The UK has also been working with other NATO member states to develop a coordinated response to the conflict, including the creation of a 'Baltic Guardian' operation to monitor and track Russian ships in the Baltic Sea. The UK has also been working to develop a new concept for the OEF, which includes the development of a 'Nordic Warden' system to track and monitor Russian ships in the Baltic Sea. The UK has also been working to develop a new concept for the OEF, which includes the development of a 'Tarassis25' exercise to test the capabilities of the OEF in a simulated conflict scenario. The exercise is scheduled to take place in September 2025 and will involve a coordinated and synchronized attack on Russia along the northern border, from Murmansk to Kaliningrad, with the goal of destroying Russian operational and strategic forces that could respond or counter-attack.

**Former CIA Director Warns of Possible Russian Attack on Lithuania**
Former CIA Director David Petraeus believes that if Russia succeeds in its war against Ukraine, Lithuania may be the next country to face a Russian attack. According to Petraeus, Russia's goal is to overthrow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and establish a puppet government to control the entire country. 'As soon as this is done, you will see them focus on one of the Baltic states,' Petraeus said in a speech at the Policy Exchange think tank in London. Petraeus also noted that Lithuania has been a priority for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that the international community should have listened to him more. The possibility of a Russian attack on NATO countries has been discussed in Western media since 2023, with some sources suggesting that Russia may attack in 2025, while others have warned of a possible attack in 2026 or later. The US intelligence community has reported that Russia does not want a direct military conflict with the US and NATO, but will continue to engage in asymmetric activities that do not cross the threshold of a global military conflict. In December 2024, a Finnish newspaper reported that Russia had been practicing an attack on Finland and the Baltic countries, including Estonia, as well as Norway, and had not ruled out plans to carry out such an attack. In January 2025, the head of Poland's Ministry of National Defense, Wladyslaw Koscinski, admitted that a Russian attack on his country was possible. In January 2025, the German Minister of Defense, Boris Pistorius, also warned of the possibility of a Russian attack on NATO countries in 2029-2030, and emphasized the importance of strengthening the alliance's defense capabilities by that time. On March 25, it was reported that Russia is considering 15 possible scenarios for military conflicts by 2045, six of which relate to Northern Europe. On May 19, The New York Times reported that Russia is actively increasing its military presence near the Finnish border, with satellite images showing large-scale construction of new military infrastructure.

**European Defense Spending Increases, but Public Support is Uneven**
The European Union is increasing its military spending, but public support is uneven across the continent. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Europe, including Russia, saw a 17% increase in military spending in 2024, surpassing the level of the late Cold War era. Within the EU, defense spending reached €326 billion in 2024, approximately 1.9% of the EU's GDP. This marks the tenth consecutive year of growth, with a significant increase of over 30% compared to 2021. 23 of the 32 NATO member states met or exceeded the alliance's directive to allocate at least 2% of their GDP to defense spending in 2024. As tensions rise on NATO's eastern flank, the US has renewed its call for allies to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. The Baltic governments have already expressed their support for this proposal, with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania committing to increase their defense spending to 5% of GDP in the coming years. Poland has already allocated over 4% of its GDP to defense in 2024, while France plans to increase its defense spending by over €3 billion annually in the 2024-2030 period. Germany's military spending increased by 28% in 2024, with Chancellor Merz promising to convert the Bundeswehr into the strongest conventional army in Europe. Finland has begun constructing a metal fence along its 1,340 km border with Russia, and Spain plans to allocate €14 billion to improve its defense equipment and working conditions. However, public opinion is more complex, with the Eurobarometer standard survey of autumn 2024 showing that 33% of EU citizens believe that security and defense should be a top priority for the EU in the next five years, ahead of migration (29%) and economic issues (28%).

**Baltic Region Tensions Escalate as Russia and West Engage in Diplomatic and Military Standoff**
The Baltic region is becoming increasingly tense as Russia and the West engage in a diplomatic and military standoff. The situation escalated after Estonia detained a Russian tanker, which Russia saw as a provocation. The US has downplayed the incident, with President Donald Trump saying 'I'm not concerned' about Russia's military buildup in the region. However, the Baltic countries, including Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, are preparing for a potential military conflict with Russia. The NATO alliance is also increasing its military presence in the region, with a combined budget of $8.5 billion. Russia has accused the West of trying to limit its influence in the region and has threatened to take retaliatory measures. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the US may withdraw its troops from the region, which could leave the Baltic countries to face Russia alone. The Russian government has proposed a plan to clarify the border between Russia and the Baltic states, which could lead to a further escalation of the situation. The situation in the Baltic region is becoming increasingly tense, with both sides accusing each other of provocation and aggression. The situation is complex and multifaceted, with various interests and motivations at play. 'It's a game of chicken,' said Igor Dimitriev, a political technologist. 'If the US withdraws, the Baltic countries will be left to face Russia alone. But if Russia takes control of the Baltic Sea, it will be a major blow to the West.'

**Poland and Baltic Countries Agree on Joint Eastern Border Defense Project**
Poland and Baltic countries have agreed on a joint project to defend the eastern border of the European Union. The project, which aims to strengthen the 2,300 km border with Russia and Belarus, includes modern defensive barriers and systems, according to the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense. The initiative, which is based on existing national initiatives such as 'Baltic Defense Line' and 'Eastern Shield' of Poland, will ensure effective resource utilization and avoid duplication of measures. The project, set to be completed by 2028, will include advanced technologies, including air defense systems and electronic warfare capabilities, as well as enhanced reconnaissance capabilities. 'The four countries (Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) have jointly agreed on the Eastern Border Initiative,' said the ministry. 'The project aims to strengthen the EU's border with Russia and Belarus by creating modern defensive barriers and systems up to 20-40 kilometers deep.'

**Former CIA Director Petraeus Warns of Russia's Next Move: A Baltic Country in Crosshairs**
Former CIA Director David Petraeus has made a new claim about Russia, stating that if they are successful in the Ukraine war, they will target a Baltic country in Europe. Petraeus, who spoke at the Policy Exchange think tank in London, suggested that Russia may attack Lithuania as a way to test the West's resolve or as a precursor to a wider attack. He also criticized US President Donald Trump for giving Russian President Vladimir Putin 'a second chance' and US President Joe Biden for not adequately arming Ukrainian forces. Petraeus called for the US to provide F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine and stated that Putin's goal is to overthrow Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenski and replace him with a 'puppet leader' to control the entire country. He warned that if this happens, Russia will focus on a Baltic state. Petraeus said, 'We should have listened more to Putin's speeches, where Lithuania is frequently mentioned.' He also claimed that Russia's losses in the war are 'unimaginable'.

**Threats to Belarus and Russia: Expert Analysis**
Russian military expert Andrei Klintsevich discusses the threats facing Belarus and Russia. He notes that the situation on the western borders of the Union State is becoming more tense, with Poland's militarization, provocations from the Baltic states, and the strengthening of NATO's military infrastructure. Klintsevich warns that the construction of a military base in Estonia, the mining of borders with Belarus and Russia by Lithuania, and the establishment of anti-tank barriers by Latvia are real measures of security or a political spectacle. He emphasizes that the Union State cannot remain neutral in such conditions and that Russia and Belarus are acting as a single military space with a common air defense system and joint troop grouping. Klintsevich also discusses the possibility of a nuclear war, citing the statements of former Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaitė, who called Russia's nuclear arsenal 'an outdated instrument that no one is afraid of.' He notes that such statements are a manifestation of political blindness and that the Union State will respond to any provocation. The expert also talks about the military preparations of Poland, which is increasing its military presence and forming heavy mechanized divisions. He notes that Belarus and Russia are strengthening their cooperation and integration into the Eurasian Economic Union, which is actively expanding. Klintsevich also discusses the possibility of a large-scale war between NATO and the Union State, citing the plans of the alliance to increase its military presence in the Baltic region and the possibility of blocking the Kaliningrad region. He warns that any attempt to block the region would lead to a military escalation with severe consequences. The expert also talks about the future of NATO, noting that the alliance is unlikely to disintegrate in the near future, but its expansion to the east may slow down. He also discusses the possibility of the United States joining the BRICS group and the implications of this for the security of Russia and Belarus.

**Natalya Radina: Lukashenko's Regime Uses West-2025 Exercises as Pretext for Attack**
Natalya Radina, editor-in-chief of Charter97.org, believes that Putin may use the West-2025 exercises as a pretext to attack the Baltic states and Poland. She notes that the exercises will be directed against Western countries and will practice nuclear strikes. Radina also criticizes the Belarusian regime's statements about the exercises, calling Defense Minister Khrenin a liar. She argues that if the Ukrainian army had entered Belarus in 2022, it would have changed the course of the war and deprived Putin of a military bridgehead. Radina also comments on the potato shortage in Belarus, which she attributes to the regime's economic failures. She also discusses the disappearance of Anzhelika Melnikova, the head of the 'coordinating council', who is suspected of being an agent of the Belarusian security services. Radina urges not to use the word 'opposition' in relation to Tikhanovskaya's entourage, as the real leaders of the Belarusian resistance are in prison. She also believes that Lukashenko is afraid of a possible response to the West-2025 exercise by the Ukrainians and Europeans, but cannot resist pressure from Russia.

**Baltic Countries Prepare for Potential Russian Invasion**
The Baltic countries, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, are preparing a defensive line of almost 1,000 kilometers to counter a potential Russian invasion. The line will feature 1,000 bunkers, trenches, anti-tank ditches, ammunition depots, and supply shelters. However, the time is running out, as they estimate it will take 10 years to complete the project. Gabrielius Landsbergis, former Lithuanian Foreign Minister, stated, 'Putin will not let us wait that long.' The Baltic countries are concerned that Putin will attack one of them before 2030, and they are preparing for the worst. They have already started to install 'dragon's teeth' (concrete pyramids) along their borders and are reinforcing their bunkers to withstand artillery attacks. The countries are also demanding that NATO replace their 'deterrent' troops with combat-ready forces. NATO has announced the creation of a new mission, Centinela Báltico, to protect the Baltic Sea's submarine infrastructure from sabotage.

**Baltic Countries Fear Russia's Quick Rearmament and Redeployment After Ukraine Ceasefire**
The defense ministers of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have warned that the ceasefire in Ukraine will increase the threat to regional security as Russia will rearm and redeploy troops to the NATO's north-eastern flank, according to the Financial Times. The Baltic countries are concerned that Russia will not stop at Ukraine and is already planning to increase military production and deploy additional troops along their borders. 'We all understand that when the war in Ukraine is stopped, Russia will quickly reassign its forces. This means that the level of threat will also quickly increase,' said Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur. Lithuanian Defense Minister Darius Gankauskas made similar remarks during a recent visit to the UK: 'Let's not indulge in illusions. Let's not deceive ourselves that Russia will be finished after Ukraine. Russia will use the time after the ceasefire to accelerate the buildup of its military potential. They already have a huge, battle-hardened army that will become even larger.' Pevkur believes that of the 600,000 Russian servicemen currently in Ukraine, 300,000 will be redeployed to other areas. 'These people will not return to different parts of Russia to harvest corn or do something else, because the salary they receive in the army is five to ten times higher than what they could receive in their hometown,' he noted. The Baltic countries are particularly concerned about the large-scale military exercises by the West, which will take place near their borders in Russia and Belarus this fall. In January, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius stated that, given the growth of the Russian army, there is a possibility of a Russian attack on NATO countries in 2029-2030. In this regard, he emphasized the importance of strengthening the defense capabilities of the Alliance by that time. On March 25, Deputy Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Major General Vadim Skibitsky, stated that Russia is considering 15 possible scenarios of military conflicts by 2045, six of which relate to Northern Europe and four to Poland. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, commenting on the information from the GUR, stated that NATO will respond 'with full force' in case of a Russian attack on one of its member countries.

**Germany's BND Warns of Russia's Plans for Large-Scale War with NATO**
According to the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND), Russia is preparing for a large-scale war with NATO. The BND report states that the Kremlin views its relations with the West as a systemic conflict and is willing to use force to achieve its goals. The BND estimates that by the end of the current decade (2030), Russia may be fully prepared for a 'large-scale conventional war'. The Lithuanian intelligence service believes that while Russia is not yet ready to attack the entire alliance, it may 'test NATO' by launching military operations against one or more member countries to understand how the alliance will react to a threat. The BND report notes that despite the full-scale war with Ukraine, Russia's air force and navy remain combat-ready. If the war in Ukraine ends, Russian troops may be redeployed to the borders of Baltic countries. The report also states that Russia is replenishing its losses in the war against Ukraine and the Russian defense industry is producing more weapons than needed for the current war. Russia's military spending is growing at a record pace, reaching nearly €120 billion in 2025, which is 6% of its GDP. The Kremlin also plans to increase the size of its army to 1.5 million personnel and increase the amount of equipment and technology on its borders with NATO by 30-50%. As a reminder, Russia has already predicted 15 possible military conflict scenarios by 2045. About half of these scenarios relate to Northern Europe. 'Russia will try to resolve the Ukrainian issue by 2026,' said Vadim Skibitsky, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, during a roundtable discussion 'New contours of European security'. 'If the war continues for another 5-10 years, Russia will never be able to catch up with the US and China,' Skibitsky added. The Kremlin's geopolitical calculations relate to the period 2026-2035, with consequences extending to 2045. Countries in the Baltic region and Poland are at particular risk, according to Skibitsky.

**Russia Prepares for War in Europe: 15 Scenarios Planned by 2045**
According to Andriy Kovalenko, the head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at the SNBO, Russia has 15 possible scenarios for war in Europe by 2045. These scenarios include the possibility of Russia's allies, such as North Korea and Iran, being involved in the conflict. Kovalenko stated that Russia needs a break from the war in Ukraine, which has significantly drained its resources. One scenario involves Russia invading the Baltic states and quickly annexing them within 4-6 years. However, Russia cannot achieve this alone and needs to form a full-fledged military alliance with North Korea and Iran. Kovalenko also mentioned that Russia plans to use proxy forces, such as North Korean and Iranian soldiers in Russian uniforms, to wage war in Europe with China's tacit approval. Another scenario involves Russia continuing the war in Ukraine, draining resources from Europe, and forming normal relations with the US and China, eventually exiting US sanctions and causing the collapse of the European Union from within. This would involve supporting eurosceptic politicians in European countries, leading to their rise to power and the eventual collapse of the EU. Kovalenko also mentioned that there are scenarios involving a pause in the war in 2026, as it is exhausting Russia's resources, and a scenario involving the return to a military solution to the 'demilitarization' of Ukraine. None of these scenarios involve a complete end to the war, democratization of Russia, and its peaceful coexistence with all countries, as was the case at least at the beginning of Vladimir Putin's presidency.

**Zelensky Warns of Russian Attack on NATO Countries in 2025**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated on February 14 that Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for an attack on NATO countries in 2025. According to Zelensky, Russia will prepare 15 divisions for the Belarusian direction this year, consisting of 100-150 thousand people. They can be deployed to Ukraine, Poland, or the Baltic states, as was the case in 2022. Zelensky believes that Putin is planning a war with NATO countries. 'I think that's his idea. Based on the intelligence I receive, I believe he is preparing for war with NATO countries next year,' he said. This comes after a report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) on December 6 stated that Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko signed a new security agreement, effectively attempting to annex Belarus. A document leaked in 2023 revealed Russia's plan to 'absorb' Belarus by 2030, including a unified currency and tax system, and the subordination of the Belarusian army to Russian laws.

**Baltic States Disconnect from Russia's Electrical Grid, Connect to EU's**
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have disconnected from Russia's electrical grid and connected to the European Union's grid through Poland, marking a significant step towards independence from Moscow. This strategic move ensures the three countries have full control over their infrastructure, adopting EU rules and leaving behind old dynamics of dependence. The EU has supported this move with a flood of funds, with over 1.23 billion euros from the Connecting Europe Facility covering 75% of the total cost. The remaining resources from the Recovery and Resilience Facility have strengthened the infrastructure of Latvia and Lithuania, solidifying their new energy autonomy. According to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, 'Today, history is written: the Baltic States ignite energy independence. The last electrical grids connected to Russia are now part of the EU's internal market, thanks to over a billion euros in European funding. The last power lines with Russia and Belarus will be dismantled. These connections with hostile neighbors belong to the past. This is freedom. Freedom from threats and blackmail. Congratulations on the start of this new era.' The next steps in the project include the completion of Harmony Link, a 700 MW interconnection between Lithuania and Poland, scheduled for 2030.

**Baltic Countries Synchronize Energy Systems with Europe, Marking End of Russian Dependence**
The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have successfully synchronized their energy systems with those of continental Europe, marking a historic moment in their journey to energy independence. According to Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, 'This is a great day, we have finally broken free from Russia's energy grip after 65 years.' Energy Minister Žygimantas Vaičiūnas added, 'We have turned the page on our dependence on Russia's energy and are now connected to the European grid, securing our energy independence.' Nauseda described the synchronization as a 'farewell to Russia' and 'farewell to Lenin,' referencing a famous German film title. The Baltic countries disconnected from Russia's energy system on February 8 and worked independently until February 9, when they connected to the European grid through the LitPol Link. They will now manage their own energy systems and balance their networks, unlike Russia's centralized system. By 2030, a new Harmony Link will be built to enable trade of electricity between Lithuania and Poland.

**Baltic Countries to Disconnect from Russian Energy Grid**
On February 8, 2025, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia will disconnect from the Russian energy grid, marking a new era for the three Baltic countries. This move is symbolic, as the countries have not purchased Russian or Belarusian electricity since May 2022. Experts believe that there will be no disruptions in energy supply, and users will not notice a difference. The countries have been gradually connecting to the European energy grid, the second-largest synchronous network in the world after China. By February 9, they will become the last EU countries to join the system, which also includes Turkey, Ukraine, and Moldova. The three countries have been part of the Soviet Union for over five decades, and their shared energy grid, known as BREL, connects the energy systems of Russia, Belarus, and the three Baltic countries. The countries declared independence from the USSR in 1991, and their goal was to open up to Europe and the EU. However, disconnecting from the Soviet-era synchronous network took time. 'Being connected to the Russian energy grid means being tied to an adversary that denies the Baltic states the right to exist,' said Christine Berzina, director of the 'Geopolitics of the North' project at the German Marshall Fund. 'Disconnecting from BREL means vulnerability.' For the Baltic countries, energy independence means diversifying energy suppliers, achieving energy balance, and using more renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. This will also allow them to participate in the European energy market. By 2030, the EU aims to have all its members able to import or export at least 15% of the electricity produced on their territory. The EU has supported the efforts of the Baltic countries, allocating 1.23 billion euros to connect them to the EU energy grid through cables laid under the Baltic Sea. This will give Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia more opportunities for reliable energy supply. A broader range of energy sources will ensure a stable influx of electricity. The main connection of the Baltic countries to the continental European energy grid is through the LitPol Link air power transmission line, connecting Poland and Lithuania, which share a common border. In addition, the three countries are connected to the Scandinavian energy market, which is independent. Lithuania is connected to Sweden by a submarine cable called NordBalt, while two submarine lines, Estlink 1 and Estlink 2, connect Estonia to Finland. By 2035, a third line is planned to be put into operation. However, in late December last year, the Estlink 2 cable was damaged, leading to a significant reduction in the network's capacity between Estonia and Finland. A day after the incident, the European Commission issued a statement saying that the ship Eagle S, which was involved in the incident, is part of Russia's shadow fleet. According to the European Commission, the attack on critical infrastructure will not hinder the planned disconnection from the Russian grid, as the Baltic countries have created additional capacities over the years. 'There is no risk to the security of electricity supply in the region,' the Brussels statement said. The alleged sabotage of underwater cables has led to increased monitoring of events at sea by NATO. 'Over the past two decades, the three Baltic countries have done a lot to ensure the security of energy supply and create a competitive environment in this area,' said Christine Berzina. This has significant geopolitical implications and means their 'derusification,' she added.

**Baltic States Disconnect from Russian Power Grid**
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have finally disconnected from the Russian power grid, a move that marks a significant step towards their independence and energy security. The three Baltic states have been gradually synchronizing their power grids with the European continental grid, the second-largest synchronized grid in the world after China. This move is a result of their efforts to diversify their energy sources and reduce their dependence on Russian energy. The Baltic states have been working towards this goal for over a decade, and their decision to disconnect from the Russian grid is a testament to their commitment to energy independence. As Kristine Berzina, director of Geostrategy North at the German Marshall Fund, said, 'Being connected meant being tied to an adversary that claims that the Baltic states should not exist.' The move is also a response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine, which has forced the Baltic states to invest in non-Russian alternatives to secure their energy supply. The European Union has supported the Baltic states with investments worth 1.23 billion euros in connections with Europe, which will provide them with more options for energy supplies. The main connection between the Baltic states and the EU will be realized through the LitPol Link power bridge, which connects Poland and Lithuania. Additionally, the three states are connected to the separate Scandinavian electricity market. Lithuania has a subsea connection with Sweden called NordBalt, while Estonia has two direct subsea connections with Finland - Estlink 1 and Estlink 2, and a third one is planned to be completed by 2035.

**Baltic Countries to Break Ties with Russia on February 8, 2025**
On February 8, 2025, the Baltic countries will complete their energy transition and break their dependence on Russia by fully integrating into the European electrical grid. The Baltic Synchro operation will see Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania join the European electrical network, a crucial step that comes with opportunities, challenges, and risks. Despite a recent sabotage that damaged an underwater cable carrying energy from Finland to Estonia, the Baltic countries maintained their energy supply using emergency reserves, demonstrating their ability to manage and adapt to the transition. This process of independence is the result of 20 years of planning and investment in new infrastructure, essential for ensuring the stability of the network and addressing potential disruptions. However, risks remain: if both connection cables were compromised, millions of people could be left without electricity during one of the coldest periods of the year. To further reduce vulnerabilities, new connections with the European electrical grid are being developed, including a new connection with Poland by 2030 and a third underwater cable with Finland by 2035, as stated by the Baltic countries' officials, 'We are taking a crucial step towards energy independence and security.'
