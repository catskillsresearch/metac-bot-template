**Congressional plan would withdraw authority from injunction-happy judges * WorldNetDaily * by Bob Unruh**
A congressional plan aims to curb the power of federal judges who have been issuing nationwide injunctions against President Donald Trump's agenda. The plan, included in a reconciliation package, would require judges to post a bond before issuing an injunction, as is already required by federal law. However, most judges have been ignoring this requirement or setting the bond at zero. Rep. Jim Jordan said, 'The judge can set the security at whatever level he wants. What's typically happened in these cases is he's just waiving it. Nobody's putting it up.' The plan would make every federal court injunction that waived the security requirement unenforceable. Democrats argue that this plan is unconstitutional. Meanwhile, other attempts to limit the power of judges, such as Rep. Darrell Issa's bill to block nationwide injunctions and Rep. Brandon Gill's articles of impeachment against District Judge James Boasberg, are also underway.

**Mexico to Hold Unprecedented Election for All Judges**
Mexico is set to hold an unprecedented election for all its judges, a move defended by the left-wing government as a way to combat impunity, but criticized by opponents as a means to consolidate an authoritarian regime and allow criminals to operate with impunity. According to the government, the election is necessary to reduce the high levels of impunity, with 90% of cases without a sentence. However, critics argue that the real goal is to control the judiciary and eliminate the only check on the government's power. 'The people are very intelligent and know who to vote for', said Claudia Sheinbaum, the president's successor, dismissing concerns that Mexicans are indifferent to the election. However, polls suggest that only half of voters know the date of the election and four out of ten are unsure if they will participate. Activists have called for protests against the election, which will choose 2,600 federal judges and magistrates from 19 of 32 states. The remaining 4,000 local judges will be elected in 2027. The election is unprecedented, as no country has ever held a popular vote for all its judges. Although the process is supposed to be bipartisan, experts warn that the Supreme Court could end up with a majority aligned with the government. The election has increased fears that judges will be subject to political and economic power, or threats from organized crime. An NGO has detected 19 candidates with links to cartels, corruption, and abuse of power. 'The justice system is not elected, it requires specialized and experienced officials', said Olimpia Rojas Luviano, a 28-year-old lawyer. 'Society is not prepared for this exercise', she added. The election also challenges the independence of the judiciary. 'It could increase the risk that candidates seek to please voters or campaign donors to increase their chances of re-election, compromising impartiality', warned Margaret Satterthwaite, a UN special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers.

**Mexico to Hold Historic Election for All Judges Amid Controversy**
Mexico will hold a historic election on Sunday to choose all its judges, a move defended by the left-wing government as a way to combat impunity, but criticized by opponents as a means to consolidate an authoritarian regime and open the door to criminals. According to President Claudia Sheinbaum, the popular vote will help reduce the unacceptable levels of impunity, which stand at 90% of cases without a sentence. However, critics argue that the true goal is to control the judiciary and eliminate the only check on the government, which dominates the legislature and most state governments. 'There are those who say that the people do not know. They are very wrong. The people are very intelligent and know who to vote for,' Sheinbaum said, rejecting the idea that Mexicans are indifferent to the election. Despite this, only half of the electorate knows the date of the election and four out of ten are sure to participate, according to polls by El Universal and El País. Activists have called for protests on Sunday against this first stage, in which 2,600 federal judges and magistrates from 19 of 32 states will be elected. The rest of the 4,000 local judges will be voted on in 2027. The process has no precedents, as countries like the US or Bolivia consider the popular election of some judges, but none have used it to appoint all magistrates. Although the process is supposed to be bipartisan, experts believe that the Supreme Court could end up with a majority favorable to the government. In a country plagued by corruption and violent crime, the election increases the fear that judges will be subject to political and economic power, or threats from cartels. A critical NGO detected 19 candidates with links to cartels, corruption, and sexual abuse. Even Silvia Delgado, a former lawyer for Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán, is a candidate for judge in the state of Chihuahua. The eventual victory of questionable candidates can only be challenged after the vote, in which thousands of candidates were selected by the three branches of government. The election also challenges the independence of the judiciary. 'It could increase the risk that candidates (...) seek to please voters or campaign sponsors in order to increase their chances of re-election,' which would compromise impartiality, warned Margaret Satterthwaite, UN special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. For Olimpia Rojas Luviano, a 28-year-old lawyer, 'justice is not voted' because it requires specialized and experienced officials. Mexican society 'is not prepared for this exercise,' she adds, leaving a capital city courthouse. Impunity and distrust underpin Sheinbaum's discourse, who in her daily morning press conference showcases judges who -according to her- favor delinquents and hinder the administration of justice. 'In my 40-plus years as a litigant, I have never given a judge, let alone a magistrate, a single cent to dictate a sentence in my favor,' Claudia Rojas, a 48-year-old civil lawyer, asserts. Experts argue that the release of many suspects is often the result of investigations by the prosecution, autonomous entities that were not touched by the proposed reform. Other factors complicating the election have been restrictions on promoting candidates, who mostly appealed to social media, and the complexity of the vote. In the case of Mexico City, voters will have to mark nine ballots (6 for federal judges, 3 for local ones). Only the federal candidates total 3,414, so the results will only be known from June 2.

**Justice Yashwant Varma to be impeached? Rules governing process of removing judges in India and the options before him explained**
Justice Yashwant Varma, a judge at the Allahabad High Court, is likely to face impeachment proceedings due to the alleged discovery of a large amount of cash at his residence in New Delhi after a fire broke out on March 14. The Centre plans to introduce an impeachment motion against him during the upcoming Monsoon Session of Parliament. According to the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968, the process begins with a notice of motion given in Parliament, which must be signed by 100 MPs in the Lok Sabha or 50 MPs in the Rajya Sabha. If the notice is admitted, a three-member committee will investigate the charges, and if found guilty, the matter will return to Parliament for a final vote. For an impeachment motion to be passed, at least two-thirds of those present and voting in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha must vote in favour of the motion. The President will then pass an order for the removal of the judge. Justice Varma will be entitled to a fair hearing, including the right to respond to the charges and cross-examine witnesses.

**Todo sobre la Elección Judicial 2025: fechas, boletas y candidatos**
The 2025 Judicial Election in Mexico will define new judges in the country. For the first time in Mexican history, citizens will actively participate in the formation of the Federal Judiciary. This vote represents a democratic milestone that aims to strengthen the legitimacy of the bodies responsible for administering justice. The election will take place on June 1st and will renew 881 judicial positions, including Supreme Court ministers, electoral magistrates, district judges, and circuit magistrates. The National Electoral Institute (INE) coordinates the logistical and educational operation to ensure a clear, safe, and participatory day. This transformation of the justice model promises a more transparent, closer, and accountable judiciary to society. The election will choose nine Supreme Court ministers, two magistrates for the Superior Chamber of the Electoral Tribunal of the Federal Judicial Power, and 15 magistrates for its Regional Chambers. Additionally, the names of five members of the newly created Judicial Discipline Tribunal will be decided, as well as 464 circuit magistrates and 386 district judges. Each position is a crucial link in the administration of justice. The electoral authorities designed six different ballots, each with a specific color and size to facilitate distinction between positions. The colors assigned are blue, pink, green, yellow, salmon, and purple, and the names of the candidates will appear in alphabetical order, divided by gender, without party logos or slogans. The vote count will be developed in four stages to ensure maximum transparency. Between June 1st and 10th, the District Councils of the INE will perform the district count. Then, on June 12th, the Local Councils will carry out the state count, and on the same day, the plurinominal constituency count will also be carried out. Finally, the General Council of the INE will complete the national count on June 15th. These stages seek to provide precise and reliable results, with cross-verification mechanisms and supervision by national and international observers. The authorities will emphasize the protection of ballots and the digitalization of acts to avoid irregularities. The structure of this staged count allows for the timely resolution of possible impugnations or inconformities. This vote marks a before and after in the design of the Mexican judicial system. For the first time, citizens will be able to directly influence the selection of judges and magistrates who will decide fundamental issues for the country, from human rights to electoral controversies. The massive participation will ensure that the positions are assigned with true representativeness. The change represents a bet for greater transparency and for democratizing one of the most closed institutions of the Mexican State. This election has the potential to improve public trust in the Judiciary and open a new chapter in the relationship between society and justice. Mexico faces a historic opportunity to strengthen its democracy from the core of its legality.

**Pushing the reforms agenda in the judiciary**
An impeachment motion against Justice Yashwant Varma, a sitting high court judge, is likely to be brought forward in the next session of Parliament. This would mark a series of firsts, including the removal of a judge by Parliament and a motion brought by members of the ruling dispensation. The Constitution sets a high bar for impeachment, requiring at least 100 signatories in the Lok Sabha and 50 in the Rajya Sabha, as well as a two-thirds majority for passage. The allegations against Justice Varma are grave, but must be thoroughly probed and transparently investigated by the appropriate authorities. The higher judiciary has faced criticism for its opaqueness, which harms its public reputation. The apex court has taken steps towards reforms, including making public the assets held by judges and publishing the appointment process. This process should continue and expand.

**How Do You Remove Sitting High Court Judge? Impeachment Process Explained**
The Indian government is considering impeachment charges against Justice Yashwant Varma, a former Delhi High Court judge, due to allegations of impropriety and a 'conspiracy' against him. Varma has denied any wrongdoing and refused to resign. The impeachment process, outlined in the Judges Inquiry Act of 1968 and constitutional provisions, involves a three-member panel investigation and a special majority vote in both Houses of Parliament. If the charges are found to be true, the President will remove the judge. This would be the first time a judge has been impeached in independent India. The government is reportedly seeking support from all parties, including the opposition, and is expected to consult them on the first draft of the impeachment motion.

**Mexicans to Elect Judges Amid Fears of Authoritarianism and Crime**
Mexico will hold its first-ever election for judges on Sunday, a move defended by the left-wing government as a fight against impunity, but criticized by opponents as a consolidation of an authoritarian regime and a path to increased crime. The election is the result of a reform promoted by former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who faced judicial blocks on ambitious projects, from constitutional changes to large public works. His successor and fellow party member, Claudia Sheinbaum, argues that popular voting will help reduce levels of impunity: 90% of cases do not result in conviction. Critics, however, see the true goal as controlling the judiciary and eliminating the only check on the ruling party, which dominates the legislature and most state governments. 'There are those who say the people don't know. Well, they're very mistaken. The people are very intelligent and know who to vote for,' says the popular president, who rejects the idea that Mexicans are indifferent to the election. However, estimates suggest that only half of voters know the election date and four in ten are certain they will participate, according to polls by El Universal and El País. Amid a clear weakening of opposition parties, activists have called for protests on Sunday against the first phase, in which 2,600 federal judges and 19 state judges will be elected. The remaining 4,000 local judges will be elected in 2027. The election is unprecedented, as countries like the US and Bolivia have considered popular election of some judges, but none have used it to appoint all magistrates. Although the process is supposed to be non-partisan, experts believe that the Supreme Court - a major thorn in López Obrador's side - may have a majority aligned with the government. In a country plagued by corruption and crime, the election raises fears that judges will submit to political and economic power, or threats from drug traffickers. A critical NGO identified 19 candidates accused of links to cartels, corruption, and sexual abuse. Silvia Delgado, a former lawyer for drug trafficker Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán, who is serving a life sentence in the US, is a candidate for judge in the state of Chihuahua in the north of the country. The eventual victory of a questionable candidate can only be contested after the vote, in which thousands of selected by the Three Powers will participate. The election also challenges the independence of the judiciary. 'This could increase the risk that candidates (...) seek to please voters or campaign donors to increase their chances of re-election,' which would compromise impartiality, warned Margaret Satterthwaite, UN special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. For Olimpia Rojas Luviano, a 28-year-old lawyer, 'Justice is not a matter of voting' because, above all, it requires specialized and experienced officials. Mexican society 'is not prepared for this exercise,' she added.

**GOP lawmakers take aim at anti-Trump rulings, nationwide injunctions**
Republicans in Congress are planning to take action against nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block President Donald Trump's policies. The House and Senate will hold hearings on the federal judiciary, and the House is expected to vote on a bill to limit injunctions. However, the bill's chances of becoming law are slim. Trump has called for judges to be impeached, but most Republicans do not support this idea. Instead, they are exploring other options, such as limiting funding for federal courts or curbing nationwide injunctions. Critics argue that these types of rulings give federal judges too much power and create a partisan divide in the courts. The issue has sparked a debate about the role of the judiciary in the US and the balance of power between the branches of government.

**Republican Lawmakers Introduce Resolutions to Impeach Two Federal Judges**
Two Republican lawmakers, Andrew Clyde and Andy Ogles, have introduced resolutions to impeach two federal judges, John McConnell and Theodore Chuang, for allegedly obstructing President Trump's authority. Clyde accused McConnell of abusing his power and having a conflict of interest, saying he 'intentionally politicized and weaponized his judicial position to advance his own political views and beliefs.' McConnell was appointed by former President Obama. Clyde wrote in an article that if McConnell is found guilty, he should be removed from office. McConnell is currently overseeing a lawsuit filed by 22 states and the District of Columbia challenging the Trump administration's decision to withhold federal funding. Clyde told Fox Digital News, 'The American people voted overwhelmingly in November to support President Trump, clearly authorizing him to increase the efficiency of the federal government. However, Judge McConnell is benefiting from his own injunction, trying to single-handedly block the president's agenda against the will of the American people. Judge McConnell's actions are corrupt, dangerous, and worthy of impeachment.' Ogles accused Chuang of being a 'partisan radical' who tried to illegally block the president's authority. Chuang ruled that the Trump administration and Elon Musk's government efficiency department (DOGE) may have violated the Constitution by cutting USAID's funding and prohibited further action. Ogles said on social media platform X that Chuang is 'a lifetime Democratic Party judge appointed by Obama, who blocked Trump's travel ban in 2017. This judge has been promoting critical race theory during his tenure as an editor of the Harvard Law Review.'

**White House Criticizes Federal Court for 'Usurping' Presidential Power**
The White House has criticized a federal court for 'usurping' the power of the President, citing a recent ruling that went against President Trump's wishes. White House press secretary Levite said, 'The extreme left-wing forces have collaborated to select judges who are clearly partisan radicals to handle cases involving Republican actions.' He added, 'They not only usurp the will of the President, but also destroy the will of the American people.' Levite specifically criticized Judge Bosberg of the District of Columbia Federal Court, who issued a 14-day temporary injunction on March 15 to block the government from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants. Levite called him a 'Democratic Party activist.' Trump's administration has invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport members of the Venezuelan mafia, who are suspected of crimes, to El Salvador as part of their mass deportation plan. Their names and alleged crimes have not been publicly disclosed. Trump personally called for Bosberg's impeachment on Tuesday, calling him 'a troublemaker and agitator, unfortunately, he was appointed by Obama.' Bosberg, 62, graduated from Yale University and was initially appointed by Republican President Bush as a judge, later appointed by Obama as a district court judge. Trump's comments were met with a rare public rebuke from Chief Justice Roberts, saying, 'For over two centuries, it has been recognized that impeachment is not an appropriate response to judicial disagreement.' Bosberg also issued a sharp warning to Justice Department lawyers in the deportation case, saying they must comply with the court's ruling. He said, 'As the Supreme Court has clearly stated, if the injunction has legal defects, the correct remedy for the party affected by the injunction is to appeal for review, not to disobey.' Federal judges are appointed for life by the President, and can only be removed by the House of Representatives for 'high crimes or misdemeanors' and convicted by the Senate. Federal judges have rarely been impeached, with the last instance being in 2010. Trump said on Fox's 'The Ingraham Angle' on Wednesday that the Chief Justice 'did not mention my name' in his statement. He said, 'But many people are calling for the impeachment of (Bosberg), he actually said we shouldn't deport criminals, killers, murderers, terrible people, the worst people, gang members, gang leaders... out of our country.' Trump said, 'Well, that's the President's job. That's not something a district judge can do.' In the midst of the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul the federal government, judges have brought Trump several setbacks in recent weeks. A judge on Tuesday ordered the immediate halt of the government's plan to close major aid agencies, led by Elon Musk's Department of Efficiency (DOGE). On the same day, another judge suspended the Pentagon's ban on transgender individuals serving in the military. Billionaire Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, sharply criticized what he called a 'judicial coup' on his social media platform X. 'We need 60 senators to impeach the judges and restore the people's rule,' but he incorrectly stated the process and the actual number of senators required, which is 67. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Miller also sharply criticized the judiciary, accusing it of 'attacking democracy.' Miller said on X, 'District court judges have already served as Defense Secretary, Secretary of State, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Commander-in-Chief.' Trump is the first president to enter the White House with a felony conviction, and has repeatedly attacked judges who have presided over his civil and criminal cases; but now, the Trump administration seems determined to take on the judiciary, as he claims to have extraordinary executive power.

**US Impeachment Process: A Guide to Removing Federal Judges**
US President Trump has called for the impeachment of Federal Judge James Boasberg, prompting Republican Representative Brandon Gill to announce that he has filed an impeachment motion against Boasberg. This is the fourth time a judge has been impeached by Republican representatives for making decisions unfavorable to Trump's policies. Although any representative can file an impeachment motion against a federal judge, the House of Representatives only needs a simple majority to charge the official with impeachment. However, these impeachment cases are unlikely to pass in the Senate. The impeachment process is not intended to punish judges who make decisions that disagree with their views, but rather to remove judges who have committed crimes or been accused of bribery and are unable to perform their duties. Federal judges are often nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate after a hearing. However, this session has seen four federal judges impeached by Republican representatives for making decisions that do not align with Trump's allies' views. They are James Boasberg, Paul A. Engelmayer, John Bates, and Amir Ali. The impeachment motion will be submitted to the Judiciary Committee, which can conduct its own investigation or wait for the full House to vote to authorize an investigation. If the Judiciary Committee approves, the impeachment motion will be submitted to the Rules Committee and then to the full House for debate and voting. The House only needs a simple majority to charge the official with impeachment. If the House passes the impeachment motion, the case will be submitted to the Senate for trial, and then all 100 Senators will vote to determine whether to convict. The Senate needs a two-thirds majority to convict, which is 67 votes out of 100. Currently, the Senate has 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats, and the four federal judges in question were impeached for overturning Trump's policy decisions, making it impossible for 14 Democratic Senators to join the Republicans to convict them. After all, many Democrats voted to appoint these judges to balance Trump's power. In history, 15 federal judges have been impeached by the House, with eight later convicted by the Senate, four acquitted, and three resigned before the Senate vote. Most of the impeached judges were impeached for corruption or crimes committed during their tenure.

US President Donald Trump has called for the impeachment of federal judge James Boasberg, who ordered the suspension of high-profile deportation flights of alleged illegal migrants. Trump wrote on Truth Social, 'This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED.' The White House has been critical of federal district courts which have blocked some of the president's executive actions, but this is the first time Trump has personally called for a judge's impeachment since he took office in January. Republican lawmaker Brandon Gill said articles of impeachment would be introduced in the House 'very soon.' Trump has a history of attacking state and federal judges who presided over his civil and criminal cases.

**Republicans move to impeach judges who blocked Trump**
House Republicans plan to introduce articles of impeachment for at least two federal judges who blocked President Trump's attempts to overturn the federal government. Trump said, 'Maybe we need to look at judges because I believe that's a serious violation.' Vice President J.D. Vance stated that federal judges had overstepped their authority, saying, 'weren't allowed control the executive's legitimate power.' Rep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., has announced that he intends to impeach District Court Judge Paul Engelmayer for blocking DOGE's access to Treasury records. Clyde's office confirmed that he is working on articles to impeach U.S. district court judge John J. McConnell Jr. who ordered the federal spending freeze to be lifted by the Obama administration. Clyde called McConnell a 'partisan activist who was weaponizing our judicial systems to stop President Trump's funding freeze for woke and wasteful spending by the government.' The impeachment process requires a majority in the House and a two-thirds majority in the Senate, which only has 53 Senate Republicans.

**Trump Launches War on Judges**
US Republicans in the House of Representatives plan to introduce a long-term impeachment bill against at least two federal judges who have blocked President Donald Trump's government agenda. According to Axios, these actions are 'part of an ongoing struggle between Republicans and the federal judiciary, where Trump is complaining about the obstacles to his 'efficiency government' agenda (DOGE). Trump escalated tensions this week when he said at a press conference in the White House with DOGE President Elon Musk: 'We may have to look at the judges because I think this is a very serious breach.' Vice President JD Vance also pointed out that federal judges have overstepped their authority and 'are not allowed to control the legitimate authority of the executive branch,' as he put it. Representative Andrew Clyde (R-GA) is working on impeachment materials against US District Court Judge John J. McConnell Jr., who ordered the administration to lift the federal spending freeze, according to Clyde's office. Clyde described McConnell as 'a partisan activist using our judicial system as a tool to block President Trump's government spending.' Representative Eli Crane (R-AZ) plans to introduce articles of impeachment against US District Court Judge Paul Engelmayer, who blocked DOGE from accessing Treasury Department records, for similar reasons.

**House GOP prepares to impeach Fed Judges blocking Trump, DOGE policies**
Several House Republicans, including Arizona Rep. Eli Crane and Georgia Rep. Andrew Clyde, are preparing articles of impeachment against federal judges who have blocked President Donald Trump's and Elon Musk's policies. The judges have blocked Trump's executive order limiting transgender care for minors and Musk's plan to reduce USAID by placing 2,200 employees on administrative leave. Rep. Crane stated, 'Our case for impeaching Judge Engelmayer is basically that he's an activist judge trying to stop the Trump administration from executing their, you know, Article 2 powers to make sure that the laws are faithfully executed.' Rep. Clyde said, 'I'm drafting articles of impeachment for U.S. District Judge John McConnell Jr. He's a partisan activist weaponizing our judicial system to stop President Trump's funding freeze on woke and wasteful government spending.' Although the House has the power to introduce articles of impeachment, it cannot remove judges, and the Senate would need two-thirds of its votes to do so.

**House Republicans eye impeachment for judges who block DOGE - Washington Examiner**
House Republicans, including Reps. Eli Crane (R-AZ) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), are considering impeachment for judges who block the Trump administration's actions. Crane is drafting articles of impeachment for Judge Paul Engelmayer of the Southern District of New York, who temporarily restricted Elon Musk and DOGE aides from accessing a Treasury Department payment system. Crane stated, 'Our case for impeaching Judge Engelmayer is basically that he's an activist judge trying to stop the Trump administration from executing their Article 2 powers.' Greene also expressed support for impeachment, saying, 'They can't do that, especially when they have a serious record of Democrat activism and being hardcore against President Trump.' Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA) is writing an impeachment resolution against Rhode Island District Judge John McConnell Jr. for blocking the Trump administration's freeze on federal funding. Clyde stated, 'He's a partisan activist weaponizing our judicial system to stop President Trump's funding freeze on woke and wasteful government spending.'
