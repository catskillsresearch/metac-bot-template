**Italy Faces a Significant Loss of Workforce: Over 3 Million Workers by 2040**
Italy is expected to lose over 3 million workers by 2040, with a significant reduction in the workforce already seen in 2030. This trend will have direct effects on the labor market and the country's productive capacity. The aging of the active population and the insufficient generational replacement risk compromising the maintenance of employment levels and the sustainability of the pension system. According to the Fondazione Studi Consulenti del Lavoro, it is essential to implement targeted policies to address the crisis, including a strengthening of the welfare system, continuous training, and strategies to promote greater inclusion in the labor market. 'It is urgent to reform the mechanisms of access to work and support the insertion with active policies,' the report states. The regions most affected by the decline in the workforce will be those with the lowest population in the 15-64 age range, such as Nuoro, Potenza, and Enna, which will see a reduction of 9.7% in the working-age population. On the other hand, regions like Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna seem to maintain a higher stability in labor market participation, due to their demographic composition and the presence of a more dynamic and attractive productive fabric.

**Colombia's 'Ninis': A Growing Concern**
According to the Dane's report on the labor market of young people for the quarter January-March 2025, the youth unemployment rate in Colombia decreased by 2.9 percentage points compared to the same quarter in 2024, reaching 17.1%. However, similar trends to those of the adult population, such as the growth of self-employed workers, indicative of informality, are also seen in the statistics of young people. Two out of three new jobs created were in this category. The number of 'ninis' (young people between 15 and 28 years old who do not study or work) is estimated at 2.68 million, which is almost one in four Colombians in this age range. Of this group, 67% are women, representing 16% of all Colombian women between 15 and 28 years old. A study by the University of Rosario recommends distinguishing between unemployed 'ninis' (those who seek work without success) and inactives (those who do not study or seek work). The government has identified initiatives to address this issue, including educational programs aligned with labor market demands, strengthening and quality in technical and technological training, and dismantling barriers that prevent young women from studying and working. Unfortunately, the National Government does not seem to show greater interest in this population of 'ninis', beyond ideologically activating them. The expectations of these young people remain high, just like their desperation for a better future.

**The Year We Realize Work Doesn't Mean Staying**
Mexico is facing significant labor challenges and opportunities, requiring a shift in focus beyond just numbers. With over 59 million people employed and a 97.5% labor participation rate, according to the INEGI, the country appears to be in balance. However, a closer look reveals that 54.5% of workers are in the informal sector, lacking benefits, support networks, and the ability to plan for the future. Even formal employment is not a guarantee, as 43% of employees are considering leaving their jobs and one in five is actively searching for a new opportunity. This is not just a matter of job rotation, but a symptom of disconnection between what employers offer and what employees need. A recent study by Pandapé and Computrabajo confirms that 50% of employers want to retain talent this year, but this can no longer be achieved solely through salary increases. What truly matters is understanding each person's needs based on their life stage. Time for oneself, financial security, and access to healthcare are just a few examples of what employees value. As the author notes, 'lealtad no se compra, se construye, y empieza por escuchar' (loyalty is not bought, it is built, and it starts with listening). The article concludes that the current debates about reducing working hours, improving bonuses, and extending parental leave are not just legislative proposals, but a response to a real demand for humanizing work. The question is no longer about filling job vacancies, but about creating organizations where people choose to stay, where work is a source of purpose, not just income.

**Taiwan's Youth Labor Participation Rate: A Call to Abandon Academic Credentials**
Taiwan's youth labor participation rate is low, with 36.4% of 15-24 year olds participating in the labor market, compared to 64.5% in Japan, 65.7% in the US, and 29.6% in South Korea. The article argues that Taiwan's emphasis on academic credentials has led to a lack of practical skills and a high debt burden for young people. The author suggests that Taiwan should shift its focus from academic credentials to vocational training and apprenticeships, and that employers should prioritize technical skills over academic qualifications. The article also notes that Taiwan's higher education system has expanded rapidly since the 1990s, but has not led to greater social mobility. Instead, it has perpetuated existing social inequalities, with privileged students attending top universities and lower-income students attending vocational schools. The author argues that employers must abandon their reliance on academic credentials and prioritize technical skills, and that the government should provide more support for vocational training and apprenticeships.

**Jordan's Economic Burden on the Workforce Remains High Despite Slight Decrease**
Despite a slight decrease in the economic burden on the workforce in Jordan, experts warn of the growing challenges related to the country's low economic participation and the widening gap in the local job market. According to the Databank of Statistics, the economic burden on the workforce decreased by 3.8% in 2024, reaching 303.5%. However, experts point out that this decrease is not a significant improvement, as the economic burden remains high, reflecting the depth of the economic crisis, including high unemployment and poverty rates. The economic burden is defined as the economic weight on the active workforce in society, usually calculated by dividing the number of individuals outside the workforce (those under 14 and over 65) by the number of workers in the 15-65 age group. Experts emphasize the need for the government to intensify efforts to reform the job market, particularly with the increasing number of new entrants, by encouraging job seekers to engage in specific professions and improving related salaries, as well as attracting foreign investments as a key driver of job creation and national production, which would contribute to improving economic growth indicators and raising living standards. The economic burden on the workforce in Jordan is still high, with 303.5% of the workforce supporting 303 non-working individuals, according to expert Hossam Ayyash. This burden is not only a financial strain but also a social and economic one, limiting the ability of Jordanian families to save and reducing their standard of living. Experts warn that the economic burden is a reflection of the country's structural imbalances in the job market, including low economic participation, particularly among women, who are among the lowest in the region. The high economic burden is also a result of the country's low economic growth rate, which is around 2.5%, and the high unemployment rate, which is over 21%. To address these challenges, experts recommend increasing economic growth to at least 4-5% per year to reduce unemployment and improve economic indicators.

**Colombia's Labor Market: Between Increased Employment and Informal Work**
Despite positive signs in the labor market, such as increased employment and reduced unemployment, experts warn that the jobs being created are mostly informal, poorly paid, and unprotected. According to Corficolombiana, the informal sector has grown to 57.2%, the highest level in two years, with 78% of the 971,000 new jobs created being informal. This has led to a situation where people are opting for informal work or entrepreneurship due to the lack of formal employment opportunities. 'This trend suggests that companies are adjusting their labor structures, not through the creation of quality employment, but through the substitution of formal jobs with more flexible, lower-cost, and outside the regulatory framework,' experts said. Bancolombia notes that the market labor is solid at the end of the first quarter of 2025, but highlights that the high incidence of informality in sectors such as agriculture, commerce, and hospitality, which have created new jobs, is a concern. BBVA Research warns that the employment total has been growing at a rate of around 5% per year, with a higher participation of non-salaried employment, which grows at 8% per year, and that of the 1.1 million jobs generated between March 2024 and March 2025, only 110,000 were salaried, while the remaining 947,000 corresponded to independent workers, the vast majority of whom are informal. 'The challenge is to implement measures that aim to reduce labor informality among independent workers, with effects on economic growth and the living conditions of workers and their families,' BBVA said.

**Low Participation Rate in Simplified Medical Claims Process**
Despite the implementation of the simplified claims process for medical expenses 7 months ago, only 25% of hospitals have participated, according to data from the Insurance Development Institute. The low participation rate is due to the lack of cooperation between the insurance industry, medical institutions, and electronic medical record (EMR) companies. The insurance industry is responsible for developing and maintaining the system, but medical institutions are hesitant to participate due to the additional administrative costs. The Korean Medical Association and the Korean Hospital Association have requested that the insurance industry compensate for the administrative costs, but the insurance industry has refused, citing the need for consumers to bear the costs. The ultimate reason for the low participation rate is the lack of penalties for non-participation. Hospitals and clinics are required to participate in the simplified claims process, but there are no consequences for non-compliance. As a result, consumers may not see the benefits of the simplified claims process, even if it is expanded to include more medical institutions in October.

**Middle-aged Women Surpass Young Men in Economic Participation**
According to a recent report, 61.5% of women aged 55-64 are economically active, surpassing 20-29 year old men who have an economic participation rate of 60.7%. This trend is attributed to the fact that mothers are actively seeking employment, unlike their children. In comparison to 10 years ago, the economic participation rate of women aged 55-64 has increased significantly, from 52.1% in 2015 to 61.5% in 2025. In contrast, the economic participation rate of 20-29 year old men has been steadily declining over the same period. The trend of young people leaving the labor market is also reflected in the employment rate, which shows that the overall employment rate for men decreased by 0.5% from the previous year, with a 1.6% decrease for 20-29 year old men. The number of unemployed young people has increased to over 1.2 million in February 2025, a 7 million increase from the previous year. This trend is expected to continue as companies reduce their hiring in the face of economic uncertainty in the first half of the year.

**Hardly Working**
The labor-force-participation rate in the US has fallen to its lowest level since the late 1970s, with the biggest decline among younger workers. The participation rate among those in their fifties has also decreased, with many likely having given up on finding a new job after being unemployed for several years. However, the most disturbing trend is the decline in workforce participation among those between 16 and 25, with a 5.3% decrease for 16- to 19-year-olds and a 3.0% decrease for 20- to 24-year-olds. Stephen Moore, chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, attributes this decline to the minimum wage, cultural attitudes, and the substitution of work with student loans. He argues that young people should be encouraged to work at a young age to learn the dignity of work and become responsible and independent. Moore suggests that parents should encourage their children to get a job, even if it's menial labor, to help them succeed in life.

**Taiwan's Labor Force Ages: Middle-Aged and Elderly Job Seekers Surpass Young Adults**
According to the statistics from the largest independent job platform in Taiwan, '打工趣', the labor participation rate in Taiwan has reached a new low in 2023, while the labor participation rate of middle-aged and elderly people (45-64 years old) has increased to 66.4%, a historical high, representing the oldest labor force in history. The platform's member data shows that the proportion of new registered members aged 45 and above has increased by 124% in 2024, while the proportion of young job seekers (22 years old and below) has decreased by two-thirds. The platform has launched a 'middle-aged and elderly job zone' to help enterprises fill labor gaps and assist middle-aged and elderly people in returning to the workforce. The platform's member composition shows that middle-aged and elderly people now account for nearly 30% (28.9%), while the largest group is still the young adults (23-44 years old) who account for 64% (63.9%). The platform points out that the term '工讀生' (job seeker) can no longer be used to describe the flexible workforce, as it implies that the target group is students, but now the majority of job seekers are middle-aged and elderly people. The platform has introduced a new 'tag' function to help employers and job seekers find suitable matches, with the first batch of tags including '#中高齡友善' (middle-aged and elderly friendly), '#二度就業' (second career), '#彈性工時' (flexible working hours), '#遠端工作' (remote work), '#假日打工' (part-time work), and '#有薪實習' (paid internship).

Despite a 3.5% increase in the workforce between 2021 and 2024, this decline suggests a strong link between demographic changes and employment. The increase in labor market participation has affected three main categories: non-EU workers (+24.7%), older workers (+9.9%), and those with tertiary education (+7.9%). These components not only grew in terms of numbers but also showed higher participation rates. In Italy, the trend of older workers is slightly higher than the European average, and it is on this component of the labor market that it is interesting to focus. According to researchers at the ECB, the unemployment rate of over-50s, at 4.4% in the third quarter of 2024, is lower than that of adult workers (5.8%). If their level of employment had remained unchanged since 2021, the overall unemployment rate would have been 0.3 percentage points higher. In Italy, the unemployment rate of over-50s is even more detached from the general average (2.8% vs. 5.7%). This suggests an impact of this significant growth of employed over-50s on other qualitative aspects of the labor market. One of these, which has been rightly focused on, concerns the strong growth of permanent employees. If we look at the trend of these employees divided by age, we find that, from 2015 to the present (third quarter 2024), between 15 and 34 years old, permanent employees have grown by 493,000 units, between 35 and 49 years old, they have decreased by 629,000 units, and in that of over-50 years old, they have grown by 1.88 million. In summary, permanent employees over 50 have grown almost four times more than those under 35. Certainly, a historical concentration of temporary contracts among the young is a factor, but it is not enough to explain such a trend, for which the aging of the workforce and the longer stay in the labor market remain the main explanations. Another element linked to this dynamic is the reduction of inactivity, which is influenced by the extension of working careers.

According to the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, the age group '40-49 years' had the highest contribution to economic activity in the last quarter of 2024, with a rate of 59.9%. The overall participation rate in the labor force was 45.5% of the total population '15 years and older', compared to 44.4% in the previous quarter and 43.1% in the same quarter of the previous year. The participation rate among males was 71.3%, compared to 71.1% in the previous quarter and 68.9% in the same quarter of the previous year, while the participation rate among females was 18.5%, compared to 16.4% in the previous quarter and 16% in the same quarter of the previous year. The agency also reported that the unemployment rate decreased to 6.4% of the total labor force in the last quarter of 2024, down 0.3% from the previous quarter.
