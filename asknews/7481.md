**Stocks Fall as Trump Rekindles US-China Jitters: Markets Wrap**
Stocks fell on the last day of the month as Donald Trump's comments on China's tariff agreement caused market jitters. Despite mild inflation data, the S&P 500 dropped 0.4% on Friday, ending a solid month on a weak note. The bond market was also affected, with Treasuries heading towards their first monthly fall this year. The dollar is also experiencing its fifth straight month of declines, the longest losing streak since 2020. According to Chris Zaccarelli at Northlight Asset Management, 'This year has been all about tariff and trade policy and because there has been little in the way of inflation or unemployment surprises, the Fed has been able to stand aside and leave rates unchanged.'

**European Stock Markets Rise Ahead of ECB Meeting**
European stock markets are closing the day with gains, ahead of the European Central Bank's (Bce) meeting on June 5. Investors are optimistic about the inflation data from Italy and Spain, which remained below 2% in May, and believe it will lead to a rate cut by the Bce. Milan and Frankfurt rose by 0.9%, London by 0.8%, and Paris by 0.2%. In contrast, New York futures are slightly down, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both falling by 0.2%. Investors are still concerned about the confusion surrounding tariffs and weak macroeconomic data on GDP and personal consumption from yesterday. Attention is now focused on German inflation and the US PCE index, which will provide further indications on the possible trajectory of interest rates. Meanwhile, bond prices are falling, with Italian 10-year bond yields rising by 2 basis points to 3.51%, while the spread with the Bund remains stable at 98 points. On the Milan stock exchange, utilities are performing well, with Italgas (+2.7%) leading the way, followed by A2A (+2.1%), Campari (+1.9%), Tenaris (+1.7%), Hera (+1.7%), Amplifon (+1.6%), and Terna (+1.6%). Among banks, Popolare di Sondrio (+1.4%) and Intesa (+1.2%) are standing out, while Banco Bpm is flat (+0.05%). In contrast, Buzzi (-0.9%) and Generali (-0.3%) are underperforming, due to concerns about Natixis, and Stm (-0.2%).

**Global Markets Operate with Caution Amid US Commercial Policy Uncertainty**
Global markets are operating with caution on Friday, May 30, due to uncertainties about US commercial policy, inflation concerns, and mixed economic data. In Asia, major stock exchanges closed lower. The Nikkei index in Japan fell 1.22%, while the Topix index dropped 0.37%, influenced by inflation data. The core consumer price index in Tokyo rose 3.6% in April compared to the same period last year, the highest increase since January 2023. The cautious tone also reflects the slow pace of trade negotiations between the US and China, which are 'a bit stagnant', according to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The situation is further complicated by the back-and-forth in US courts over tariffs known as 'reciprocal', imposed by former President Donald Trump. European Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis stated that the uncertainty adds 'another layer of uncertainty' to trade relations, classifying the situation as urgent due to its economic impact on the US and the European Union. Despite the impasse, European markets are operating higher. The Stoxx 600 index advances 0.1%, the FTSE 100 in London rises 0.4%, and the DAX in Frankfurt gains 0.3%. The CAC 40 in Paris, however, falls 0.2%. US futures indices are operating in slight decline. The Dow Jones futures index falls 0.08%, the S&P 500 futures index loses 0.16%, and the Nasdaq futures index drops 0.21%. Investors are digesting quarterly earnings reports: Gap shares fell more than 14% after weak second-quarter projections, while Ulta Beauty rose 8% with strong results and Dell gained 2% with revenue above expectations. Despite recent volatility, May is on track to close with robust gains. For the month, the S&P 500 has risen over 6%, the Nasdaq has advanced 10%, and the Dow Jones has risen around 4%. For the week, gains are also consistent: 2% for the S&P 500, 1.4% for the Dow, and 2.3% for the Nasdaq. The market awaits the release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the preferred inflation metric of the Federal Reserve, which will be released later today.

**European Stock Markets Expected to Rise Following US Tariff Block**
European stock markets are expected to rise on Thursday, following a US federal court's decision to block the implementation of tariffs imposed by Donald Trump on April 2, which he called the 'Day of Liberation'. The contracts indicate an opening increase of 0.96% for the CAC 40 Parisian, 0.84% for the Dax in Frankfurt, and 0.61% for the FTSE in London. The Stoxx 600 is expected to open with a 0.84% increase. Nvidia's sales exceeded analyst estimates, but its second-quarter revenue forecast was slightly below Wall Street expectations, as the chipmaker faces a tightening of US restrictions on exports of its AI chips to China. Paul Ashworth, chief economist for North America at Capital Economics, said, 'This decision will obviously disrupt the efforts made by the administration to quickly conclude 'agreements' during the 90-day pause on tariffs, which have now been declared illegal.' The US Federal Reserve's latest meeting report was released after the close of trading, and Nvidia's quarterly results were also published. The Dow Jones index fell 0.58%, or 244.95 points, to 42,098.70 points. The S&P-500, the largest index, lost 32.99 points, or 0.56%, to 5,888.55 points. The Nasdaq Composite fell 98.23 points, or 0.51%, to 19,100.94 points. In Asia, the Tokyo Stock Exchange reached a two-week high, closing with a 1.88% increase after the US federal court's decision, while the rebound in electronics-related stocks also supported the index. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.69%, and the CSI 300 of large-cap stocks advanced 0.62%, driven by an improvement in sentiment. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange rose 0.99%.

**Confidence Crashes: Markets React to Trump's Tax Cuts, $880 Billion Medicaid Rollback**
The US financial markets experienced a significant decline on May 21, 2025, as concerns over the country's debt and the Treasury bond yields grew. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 1.91%, the S&P 500 index by 1.61%, and the Nasdaq by 1.40%, marking the largest one-day declines in a month. This reaction indicates investor apprehension and highlights the fragile link between political calculation and market reaction, echoing greater concerns about America's financial future and investors' trust in it.

**Fed Faces 'Difficult Dilemma' as Inflation and Unemployment Risks Rise**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) members have pointed out that monetary policy is facing a 'difficult dilemma' due to the increased uncertainty caused by Donald Trump's tariff policy. They have reaffirmed that they will not rush to lower the benchmark interest rate. The New York Stock Exchange saw all three major indices fall at the end of the day. On May 28 (local time), the Dow Jones Index fell 0.58% to 42,098.7, the S&P 500 Index fell 0.56% to 588.55, and the Nasdaq Index fell 0.51% to 19,100.94, respectively. The decline in the market today was not limited to specific stocks. The minutes of the May Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, released today, stated that 'participants generally agreed that the risks of inflation and unemployment rising have increased.' The minutes also mentioned that 'participants generally agreed that the risks of inflation being more persistent than expected, and the risks of growth and employment weakening, could pose a difficult tradeoff for the FOMC.' This suggests that the Fed may be forced to choose between fighting inflation through monetary tightening or supporting growth and employment through monetary easing in a situation where inflation and unemployment are both rising due to the impact of tariffs. The Fed has reaffirmed its stance that it will not rush to lower the benchmark interest rate, while the market is focusing on the possibility of a rate cut in September. According to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) FedWatch, the market is currently pricing in a 59% probability of a 0.25% or more rate cut by the Fed in September, with a 41% probability of no change. The probability of a single rate cut this year is 30%, and the probability of two rate cuts is 39%.

**US Stock Indexes Rise After Federal Court Cancels Most of Trump's Tariffs**
US stock indexes rose on Thursday after a federal court decision to cancel most of the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, boosting global markets. According to Reuters, this move has led to a surge in investment activity. The S&P 500 index rose 23 points to 5,912, while the Nasdaq gained 173.41 points to 19,273.71. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index also rose 1.4% due to Nvidia's success. Eight out of 11 sectors in the S&P 500 showed growth, including leaders in information technology and consumer goods. Apple's shares rose by almost 1%, Tesla by 2.2%, and Amazon by 1.2%, while Salesforce lost 5.4% despite an improved revenue forecast. The cancellation of most of Trump's tariffs, imposed since January, has increased investment activity, although industry-specific tariffs, such as steel or automobiles, remain. The S&P 500 is now only 3% below its historical high of February 19, having recovered from a 19% drop in April due to easing trade tensions, strong company reports, and contained inflation. May has been a successful month for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, which may be the best month since November 2023.

**US Stock Market Futures Rise Sharply on Court Ruling and Nvidia's Strong Results**
The US stock market futures rose sharply on Thursday, driven by a US court ruling that largely eliminated the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, as well as strong quarterly results from tech giant Nvidia. Nvidia's stock jumped over 6% in pre-market trading after the company announced a 69% increase in its quarterly sales, driven by strong demand for artificial intelligence chips before the US export restrictions on China took effect. However, the company warned that these restrictions could reduce its sales in the current quarter by around $8 billion, according to Reuters. Other chipmakers also rose, with Advanced Micro Devices' stock increasing by 3% and VanEck's semiconductor ETF rising by 3.2%. The US court ruling, which eliminated most of the tariffs imposed since January, boosted risk appetite globally, with some tariffs remaining in place for specific sectors such as metals and cars. By 7:06 am ET, the S&P 500 index rose by 1.09%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.49%, and the Nasdaq 100 index rose by 1.62%. Apple's stock led the gains among large-cap growth stocks, rising by 2.4% after the company was affected last week by Trump's threats to impose new tariffs. Meta and Alphabet also rose by 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively. Despite falling 4% from its all-time high in February, the S&P 500 index has seen a significant rebound since its 19% drop in April, driven by declining trade tensions, improving corporate results, and falling inflation levels. May appears to be shaping up to be one of the strongest months for stocks since November 2023, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes nearing their best monthly performance during that period. The Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting minutes, released on Wednesday, suggested that policymakers may face 'tough trade-offs' in the coming months, amidst challenges from high inflation and rising unemployment. The second estimate of first-quarter GDP is due later in the day, while personal consumption expenditure data is due on Friday. Five Fed officials, including Adriana Kugler, are expected to make public comments later. On the corporate front, HP's stock fell by 9% after the company lowered its annual earnings forecast, while Best Buy's stock fell by 3% after the retailer lowered its annual sales forecast.

**Wall Street Falls as Federal Reserve Meeting Protocol Released**
The main indices on Wall Street closed below zero on Wednesday. The release of the Federal Reserve's meeting protocol, where the interest rate was left unchanged, had an impact on the market. The S&P 500 index fell 0.6% to 5,888, while the Dow Jones industri index dropped 0.6% to 42,098. The Nasdaq Composite index weakened by 0.5% to 19,100. The Federal Reserve members stated that they may face 'difficult trade-offs' in the coming months, as inflation is expected to rise while unemployment increases. The protocol also emphasized that Fed officials are committed to keeping the interest rate unchanged for a longer period, as the economic outlook remains uncertain due to ongoing political changes. Macy's, a retail company, fell 0.3% after reporting a stronger-than-expected first-quarter result, but lowered its profit forecast due to uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Abercrombie & Fitch, on the other hand, rose nearly 15% after exceeding analyst expectations in its latest quarter, driven by strong numbers from Hollister. The company also raised its full-year 2025 forecast. Okta, a software company, fell 16.2% after reporting results and revenue that exceeded expectations, but left its full-year forecast unchanged due to 'macroeconomic uncertainty'. Gamestop, a video game retailer, fell 10.9% after announcing that it has purchased nearly 5,000 bitcoins. Vail Resorts, a ski resort company, rose 8.7% after announcing that Rob Katz will take over as CEO. Kohl's, a retail company, added 2.4% ahead of its earnings report on Thursday, as analysts expect the company to withdraw its full-year forecast due to challenges it faces, including the impact of higher tariffs and the sudden departure of its CEO in May. Nvidia, a technology company, fell 0.5% ahead of its earnings report, with its sales in China expected to be in focus. The US government announced in April restrictions on the export of Nvidia's H20 chip for artificial intelligence to China, and Nvidia will take one-time costs of $5.5 billion as a result.

**US Treasury Yields Fall, S&P 500 Index Rises for Sixth Consecutive Day**
The S&P 500 index rose 5.22 points or 0.09% to 5,963.6, marking its sixth consecutive trading day of gains. The Nasdaq composite index fell 4.36 points or 0.02% to 19,215.46. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 137.33 points or 0.32% to 42,792.07. The Dow Jones was driven by a rebound in UnitedHealth Group, which rose 8.21% after a sharp decline in the previous trading day. UnitedHealth Group has risen over 14% in the past two days, its best two-day gain since March 2020. The company's stock must rise another 28% to reach its closing price on May 6. UnitedHealth Group is the largest gainer in the Dow Jones, with investors trading approximately 40 million shares, more than twice its 30-day average trading volume of 18 million shares. Moody's downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, which led to a surge in US Treasury yields. The company stated that the funding challenges are related to the federal government's growing budget deficit and the consequences of extending existing US debt at high borrowing costs. The downgrade of the US credit rating put pressure on bond prices and pushed up yields. The 30-year US Treasury yield rose above 5%, while the 10-year US Treasury yield exceeded 4.5%. This level had previously affected the stock market and led to President Trump's decision to abandon the most severe tariff measures. Mortgage rates follow the 10-year Treasury yield. The Dow Jones fell by over 300 points at its lowest point, while the S&P 500 fell by about 1%. However, as US Treasury yields fell from their highs, the major indices reduced their losses. Michael Feld, an analyst at BofA Securities, said, 'Moody's report did not highlight any unknown US fiscal situation. 'For me, this is just a chance for the market to catch its breath, but it will not change the optimistic view for the next 6 to 12 months.' Traders now believe that if higher interest rates will not scare off investors, more trade agreements will be key to maintaining the stock market's recovery. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, said, 'I think people feel good because they haven't seen effective tariffs yet. 'The market has gone down 10% and then up 10%, which is a remarkable complacency.' Dimon also discussed the risks of stagflation and the US budget deficit. He also stated that the S&P 500's profit growth may decline. Jay Sole, an analyst at UBS, said that as strong brands take market share from struggling brands, retail companies are accelerating their store closures. The rate of store closures for retailers selling clothing, shoes, and bedding increased by 4.8% in March, faster than the 2.7% decline in December. Sole believes that this series of store closures should not be attributed to the shift to online sales, as 'discount' retailers increased their store count by more than 4% in the first quarter. UBS has upgraded the stocks of TJX Cos. and Burlington to 'buy.' He said that tariffs have only made things worse, 'although strong retailers can reduce costs by passing them on to consumers and suppliers, struggling retailers may not be able to easily reduce costs because they lack the influence over their supply chain partners that strong retailers have.' Sole also predicts that the pace of department store closures will accelerate. US Bancorp has reinstated its 'buy' rating on Digital Realty Trust and has listed the real estate investment trust as its top data center choice for 2025. Analyst Michael Funk wrote in a report to clients that the reason for the upgrade is Digital Realty Trust's strong order book and its overall understanding of artificial intelligence training. He said, 'The explosive growth of artificial intelligence and the resulting surge in demand, combined with the company's ability to maintain pricing power in a supply-demand mismatch, make it possible for the stock to benefit from the entire industry's demand, and its results should begin to appear in 2025.'

**S&P500 Plummets 6% in a Single Day: A Sign of a Global Recession?**
The S&P500 index plummeted by 6% in a single day, a more significant shock than the 9/11 attacks. The Dow Jones 30 industrial average fell 5.50% to 38,314.86, while the S&P500 index dropped 5.97% to 5074.08. The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by tech stocks, fell 5.82% to 15,587.79. The S&P500 has recorded its largest one-day decline since the pandemic in 2020, with a 5.97% drop. The index has also surpassed the daily decline of 5.8% during the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the 4.9% decline after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. The market capitalization of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has declined by $11 trillion since Trump's inauguration in January 2021. Apple and NVIDIA, the two largest companies on the NYSE, fell 15.86% and 14.58%, respectively, over the past two days. Tesla, led by Elon Musk, also plummeted 15.32% over the same period. Even Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, fell 13.56%. The problem is that this market downturn may be just the beginning. Wall Street is dominated by bearish sentiment, with analysts predicting that the US market's recent bull run has ended. Michael Rosen, CIO of Angeles Investment, said, 'Trump's trade policies are unlikely to change easily. The market's reaction to inconsistent trade policies will only have a negative impact on the US and global economies.' The VIX, also known as the 'fear index,' has surged 51% to 45.31, while the CNN fear and greed index has reached a record high of 4, indicating extreme fear. Even Dan Ives, a prominent tech stock bull, said, 'The market is expecting an economic Armageddon and a recession is almost certain. This is all self-inflicted.' The NYSE is likely to be influenced by Trump's trade policies, which may lead to further uncertainty. If the US imposes additional tariffs on Chinese goods, the market may become even more volatile. Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson said, 'If high tariffs persist and negotiations take several months, and major trading partners take additional measures, the risk of a recession, or a bearish scenario, will increase significantly.' If Trump continues to impose tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, the global economy may be on the brink of a recession. JP Morgan has raised the probability of a global recession to 40-60% following the US's announcement of tariffs. RBC Capital Markets' Lori Calvasina has lowered her S&P500 year-end target to 5550 from 6200.

**Global Financial Market Plunges Amid Trade War Fears**
The global financial market was shocked on April 4th as China responded to Donald Trump's tariffs with retaliatory taxes, leading to a 5.5% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the largest one-day decline since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The S&P 500 index fell 5.97% and the Nasdaq composite index fell 5.82%. The S&P 500 index recorded its largest one-day decline since March 16, 2020, when the pandemic spread fear. The Nasdaq index has fallen by over 20% since its high in December last year, entering a technical bear market. The Dow Jones index has fallen by 15% since its high in December, entering a correction period. The three major indices have recorded their largest weekly declines since the pandemic in 2020, with the Dow Jones falling 7.9%, the S&P 500 falling 9.1%, and the Nasdaq falling 10%. The Chinese government announced its retaliatory tax plan on CCTV, a Chinese state-run channel, three hours before the US market opened. China's Ministry of Commerce said it would impose a 34% additional tax on all US imports, effective April 10. The US's move has sparked a global trade war, causing investors to panic about a recession. Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that the US economy is not yet ready for policy changes, further fueling the market's pessimism. The recent correction in the New York Stock Exchange was focused on technology stocks, but this time it was a broad-based decline across all sectors. Apple, the largest company by market capitalization, and NVIDIA, the leader in artificial intelligence chips, fell 7.3% and 10.5%, respectively. Tesla fell 10.5%. The European stock market also fell for the second day, with major indices falling by 5% or more. The 10-year US Treasury yield, which serves as a benchmark for global bond yields, fell to 4% at one point during the day, its lowest level in six months. The US dollar rebounded slightly, with the dollar index rising 0.8% to 102.9 at the close of the New York Stock Exchange. Despite the safe-haven sentiment triggered by the trade war, gold prices fell by around 3%. The June futures contract for gold on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.9% to $3024.2 per ounce. Investors who have been long on gold due to safe-haven sentiment are believed to have sold their positions to realize their gains, as they face margin calls due to a lack of liquidity. The international oil price also fell for the second day, reaching its lowest level in four years. The June futures contract for Brent crude oil on the ICE exchange fell 6.5% to $65.58 per barrel. The May futures contract for West Texas Intermediate crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 7.4% to $61.99 per barrel, its lowest level since April 2021. The decline in oil prices is expected to continue due to the expected decline in oil demand caused by the global recession and the trade war.

**Goldman Sachs Trader Predicts 'End of History' and New Era of Economic Warfare**
Goldman Sachs Macro Trader believes that the recent market volatility marks the 'end of history' and the beginning of a new era of economic warfare, de-globalization, and verticalization. The S&P 500 index fell 4.8% in a single day, its largest one-day drop since 2020. According to the trader, this shift signals a move away from globalization and towards protectionism, with regions becoming more isolated and self-sufficient. As the trader noted, 'it feels like an ‘end of history’ and move to a new era of economic warfare'.

**US Stock Market Plunges as China Imposes New Tariffs**
The US stock market plummeted on Friday, with the S&P 500 index falling 4.8% on Thursday, its largest daily drop since June 2020, after US President Donald Trump imposed a 10% tariff on most imports and higher tariffs on dozens of other countries. Strategists at UBS Global Research said, 'We expect the 5,300 level to be a near-term target for the S&P 500, but if uncertainty over tariffs or trade negotiations with partners persists, the risk of a drop below 5,000 becomes real.' They added, 'The likelihood of US stocks entering a bear market is increasing.' The tariffs fueled expectations of a global economic slowdown and sharp price increases in various sectors in the world's largest consumer market. The Nasdaq index, dominated by the technology sector, fell around 6% on Thursday, its largest daily drop since the pandemic peak in March 2020. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.5% in the previous session, and the index was on its way to confirming a correction, a 10% drop from its all-time high. By 6:12 am ET, the small electronic S&P 500 futures fell 67.5 points, or 1.24%, the small electronic Nasdaq 100 futures fell 228 points, or 1.22%, and the small electronic Dow Jones futures fell 576 points, or 1.41%. US bank stocks saw further declines on Friday, with the sector facing global pressure as investors expect more interest rate cuts from central banks and economic growth to be hurt by tariffs. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup shares fell around 2% in pre-opening trading. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell to its lowest level in six months at 3.95%. A Labor Department report due at 8:30 am ET is expected to show a slowdown in US job growth in March, amid collective layoffs of government employees to reduce federal spending, and companies' hesitation to increase hiring due to tariffs on imports. Non-farm payrolls are likely to rise by 135,000 in March, after rising by 151,000 in the previous month. Attention will also be focused on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at 11:25 am ET for clues on the interest rate path. Investors continue to expect a more accommodative policy from the US central bank, with futures contracts for the Fed's policy meeting pricing in cumulative rate cuts of 100 basis points by the end of this year, compared to around 75 basis points in the previous week.

**US Stock Market Experiences Largest Single-Day Loss Since 2020**
The US stock market experienced a significant decline on March 16, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the recent drop of 2.4 trillion dollars in the S&P 500 companies' market value is the largest single-day loss since then. The S&P 500 companies lost a total of 2.4 trillion dollars in market value, with the Nasdaq Composite Index experiencing a 5.97% decline, the largest daily drop since March 2020. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also saw their largest percentage losses since June 2020. Investors reacted negatively to President Trump's new 10% tariff on imported products and aggressive counter-tariffs against many countries. The tariffs raised concerns that trade disputes could lead to a global economic slowdown and higher inflation. The VIX, Wall Street's fear index, rose to 30.02% and reached its highest closing since August 5, 2024. The Dow Jones Index fell 1,679.39 points, or 3.98%, to 40,545.93, while the S&P 500 fell 274.45 points, or 4.84%, to 5,396.52, and the Nasdaq fell 1,050.44 points, or 5.97%, to 16,550.61. The US dollar also weakened significantly. The euro rose to a six-month high against the dollar, increasing by 1.74% to 1.1037 dollars. The dollar fell 1.95% against the Japanese yen to 146.445 yen and 2.35% against the Swiss franc to 0.8608 francs. In Europe, the 27-country EU bloc faced a 20% reciprocal tax. The STOXX 600 index fell 2.57% across Europe.

**U.S. Stocks tumble: Billions wiped out, worst performance in 2025 & cause of tumble**
U.S. stocks plummeted on Friday, marking the worst performance of the year 2025. The S&P 500 recorded its largest single-day percentage drop since 18 December, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq composite also falling sharply. According to S&P Global, $927 billion was wiped out in a single day, with experts attributing the decline to worries over President Donald Trump's radical policies and their impact on the economy. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, stated, 'Sales are reportedly being hit by the uncertainty caused by the changing political landscape, and prices are rising amid tariff-related price hikes from suppliers.' The decline is also attributed to U.S. consumers cutting down on spending in preparation for higher inflation, with a survey by the University of Michigan predicting inflation to rise to 4.3% in the coming months.

**US Stock Market Experiences Largest Single-Day Decline of 2025 Amid Concerns Over Rising Tariffs and Inflation**
The US stock market experienced its largest single-day decline of 2025 on Friday, February 21, due to concerns over rising tariffs and persistent inflation. The S&P 500 index fell 1.7%, its largest decline since December 18, 2024, when the Federal Reserve announced plans to slow down interest rate cuts. The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.2%, its largest decline since January 27, 2025, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 748.63 points, a 1.69% decline, the worst since 2025. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-cap US companies, fell over 2%, exceeding the S&P 500's decline, indicating a cooling market sentiment. The market's sell-off is linked to a series of disappointing economic data, showing that the US economy is facing challenges from high interest rates and inflation expectations. According to the National Association of Realtors, US existing home sales fell 4.9% in January compared to the previous month, due to high mortgage rates and rising housing prices, causing buyers to hesitate. The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index (MCSI) fell sharply in February, indicating increased uncertainty among consumers about the future economy. The survey also showed that the five-year inflation expectation reached 3.5%, the highest level since 1995. Steve Sosnick, chief economist at Interactive Brokers, noted that weak retail sales and other economic indicators have shown that the US economy may be cooling down. Trump's tariff policy and other uncertainties have also begun to erode consumer and business confidence. The S&P Global US Composite PMI index fell to 50.4 in February, the lowest reading since September 2023, and below January's 52.7. Manufacturers cited rising prices and labor costs due to tariffs as the main reasons for increasing input costs. Chris Williamson, chief economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said, 'The optimism of US businesses at the beginning of the year has disappeared, and the market is now shrouded in uncertainty, business stagnation, and rising prices.' The stock market sell-off was accompanied by a rise in US Treasury prices, indicating that investors are turning to defensive assets such as US government bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 0.08 percentage points to 4.42%, a two-week low.
