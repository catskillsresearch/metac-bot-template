**UK Pensions: DC trustee agenda update - July 2025**
The UK Pension Schemes Bill has been published, introducing changes to the DC pensions landscape, including a value for money framework, requirements for master trusts and GPPs, and a framework for consolidation of small, dormant pots. The bill aims to be passed by the start of 2026. The Pensions Regulator (TPR) has published guidance on preparing for and responding to market volatility, and the Pensions Dashboards Programme (PDP) has published its data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for processing in relation to the central dashboards architecture. Changes under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act (ECCTA) are being brought in gradually, including compulsory identity verification for new directors and Persons with Significant Control (PSCs) by autumn 2025. TPR will be extending its oversight of professional trustee (PT) firms, beginning with targeted engagement with larger firms in the summer. 'Action: Keep a watching brief as the bill progresses and regulations are published. Arrange training on the aspects that affect your scheme.'

**ANSES Announces Increases for Pensioners and Retirees in July 2025**
The National Administration of Social Security (ANSES) has announced updated figures for pensioners, retirees, and beneficiaries of social programs that will take effect from July 2025. The changes apply under the new mobility formula, based solely on the monthly variation of the Consumer Price Index (IPC), which has been in effect since April. The minimum pension will increase by 1.5% to $309,294.79, while the maximum pension will rise to $2,081,261.17. The $70,000 bonus remains in effect as an economic reinforcement, but its value continues to decline in real terms, affecting those who depend on it the most. ANSES aims to maintain family income, but the increases are also affected by the acceleration of prices. The monthly bonus will continue to be renewed by the Executive Power, but there are no official announcements on its continuation in the second half of 2025.

**Will There Be an Interim Increase in the Minimum Wage in July 2025?**
Citizens are wondering about the possibility of an interim increase in the minimum wage in July 2025, due to rising inflation and living costs. The government's recent statements suggest a cautious approach to interim increases. According to the latest statements by Labor and Social Security Minister Vedat Işıkhan, the possibility of an interim increase in the minimum wage in 2025 is becoming clearer. Experts believe that if inflation exceeds the target level by mid-year, the government may decide on an interim increase. The minimum wage for January 2025 was set at 22,104 TL net and 26,005 TL gross, with an increase of around 30%. There are predictions of a 20-30% increase in the minimum wage for July 2025. The government will re-evaluate the minimum wage in July based on inflation differences, public contracts, and economic indicators. However, there is no official decision on an interim increase yet. If the inflation rate for January-May is around 15.10%, it could rise to 16-18% with the addition of June's inflation rate. This rate will determine the increase in the minimum wage for SSK and BAĞ-KUR retirees in July 2025. If the interim increase is 16%, the lowest pension will be around 16,785 TL, and if it is 18%, it will be around 17,075 TL. The final increase rate will be announced on July 3, 2025, after the release of June's inflation rate. Retirees can expect an increase of 16-18% in their pensions, but the final figures will depend on the announced inflation rate. They will receive their zamlı maaş ödemeleri, usually between July 17 and 26.

**Denmark increases salary requirements for foreign workers and residence permits effective July 2025**
Denmark has announced a revision to its salary requirements for foreign nationals seeking work and residence permits, effective July 1, 2025. Applicants must now earn a minimum monthly salary of DKK 74,958, which must also align with the national average for their specific occupation. The updated policy aims to ensure fair compensation for foreign workers, aligning salaries with national wage standards. The revised income rules apply to several popular Danish work schemes, and employers must declare salaries in Danish kroner and pay them into a Danish bank account. To ensure compliance, employment contracts should clearly state the salary and conditions. The Danish Agency for International Recruitment and Integration (SIRI) will evaluate salaries based on income data from the Confederation of Danish Employers (DA), ensuring that pay matches the lower quartile for the job role and experience level in the specific region. 'The goal is to ensure you're paid fairly and treated in line with Danish labor standards,' according to the Danish Agency for International Recruitment and Integration (SIRI).

**Agirc-Arrco Overhauls Rules in 2025: New Calculation Boosts Pensions for Thousands of Retirees**
The Agirc-Arrco is changing its rules in 2025, introducing a new calculation method that will increase the pension of thousands of retirees. This reform applies to all private sector employees who benefit from a reduced working day allowance, provided they have a written agreement specifying the organization of their working time. The new mechanism aims to correct a structural injustice in the management of atypical careers. It targets those who move away from traditional full-time work but still receive a high salary. More and more companies are adopting flexible work models, increasing the number of workers affected. To benefit from the revaluation, employees must verify their employment contract or any amendments to check for the mention of a reduced working day allowance and the number of working days per year. They must also contact their HR department or payroll manager to ensure that this information is correctly communicated to the Agirc-Arrco caisses. A simple administrative check can activate this discreet but powerful lever. Employees can also request a summary of their rights via the Agirc-Arrco portal to measure the differences before and after the reform, and plan for any necessary adjustments. This revision of the calculation represents a real opportunity for revaluation for those who were previously disadvantaged, and it embodies a social evolution towards greater flexibility without penalizing non-linear careers. As Antoine Martin, a journalist for La Pause Info, notes, 'This reform rewards those who continue to actively contribute to the economic life of their company despite an adjusted work schedule.'

**Poland Introduces 4-Day Workweek and Labor Law Reforms**
Poland has launched a pilot program to reduce working hours without reducing salaries. Employees and employers can choose from three options. The full transition to the new system is expected by November 2027. The program has been allocated 10 million zlotys for 2026. The rules for the experimental model must be published by June 30. However, some experts question the initiative due to costs. Additionally, several changes to labor legislation have been made. The Polish Sejm passed a law on transparency in wages on May 9, 2025. The law requires employers to indicate the salary or salary range in job postings or before an interview. Employers are also prohibited from asking candidates about their previous income level. The law will take effect six months after publication. The SprawdzaMY.com team has proposed simplifying interactions between businesses and the Social Insurance Office (ZUS). The key innovation is the Unified Insurance File, which automates accounting and payment calculations. ZUS will take on some responsibilities, and the number of paper forms will be reduced, with some data being sent directly to the Polish Statistics Office. A court ruling on March 19, 2025, stated that employers are not required to send subcontractors under civil law contracts for medical exams. This decision may affect personnel policy in the food and services sector. The Ministry of Labor has prepared a bill to change the rules for calculating work experience. Work experience will be credited for: The bill is expected to take effect on January 1, 2026. The Polish government has approved a bill to exclude bonuses from the minimum wage starting in 2026. First, functional bonuses will be excluded, then other bonuses, and from 2028, also premiums. This is part of implementing the European directive on adequate minimum pay. In 2025, the State Labor Inspectorate plans to conduct 55,000 inspections to identify cases where civil law contracts conceal actual employment. They will also check temporary employment agencies and their clients for abuse of outsourcing forms.

**Critical Date for July Salary Increase for Retirees Announced**
The critical date for the July salary increase for retirees is when the inflation data will be announced on July 3. Meanwhile, SSK retirees will receive their salaries between July 17-26, Bağ-Kur retirees between July 25-28, and civil servant retirees between July 1-5. After the increase is announced, the rate of the salary increase will be discussed, including the possibility of increasing the rate through the 'refah payı' (welfare share) and similar applications. If the welfare share decision is made and implemented, the salary increase rate will be higher for retirees. A decision in July will also be made regarding the minimum pension.

**Enflasyon Data to be Announced on July 3: Impact on Civil Servant and Retiree Salaries**
According to the official calendar of TÜİK, the inflation data for June 2025 will be announced to the public on Thursday, July 3, 2025, at 10:00. This data will also clarify the 6-month inflation rate for the period of January-June 2025. As a result, the salary increases for civil servants and retirees in July will be determined. The salaries of civil servants and retirees are updated annually in January and July based on the inflation data announced by TÜİK. If the collective bargaining agreement rate is below the 6-month inflation rate, the difference is reflected in the salaries as 'inflation difference'. Therefore, the June inflation data plays a decisive role in determining the increase in salaries for civil servants and SSK-Bağ-Kur retirees. As stated by the TÜİK official calendar, 'With this data, the 6-month inflation rate for the period of January-June 2025 will be clarified, and the salary increases for civil servants and retirees in July will be determined.'

**Form 16 Changes For Salaried Employees: What You Need To Know For FY 2024-25 ITR Filing?**
Salaried employees in India will receive their Form 16 documents by June 15, 2025, for the Financial Year 2024-25. This year, Form 16 will include changes due to updates in the July 2024 Budget. According to tax expert CA Gauri Chadha, 'One of the key changes is that Form 16 will clearly mention your selected tax regime.' Employees who switched jobs during the financial year should get Form 16 from every employer to report all income correctly. The 2024 Budget allows salaried individuals to share details of TDS from other income and TCS on certain expenses with their employer, which will be included in the revised Form 16. Additionally, employees opting for the new tax regime will see an increased standard deduction of ₹75,000 in their Form 16, up from ₹50,000 under the old regime. Employers' contributions to the National Pension System (NPS) will also appear as higher deductions in Form 16, up to 14% of the employee's basic salary.

**UK unemployment rises to a four-year high as firms cut back on hires**
The UK unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in the period from February to April 2025, the highest rate seen since summer 2021. The number of staff on payroll fell by 109,000 month-on-month in May, and annual pay growth excluding bonuses eased to 5.2%. The number of available jobs fell by 63,000 to 736,000 between March and May. The data suggests the UK's labour market is cooling as firms are hesitant to hire due to rising employer costs, including increased payroll taxes and a bumped-up minimum wage. According to Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, 'Indeed, with increased national insurance contributions on businesses now bedded in, the employment picture is deteriorating as companies look to scale back hiring, and in some cases cut their UK workforce significantly.' The Bank of England will meet next week for their monetary policy meeting, and while there are expectations that they may deliver a rate cut later in the summer, Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis, noted that 'Whilst the smart money is still on no cut at the Bank of England's meeting next week, the softening in the labour market and cooling wage increases have added to expectations that the MPC will deliver another cut later in the summer.'

**UK employment plummets by most in five years, 276,000 jobs lost since Oct 2024**
The UK employment rate has plummeted by 109,000 in May, the largest decline in five years, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This brings the total number of jobs lost since October 2024 to 276,000. The payrolls number is often revised, but the ONS warned that May's figure should be treated with caution. The labour market has deteriorated significantly since the £26 billion tax hike on businesses took effect in April. Economists had predicted a 20,000 fall, but the actual decline was much worse. The pay growth excluding bonuses eased to 5.2 per cent, the slowest pace in seven months. Private-sector wage growth cooled to 5.1 per cent from 5.5 per cent. Unemployment rose to 4.6 per cent, the highest since the summer of 2021. ONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown said, 'There continues to be weakening in the labour market, with the number of people on payroll falling notably.' KPMG UK chief economist Yael Selfin added, 'Today's labour market data provides the Bank of England with tentative evidence that the rise in labour costs is unlikely to lead to a rebound in wage growth.'

**Thousands of workers warned over HMRC 'jobs tax' under Labour government - Birmingham Live**
The UK's labour market has seen a decline in vacancies and payrolled employee numbers, according to data released by the ONS. Vacancies dropped by 26,000 between January and March 2025, marking the 33rd consecutive quarter of decline. Payrolled employee numbers also fell by 8,000 between January and February, with early estimates suggesting a sharper fall of 78,000 in March. Experts warn that the decline is a result of the upcoming 'jobs tax' under a Labour government, which is expected to increase labour costs in April. Thomas Pugh of RSM UK said, 'This is a clear sign that employers are cutting back ahead of the sharp rise in labour costs in April.' Stephen Perkins of Yellow Brick Mortgages added, 'Fewer people working and fewer available vacancies is not the recipe for growth the government was promising.' Danni Hewson of AJ Bell noted that the decline is a result of the post-pandemic boom coming to an end, saying, 'For 33 months now vacancy numbers have been slipping back like sand falling through an hourglass... The last remnants of a post-pandemic boom that helped the UK stay resilient... have finally ended.' Lindsay James of Quilter cautioned that the accuracy of the data is a concern, saying, 'Concerns around the accuracy of the data make these labour market updates considerably less trustworthy than in previous cycles.'

**DWP urging workers to 'check payslips' ahead of major change - Liverpool Echo**
The UK's Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is urging workers to 'check their payslips' ahead of a major change in April 2025. Millions of workers will receive a significant pay increase, with a boost of £1,400 per year for eligible full-time workers. The National Minimum Wage for 18-20 year olds will rise to £10.00 per hour, while the National Living Wage for those aged 21 and over will increase to £12.21 per hour. Employment Rights Minister Justin Madders said, 'Economic growth only matters if working people are feeling the benefits.' The new pay increase will also put an end to age-based wage discrimination, ensuring that younger workers are paid the same as their older colleagues for doing the same job.

**Preparing salary sacrifice car schemes for the 2026 P11D reporting change**
Ahead of the mandatory shift to payroll all Benefits-in-Kind (BIKs) by April 2026, employers must start preparations early to avoid payroll headaches, errors, and HMRC penalties. Cheryl Clements, business development manager at Tusker, emphasizes that this change is not just a compliance update, but a strategic shift in how benefits are managed, reported, and understood across the workforce. Employers must audit their payroll systems, engage with providers, and communicate the changes to employees to ensure a smooth transition. This is an opportunity for organisations to reassess their entire benefits strategy, enhance their competitiveness, and create long-term value. It's recommended to set internal deadlines well ahead of the statutory date, aiming for October 2025, to ensure a successful transition.
