**Virginia Giuffre's Death: A Life of Trauma and Stress**
Virginia Giuffre, one of the most prominent accusers of financier Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, had been experiencing significant stress and depression in the months leading up to her death. According to sources close to her family, Giuffre was 'overwhelmed for several weeks before her death, feeling like everything she had fought for was crumbling.' She had been involved in a lawsuit with artist Rina O, who was seeking £7.5 million in damages for alleged defamation. Giuffre had previously accused Prince Andrew of sexual assault and received a $12 million settlement from him in February 2022. Giuffre's lawyer had been using the lawsuit as a way to discredit her and potentially use it as a basis for a new defamation lawsuit against her. 'She was feeling like everything was falling apart,' said a source close to the family. 'She had been through so much trauma with the Epstein case, and this was just another layer of stress and anxiety.' The lawsuit concerns a series of posts on social media, interviews, and a book of memoirs, Billionaire's Playboy Club, in which Giuffre made allegedly defamatory and hurtful statements about O. According to sources, Prince Andrew's lawyers were considering using the lawsuit as a way to discredit Giuffre further. The FBI has also obtained thousands of videos made by Epstein, which may show meetings between Giuffre and influential figures, including Prince Andrew. 'We have thousands of videos that show the relationships between Epstein and his associates, including Prince Andrew,' said former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.

**A Requiem For Virginia Giuffre**
Virginia Giuffre, a victim of child sex trafficking, shared her story with author Nick Bryant. She was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, including Ghislaine Maxwell, from 1999 to 2002. During this time, she was forced to have sex with numerous powerful men, including Prince Andrew, Alan Dershowitz, and Les Wexner. Giuffre's story was corroborated by evidence, including a photo of her with Prince Andrew and instructions from Maxwell to bring a minor from Thailand for their trafficking ring. Giuffre's affidavit in 2015 named several of her perpetrators, including Maxwell, Dershowitz, and Prince Andrew. Maxwell accused Giuffre of lying, but Giuffre stood strong and eventually settled with Maxwell for an undisclosed amount. Giuffre also filed a lawsuit against Prince Andrew in 2021, which he settled for $12 million in 2022. Dershowitz initiated a defamation campaign against Giuffre and her lawyers, but Edwards and Cassell sued him for defamation. Dershowitz's wife was absent from many of the flights he took with Epstein, and his alibi for the flights was shaky. Giuffre's story is a testament to the bravery of victims of child sex trafficking and the need for justice and accountability.

**Bride branded 'selfish' over 'unhinged' warning she gave to her bridesmaid ahead of the wedding | Daily Mail Online**
A woman has been called 'odd and selfish' by Reddit users after telling her bridesmaid not to get pregnant before the wedding. The bridesmaid, who shared her story on Reddit, said the bride told her to wait until after the wedding, citing concerns about looking 'huge in photos.' Many commenters were supportive of the bridesmaid, agreeing that it was an unreasonable request. One user said, 'I'm quite certain deciding to have a child and getting pregnant is WAY more important in your life than this bride's 'special day.' IMO, asking people to put their lives on hold like this is truly odd and selfish behavior.' Another user suggested that the bridesmaid tell the bride she'll get pregnant when it's best for her and if it's not for the bride, she'll be a guest, not a bridesmaid. A further poster agreed, noting, 'Girlfriend, you get ONE life. The choice to have a child is between you and your partner. Don't let a selfish fool have any kind of power over you.'

**Virginia Giuffre 'extremely distressed' about Prince Andrew payout before taking her own life - The Mirror**
Virginia Giuffre was 'extremely distressed' two weeks before her suicide, fearing she would lose her £7.5 million payout from Prince Andrew due to a defamation lawsuit filed by artist Rina Oh. Sources close to Giuffre said she was depressed over the collapse of her marriage and possibly losing her money. Giuffre had accused Oh of physically assaulting her in tweets, but Oh has denied the allegations and claims to be a victim of Epstein's manipulation and abuse. Oh's lawyer stated, 'Considering the high profile nature of the Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and Prince Andrew story, [Giuffre] knew that accusing [Oh], a fellow victim, of such horrible things, would maximise the spread and harm and damage to [Oh].' The lawsuit was set to be used by Andrew's legal team to attack Giuffre, who sued Andrew in 2021 for sex abuse and received a reported £12m settlement.

**The lead prosecutors have experience in complex racketeering cases.**
The lead prosecutors in the case against Robert Combs have extensive experience in complex racketeering cases. Ms. Comey, one of the lead prosecutors, has a decade of experience and was involved in the case against Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking. Another lead prosecutor, Emily A. Johnson, has several gang-related racketeering cases on her résumé, including one involving a Trinitarios gang leader who was sentenced to life in prison. The prosecutors have presented information about their case bit by bit, keeping the vast majority of details out of public view until the trial. They have signaled that their star witness will be Casandra Ventura, Mr. Combs's former girlfriend, but have not uttered her name in public court so far. The prosecutors have also bristled at public statements by Mr. Combs's lawyers that they considered inappropriate, including a comment by Mark Geragos that the prosecution team was a 'six-pack of white women'.

**Virginia Giuffre feared loss of £12m Prince Andrew payout, pal claims**
Virginia Giuffre, who received a reported £12 million settlement from Prince Andrew, feared losing the payout in a court battle with another Jeffrey Epstein victim, Rina Oh, according to a friend. Giuffre was 'extremely distressed' in the lead up to her death by suicide on April 25, and felt like everything she had fought for was 'going or gone.' Oh is suing Giuffre's estate for falsely describing her as a girlfriend of Epstein and one of his recruiters. The lawsuit will pass to Giuffre's estate under New York law. Oh's lawyer stated, 'Considering the high profile nature of the Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and Prince Andrew story, [Giuffre] knew that accusing [Oh], a fellow victim, of such horrible things, would maximise the spread and harm and damage to [Oh].' Oh has denied the allegations against her and claims to be a victim of Epstein's abuse. The lawsuit is expected to be used by Prince Andrew to attack Giuffre, who sued the Duke in 2021 for sex abuse.

**Sean 'Diddy' Combs Lawyers Face Uphill Battle In Bid To Undermine Accusers**
Sean 'Diddy' Combs' lawyers face an uphill battle in trying to undermine the credibility of accusers who claim he forced them to participate in his elaborate sex parties. Combs has pleaded not guilty to five felony counts, including racketeering and sex trafficking. Prosecutors say he used his business empire to lure women into his orbit with promises of romantic relationships or financial support, and then used violence and threats to obligate them to take part in days-long, drug-fueled sexual performances known as 'Freak Offs'. Combs' lawyers have signaled they intend to argue the women had financial incentives to falsely accuse Combs of abuse, and have pointed to a hotel surveillance video depicting Combs kicking and dragging a woman in a hallway as evidence of a domestic dispute unrelated to any racketeering conspiracy. However, experts say the video is likely to be damaging to Combs' case, and that the indictment lacks details about other specific actions Combs had taken to compel women to take part in the 'Freak Offs'. Combs' defence says it has evidence that the accusers are not being candid, but many of these defendants, such as R&B singer R. Kelly and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, have been convicted anyway. 'The defence has quite the uphill battle ahead,' said Heather Cucolo, a New York Law School professor. 'There was a clear power dynamic, and that power dynamic is going to be a main focus and a main issue here.'

**Virginia Giuffre's Tweet About Not Being 'Suicidal' Resurfaces After Her Death**
Virginia Giuffre's family has confirmed her death by suicide, remembering her as a fierce advocate against sexual abuse. In 2019, Giuffre denied any suicidal intentions, warning of potential harm from influential individuals. Her death has resurfaced a 2019 post on X, where she stated, 'I am making it publicly known that in no way, shape or form am I suicidal.' Giuffre's family and friends have paid tribute to her fight for justice, with her attorney, Sigrid McCawley, saying, 'Virginia was fearless, and her courage pushed me to fight harder.' Giuffre was a vocal accuser of convicted sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, and had reached a multi-million dollar settlement with Prince Andrew in 2022. According to her family, Giuffre had been a victim of domestic violence in her marriage and had reported an assault to the authorities on January 9, 2025.

**New details emerge about Virginia Giuffre's final moments**
Virginia Giuffre, a sex trafficking victim who was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein as a teenager, has died at the age of 41. According to preliminary findings, her death is 'not suspicious' and was declared at the scene after paramedics provided emergency first aid. Giuffre's family confirmed her death in a statement, saying she had lost her life to suicide after grappling with the toll of abuse. 'Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking,' the family wrote. 'She was the light that lifted so many survivors.' Giuffre had claimed she was sexually abused by Prince Andrew at the behest of Epstein's associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, when she was just 17. She had filed a federal lawsuit against Andrew in 2021, which he agreed to settle for an undisclosed fee in 2022. He has consistently denied ever having sex with her.

**Jeffrey Epstein's Convicted Accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell Asks the US Supreme Court To Hear Her Appeal | The Gateway Pundit | by Paul Serran**
Ghislaine Maxwell, a convicted sex offender and former close friend of Prince Andrew, is asking the US Supreme Court to hear her appeal against a 2021 conviction on five counts of aiding Jeffrey Epstein in his sexual abuse of young girls. Maxwell's lawyers argue that she should not have been charged as Epstein's 'co-conspirator' due to a 2007 plea deal in Florida, where Epstein agreed to plead guilty to child sex abuse charges in exchange for his 'co-conspirators' avoiding prosecution. The prosecutors argue that different jurisdictions have different rules for honoring plea deals made elsewhere. Maxwell's lawyers claim that a defendant should be able to rely on a promise that the US will not prosecute again, without being subject to a 'gotcha' in another jurisdiction. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence in Tallahassee State Prison, Florida.

**Socialite sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell 'considers pardon bid' from old pal Donald Trump - Daily Record**
Ghislaine Maxwell, the socialite convicted of sex trafficking, is considering asking her old friend Donald Trump for a presidential pardon. Sources close to Maxwell believe her long friendship with Trump could lead to her freedom from prison. Trump has a history of granting pardons to those loyal to him, and Maxwell has maintained her loyalty by not revealing his friendship with her and Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell's supporters argue that her trial was unfair and that she was scapegoated for Epstein's crimes. If a full pardon proves politically unpalatable, another option is a prisoner transfer agreement, which would allow her to return to a UK prison and serve the rest of her sentence. Critics argue that a Maxwell pardon or transfer would further confirm suspicions that Trump is keen to keep Epstein's web of connections buried.

**Trump 'pardon bid' for jailed socialite and sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell**
Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed socialite and sex trafficker, is considering seeking a presidential pardon from Donald Trump. Those close to her believe their long friendship could help set her free. Maxwell was convicted of grooming and trafficking underage girls for her former boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein, a friend of Trump's. A source said, 'Given how many pardons Trump has issued in the weeks since being back in power, those in Ghislaine's clique joked she should push for one.' Trump is acutely aware of the information Maxwell has on him, including their friendship and his association with Epstein. Maxwell's supporters argue that her trial was unfair and that she was scapegoated for Epstein's crimes. They claim she was subjected to harsh treatment in custody and that her conviction was part of a broader effort by the US government to appear tough on the Epstein scandal without exposing the full extent of his powerful connections. A source close to her legal team said, 'Ghislaine has always believed she was unfairly targeted.' If a full pardon proves politically unpalatable, another option remains a prisoner transfer agreement. Trump's Department of Justice could approve her return to a UK prison, where her remaining sentence would be substantially reduced. Critics argue that a Maxwell pardon or transfer would further confirm suspicions that Trump is keen to keep Epstein's web of connections buried.

**Epstein's List of Contacts Revealed: Clinton, Pastrana, and Mick Jagger Confirmed**
The US Department of Justice has declassified documents revealing the list of contacts of Jeffrey Epstein, including figures such as Mick Jagger, Naomi Campbell, Bill Clinton, and former Colombian President Andrés Pastrana. The 200-page files confirm trips on his plane and meetings, increasing pressure to clarify the network of the deceased pedophile, accused of child sex trafficking. The list includes politicians, celebrities, and business leaders linked to Epstein, who was convicted of child sex trafficking before his death in 2019. Pam Bondi, the US Attorney General, confirmed the declassification, stating that 'the first phase contains known information, but now it's official.' She demanded that the FBI deliver 'thousands' of additional files by this Friday. Other notable names include Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, Alec Baldwin, Naomi Campbell, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and former President Andrés Pastrana, who traveled on Epstein's private plane, according to the records. Pastrana faced criticism in 2020 for using the 'Lolita Express' -- linked to the transportation of victims --, although he insisted that his trip to Cuba in 2003 with Epstein was 'diplomatic.' Former President Bill Clinton also appears in multiple testimonies. Johanna Sjoberg, one of the victims, stated that Epstein told her that Clinton 'likes young women, referring to the women.' Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's accomplice, confirmed that Clinton traveled on the jet, although she was unaware of the frequency. Clinton defended in 2019 that his trips to Africa in the 2000s were 'humanitarian' and that he cut ties with the magnate upon learning of his crimes. The curious 'disappearance' of Trump The magazine People claims to have had access to flight records and includes the name of US President Donald Trump in seven instances. However, curiously, Trump's name does not appear in this batch, justifying that the appearance of someone's name in flight records does not indicate any irregularity. Trump, who was in office when Epstein was arrested in 2019, suggested during his campaign last year that he would seek to open government files.

**Alina Habba Drops Bombshell: Absolutely Expects Criminal Charges After Epstein Files Drop TODAY After Meeting with Kash Patel and Pam Bondi | The Gateway Pundit | by Jim Hᴏft**
Alina Habba, a Trump attorney, has revealed that she met with Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel at the White House, hinting that the long-awaited release of the Jeffrey Epstein files is imminent. Habba confirmed that the files, which contain flight logs, names, and damning evidence, are 'mere moments from hitting the public square.' She suggests that the release of the files will hold powerful men accountable for their involvement in the Epstein scandal, which has been shrouded in secrecy for years. Habba 'absolutely expects' criminal charges to be filed as a result of the release of the files. 'For years, the Epstein scandal has been shrouded in secrecy, with high-profile elites mysteriously dodging accountability while only one individual -- Epstein's longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell -- was sentenced to prison,' Habba said. 'Despite the well-documented abuse of hundreds of young victims, no powerful men have been held responsible. That, Habba suggests, is about to change.'
