**🔥YouTube Just Launched Podcast Charts and the Rankings Are Already Wild**
YouTube has launched an official weekly podcast chart in the US, ranking the top 100 podcasts based on watch data from YouTube and YouTube Music. The chart includes both video and audio-first podcasts, and YouTube's move into public podcast rankings is seen as a power play in the broader shift in the podcast space. The Joe Rogan Experience and Huberman Lab are currently leading the chart, and YouTube's momentum in the podcast space is expected to continue, particularly as Gen Z and younger millennials treat video podcasts as their go-to format. The bigger question is what comes next, with potential implications for exclusive podcast deals, Spotify's video podcast UX, and how creators think about success in the podcast space.

**Meghan Markle's New Podcast Makes Lukewarm Debut on Spotify**
Meghan Markle's new podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, made a relatively quiet entrance on Spotify's global stage, ranking at number 10 on Spotify's general top podcast chart in the United States. The first episode featured Markle in conversation with Whitney Wolfe Herd, the founder of Tinder and Bumble. Critics generally panned it, although it's worth noting that Markle's previous podcast, Archetypes, debuted at number one in its launch week in 2022, but quickly slipped down the rankings as listeners tired of the formula. According to Spotify's rankings, the show's relatively low ranking may be a disappointment for such a high-profile launch.

**Meghan's new podcast FLOPS as first episode fails to meet figures of her Archetypes show - amid criticism of interview style and after Spotify boss called she and Harry 'f****** grifters' | Daily Mail Online**
Meghan Markle's new podcast, 'Confessions Of A Female Founder', has received scathing reviews, with critics condemning its 'vapid lessons in self-love' and 'ego-fluffing conversation'. The podcast, which sees Meghan chat with successful women who have launched their own businesses, has been given one star by The Times and The Irish Times, with reviewers criticizing its 'mutual love-in' and 'sycophantic interview style'. This comes after Spotify's Head of Podcast Innovation and Monetization, Bill Simmons, called Harry and Meghan 'f***ing grifters' in 2023. Meghan's previous podcast, 'Archetypes', was a success, ranking at Number One in the US podcast chart in 2022, but its reported $20million deal with Spotify ended in June 2022. Meghan has also faced criticism for her interview style and her new luxury food brand, As Ever, which was accompanied by an eight-part Netflix cooking show. Speaking to PEOPLE Magazine, Meghan said that talking to other female founders has been 'meaningful' for her entrepreneurial journey, but critics have condemned the podcast as 'inane' and 'stomach-turning'.
