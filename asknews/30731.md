**Could bird flu be the next pandemic? What we know about H5N1**
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has reported 70 human cases of H5N1 bird flu in the U.S. since 2024, with the first human death caused by the virus announced in early 2025. While the CDC considers the risk to the public to be low, many experts have varying opinions on the potential for the virus to escalate into a more serious problem. Jacob Lemieux, an infectious disease specialist, said, 'I think we are living next to a volcano, and it may erupt or it may not, but we need to prepare for the possibility of a pandemic.' The virus has been detected in wild birds, poultry, and dairy cows in the U.S., and has also been found in North Carolina, where no human cases have been announced. The CDC advises that poultry and eggs should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees to kill bacteria and viruses, including avian influenza A viruses. Biosecurity measures can help protect backyard chickens and other domestic birds from infectious diseases, including avian flu. The symptoms of bird flu in humans may include eye redness, respiratory symptoms, and fever, and anyone with direct or close exposure to infected birds or animals should be monitored for illness for 10 days after their last exposure.

**USDA's Animal Health Agency Loses Key Personnel Amid Avian Flu Outbreak**
The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has lost 1,377 employees, including 400 veterinarians, due to the Trump administration's push for voluntary resignations. This has left fewer experts to combat the longest outbreak of avian flu in US history and the invasion of the New World beetle, a carnivorous pest detected among cattle in Mexico. 'With the decrease in veterinary positions at the USDA, there is concern that fewer veterinarians may be able to meet the ongoing regulatory requirements, disease investigations, and planning and preparation for responses,' said Kansas Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith. 'This may result in slower response times and reduced capacity to meet local veterinary needs,' he added. The loss of personnel threatens the APHIS's ability to respond to the avian flu, which continues to infect dairy herds and birds, said three state veterinarians and three other sources. Seventy people, mostly rural workers, have contracted the virus since 2024, and a wider spread increases the risk of the avian flu becoming more transmissible to humans, experts say. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say the risk of transmission of avian flu to people remains low.

**Acre Declares State of Emergency Due to Respiratory Syndrome Cases**
The state of Acre in Brazil has declared a state of emergency in public health due to a significant increase in cases of Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SRAG) and overcrowding of intensive care units, particularly pediatric ones. According to the Epidemiological Bulletin of Respiratory Syndromes nº 13/2025, there has been a constant increase in hospitalizations since the 13th epidemiological week of the year, with a higher incidence among children aged 0-9 years and seniors over 60 years. The most common viruses identified in hospitalized patients are SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Rhinovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Influenza A, and Influenza B. Many cases evolve into pneumonia and bronchiolitis, requiring intensive care unit admission. With this measure, the State Health Secretariat will coordinate the emergency response, authorizing the adoption of urgent administrative measures, including emergency expenses to expand the capacity for care. State government agencies and entities will prioritize health demands. The decree also allows the Health Secretariat to issue complementary acts as necessary to address the situation.

**Mato Grosso do Sul Launches Emergency Vaccination Plan for Influenza**
The Government of Mato Grosso do Sul has launched the MS Vacina Mais - Emergency Vaccination Plan for Influenza 2025, which aims to increase vaccination coverage among priority groups. The plan allocates R$ 825 million in state resources to support municipalities in their vaccination efforts. The current vaccination coverage is 22.35% among priority groups, which is below the 90% target set by the Ministry of Health. The plan includes a unique financial incentive for municipalities, with Dourados receiving R$ 25,000, Três Lagoas, Corumbá, and Ponta Porã receiving R$ 20,000 each, and the remaining 56 municipalities receiving R$ 10,000 each. The plan also includes strategies to reach vulnerable populations, such as vaccination in schools, creches, and long-term care facilities, as well as mobile vaccination units and application in public areas. The campaign will be intensified from April 28 to May 10, and a large mobilization is planned for the national Day D on May 10. According to the Secretary of State for Health, Maurício Simões Corrêa, 'This mobilization is essential to reverse the low indices and avoid the aggravation of cases. We are facing a concerning scenario and it is fundamental that the municipalities use this resource in a strategic and agile way, reaching those who need protection the most.'

**Barueri Promotes National Day of Vaccination against Influenza**
The city of Barueri will participate in the National Day of Vaccination against Influenza (Dia D) on Saturday, May 10, 2025, a mobilization coordinated by the Ministry of Health to increase the vaccination coverage against the flu. The action will be carried out by the Barueri Health Department, with special attention in all Basic Health Units (UBSs) of the municipality, from 8am to 5pm. The goal is to protect the most vulnerable groups to flu complications and to reinforce the importance of immunization as a fundamental tool of public health, especially during the autumn, when there is a higher circulation of respiratory viruses. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the trivalent vaccine used in 2025 protects against the Influenza H1N1, H3N2, and Influenza B strains, updated annually based on the viruses that most circulated globally. 'Gripe is not just a simple cold,' said the Health Department. The initiative aims to raise awareness about the importance of vaccination, combating misinformation and expanding collective protection. The flu can be especially dangerous for the elderly, pregnant women, people with chronic diseases, and immunocompromised individuals, which is why there is a definition of priority groups. The following groups are eligible to receive the vaccine: healthcare and education professionals, new mothers, indigenous people, people living on the streets, truck drivers, public transportation workers, and port workers, people with chronic non-communicable diseases or special clinical conditions, people with permanent disabilities, security and rescue professionals, and the prison population. To receive the dose, it is necessary to present a photo ID, vaccination card (if available), and some proof of affiliation with the priority group, such as a medical report, ID badge, or institution declaration.

**Hong Kong Suspends Importation of Poultry Meat and Products from North Dakota Due to H5N1 Avian Influenza Outbreak**
The Hong Kong Department of Food and Environmental Hygiene announced that the H5N1 avian influenza has broken out in a region of North Dakota, USA, and has instructed the industry to suspend the importation of poultry meat and poultry products (including eggs) from that region to ensure public health. According to the government's statistics, Hong Kong imported approximately 12,290 tons of frozen and chilled poultry meat and about 1.19 million eggs from the US in the first three months of this year. A spokesperson for the center said, 'We have contacted the US authorities and will continue to closely monitor the messages from the World Organisation for Animal Health and other relevant authorities regarding the outbreak of avian influenza, and take appropriate action based on the local epidemic situation.'

**The true enemies of the people**
Bill Palmer warns that the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, also known as bird flu, is a major threat to global health. Despite the Trump administration's cut in funding to combat the virus, Palmer emphasizes that the real problem lies in the spread of misinformation and vaccine denialism. According to Palmer, the mortality rate of human bird flu infection is over 50%, and if it spreads worldwide, it could lead to billions of deaths. The virus is also evolving and jumping from mammal to mammal, with virologist Dr. Angela Rasmussen stating that she is 'scared' about the situation. Meanwhile, vaccine denialism and mistrust of science are becoming a pandemic on the internet, with Palmer labeling those who refuse to get vaccinated as the 'true enemies of the people'.

**Sete Lagoas Declares Public Health Emergency Due to SRAG Outbreak**
The city of Sete Lagoas has declared a state of public health emergency due to the significant increase in cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SRAG). The measure is motivated by the high number of cases, which has overwhelmed the local healthcare system, particularly in pediatric wards and intensive care units. The decree considers the circulation of various respiratory viruses, seasonal climate conditions, and the simultaneous circulation of viruses such as the rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A, which have contributed to the decision. The current situation has led to a high demand for ventilatory support and ICU beds, exceeding the operational capacity of the healthcare system, increasing the risk of unassisted deaths. The municipal decree also takes into account the State of Emergency in Health already declared by the Government of Minas Gerais. The measures authorized by the decree include the waiver of bidding for the acquisition of necessary goods and services, the temporary hiring of healthcare professionals, and the possibility of increasing the working hours of existing contracts. The Municipal Health Secretary will be responsible for establishing general guidelines and may issue complementary norms for the execution of the measures. The decree also establishes that hospitals that operate under the Unified Health System (SUS) must prioritize the availability of clinical beds with ventilatory support and ICU beds for SRAG cases. The General Superintendence of Health Promotion and Surveillance and the General Superintendence of Emergency and High Complexity Network will act in a coordinated manner to implement the actions, focusing on the care of children, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups. The processing of processes related to the emergency will have an urgent regime in all municipal administration organs. The Municipal Health Secretary will also maintain continuous contact with the SRAG Emergency Operations Center (COE-Minas-SRAG) of the state government for monitoring and managing the situation. The decree has a validity period of 180 days, which may be extended if the emergency situation persists.

**Everything you need to know about bird flu**
The highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) virus has been spreading globally, infecting over 960 people since 2003, killing roughly half of them. In 2024, the virus appeared in dairy cows in the Texas Panhandle, and since then, it has been detected in at least 17 states. The virus has also affected diverse mammals, including cats, goats, mink, tigers, seals, and dolphins. While the virus has not acquired the ability to pass easily from person to person, it has infected dozens of people in the United States, mainly farm workers, and killed its first person stateside in January 2025. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization rate the public health risk as low, but the situation could change. Scientists are concerned about the virus's ability to mutate and spread, and the potential for human-to-human transmission. To combat the spread of the virus, the US Department of Agriculture has allocated up to $1 billion in additional funds to combat highly pathogenic avian flu, including support for biosecurity, financial relief for farmers, and vaccine research. Companies, such as Zoetis, are working on H5N1 vaccines for cows, but it's too soon to know if and how such vaccines would be deployed. Even with vaccines, 'we may not be able to put out this fire,' says Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. 'It appears, to many of us, that these viruses are going to be endemic, or we say 'enzootic,' for a long time.'

**Most states unprepared for next public health emergency, report finds**
A report from the Trust for America's Health finds that more than half of states are unprepared for the next public health emergency. Only 21 states, including Washington D.C., received a 'high tier' ranking for preparedness, while 16 states were ranked as 'middle tier' and 13 states as 'low tier.' The report highlights ongoing challenges in areas such as incident management, public health funding, and emergency management accreditations. The authors also warn of the emerging threat from avian influenza A (H5N1), also known as bird flu, and caution that waiting for the threat to escalate before acting can be costly in terms of human lives, economic stability, and social trust. According to the report, 'waiting for the threat to escalate before acting is costly in terms of human lives, economic stability, and social trust.'

**Scientists Warn of Potential Avian Influenza Pandemic, Call for Immediate Action**
A group of scientists have published a letter in the journal Science warning of the potential for an avian influenza pandemic. They are calling for immediate action to prepare for a possible outbreak of H5N1, which has already infected humans in the US and caused severe illness. 'Preparing now can save lives and reduce social and economic impacts if H5N1 or another virus leads to a pandemic,' the letter states. The scientists, led by Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, note that the virus has already crossed species and adapted to mammalian hosts, including cattle, causing widespread exposure and sporadic infections in humans. They emphasize the need for urgent action to address gaps in preparedness, including the development of an effective vaccine that can be produced in large quantities quickly. They also stress the importance of equitable access to the vaccine, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, they recommend implementing a communication strategy based on scientific data to address public concerns and rebuild trust in public health. Finally, they suggest testing pandemic response plans in a transparent and collaborative manner, transcending political divisions. Currently, human infections have been contained, with 88 reported cases worldwide since January 2024, and 5 reported cases in 2025. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the risk of zoonotic transmission, including H5N1, is low for the general population, but moderate for individuals exposed professionally, depending on risk mitigation measures in place.

**Measures Already In Place For Another Plandemic – Here’s The Evidence**
The Department of Health and Human Services has awarded $590 million to Moderna to develop multiple modified mRNA injections for several 'avian influenza viruses', including H5N1 and H7N9. The funding is based on a declaration of a potential public health emergency with a potential impact to national security that involves biological agents, specifically naming pandemic influenza A viruses and influenza A viruses with pandemic potential. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has defined pandemic influenza A viruses as 'animal viruses and/or human influenza A viruses circulating in wild birds, domestic animals and/or humans that cause or have significant potential to cause sporadic or ongoing human infections'. This broad definition would encompass any and all 'influenza A viruses', including H5N1, H5N2, H7N9, H10N3, H5N8, and H7N4. The declaration triggers the PREP Act, which allows for the development of 'demonstration products' for a military operation. The FDA has issued alerts and investigations regarding H5N1, and has established four Animal and Veterinary Innovation Centers (AVIC) to explore 'the use of gene editing in chickens to reduce susceptibility or provide resistance to HPAI and other avian viruses'. The government has chosen to cull millions of commercial chicken flocks based on results of a PCR test, and has listed numerous 'tests' for H5N1 as 'approved' at the FDA website. The FDA has also updated their 'medical countermeasures initiative' (MCMi), which occurred on June 27, 2024, a mere month before the emergency declaration update in July 2024.

**We're Infectious Disease Experts. Here's How Soon Bird Flu Could Cause A Pandemic.**
The H5N1 avian influenza outbreak is spreading rapidly in the US, with over 23 million birds infected in January. At least 69 people have been infected, and one person has died since 2024. Experts are concerned that the virus could quickly evolve into a human pandemic. While there have been no reports of sustained human-to-human transmission, the virus is adapting to new hosts, including cows and cats. Suresh Kuchipudi, a veterinarian, said, 'This virus is now demonstrating some of those hallmarks of a potential public health threat.' Thomas Russo, chief of the infectious disease division at the University at Buffalo, said, 'There is not grounds for panic yet,' but warned that sustained human-to-human transmission could happen anytime. Experts recommend taking precautions, such as wearing personal protective equipment, washing hands, and avoiding contact with infected animals. 'I would not come in contact with a dead bird,' said Jodie Guest, a senior vice chair of the epidemiology department at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health. 'When you handle or touch an animal, washing hands can be a very simple, very effective means of reducing the risk of transmission,' said Kuchipudi.

**The cost of a virus: the politics of the U.S. bird flu outbreak and its public health implications**
The avian influenza crisis has led to a record high in California's egg prices, with a dozen loose eggs costing $4.95 in January, up from $2.04 in August 2023. The crisis has also led to a California Department of Public Health's response to a State of Emergency, precautioning the spread through contact with sick birds and contaminated surfaces. The virus has infected a small but growing population of human patients, and there are fears of human-to-human transmission. According to Dr. [no specific doctor is quoted], the virus has formed mutations in infected birds which allow transmission across the species barrier. The virus has currently infected 972 herds of cattle, and 64 human cases have been recorded since March 24, 2024. Despite the risks, most epidemiologists and flu experts agree it's not yet time to worry, with precautions in place to prevent the spread of the virus. However, the flawed federal response to the outbreak has exposed an underlying issue in the USA's public health system, with a lack of accessibility of information on this health crisis. The executive branch has withheld information about the virus, and federal officials have propagated misinformation, including the newly appointed Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. advising against 'dangerous' bird flu vaccines on social media. The administration's policies have also reduced healthcare accessibility, and the goal to 'defeat inflation' is undermined by the rising grocery prices caused by the avian flu.

**UK detects first human case of H5N1 bird flu in 3 years**
The United Kingdom has confirmed its first human case of bird flu in three years, involving a poultry worker from the West Midlands who contracted the A(H5N1) virus. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) stated that the risk to the wider public continues to be very low, as the transmission is rare. The patient is in good health and receiving treatment in a High Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID) unit. The UKHSA has launched enhanced surveillance and offered antiviral treatments to those at the highest risk of exposure. UK Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss emphasized the importance of preventive measures, such as scrupulous biosecurity, to protect the health and welfare of birds from avian influenza and other diseases. Public Health Minister Andrew Gwynne added that the UK has added the H5 vaccine to its stockpile as part of preparedness plans. The UK Chief Veterinary Officer has declared a new Avian Influenza Prevention Zone across England, effective from January 24, 2025.

**US Department of Health and Human Services Grants $590 Million to Accelerate H5N1 mRNA Vaccine Development**
The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has granted $590 million to Moderna to accelerate the development of an mRNA-based vaccine for H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. According to Stephanie Kurdach, infectious disease analyst at GlobalData, 'Although H5N1 infections remain a low risk to the general public, they can cause severe disease and should be taken seriously.' The FDA has approved multiple vaccines in the past that target H5N1, but these are not effective against strains found in the 2024 outbreak. As of January 2025, all 50 states have outbreaks in poultry, and the CDC has reported rising cases in cattle and dairy cows. The CDC has reported a total of 67 confirmed reported human cases of H5N1, but the actual number may be higher due to lack of testing and public awareness. Xavier Becerra, secretary of the HHS, said, 'Avian flu variants have proven to be particularly unpredictable and dangerous to humans in the past. That is why this response has been a top priority for the Biden-Harris Administration and HHS.'
