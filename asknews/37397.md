**Four European Countries Call for Global Support for Two-State Solution in Israeli-Palestinian Conflict**
Four European countries - Spain, Ireland, Norway, and Slovenia - have issued a joint statement reaffirming their commitment to a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The statement, made through their foreign ministries, reads: 'We reiterate our commitment to the principle of a two-state solution, where a Palestinian state, within internationally recognized borders, including Gaza and the West Bank, with East Jerusalem as its capital, can coexist with the State of Israel, and meet the legitimate national aspirations and security needs of both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.' The countries also praised the international community's commitment to the two-state solution, saying that it has 'irreversible effects on the international dynamics surrounding the Gaza conflict.' The statement also called on the international community to recognize the State of Palestine and to support a mutual recognition agreement between Israel and Palestine. The statement was made in the context of a UN conference scheduled to take place in June 2025, which the countries believe will provide a 'unique opportunity' for the two-state solution to be implemented. 'The international community has agreed to establish a Global Partnership for Implementing the Two-State Solution in September 2024,' the statement reads. 'We believe that the High-Level Conference to be held under the auspices of the United Nations and co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia on June 17, 2025, will not only be a unique opportunity for the highest level of international legitimacy, but also a suitable framework for the ultimate implementation of the two-state solution.' The statement also called on countries that have not yet recognized Palestine to do so, and to support Palestine's bid for full membership in the UN.

**Polls by June 2026 under any circumstances: chief adviser**
Bangladesh's Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus reaffirmed that a general election will be held by June 2026 under any circumstances. Yunus made the statement during a meeting with former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso in Tokyo, where he also discussed the country's reform agenda and the Rohingya refugee crisis. Yunus noted significant achievements in the past 10 months, including restoring discipline in the banking sector and rebuilding the foreign currency reserve. He thanked Japan for its support, saying, 'Japan has given every kind of assistance that we needed in the past ten months. I want to thank Japan a lot for its support.' Yunus also invited Aso to visit Bangladesh to witness the ongoing changes firsthand. The two leaders discussed the possibility of signing the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) and advancing the repatriation process for the Rohingya refugees.

**China and Russia Plan to Build Nuclear Reactor on the Moon by 2035**
China and Russia have announced a joint plan to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2035, which will serve as the energy hub for the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). The ILRS is a robotic outpost, and later a human settlement, near the lunar south pole. The project aims to rival the US-led Artemis program, which involves 55 countries and plans to build a lunar orbital station (the Gateway) and return astronauts to the lunar surface, potentially by December 2025. The Sino-Russian alliance is gaining momentum, with 17 countries already partnering with the ILRS, and plans to expand to 50 countries, 500 scientific institutions, and 5,000 researchers through the Chinese 'Project 555'. The choice of the lunar south pole is not random, as it has prolonged solar exposure and the possible presence of water ice in the permanent shadows of craters. According to Roscosmos, the station will be used for basic scientific research and to test technologies capable of operating without human presence for long periods. Yury Borisov, Roscosmos director general, confirmed that 'the technological steps are almost ready', suggesting that the infrastructure could soon enter the operational phase. The ILRS project foresees a first robotic phase with the Chinese mission Chang'e-8 in 2028, which will test automated construction with 3D-printed lunar soil. Between 2030 and 2035, five heavy-lift launches will transport the main modules to the Moon. The long-term goal, by 2050, is to establish an extensive network of bases powered by solar, radioisotopic, and nuclear sources, with rovers, lunar jumpers, and high-speed communications between Earth and the lunar far side.

**Ireland Paves the Way for Commercial Ban on Israeli Settlements**
The Irish government has approved a bill to ban the importation of products from Israeli settlements, which are considered illegal by the international community. According to a spokesperson for the Irish Foreign Ministry, 'the government has agreed to proceed with legislation that prohibits trade with the illegal settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, and the government considers this a commitment under international law.' The bill, which will be voted on by the Irish parliament, includes products such as fruits, vegetables, and wood, but excludes services like tourism and technology. Between 2020 and 2024, the trade between Ireland and the occupied Palestinian territory was less than one million euros. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said, 'I hope that when this small European country takes this decision and becomes the first Western country to enact legislation of this kind, it will encourage other European countries to follow.' A parliamentary committee will study the government's plan in June, and the MPs will vote on the final version in the fall. Ireland's decision is based on an advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice in July 2024. In May 2024, Ireland, Spain, and Norway recognized the Palestinian state, and Slovenia joined them a month later, prompting Israel to take retaliatory measures. Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that Paris is considering recognizing the Palestinian state in early June. The Irish government's decision comes a week after the European Union decided to review the partnership agreement signed with Israel in 1995, which serves as a framework for relations, particularly trade, between the two parties. Conor O'Neill, a representative of the 'Christian Aid Ireland' organization, said, 'This Irish law will be the first 'commercial initiative' within the European Union and is a welcome step.'

**European Leaders Call for Reinterpretation of Human Rights Treaty To Curb Migration**
A coalition of nine European Union countries, led by Italy and Denmark, is calling for a reinterpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights to curb migration. The group, which includes Austria, Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, argues that the treaty's current interpretation hinders efforts to control irregular migration and expel foreign nationals with criminal records. The leaders, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, stated, 'The world has changed radically since many of our ideas were conceived.' They claim that the ECHR's tight constraints prevent necessary actions against individuals who 'have chosen not to integrate' and instead 'commit crimes.' The initiative comes despite a 25 percent drop in irregular arrivals at EU borders in the first months of 2025. The leaders acknowledged the sensitive nature of their proposal, writing, 'Although our aim is to safeguard our democracies, we will likely be accused of the opposite.' The move is expected to spark heated discussion and will be a central topic at the European summit on June 26-27.

The signing ceremony was held on the sidelines of the Bangladesh Investment Summit 2025 at the InterContinental Hotel Dhaka on April 8.
