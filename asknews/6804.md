**2 Top Tech Stocks That Can Double by 2030**
Nvidia, the leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs), is poised to benefit from the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. According to CEO Jensen Huang, 'Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure -- just like electricity and the internet -- and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation.' The company's revenue was reported at $44 billion, up 69% year over year and 12% over the previous quarter, despite missing out on $2.5 billion in revenue due to new export requirements to China. AI spending is expected to boost the global economy by $20 trillion by 2030, according to IDC, making Nvidia a prime candidate for growth. The company continues to benefit from growing demand from cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services and Alphabet's Google Cloud, and is providing AI computing systems for various markets, including autonomous driving and robotics. With a growing revenue forecast and a significant boost in performance for AI workloads from its Blackwell computing system, Nvidia's shares could potentially double in value by 2030.
