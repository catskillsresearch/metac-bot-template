**Meat Prices Soar Ahead of Eid al-Adha in Egypt**
Meat prices have skyrocketed in Egyptian markets ahead of Eid al-Adha, with a kilogram of lamb costing between 400-450 EGP, and a kilogram of beef costing between 270-350 EGP. According to Heitham Abdelbaset, the head of the Butchers' Section at the Cairo Commercial Chamber, the price hike is not in the butcher's interest, as they want to increase purchasing power and sales rates, which are currently weak. Abdelbaset expects prices to drop in the coming days due to low demand from butcher shops, saying 'Butcher shops are empty and all the demand is on the malls and outlets.' Egypt is not a major meat producer, with only 40% of its local production, which amounts to 18 million heads of sheep, goats, and cattle. The country imports around 60% of its meat, mainly live cattle from Brazil, Spain, Sudan, or Djibouti. The Holding Company has intervened to balance the market by importing meat from Sudan and Djibouti and selling it in retail stores at 285 EGP per kilogram. Economist Dr. Adel Amer called on the government to sell meat at discounted prices through official outlets before Eid al-Adha, saying this would help balance the market. Amer emphasized the need to work on addressing the greed of traders across the country, pointing out that prices have skyrocketed during this period, and that the authorities should use economic tools to address the crisis and unjustified price increases.

**DA mulls lower tariff for pork imports**
The Department of Agriculture (DA) is proposing to expand the minimum access volume (MAV) on pork imports by 150,000 metric tons (MT) to boost domestic supply and lower retail prices. Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said, 'The proposal aims to lower pork prices.' The increase in pork MAV will be for two years. The current tariff rate for pork imports under MAV is 15%, while those outside the mechanism are slapped with a 25% tariff. Jesus Cham, president emeritus of the Meat Importers and Traders Association (MITA), supports the proposal and suggests increasing the volume to at least 200,000 MT. The country is expected to import a record-high of 630,000 MT of pork this year, based on USDA figures. The price of fresh pork liempo in Metro Manila markets is now ranging from P390 to P500 per kilo with an average price of P440 per kilo.

**Meat Prices in Port Said Remain Stable Amid Balanced Demand and Supply**
The meat markets in Port Said, Egypt, witnessed a noticeable stability in the prices of red meat and its products, including burgers, sausages, and bacon, on Sunday, June 1, 2025.

The prices of fresh local meat ranged from 270 to 300 Egyptian pounds per kilogram, depending on the type of cut and quality of the animal.

'The current prices are more stable compared to the previous period,' said one butcher. 'We expect a gradual increase in demand with the arrival of summer and the increase in the number of tourists and visitors to the coastal city.'

**Garlic is Currently at its Lowest Price of the Year: A Simple and Delicious Home Cooking Method**
Garlic is currently at its lowest price of the year, with a wholesale price of NT$77.5 per kilogram and a retail price of NT$155 per kilogram. According to the 'Seasonal Fruits and Vegetables' website, the price has been trending upwards in recent months. NOWnews reporter visited the northern traditional market on May 1st and found that the price of garlic in North Port was NT$80 per half kilogram. The vendor said that the price of domestic garlic is now very low and should be taken advantage of. Garlic is rich in sulfur-containing compounds and has been proven to have anti-tumor effects, earning it the nickname 'Anti-Cancer King.' However, many people dislike the pungent flavor of garlic. NOWnews has previously introduced various home cooking methods for garlic, including 'black garlic' and 'sugar and vinegar garlic.' Today, we will introduce the method of 'oil-sealed garlic,' which is simple and easy to make. The ingredients are just garlic and oil, and you can add dried chili peppers and thyme for extra flavor. The method can be done using a deep fryer, microwave oven, or even a wok. The most difficult part of making oil-sealed garlic is peeling the garlic and pouring the oil. According to NOWnews, the method of making oil-sealed garlic is as follows: Peel the garlic and place it in a wok or deep fryer. Pour enough oil to cover the garlic and heat it over low heat, stirring occasionally. Once the garlic is golden brown, turn off the heat and let it cool. Then, transfer the garlic to a glass jar and add the remaining oil. The oil-sealed garlic can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 months.

**Meat products become cheaper in federal retail before May holidays**
In the run-up to the May holidays, the prices of socially significant products in federal retail have not increased, while meat products have become cheaper, according to the Association of Companies of Retail Trade (AKORT). 'Before the May holidays, retail chains - members of AKORT maintained accessible prices for the most in-demand positions of socially significant products... During the week from April 21 to 27, retail chains reduced the price of pork and chicken broiler carcasses', - reported in the association. As a result, pork 'first price' became cheaper in retail by 0.33% against the backdrop of a 1.55% decrease in procurement prices. Its minimum price in retail is 266 rubles per kilogram. A chicken broiler carcass decreased in price by 1.88% over the week, despite a significant increase in procurement - almost 3.5%. Overall, in April, retail prices decreased more than procurement prices: 3% against 0.15%. In retail chains, a kilogram of chicken can be bought for 161 rubles, added there. It is noted that in the pre-holiday week, beef 'first price' increased in procurement, which led to an increase in price in retail by 1.55%. However, over the month, meat became cheaper by 0.58%. The current minimum retail price is 313 rubles. They also reported about shashlik: a dish made from pork costs from 199 rubles per kilogram, from chicken legs - from 230 rubles, and from turkey - from 655 rubles. However, according to AKORT data, the most popular vegetables among shashlik lovers - onions and potatoes - increased in price both in procurement and in retail over the week. So, potatoes added 2.61% in value over the week - a kilogram in a network retail will cost 71 rubles. The most affordable positions of onion increased in price by 11.25%, the minimum price of onion in retail chains is 57 rubles. Retail invests more than 8 rubles per kilogram of onion to balance the growth of procurement prices, clarified in the association. They reminded that all categories of socially significant goods federal networks continue to maintain minimum markup on a number of product positions. In turn, the chairman of the AKORT presidium Stanislav Bogdanov commented that the approach of trade in controlling the growth of prices 'is not formal, but maximally responsible': the share of positions with reduced markup in the turnover of corresponding categories is dozens of percent. 'In individual large networks, almost every second product in such categories is sold with limited markup. This happens not in individual, specially selected stores, but in each trading point throughout the country', - he noted.

**Why Aussie consumers could soon be paying DOUBLE for beef**
Australian consumers may soon be paying more than $50 a kilogram for steak due to Donald Trump's tariffs on agriculture exports, according to farmers. The Australian Food Sovereignty Alliance, representing 350 small-scale farmers, fears rump steak will cost Australian consumers $56 at the supermarket. Spokeswoman Tammi Jonas said, 'In a global supply crunch like this, we could see rump steak climb past $50 per kilogram. That's not a family dinner - that's a premium luxury.' However, Angus Gidley-Baird, a senior analyst in animal protein with RaboResearch, said more expensive steak at the supermarket is unlikely, given the strong supply of Australian beef. Meat and Livestock Australia data showed the US was Australia's biggest market for beef exports in 2024, with 96% of the beef sent being the leaner, grass-fed variety.

**ATB Does Not Lead: Where to Buy Chicken Meat at the Lowest Price**
Prices for products in Ukraine are alarming. After the New Year, prices continued to rise, and many people are now looking for stores that offer certain categories of products at lower prices. Even the prices of popular products can vary significantly depending on the retail chain. For example, the price of chicken meat differs in the three largest supermarkets in the country: ATB, Silpo, and Varus. Let's take a look at where it's more profitable to buy chicken meat.

**Contra el aumento de carne: recomendación viral de dos cortes baratos**
Marito Laurens, a butcher who gained fame on TikTok, has recommended two affordable cuts of meat in response to the recent increase in meat prices. The first option is the 'centro de entraña' (entrails center), which costs around $6,000 to $6,800 and is suitable for churrasco, milanesa, and salpicón. The second option is the 'corazón de vaca' (cow's heart), which is cheaper but has a higher fat content and is rich in nutrients. Laurens suggests changing the way people cook and consume meat to make it more affordable. Meanwhile, the government's Cuenta DNI program has changed its promotion, offering a 35% discount on meat purchases only two Saturdays a month, with a maximum reimbursement of $6,000 per person per date. The consumption of meat has recovered in recent months, with sales in carnicerías and supermarkets increasing by 20% since mid-2024. However, prices are still historically low, with the average consumption per person per year being 48 kilograms, compared to 39 kilograms in the midst of the 2023 recession.

**Beef Prices to Increase by 5-10% as Consumption Declines**
In a scenario of a historic decline in beef consumption, prices of cuts will increase by 5-10% starting from this Monday. This increase is due to the reduction in cattle supply in the market, which has been reflected in three consecutive days of price increases that the market has validated. According to Miguel Schiariti, President of the Argentine Meat and Derivatives Industry Chamber (CICCRA), 'the price of cattle on the hoof has been consolidated. It is possible that starting from Monday, this increase will be passed on to the shelves, in a percentage that will range from 5 to 10%. We will see if the public validates this increase.' The meat industry considers that in 2025, the supply will decrease due to droughts. In the face of the upcoming months, it is likely that cattle for consumption will continue to be scarce, and the price of meat will be regulated by the market. In 2024, the consumption of chicken and pork increased, with 49.3 kg per capita of poultry products consumed, compared to 48.5 kg of beef products. This represents the lowest level of beef consumption in the last 28 years, according to CICCRA statistics. However, if we add the three main categories of meat (beef, poultry, and pork), Argentina is the second country with the highest consumption globally, with 115 kg per capita, following the US with 120 kg and Australia with 105 kg.
