**Tesla Not Interested in Local Electric Vehicle Production in India, Says Minister**
India's Minister for Heavy Industry, HD Kumaraswamy, announced that Tesla has not expressed any interest in producing electric cars in the country. The company plans to import cars to the country instead. This revelation comes as India is finalizing a new electric vehicle policy that aims to attract foreign investments by reducing import duties for manufacturers that invest in local production. The policy offers a reduced import duty rate of 15% for a limited number of electric vehicles, provided that companies invest at least $500 million in local production and start operations within three years. Kumaraswamy stated, 'Tesla, we actually don't expect (interest) from them... They are not interested in production in India.' The minister highlighted the company's current focus on importing vehicles to the Indian market, with Tesla reportedly planning to import electric cars from its factory in Berlin to India. This is despite Tesla's CEO Elon Musk commenting that the tariffs on imported vehicles in India are too high. The new policy also allows for limited investments in research, machinery, and fast charging. The lack of fast charging stations has hindered more customers on India's developing markets from using electric vehicles. India's push for local electric vehicle production is part of its broader strategy to increase the share of electric vehicles on its car market from the current 2.5% to 30% by 2030. The government believes that local production will not only create jobs but also reduce import dependence, promote technological advancements, and contribute to environmental sustainability. While Tesla remains uncertain, other global automakers such as Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Hyundai, and Kia have shown enthusiasm for India's electric vehicle policy, signaling a positive response to the government's incentives. Indian automakers like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have already made significant investments in electric vehicle production, with Tata Motors focusing on locally produced electric vehicle batteries to maintain its competitive edge in the face of intensifying competition.

**Tesla not keen on local production, minister says, as India finalises EV policy**
India's federal minister, HD Kumaraswamy, stated that Tesla is not interested in producing cars in the country, despite the government finalizing its electric vehicle policy. The policy aims to attract foreign automakers to invest in domestic EV production lines, with significant cuts in import taxes for those who commit to investing $500 million. However, Tesla's immediate plan is to import cars into India, as CEO Elon Musk has previously expressed concerns about the country's tariffs on imported vehicles. Other companies, such as Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Hyundai, and Kia, have shown interest in India's EV manufacturing policy. Domestic players like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have invested in local EV manufacturing and lobbied against duty cuts. The government aims to increase EV sales to 30% of total car sales by 2030, currently at 2.5%.

**Tesla not keen on local production in India, minister says**
Tesla does not want to produce cars in India, according to a federal minister. Despite this, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen are eyeing India's new electric vehicle policy, which significantly cuts import taxes for foreign automakers that pledge to invest in building EVs domestically. The policy, designed to lure Tesla to set up manufacturing in the country, requires companies to set up a manufacturing facility in India and commence operations within three years. Domestic players like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have invested millions of dollars in local EV manufacturing and lobbied against duty cuts. India's EV sales, dominated by Tata Motors, accounted for just 2.5% of total car sales in 2024, and the government wants to increase this to 30% by 2030.

**Xpeng and Chinese Electric Vehicle Manufacturers See Significant Growth, Tesla Lags Behind**
Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers Xpeng, Li Auto, and Nio have seen significant growth in sales, with Xpeng's sales increasing by 230% in May compared to the same period last year. In contrast, Tesla's sales have declined. According to analysts, the strained trade relations between the US and China may be the reason for Chinese consumers avoiding US-made vehicles. 'The Chinese market for electric vehicles is healthy, but Tesla is likely to see no sales growth in 2025,' said analysts. In the first five months of this year, the three manufacturers have sold 419,462 vehicles, a 69% increase from the same period last year. BYD, China's largest electric vehicle manufacturer, has sold 376,930 vehicles, a 14% increase from the same period last year, with a 40% increase in battery electric vehicle sales.

**Tesla Could Benefit Big as Humanoid Robot Market Set to Hit $5 Trillion by 2050**
Investment bank Morgan Stanley predicts that the humanoid robot market could reach $5 trillion in annual revenue by 2050, nearly double the combined sales of the world's 20 biggest car companies. Tesla, which is developing its humanoid robot called Optimus, could significantly benefit from this growth. According to Morgan Stanley, humanoid robots will initially be used in commercial and industrial settings, especially for repetitive tasks, with 13 million robots expected to be in use by 2035 and as many as 1 billion by 2050. Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has said that Optimus could become more valuable than Tesla's car business. Cathie Wood's investment firm ARK Invest is also positive about Tesla, predicting that its stock could reach $2,600 per share by 2029, driven mostly by Tesla's robotaxi business. Tesla's car production is expected to grow by 45% each year, going from 1.8 million vehicles today to as many as 14.4 million by 2029.

**Vet drives Sherman tank over Model 3 as BYD beats Tesla sales in Europe for the first time**
A 98-year-old WWII vet drove a Sherman tank over a Tesla Model 3, demonstrating the resilience of the electric vehicle. This stunt serves as a metaphor for Tesla's declining sales in Europe, where BYD has taken the lead. In the first quarter, Tesla's sales plummeted 46% in Germany, 62% in the UK, 80% in Sweden, 59% in France, and 36% in Spain. Meanwhile, BYD's sales surged 750% in Germany and 300% in the UK year-over-year. BYD has now beaten Tesla in EV sales in two consecutive quarters and may become the world's largest electric car maker in 2025. As one analyst noted, 'BYD has now managed to beat Tesla in EV sales in two consecutive quarters already, and it might very well log its first full year as the world's largest electric car maker in 2025.'

**BYD aims to sell half its cars outside China by 2030, sources say**
BYD, China's No. 1 automaker, aims to sell half of its vehicles outside the Chinese market by 2030, according to sources. The company's growth would be fueled by expansion in Europe and Latin America, despite being locked out of the U.S. market by trade barriers. BYD executives have outlined the 2030 target to investors, emphasizing its Europe expansion as pivotal to hitting the target. The goal is a heavy lift, even for a company with BYD's dizzying growth rate. BYD now believes it has the right products to repeat its Chinese success in overseas markets, said a third source. Hitting the ambitious target would vault BYD into the upper echelon of global carmakers, joining multinational juggernauts Toyota and Volkswagen. BYD's global sales have surged to a level just behind Ford and General Motors, from fewer than 430,000 cars in 2020. BYD's aspirations will likely fray nerves among executives at those companies as well as electric-vehicle rival Tesla, which sold 1.79 million fully-electric cars in 2024. 'We have to compete and win against BYD,' said Ford CEO Jim Farley. 'It will be pretty challenging to reach that goal without access to the U.S. market,' said Tu Le, founder of consultancy Sino Auto Insights. BYD's global sales growth will slow to hit 5 million units this year, with about 80% of that coming in China. An eventual 50/50 split would likely translate into total annual sales of 10 million cars - rivaling Toyota, the world's largest automaker last year with 10.7 million vehicles in 2024.

**Why you might not be forced into an electric car by 2030: Diesel dual-cab utes like the Ford Ranger, Toyota HiLux and Isuzu D-Max are like Coco Pops and Australia can't get enough of them | Opinion - Car News**
The Australian electric car market is facing a reality check, with sales figures showing that vehicles with internal combustion engines still make up more than 70% of new-car sales in 2025. The success of the electric car market was largely driven by Tesla, but the company is now in steep sales decline. The author argues that the car industry needs to focus on consumer demand, rather than relying on government regulations to drive the adoption of electric vehicles. The author suggests that plug-in hybrids could be a compromise solution, with sales already up by over 200% in the first two months of 2025. Brands like Toyota and Ford are already planning to offer PHEVs in their showrooms by the end of 2025. The author concludes that the decision of consumers will ultimately shape the future of the car industry, rather than regulatory oversight.

**Tesla Model Y: Lower Starting Price and Halved Sales in Norway**
Tesla has been in the media storm recently, both in Norway and other countries. According to Bloomberg, Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller has openly encouraged Polestar salespeople to contact Tesla customers. However, the exact sales figures for new Teslas are not yet known, as order intake is a closely guarded secret for most car manufacturers. In January, Tesla was parked while Volkswagen and Toyota topped the registration statistics. So far this year, there have been 46% fewer new Teslas registered in Norway than at the same time last year, according to figures from OFV. Tesla has only registered 1,206 new cars in the period from January 1 to February 19, compared to 2,231 in the same period last year. Tesla has now launched several versions of the new Model Y with a lower and more affordable starting price. The Model Y Long Range and Model Y Long Range four-wheel drive are now available, in addition to the previously launched Launch edition at over 600,000 kroner. The new Model Y was Norway's best-selling model in 2024, but will it be successful in 2025? Tesla's factories are highly efficient and have enormous capacity to produce cars. The Gigafactory in Berlin, which supplies Norway with cars, is always ready to respond quickly to market orders. The new delivery facility in Drammen Harbour is full of old stock cars, and the harbour is still filled with outgoing Tesla Model Y cars. However, Tesla's website does not indicate any panic. There is a rent campaign on new stock cars and a cash discount on demo cars, but it does not scream 'buy and run'. The tollbukaia shows that there are stored Teslas from Tesla per February 21. It will be exciting to follow the market further. Volkswagen, Tesla, and Toyota all have large volume ambitions, and the one who will be the largest may also have to win the prize in 2025. Some Tesla board members have sold their shares in recent times. One of the reasons for the sale is that they have to pay back large sums to Tesla after a dispute in the state of Delaware, where they were accused of receiving overpayment from Tesla. Board chairman Robyn Denholm has reportedly sold most of her shares, and Elon Musk's brother and also board member, Kimbal Musk, has also sold his shares.

**Tesla Model Y retains top spot as world's best-selling car in 2024**
The Tesla Model Y has retained its position as the world's best-selling car in 2024, with 1.09 million units sold. According to 'Focus2move', the Toyota Corolla came in second with 1.08 million sales, a 3.1% decrease from the previous year. The Toyota RAV4 took third place with 1.02 million sales, a 10.7% increase. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz were left behind, with the Volkswagen Tiguan taking 10th place with 543,351 sales. Tesla's overall sales decreased by 19,355 units in 2024, with CEO Elon Musk having predicted a slight increase. Meanwhile, Volkswagen has publicly stated that it will only produce electric cars from 2033, but internal reports suggest that the phase-out of combustion engines is uncertain.

**Volkswagen Falls to Second Place in Global Sales**
2024 was a challenging year for the auto industry, including Volkswagen, the German market leader. Tesla, the electric car manufacturer, missed Wall Street's expectations in the last quarter, with a 2% increase in sales to $25.7 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations of $27.3 billion. Meanwhile, Toyota solidified its position as the world's largest automaker, selling 10.8 million vehicles in 2024, despite a 3.7% decline in sales. Toyota's sales decreased in Japan due to certification issues with its Daihatsu subsidiary and in China, where sales shrunk by nearly 7%. Volkswagen came in second in terms of sales, with a 2.3% decline in January and a total of nearly 9 million vehicles sold in 2024.
