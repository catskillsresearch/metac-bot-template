**Santander Reaches Highest Market Capitalization in History**
Banco Santander has reached its highest market capitalization in history, €102.5 billion, after a 1.68% increase in trading on Monday. The bank has surpassed Iberdrola as the second-largest company in the Ibex 35, with a market value of €99.764 billion, and is closing in on Inditex, the largest company in the Ibex 35 with a market value of over €144.8 billion. According to Ana Botín, the bank's president, the bank's record-breaking €3.402 billion profit in the first quarter of the year is due to 'record-breaking commission income and lower costs.' The bank has also seen a 19% increase in attributed profit, with a total of 175 million customers, a 9 million increase from the previous quarter. The bank's growth was influenced by the full imputation of the bank tax on income obtained in Spain in the first quarter of 2024, which was €335 million, compared to €87 million in the first quarter of 2025.

**Zara's 50th Anniversary: A Sign of Maturity and Success?**
Despite the challenges in the textile industry, Zara, which recently celebrated its 50th anniversary, is thriving. The company continues to be the driving force behind its parent company, Inditex, which has a market value of 146 billion euros, a 15-fold increase from its initial capitalization in 2001. Although the stock price has fallen 12.5% over the past three months, analysts are optimistic about the company's prospects, citing its robust business model, high margins, strong brands, positive net cash flow, and continuous innovation. As the company becomes more reliant on its European operations due to the uncertain geopolitical environment, analysts expect a prompt recovery and have even revised their price targets upwards in mid-April. As one analyst noted, '50 years is not necessarily a critical age, but rather a sign of maturity and success.'

**Zara boss calls for crackdown on tax loophole used by Shein and Temu - Business Live**
The CEO of Inditex, Oscar Garcia Maceiras, has called for a crackdown on the 'de minimis' tax loophole used by Chinese e-commerce giants Shein and Temu to import small goods into Europe duty-free. Maceiras said, 'What we have been asking for is a level playing field... in order to have the same set of rules for any single competitors.' This comes after US President Trump closed the loophole for goods shipped directly from China and Hong Kong, and the UK is reviewing its policy. Other retail bosses, including George Weston of Associated British Foods and Simon Roberts of Sainsbury's, have also urged the UK government to close the loophole to prevent lower quality goods being rerouted from the US to Europe. Currys CEO Alex Baldock warned that there are already indications of stock being diverted into European markets, with Chinese vendors on Amazon marketplace being a major concern.

**H&M and Inditex Return to Venezuela with Cautious Approach**
H&M and Inditex, the parent company of Zara, are returning to Venezuela after a four-year absence. The companies will operate under a franchise model, managed by the local group Futura, which allows Inditex to maintain a presence in the country while minimizing operational risks. The return is not only commercially significant but also symbolic, as the companies were accused of 'usury' in 2013 and forced to close their stores. With the Venezuelan economy showing signs of stabilization and inflation decreasing, Inditex, led by Marta Ortega, is taking a cautious approach to rebuilding its relationship with Venezuelan consumers. H&M is also entering the market, opening a store in the Sambil shopping complex before the end of the year, marking its first foray into Venezuela through its franchise partner Hola Moda. This move is part of a broader strategy to expand in the region, with Venezuela, Brazil, and El Salvador set to be key markets in 2025.

The Ibex 35 index rose by 0.53% to 13,625.9 points at midday on Monday, breaking the 13,600-point barrier for the first time since May 2008.

The US will reduce its tariff on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce its tariff on US imports from 125% to 10%. Experts at Banca March believe that this agreement will reduce the average US tariff on imports from 24% to levels below 18%. Meanwhile, in Spain, companies such as Almirall and Oryzon have reported financial results, with Almirall closing the first quarter with a net profit of 21.6 million euros, nearly triple that of the same period in 2024.

**Inditex loses third-place position in Ibex index due to disappointing sales**
Inditex, the leading textile firm, lost its third-place position in the Ibex index due to a significant drop in its market value, which was affected by disappointing sales in recent weeks. The company's market value decreased by 11.376 billion euros, more than the value of 18 companies in the Ibex. Inditex's decline to 12.85% in the Ibex index allowed Santander to take the lead, followed by Iberdrola. Despite this, Inditex remains the company with the highest market capitalization in the Bolsa de Madrid, with 140.249 million euros. Analysts justified the decline in Inditex's market value due to disappointing sales in the first quarter, despite the company's record profit and confidence in its future. As Elena Fernández-Trapiella, analyst at Bankinter, said, 'The fundamentals and business model remain very solid, but the value will reflect the deceleration in growth and the difficulty in expanding margins to historically high levels with a competitive perspective.' Patricia Cifuentes, of Bestinver Securities, also commented, 'Inditex has presented its 2024 results in line with expectations, but the commercial update was much weaker than expected. At a PER of 23.1 times estimated for 2025, Inditex is trading very above the average multiple of previous years.'

**Inditex Stock: A Surprising Collapse?**

Despite a 2.13% increase to 54.20 USD at the close of trading on March 8, the overall trend for the month remains negative with a 3.59% decline.

**Santander Surpasses Inditex as Most Valuable Company in Ibex Index**
Santander has surpassed Inditex as the most valuable company in the Ibex index, with a market capitalization of 95.627 million euros, up 27.979 million euros from the end of 2024. The bank's stock price rose 2.45% to a record high of 6.31 euros. Santander's president, Ana Botín, has maintained the bank's position as one of the favorites in the sector, with over 73% of analysts recommending a buy. Despite its strong performance in 2025, several analysis firms believe that Santander has room for growth. Kepler Cheuvreux has raised its target price to 7.40 euros, while Deutsche Bank has raised it to 7 euros. Deutsche Bank notes that while a weaker first half of the year could lead to a more cautious approach from investors, the outlook remains positive. The bank's good results in 2024, combined with its announcement of a 10,000 million euro share buyback, have contributed to its strong performance. Additionally, the strong rebound in bond yields has also benefited European banks. Furthermore, the reduced probability of a significant interest rate cut by the European Central Bank in the future, due to increased growth and inflation expectations, is also positive for the bank's earnings. Inditex, which has fallen to second place in the Ibex index, will release its results next week, which could be a catalyst for its stock price. The company's stock price has risen 1.05% in 2025, after advancing 25.89% last year. Bernstein has raised its target price for Inditex to 60 euros, above the consensus of 53.10 euros.

**EU Cracks Down on Low-Cost Chinese E-commerce Platforms, Inditex Continues to Thrive**
The European Union is cracking down on low-cost Chinese e-commerce platforms, such as Temu, Shein, and Aliexpress, which have gained 70 million European users and 16 million in Spain. The EU is concerned about the competition, which is suspected of being unfair to European companies, and also wants to ensure that these platforms do not introduce potentially hazardous products for consumers and the environment. 'More and more harmful products are entering the EU,' said the European Commission in a statement. In contrast, European textile giants like Inditex, which owns Zara, are investing in sustainability and circularity, and the EU will require them to manage their textile waste next year. Inditex has reported record profits and sales, with €27.442 million in revenue and €4.449 million in profits in the first nine months of its fiscal year. The company's stock price has also reached a new record high, closing at €52.66 on February 7, 2025.
