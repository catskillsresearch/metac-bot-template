**"I've Done Enough": Ridley Scott Gets Candid About His 'Alien' Franchise Future**
Ridley Scott, the director of the 1979 film Alien, says he's 'done enough' for the franchise. Scott was only involved in the first film and then returned in 2012 to make the prequel Prometheus, and in 2017 he made his last Alien film, Alien: Covenant. He gave Fede Álvarez the opportunity to direct the 2024 film Alien: Romulus, which was a critically acclaimed blockbuster. Scott believes that the sequels after his film were not as good, saying, 'I think mine was pretty damn good, and I think Jim's [Cameron's Aliens] was good, and I have to say the rest were not very good.' He also talked about deciding to return to the franchise with Prometheus and Covenant, saying, 'A number of years after, I said, 'I'm going to resurrect this,' [and wrote] Prometheus from scratch-a blank sheet of paper.' Despite this, Scott says he's done with the franchise, but will likely participate in some way in the future. The franchise's future is uncertain, but the success of Romulus may lead to a sequel.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**First trailer for upcoming horror sequel The Black Phone 2 reveals its masked killer is back from the dead, and about to go full Jason Voorhees**
The first trailer for The Black Phone 2 has been released, revealing that The Grabber, the masked killer from the original movie, is back from the dead and seeking revenge. The trailer shows Finn, the main character from the first movie, trying to move on with his life years after killing The Grabber, but his sister Gwen starts to have psychic dreams about the killer again. The Grabber says, 'Hello, Finney. Did you think our story was over?' via the black phone, suggesting that Finn may not have actually killed him after all. The sequel, directed by Scott Derrickson, picks up four years later and follows Finn and his sister as they try to uncover the truth behind The Grabber's return and their own family's history. The trailer hints at a more violent and graphic horror experience, with Derrickson stating that the sequel will be 'more visceral' and 'scarier' to match Finn and Gwen's age. 'You're dead,' says Finn to The Grabber, but The Grabber replies, 'You of all people should know that dead is just a word.'

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Alien: Earth - A New Chapter in the Alien Franchise**
The Alien franchise is set to take a new turn with the upcoming series Alien: Earth, which will explore a futuristic Earth dominated by corporations in the year 2120. The series, created by Noah Hawley and produced by Ridley Scott, follows the story of Wendy, the first human-machine hybrid, as she navigates intense moral dilemmas. In this vision of the future, humanity is no longer in control, but rather five powerful corporations - Prodigy, Weyland-Yutani, Lynch, Dynamic, and Threshold - are engaged in a ruthless struggle for power and technological supremacy. The series will explore the emergence of hybrids, a technological achievement signed by Prodigy Corporation, and will delve into the question of which species is the most monstrous: humans or aliens. The showrunner, Noah Hawley, has stated that the phrase 'Which is the worst species?' - a nod to Ripley's iconic line - has directly influenced the narrative. The series will present five different monsters, including a particularly ferocious Xenomorph, and will follow Wendy as she tries to understand her place in this complex world. The series will be a dramatic, grandiose, and epic story, with a strong focus on female characters and a complex moral landscape.

**This Sci-Fi Movie's Ending Broke My Heart - 16 Years Later, We Still Don't Have A Sequel**
District 9, a sci-fi movie directed by Neil Blomkamp, has a powerful and emotional ending that still resonates with audiences 16 years after its release. The movie tells a unique first contact story, where aliens are treated as second-class citizens in South Africa. The ending follows Wikus, a human who is gradually transforming into a prawn, as he finds a solution to his problems with the help of Christopher Johnson, an alien. However, Wikus is forced to wait three years for Christopher to return, and in the meantime, he is vilified in the media and forced to live in dire conditions. The movie's ending is devastating, but also thought-provoking, as it explores themes of prejudice, oppression, and the similarities between humans and aliens. Despite the lack of a sequel, District 9's ending remains powerful and has become a classic of the sci-fi genre. 'It's a testament to the film's craftsmanship that its ending still lingers in the memory long after the credits roll,' says the article. 'The movie's broader thematic concerns and its specific sci-fi worldbuilding both offer food for thought.' The article also notes that the ending sets up a sequel nicely, but the fact that a second movie has taken so long hasn't damaged the original's reputation. 'Even if District 10 never materializes, audiences will probably keep watching District 9 for many years,' the article concludes.

**Lease Expired: The Day Humanity Learned Earth Was Never Ours**
A mysterious event occurred when the skies darkened and vast vessels appeared, announcing that humanity's 10,000-year lease on Earth had expired. The aliens presented an ancient contract, which revealed that humanity had agreed to temporary stewardship of Earth in exchange for protection against a cosmic threat. Humanity was given 30 days to either restore the planet to its pristine state or find a new home. Dr. Anika Reddy, an astrophysicist, discovered evidence of the ancient pact and became Earth's spokesperson. She communicated with the custodians, who offered a trial period for a renewed lease contingent upon global changes. Humanity transformed, launching massive projects to clean the planet, and eventually, the custodians reinstated the lease, now perpetual, conditioned on continued stewardship.

**Will humans hear back from aliens on K2-18b? Not for at least 248 years**
Scientists at the University of Cambridge have announced that the planet K2-18b, located 124 light-years away, has characteristics that suggest it may host life. However, experts warn that contacting aliens could have devastating consequences for humanity. Former ISRO chief S Somanath said, 'I would be happy to never be in contact with aliens,' due to concerns that their genomic and protein structures may be different from ours, posing a threat to life on Earth. British physicist Mark Buchanan also expressed concerns that contacting aliens may result in 'the end of all life on Earth.' Professor Avi Loeb noted that even if we send a communication signal to K2-18b, the earliest time for a response would be 248 years from now, in the year 2273. The team that discovered K2-18b used data from the James Webb Space Telescope to conclude that there is a 99.7% likelihood that it hosts biological life.

**The Descendants of Darkness: Exploring the Hypothesis of Grey Aliens as Future Cave-Dwelling Humans**
The article explores the hypothesis that 'grey aliens' reported in UFO sightings might be future humans adapted to subterranean existence following a global catastrophe. The author suggests that humanity's capacity for technological intervention in its own biology could accelerate this process, leading to the emergence of humans with traits similar to those commonly associated with grey aliens, such as reduced pigmentation, enhanced non-visual sensory systems, and reduced size. The article also discusses the possibility of humans adapting to life on the Moon, where they could evolve to have traits such as reduced gravity and radiation resistance. The author argues that this hypothesis offers a compelling framework that unifies disparate fields, including ufology, evolutionary biology, catastrophe theory, and futurism. Dr. Elena Rodriguez notes that 'when faced with extinction-level threats, species often undergo rapid adaptation to secure their survival,' and Dr. Julian Savulescu argues that 'the bioethical questions surrounding human enhancement become existential imperatives in the face of extinction-level threats.' The article concludes that if grey aliens are indeed future humans, their presence may serve as both a warning and hope for humanity's future.

**The Real Sequel To Ridley Scott's Prometheus Took 12 Years To Happen And Was Much Better Than Alien: Covenant**
Ridley Scott's Alien: Covenant was not a satisfying sequel to Prometheus, but the more recent Alien: Romulus has rectified this issue. Alien: Romulus explores the mysteries of Prometheus, including the black goo and the life cycle of Engineer-black goo-xeno-human DNA-Engineer, without retconning anything from the original film. The movie's use of the Engineer-like hybrid, 'The Offspring,' is a perfect escalation of Prometheus' biological enigmas. In contrast, Alien: Covenant threw away everything that made Prometheus interesting, retaining only Michael Fassbender's duplicitous android character, David. As a result, Alien: Romulus serves as a more faithful and satisfying sequel to Prometheus than Alien: Covenant.

**Humanity May Find Clues of Alien Life in the Next 20 Years, Scientist Says -- And That Will 'Change Everything'**
Scientists believe that humanity may find clues of alien life in the next 20 years. According to Abel Méndez, a planetary astrobiologist, samples of rock and soil from Mars, along with advancing work on exoplanets and the potential signatures of life emanating from them, could help breathe new life into the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) mission. Méndez thinks that the next decade or two could bring some tantalizing hints, and 'if we don't find anything at all... that probably collapses the interest and the funding.' Rebecca Charbonneau, a historian of science, notes that 'we have one data point -- that's us,' and that SETI researchers are making a guess based on our preferred own communications technologies. Despite the challenges and skepticism, Charbonneau says that the search won't be for naught, as it fosters crucial collaboration between scientists across disciplines and acts as a mirror to our own civilization.
