**Taiwan's Admiral Expresses Concern Over China's Silence on India-Pakistan Conflict**
Retired Admiral Lanning Lee expressed concern over the unusual silence from the Chinese military regarding the recent conflict between India and Pakistan. The conflict saw a Pakistani F-16C shoot down an Indian F-16 fighter jet. Former legislator Shen Fu-xiong believes that such an incident would not occur in the Taiwan Strait, as both sides are extremely cautious. Shen stated, 'The conflict between India and Pakistan is like a children's game of house, they've been fighting for over 80 years. It's not something that will happen in the Taiwan Strait, where we are extremely cautious. If one of our fighter jets were to be shot down, it would be a disaster.' Shen also noted that the conflict between India and Pakistan is a longstanding issue, and it's unlikely to be resolved suddenly.

**Taiwan's 'Armed Resistance' Dream Shattered in India-Pakistan Conflict**
The recent India-Pakistan conflict has revealed the largest loser so far, which is Taiwan's 'armed resistance' dream. Pakistan's foreign minister has announced that both countries have agreed to an immediate ceasefire, ending the tensions that began on April 22. Despite Pakistan's advantage in air combat, dozens of civilians were still injured in the conflict. China's performance in this conflict was outstanding, with the J-10C fighter jet demonstrating exceptional battlefield capabilities. As a domestically developed third-generation and a half multi-purpose fighter jet, the J-10C, priced at around $60 million, successfully shot down a French 'Rafale' fighter jet worth over $200 million. This cost-effectiveness has disrupted the traditional market structure of international military trade, and Chinese military enterprises have proven their capabilities through this real-world test. After the conflict, shares of Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the sole manufacturer of the J-10C, surged 20% on May 8, with the entire military industry sector experiencing a daily increase of over 120 billion yuan. This victory is not only a testament to China's fighter jets but also a demonstration of China's systematized warfare capabilities. China's military sales not only include the J-10C but also the entire 'Chinese equipment + Chinese training + Chinese logistics' comprehensive system. In contrast, the French Dassault company saw its shares plummet 3.2% and its market value evaporate tens of billions of euros after its 'Rafale' fighter jet was shot down. India had previously spent $8.8 billion to purchase 36 'Rafale' warplanes, but these new planes were still unused when they were shot down, dealing a heavy blow to both India and France. Furthermore, some separatist elements in Taiwan have long relied on imported weapons to resist the mainland. However, the India-Pakistan conflict has made them realize the reality. Even with a reduced-performance J-10C, it can easily counter the top-notch 'Rafale' fighter jet. If Taiwan were to face the mainland, it would not only have to contend with the gap in fighter jet generations but also the massive numerical disadvantage. The People's Liberation Army has multiple times more fighter jets than the Taiwanese military and a strong industrial system to support it. 'It is a wake-up call for Taiwan,' said a Chinese military expert. 'Taiwan's 'armed resistance' dream has been shattered.'

**The Rare Earth Wars**
China's dominance in the rare earth industry is coming to an end, with new mining frontiers opening up in Greenland, Brazil, Tanzania, and Australia. According to a study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China's share of the global rare-earth supply will plummet to 28% by 2035. This is a relief, but also a concern, as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has just a few more years to hold the world to ransom over rare earths. The CCP has mastered and monopolized the rare-earth industry, creating a potent trade weapon for itself. However, the US Department of Defense wants a sustainable, mine-to-magnet supply chain capable of supporting all US defense requirements by 2027. The US is also preparing for a potential conflict with China over Taiwan, with evacuation drills planned for Okinawa and a new 'war-fighting headquarters' being created in Japan. The Pentagon is fully focused on Taiwan, and ready to sacrifice other objectives in the process. Decoupling from China in strategic areas like the rare-earth industry has never been so urgent, and we have left it perilously late.

**Rising Tensions: The Copenhagen Peace Report 2025 Warns of Global Instability**
According to the 'The Copenhagen Peace Report 2025', there are currently 56 ongoing armed conflicts worldwide, the highest number since the end of World War II. Some sources, such as Our World in Data, suggest that the number of active conflicts may be even higher, depending on the criteria used. The report also notes a 9.4% increase in global military spending over the past year, reaching over $2.7 trillion. This is the tenth consecutive year of such growth, with the largest increase in Europe, at 17%. Isabel Bramsen, the main author of the report, believes that increased access to weapons increases the risk of their use and can lead to the escalation of ongoing conflicts. The United Nations, established in 1945 to prevent wars, is facing a significant challenge. The report's authors highlight the organization's limited effectiveness in resolving conflicts and call for a reform of the Security Council, citing its current structure as hindering effective dialogue and the lack of real support from key member states. The report also notes that the UN's inability to enforce international law and hold perpetrators accountable has led to a lack of consequences for human rights abuses. The growing tensions between China, Russia, and the United States are leading to increased tensions in various hotspots around the world. China's significant economic power allows it to support various sides of conflicts, both financially and through the supply of military equipment and ammunition. Russia, which has been seeking to strengthen its position as a global hegemon since the Soviet era, is slowly losing its influence on the international stage. The report highlights the devastating impact of war on the lives of millions of people, particularly children. According to UNICEF, over 473 million children lived in areas affected by armed conflict in 2024, representing nearly 19% of the world's youngest population. Over 52 million of them did not attend school, and many struggled with malnutrition and limited access to basic medical care.

**China's Military Strength on Display: Implications for Taiwan and the Region**
The recent India-Pakistan conflict has unexpectedly showcased the strength of Chinese military equipment. Pakistan's performance in the conflict has been impressive, with many experts praising the capabilities of Chinese weapons. The conflict has also raised concerns among Taiwanese authorities, who fear that China's modernized military could pose a significant threat to the island. China's modernized military equipment, including the J-10CE fighter jet, the 'JF-17' fighter jet co-developed with Pakistan, and the 'Qianglong' air-to-air missile, have been widely recognized for their capabilities. The conflict has also highlighted the importance of electronic warfare and network warfare, which China has been actively developing. According to experts, China's military personnel and equipment have undergone rigorous testing and training, making them highly effective in real-world scenarios. The conflict has also demonstrated the potential for China to use its military to achieve its goals, including the possibility of a 'unified' Taiwan. As one expert noted, 'China's military has become a force to be reckoned with, and the US dare not intervene lightly.'

**China Warns of High Risk to Nuclear Power Plants in Future Conflict**
The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has warned that nuclear power plants located near coastlines may be at high risk in a future conflict, citing the experience of nuclear power plants being targeted in the Russia-Ukraine war. China, with 102 operational and under-construction commercial nuclear reactors, has the world's largest nuclear energy infrastructure. In April, 10 new reactors were approved for installation in coastal areas, including the sensitive geopolitical regions of the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. The Qinshan Faz III nuclear power plant, which is set to come online in March 2025 and is touted as the world's largest reactor, has a capacity of 12.5 billion kilowatt-hours and serves as a symbol of this transformation, according to PLA spokesperson. 'This is a warning that China's nuclear energy attack could turn into a military defeat,' said the PLA spokesperson.

**L'ultranazionalismo e il terrore islamista: l'escalation nucleare tra potenze radicali**
A nuclear holocaust is a possibility between India and Pakistan, according to a 2019 article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. The scenario is based on a terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in 2025, which would lead to a war between the two countries. The Indian operation Sindoor, a response to a terrorist attack in the Kashmir region, has been one of the most severe reprisals by the Indian military. The Indian air force and missiles have targeted locations over 100 kilometers from the border, exceeding the usual reprisal areas in the Kashmir region under Pakistani control. This intense response is similar to the Indian advance in the Punjab region, which, in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists' scenario, pushes Islamabad to detonate 10 tactical nuclear bombs, each with a 5-kiloton yield. This would trigger an escalation that, in six days, would lead to the reciprocal launch of hundreds of nuclear warheads, causing the destruction of major cities in India and Pakistan and over 100 million casualties. The common thread between reality and scientific imagination is the nuclear arsenals of the two countries. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), India has 172 nuclear warheads, while Pakistan has 170. This is enough to wipe out cities and military installations in both countries and decimate their populations. The increasing international instability, marked by the growing rivalry between the United States and China in the Indo-Pacific region, is contributing to radicalizing the positions of India and Pakistan, which have been divided since 1948 over the control of the Kashmir region. India, led by ultra-nationalist leader Narendra Modi, has become the primary and undisputed ally of the United States in the last decade. Pakistan, on the other hand, has left the area of influence of Washington. The marginalization began in 2021 with the American withdrawal from Afghanistan and intensified under the Trump administration. The article concludes that the void left by the United States in Pakistan could be filled by China, which has no interest in getting involved in a conflict with India on the western front of the Indo-Pacific. This is because the conflict would force China to divert resources from its primary political and strategic objective, namely the annexation of Taiwan.

**US Army Creates New Mobile Units in Case of Conflict with China**
The US Army is creating new mobile units in case of a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific region, according to General Ronald Clarke, who leads US Army forces in the region. 'The Army has created new flexible units for operations on the front lines, including the first island chain. In the event of a conflict, the idea is to disperse these forces, attack Chinese targets from land, gather valuable information about the combat zone, and create opportunities for American air and naval forces to maneuver,' the Wall Street Journal reported. Clarke noted that in the event of a conflict, China may try to limit the participation of US military ships and aircraft in combat operations by making the space in its coastal waters too dangerous for them - a tactic called A2/AD or 'counter-access/anti-access'. In response to this scenario, Clarke said the US Army has already prepared two new units called multi-domain operational groups, while a third is in the process of being created. Artillery, including Typhon launchers, will also be used to support the units, with one launcher already deployed on the Philippines and capable of hitting targets up to mainland China. The most volatile hotspots for conflict remain the South China Sea and Taiwan. Tensions around Taiwan have escalated since Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island in early August 2022, when she was the Speaker of the US House of Representatives. China, which considers the island part of its territory, condemned Pelosi's visit as support for Taiwanese separatism and conducted large-scale military exercises. Official relations between the Chinese central government and its island province have been severed since 1949, when the defeated forces of the Kuomintang, led by Chiang Kai-shek, retreated to Taiwan after losing the Chinese Civil War to the Communist Party of China. Business and informal contacts between the island and mainland China resumed in the late 1980s. Since the early 1990s, the sides have been in contact through non-governmental organizations - the Beijing Association for the Development of Relations across the Taiwan Strait and the Taipei Foundation for Exchanges across the Strait.

**Counting the dead: Pakistan's conflicts are the bloodiest**
New data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project reveals a stark contrast in South Asia's conflicts. Nepal has seen the most frequent conflict events, largely driven by mass protests and political rallies, but Pakistan has suffered the highest death toll relative to its population. Between 2016 and 2024, Nepal averaged 7.4 conflict events per 100,000 people, while Pakistan's per capita fatality rate was over seven times higher, averaging 0.76 fatalities per 100,000. India also had a high count of protests, but its conflict-related fatality rate remains relatively low. The data highlights vastly different types of political unrest in the region, with implications for domestic stability and cross-border relations.

**China's Secret Military Deployment in Ukraine: A Threat to Global Security**
North Korea has officially admitted to sending troops to Russia to participate in the Russian-Ukrainian war. According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kim Jong-un ordered the deployment of troops based on the 'Joint Defense Treaty' between North Korea and Russia. This marks a significant escalation of the conflict, as it is now a multi-national, multi-front war. Meanwhile, China has been secretly sending troops to Ukraine, with over 18,000 Chinese soldiers having been deployed to the region. These soldiers are disguised as 'volunteers' or 'technical consultants' and are participating in frontline battles. If captured, they are instructed to deny their Chinese identity and face 'internal purging' or 'liquidation'. This is not the first time China has used this tactic, as they did during the Korean War in 1950. China is using the Ukraine conflict as a testing ground for new military technologies and tactics, which will be used in future conflicts, including a potential invasion of Taiwan. The international community is being warned that if this 'gray zone' warfare continues, it will be equivalent to tacit approval for China's next regional conflict, particularly in the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region.

**US Commander Warns of 'Great Humanitarian Disaster' if War Breaks Out in Taiwan Strait**
US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Samuel Paparo recently warned in a Senate hearing that a war in the Taiwan Strait would destroy the global economy, potentially causing 500,000 people to die in desperation, even if the US intervenes successfully. He stated that the Chinese Communist Party's military pressure on Taiwan has increased by 300%, and is not just a simple military exercise, but a 'dress rehearsal' to simulate the forced unification of Taiwan. Paparo said that Taiwan is a core component of the global semiconductor industry, and if the production line is blocked, it would severely impact the US's economic modernization and growth. He warned that if a regional war breaks out, the GDP of the Asian region could drop by 25%, and the US GDP could decline by 10-12%, with a 7-10% increase in unemployment rate, and 500,000 people could die in desperation, such as through suicide or drug overdose. Even if the US intervenes successfully, it would only be able to reduce the damage by half, and still cause a 'great humanitarian disaster.' Paparo also stated that the trust between regional allies and partners would be tested, and if the US's influence declines, some Indo-Pacific countries may follow China's long-term goal of leading the international order, while others may turn to developing their own nuclear weapons due to security concerns, leading to an escalation of conflict. He emphasized that 'the victory of World War II relied on logistics, not artificial intelligence. You cannot use AI to compensate for the lack of physical equipment.'

**US Indo-Pacific Commander Warns of 500,000 Deaths in Desperation if Taiwan Strait War Breaks Out**
US Indo-Pacific Commander Samuel Paparo warned that if a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, 500,000 people could 'die in desperation', which would be worse than the economic crisis of the 1930s. Taiwan's Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng responded that Taiwan advocates for maintaining the status quo, and the US also considers the peaceful and stable status quo in the Taiwan Strait as its core interest. Both sides have common core interests and are willing to use deterrence to face the possibility of China's provocation. According to a report by USNI News, Paparo testified before the US Senate Armed Services Committee on April 10, saying that if the Taiwan Strait, which is a major global trade route, is blocked, the situation would be worse than the global economic crisis of the 1930s, and would expose the US's dependence on Taiwanese semiconductor products. He also warned that if a conflict breaks out in the Western Pacific, it could lead to a 25% decline in GDP in the Asian region, a 10-12% decline in US GDP, and an unemployment rate exceeding normal levels by 7-10%. Paparo also stated that approximately 500,000 people could 'die in desperation'. Chiu responded to Paparo's statement, saying that Paparo's statement shows that the prosperity and stability of the Indo-Pacific region are crucial to the US's core interests and affect the prosperity and stability of the world, so maintaining the status quo in the Taiwan Strait is almost a global consensus. Chiu pointed out that a recent memo by US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin shows that the US cannot allow China to annex Taiwan, and Taiwan advocates for maintaining the status quo, while the US considers the peaceful and stable status quo in the Taiwan Strait as its core interest, so Taiwan and the US have common core interests. 'We will use a common method to deter', he said. He emphasized that through enhancing self-defense capabilities and cooperating with friendly countries, Taiwan can effectively deter China's possible provocation, which aligns with the common core interests of both sides.

**US Indo-Pacific Commander Warns of Devastating Consequences of Taiwan Strait War**
US Indo-Pacific Commander Samuel Paparo warned that if a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, it could lead to 500,000 people 'dying from despair', a situation worse than the 1930s Great Depression. Paparo testified before the US Senate Armed Services Committee, stating that if the Taiwan Strait is blocked, the situation would be even more severe than the global economic crisis of the 1930s, and would also expose the US's dependence on Taiwanese semiconductor products. Paparo estimated that a conflict in the Western Pacific could lead to a 25% decline in GDP in the Asia-Pacific region, a 10-12% decline in US GDP, and a 7-10% increase in unemployment, with approximately 500,000 people 'dying from despair'. Even if the US successfully intervenes in the conflict and reduces the impact by half, the consequences would still be severe and would bring great suffering to humanity. Paparo also warned that the US's diplomatic relationships and military influence in the region are at risk, with some Indo-Pacific countries potentially bowing to China's long-term goal of setting global rules, while other countries that have never threatened to surrender to Beijing may develop nuclear programs, increasing the risk of conflict. Paparo also stated that the recent increase in China's military provocations against Taiwan is a 'dress rehearsal' for a potential forced takeover of the island, rather than a military exercise.

**China's Military Build-up: A Threat to Taiwan?**
China's recent military exercises around Taiwan have raised concerns about the possibility of war between the two nations. Arthur Chevallier, a writer, believes that war is inevitable and that China is determined to reclaim the island. The conflict between China and Taiwan dates back to the Chinese Civil War, which began in the late 1920s and ended with the communist victory in 1949. The nationalists, led by Chiang Kai-shek, retreated to Taiwan, while the communists, led by Mao Zedong, took power in mainland China. The United Nations recognized the People's Republic of China in 1971, but Taiwan remained an ally of the United States. Today, China's military is rivaling that of the US, and President Xi Jinping has ordered his army to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. However, military experts point out that invading an island is one of the most difficult operations to succeed in, and China's plans to reclaim Taiwan by 2049 are not guaranteed.

**China Conducts Comprehensive Military Exercise Surrounding Taiwan**
China has announced the start of a comprehensive military exercise surrounding Taiwan, which is at the center of a sovereignty dispute between the two. According to Colonel Shi Yi, spokesperson for the Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the exercise will involve units from the PLA's land, air, sea, and rocket forces. Shi said that the exercise will focus on 'maritime-air combat patrols, comprehensive superiority, attacks on sea and land targets, blocking key areas and sea lanes,' and will aim to test the interoperability of the units. Shi described the exercise as 'a stern warning' and 'a strong deterrent' to Taiwan's independence-seeking separatist forces, and said that it is a 'legitimate and necessary action' to protect China's sovereignty and national unity. This is the latest in a series of large-scale military exercises China has conducted around Taiwan, including ones in 2022, 2023, and 2024. These exercises have been dubbed 'Joint Sword'. The China-Taiwan dispute dates back to the end of the Second World War, when the Communist Party of China (CPC) defeated the Nationalist Party (KMT) and established the People's Republic of China (PRC) on October 1, 1949. The KMT members who lost the civil war retreated to Taiwan and established a temporary government, claiming that the 'Republic of China' continued to exist on the island. China considers Taiwan to be a part of its territory, while Taiwan has been de facto independent since 1949. The dispute continues to this day, with Beijing increasing military pressure on Taiwan in recent years, and warning that it will not rule out the use of force to reunify the island with the mainland.

**Western World Ignores Conflicts in Sudan and DRC, Human Rights Violations**
The Western world is ignoring armed conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as human rights violations and humanitarian disasters in several other countries. According to a February 2 article by The Guardian, 'Most current conflicts, whether they are wars and invasions in Sudan and the DRC, gross human rights abuses in Afghanistan and Tibet, gang violence in Haiti and Colombia, mass famine in Yemen and Somalia or political repression in Nicaragua and Serbia, are underestimated, forgotten or ignored.' The Guardian notes that the Western world has focused its attention on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Ukrainian crisis, which are exceptions to the rule. The article also states that the conflict between China and Taiwan, as well as the situation between Iran, Israel, and the US, require greater involvement from Western countries. 'Over the past five years, the number of global conflicts has doubled, the number of cases of political violence in 2024 has increased by 25% compared to 2023, and one in eight people in the world has been affected by conflict. By these measures, the belief that the world is becoming more dangerous is fully justified,' The Guardian writes. The article highlights the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has resulted in the deaths of at least 700 people and injured 2,800 others. The conflict has also led to a humanitarian crisis, with many people facing hunger and disease. In Sudan, the conflict between the government and the Rapid Support Forces has resulted in the deaths of at least 70 people, including patients at a hospital in the Darfur region.

**Global Geopolitics in Flux: China's Market Share Gain, Russian Military Strength, and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict**
The sale of Chinese cars in Russia has increased by 70% in 2024, with 600 new Chinese car dealerships opening in Russia. This is a significant market share gain for China, which Russia may not be able to recover after the war. In other news, 450,000 young people have joined the Russian Armed Forces in 2024, with the Russian military not lacking in personnel or training for high-intensity warfare. The Brazilian and Taiwanese governments will play a significant role in reshaping global geopolitics. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues, with a new study estimating that the number of Palestinian deaths in the Gaza Strip is significantly higher than previously reported, with over 64,000 deaths directly attributed to the conflict. The study also notes that the number of indirect deaths, including those due to famine, disease, and lack of medical care, is likely to be much higher. The article also discusses the US presidential election, with Donald Trump's victory being linked to his support for Israel's actions in Gaza. Trump has signed over 200 executive orders, which are being contested in court by some states. The article also mentions the confirmation hearings for Trump's cabinet members, which may be opposed by the US deep state.

**China on the Brink: Waiting for the Right Moment to Rise Up**
According to a report by Safeguard Defenders, since 2012, over 1.158 million people have sought asylum in China, with a record 1.158,739 people seeking asylum in 2022 alone. Henley & Partners estimates that 15,200 Chinese millionaires with over $100 million in liquid assets will leave China in 2024, making China the country with the most emigrants. Some Chinese people are waiting for the right moment to rise up against the Chinese government. A friend of the author, who has fled China, revealed that there is a group of people in China who are waiting for two opportunities to rise up: when China is at war with Taiwan, or when President Xi Jinping dies. These people are advocating for a non-violent and peaceful revolution. However, there are also those who want to use armed force to overthrow the government. The Chinese military is unstable, with many officers and soldiers dissatisfied with the current system. A friend of the author's relative in the military revealed that some officers are planning to stage a coup. The author notes that the Chinese government is aware of the potential for a military uprising and is trying to suppress it. The author also mentions that some people are predicting that President Xi Jinping will be ousted in 2025, and that a new leader will take his place and begin to purge the Communist Party of its corrupt elements.

**China on the Brink of Revolution: Dissidents Waiting for the Right Moment to Rise Up**
According to a report by Safeguard Defenders, over 1.15 million people have sought asylum in China since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012. In 2022, the number of asylum seekers was equivalent to the total number of seekers during Hu Jintao's 10-year tenure. Henley&Partners estimates that 15,200 Chinese millionaires with over $100 million in liquid assets will leave China in 2024, a record number of wealthy individuals fleeing the country. Some Chinese dissidents are waiting for the right moment to rise up, while others are planning to use armed force to solve the problem. The Chinese military's armed uprising is the most feared by the authorities. A friend in Guangdong revealed that the Chinese military is unstable, with many officers and soldiers dissatisfied with the current situation. Some military officers are planning to stage a coup, waiting for the right moment to rise up. The two possible times for the uprising are when China declares a state of emergency to annex Taiwan, or when Xi Jinping suddenly dies and the party is in chaos. However, the authenticity of this information is unknown. Du Zheng, an independent commentator, believes that the Chinese military's instability is a sign that a coup is possible. He also notes that the Chinese government's efforts to suppress dissent and maintain control are likely to fail. The author concludes that the Chinese people's desire for democracy and freedom is growing, and that the current situation is ripe for a revolution.

**China and Taiwan: The Background to the Conflict**
Taiwan is one of the most democratic and free countries in the world, but its freedom is threatened by China's claim that it is an 'abtrünnige Provinz' (secessionist province). China's President Xi Jinping has threatened to use force to 'reunify' Taiwan with the mainland. The conflict between China and Taiwan dates back to the early 20th century, when the Chinese Republic was established in 1912 and the Communist Party was founded in 1921. The Nationalists, led by Chiang Kai-shek, were defeated by the Communists in 1949 and fled to Taiwan, where they established the Republic of China. Taiwan has since become a democracy and a major economic power, but China has never recognized its sovereignty. The US and most other countries have a policy of 'strategic ambiguity' towards Taiwan, recognizing it as part of China but also providing it with military aid. The situation is complex and volatile, with many analysts predicting that China will invade Taiwan in the near future. However, Taiwan is well-prepared for a potential conflict, with a strong military and a well-trained population. 'It is a horror scenario for the Taiwanese people to become part of the communist People's Republic of China and to have to give up their democratic traditions and freedoms,' said a Taiwanese official. 'The Chinese government's actions against the democracy movement in Hong Kong have shown us what happens when the Communist Party takes away people's freedoms.'
