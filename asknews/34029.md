**US Opens Investigation into New York Mayor Candidate Eric Adams**
The US Department of Justice has opened an investigation into Eric Adams, the Democratic candidate for Mayor of New York, following a move by the Trump administration to drop an indictment against current Mayor Eric Adams, who has promised to comply with federal government policies on immigration. The investigation was initiated approximately one month ago, according to The New York Times, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the case. This move, along with Adams' promise to comply with federal policies, has raised suspicions of a potential quid pro quo. Republican congressmen have been pushing for the Department of Justice to investigate whether former New York Governor Cuomo lied to Congress about COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes during the pandemic. Cuomo announced his candidacy for Mayor in March, but will need to win the Democratic primary in June to make it to the November elections.

**US Department of Justice Investigates Andrew Cuomo Over Lying to Congress**
The US Department of Justice is investigating former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is now a candidate for Mayor of New York, after Republicans accused him of lying to Congress about his decisions during the pandemic. According to The New York Times, citing sources familiar with the investigation, the federal prosecutor's office in Washington has been focusing on Cuomo for a month. Cuomo is leading the polls in the Democratic primary elections, which will take place on November 24. This investigation comes three months after Cuomo demanded the dismissal of the corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, who has recently aligned himself with President Donald Trump. Adams, who was previously a Democrat, is running for re-election as an independent, while Cuomo, who is very popular, is leading the polls in the Democratic primary. Cuomo has called Trump a 'bully' during the campaign and has vowed to stand up to him. Rich Azzopardi, Cuomo's spokesperson, said that they have not been informed of the investigation and that it is an 'interested leak'. 'This is a legal war and electoral interference, plain and simple, something that President Trump and his high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice say they oppose,' Azzopardi said. He continued, 'Mr. Cuomo testified truthfully, to the best of his recollection, about the events four years ago, and offered to answer any further questions from the subcommittee; but from the beginning, all of this was, obviously, something political.'

**Investigation Launched into Andrew Cuomo's Testimony Before Congress**
The US Justice Department has opened an investigation into Andrew Cuomo, a top candidate for the New York mayoralty and a close ally of Donald Trump, to determine if he lied to Congress, according to several American media outlets. The investigation was opened several weeks ago by the Washington prosecutor's office, according to the New York Times, citing anonymous sources. This revelation comes after the authorities dropped corruption charges against outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who has aligned himself with Republican President Donald Trump and will run for re-election as an independent in the November election. Cuomo, the former governor of New York, is a comeback politician who had to resign in 2021 due to allegations of sexual harassment and assault, but is currently leading in the polls. Cuomo's spokesperson, Rich Azzopardi, said he was not aware of the investigation, but claimed that its disclosure was 'purely and simply a legal war and electoral interference - a situation that President Trump and his senior Justice Department officials claim to oppose.' The Democratic primary is scheduled for June 24, and the winner will be the favorite to win in New York, a progressive stronghold.

**US Launches Investigation into Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo**
The US Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into Andrew Cuomo, the former Governor of New York, who is running for mayor of the city. According to The New York Times, the investigation began about a month ago, and prosecutors are looking into whether Cuomo made false statements to Congress about his actions as Governor during the pandemic. Cuomo's representative said that he was not informed of the investigation and called it 'a plan by the administration of US President Donald Trump to interfere in the mayoral election.' Cuomo, a Democrat, is running for mayor against current Mayor Eric Adams, who has publicly supported Trump. In April, a New York court closed a corruption case against Adams, citing that the trial would interfere with his ability to implement Trump's policies on immigration and could impact his re-election campaign. The mayoral election is scheduled for November 2025.

**US Department of Justice Launches Investigation into Andrew Cuomo**
The US Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a candidate for New York City mayor, over allegations that he made false statements to Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigation focuses on Cuomo's decision to require nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients in March 2020, which is believed to have increased the risk of elderly people dying from the virus. Republican Representative James Comer accused Cuomo of hiding his involvement in editing a report from the state health department, which led to the investigation. Cuomo's spokesperson, Rich Azzopardi, denied the allegations, calling the investigation 'a naked political interference and a legal battle.' Cuomo has previously stated that the criminal investigations into him, Mayor Eric Adams, and former President Trump are all controlled by high-ranking Democrats. The investigation is not the first time the Trump administration has targeted Cuomo. In 2020, the Department of Justice investigated Cuomo's government for allegedly hiding the number of deaths in nursing homes, but a report by the inspector general found that the DOJ officials had violated internal rules by leaking confidential information to the media before the election.

**Taoyuan Prosecutors' Office Investigates Impeachment of DPP Legislator Chen Jun-yu**
The Taoyuan District Prosecutors' Office is investigating the impeachment of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Chen Jun-yu, who is accused of forging documents. On the day after President Tsai Ing-wen's first anniversary in office, the office searched the homes of 8 people, including National Party Yilan County Party Chairman Lin Ming-chang, and brought them in for questioning. Lin's son, Legislator Lin Yue-xian, said, 'This is not only an attack on my father, but also a trampling of local democracy.' Lin Yue-xian also showed text messages between his father and the former secretary-general of the party, saying that they emphasized the need to handle the impeachment case in accordance with the law. Lin Yue-xian said that his father was taken away at 7:30 am and that, as a 76-year-old, he found it very difficult. He wondered if the prosecution was trying to intimidate him. National Party Legislator Wu Tsung-chin said that the impeachment case against Chen Jun-yu will end on June 24, and that the prosecution's actions could have a 'chilling effect' on the public, making them afraid to sign the petition. Meanwhile, the Keelung District Prosecutors' Office is investigating the impeachment of DPP Legislator Zheng Wen-ting and Zhang Zhi-hao, who are accused of forging documents. The prosecution arrested Zhang Zhi-hao's leader, You Zheng-yi, and the Keelung District Court has ordered him to be detained due to the severity of the crime and the risk of tampering with evidence.

**Prosecutors Destroy the Prosecution and Flee: A Shameless Attempt to Avoid Investigation**
Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office Chief Prosecutor Chang-soo Lee and 4th Deputy Prosecutor Jo Sang-woon suddenly announced their resignation. They are expected to retire on May 2, the day before the presidential election. This is seen as an attempt to escape the upcoming investigation after destroying the prosecution and fleeing. Chang-soo Lee said, 'I thought I should come back and work for my junior colleagues after the impeachment was rejected, and now the system is somewhat stabilized.' Jo Sang-woon said, 'I decided it was time to stabilize after some stability was achieved.' These statements are shameless. They have destroyed the prosecution's fairness and neutrality to the extent that it cannot be recovered, and what kind of system is stabilized and stabilized? 'I thought of my junior colleagues' is a statement that can only be agreed with by one of his junior colleagues. Chang-soo Lee was promoted to Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office Chief Prosecutor for his efforts to remove political opponents and engage in political revenge investigations, including the investigation of Lee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party of Korea, and the investigation of Moon Jae-in's daughter, Dahye. After his promotion, he dismissed all charges against Kim Gun-hee, including the luxury handbag and stock price manipulation allegations. Jo Sang-woon, who led the investigation into Kim's stock price manipulation, is currently under investigation by the Seoul High Prosecutors' Office and is expected to face disciplinary action. They are resigning to avoid the upcoming investigation, which is inevitable after destroying the prosecution. According to the Prosecutors' Disciplinary Act, the Minister of Justice must first confirm whether there are any disciplinary grounds for the prosecutor who wishes to retire, and once the investigation begins, the prosecutor cannot retire. If the investigation results in disciplinary action, the prosecutor will be barred from practicing law for 3 years if dismissed and 2 years if removed. They are fleeing because they are afraid of being barred from practicing law. Justice Minister Park Sung-jae recently appointed current prosecutors to the Ministry of Justice and the Prosecutors' Office, completing the 'obstruction of investigation' personnel appointments. This is an attempt to weaken the investigation of the next government. Therefore, the truth must be revealed through investigation and responsibility must be held for the abuse of power.

**US Department of Justice Investigates Former Governor Andrew Cuomo**
The US Department of Justice is investigating former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a leading candidate for the city's mayoralty, over his testimony to Congress about his decisions during the pandemic. According to The New York Times, the federal prosecutor in Washington has been focusing on Cuomo for a month, who is currently leading the polls in the Democratic primaries to become the next mayor of New York in the November elections. The investigation comes three months after Cuomo demanded the dismissal of the corruption charges against current New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who has recently aligned himself with President Donald Trump. Republicans in the House of Representatives had requested a federal investigation into Cuomo, arguing that he lied to the House Oversight Committee last year by claiming he had not reviewed a report by the New York State Department of Health on the state's management of the COVID-19 pandemic during his tenure as governor. Cuomo currently leads the polls in the Democratic primaries, which will take place on June 24, and has referred to Trump as a 'bully' during the campaign, vowing to stand up to him. This new case has sparked further criticism of Trump for allegedly using the Department of Justice to punish his perceived political opponents.

**Prosecution Investigates Choi Ho over Allegations of Kim Yeo-sa's Interference in Nomination Process**
The prosecution has summoned Choi Ho, a former candidate for the mayor of Pyeongtaek, for investigation related to the allegations of interference in the nomination process by Kim Yeo-sa, the wife of former President Yoon Suk-yeol. According to the legal community, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office's special investigation team, led by Chief Prosecutor Lee Ji-hyeong, summoned Choi, who was nominated as the candidate for the mayor of Pyeongtaek by the People Power Party in the 2022 local elections, as a witness for questioning. The prosecution is investigating allegations that the Yoon Suk-yeol couple intervened in the nomination process for the mayor of Pyeongtaek during the local elections, pushing Choi, who was seen as a 'pro-Yoon' candidate, as a preliminary candidate despite his lack of competitiveness. Choi, who served as the vice chairman of the People Power Party's presidential election committee and a permanent advisor to the transition committee, posted on his blog in May 2022 that he had received a promise of support from Yoon Suk-yeol during a meeting at the presidential transition committee office. However, Choi ultimately lost the election to the Democratic Party of Korea's candidate, Jeong Jang-seon. The prosecution plans to conduct a face-to-face investigation with Kim Yeo-sa after completing the investigation of surrounding individuals.

**Taiwan's KMT Party Department Searched by Prosecutors, Lawmakers Protest Judicial Injustice**
The Taipei District Prosecutors' Office conducted a large-scale search of the Kuomintang (KMT) New Taipei City Party Department on April 28, taking away three people for questioning. KMT lawmakers, including Hsu Yu-chen and Wu Tsung-hsien, held a press conference, stating that the prosecution is 'chasing' the KMT's signature efficiency and that last month's impeachment of KMT legislator Lin Pei-xiang had 116 cases of forged or deceased signatures, but none have been investigated. The KMT New Taipei City Party Department stated that the prosecution unit searched the homes and offices of the party's secretary-general, secretary, and three district executives, and took them to the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office for questioning. The party respects the judicial investigation, but demands fairness and justice, and not to use illegal means to investigate. Chu Li-lun stated that President Lai Ching-te is instructing the prosecution, completely disregarding the principle of proportionality and judicial justice. The people's power will ultimately be the one to retaliate, and it will be concentrated on Lai Ching-te. In the coming days, various regions will launch impeachment activities against Lai Ching-te, which will become the most important democratic movement in Taiwan. Hsu Yu-chen stated that the prosecution has recently launched searches of KMT party departments in various counties and cities, 'chasing' the KMT's signature efficiency, is the judiciary still fair? The prosecution has taken people into custody and extracted confessions, and the Taipei City Party Department's chairman, Huang Lu-jin-ju, was detained and forbidden from seeing her family after she successfully appealed to the Taipei District Court. This time, the prosecution has searched the New Taipei City Party Department for the second time, taking away party officials. Hsu Yu-chen believes that last month, 10 KMT legislators were impeached, with the most cases being 116 forged or deceased signatures in the impeachment of KMT legislator Lin Pei-xiang, but none have been investigated. The judiciary's lack of fairness is evident, and the people are watching. On April 26, 250,000 people marched in the rain on Ketagalan Boulevard to protest against judicial injustice and authoritarian rule. Wu Tsung-hsien stated that the Central Election Commission's vice chairman said that 'if the second-stage signature format is incorrect, it is a violation of the Election and Recall Law and the Criminal Code.' However, in Hualien, 4,000 signatures were found to have incorrect formats, but the prosecution has taken no action. The Central Election Commission has even come out to defend the government's actions, saying that minor errors do not matter. As an independent institution, it has joined the government in its chaos.

**AG Paxton uses end of federal probe to jab Cornyn, Biden**
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has used the news that the Justice Department will not prosecute him to take shots at both former President Joe Biden and current Texas Sen. John Cornyn. Paxton claimed that Biden 'weaponized the DOJ' to try and take him down due to his frequent lawsuits against the Biden administration. He also accused Cornyn of working against the Trump presidency and suggested that Cornyn is a 'Republican in name only.' Cornyn has already announced his bid for a fifth term in the Senate, and a recent poll showed a slight edge for Cornyn. Paxton has hinted at a possible Senate run since his acquittal in the 2023 impeachment trial.

**This Top Senate Democrat Is Now Under Federal Investigation**
Interim D.C. U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr. has launched an investigation into Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer over comments he made in March 2020, where he threatened Trump-appointed Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. Schumer said, 'I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh: You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price.' According to 18 U.S. Code § 115, threatening a federal official can result in a fine or imprisonment of up to ten years. Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, has been calling for Schumer's prosecution for years, stating, 'Schumer should have been (and should be) criminally prosecuted for his threats targeting two Supreme Court justices.' Martin wrote Schumer in a letter, 'We take threats against public officials very seriously. I look forward to your cooperation.' However, some career prosecutors have expressed concerns that Martin is politicizing the office and potentially breaking with 50 years of Justice Department policy.
