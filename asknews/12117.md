**Virgin Galactic spaceflight chief encourages Florida Tech grads as company builds new rocket plane**
Virgin Galactic's spaceflight chief, Will Moses, encouraged Florida Tech graduates to pursue careers in space exploration, citing the company's progress in building a new rocket plane, the Delta. Moses, a Florida Tech alumnus, emphasized the importance of consistency and innovation in the space industry. He noted that Virgin Galactic is working to assemble the first two Delta rocket planes at a hangar complex in Arizona, with a goal of conducting the first glide test flight next spring and the first private astronaut flights in fall 2026. Moses also highlighted the Delta's superior avionics and components, as well as its ability to fly faster and more frequently than its predecessor, the VSS Unity. He expressed enthusiasm for the company's plans to expand to more spaceports, including Spaceport America in New Mexico, and to offer daily missions using four Delta rocket planes. Moses said, 'Starting a new industry? Enormous. Taking people to space monthly? Enormous. Doing so as a small commercial company safely, repeatedly, with a whole lot of heart? Enormous.' He also advised the graduates, 'Never discount that what you learn along the way is invaluable for tomorrow.'

**Expert: Russia to Go Bankrupt in 2026**
Russian expert Malcolm Dixelius predicts that Russia will go bankrupt in 2026. He believes that Russia's President Vladimir Putin is now in need of a peace agreement, more than Ukraine. 'Russians are exhausted. The country is heading towards national bankruptcy in 2026. It's the Russians who are under the greatest pressure,' Dixelius said to Swedish Aftenposten. He points to US President Donald Trump's recent shift in stance, which appears to be more in favor of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky than Putin. 'The US has not completely changed course, but they have become much more accepting of Ukraine's description of reality. Russian attempts to take advantage of the opening Trump gave them have failed,' Dixelius said. Russia's poor economy and US support for Ukraine are two factors contributing to Russia's struggles. However, Ukraine has also managed to hit critical Russian infrastructure. China still has influence over Putin, and it's difficult to assess the impact of Chinese President Xi Jinping on Putin, as China is the only country that can lend Russia money.

**China Evergrande Group: Clearing Person Applies to Hong Kong High Court to Withdraw Share Transfer**
On May 12, 2025, China Evergrande Group (03333.HK) released an internal information announcement, disclosing further information about the liquidation and continued suspension of trading. The announcement showed that the liquidator of CEG and the temporary liquidator of CEG Holdings have jointly applied to the High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to allow the transfer of CEG Holdings' ordinary shares held by the company to BVI Limited (a company in liquidation in the British Virgin Islands) and to confirm that the transfer shall not be invalid under the Companies (Winding-up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32) (CWUMPO) Article 199(2) and Schedule 25, Part 1, Section 2. BVI Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Evergrande Group registered in the British Virgin Islands, and according to the investigation conducted by the liquidator of CEG and the temporary liquidator of CEG Holdings from March 2024 to the present, China Evergrande Group and BVI Limited each held 1 ordinary share of CEG Holdings, representing a 50% stake in the company. On December 30, 2022, BVI Limited transferred its 1 ordinary share of CEG Holdings to China Evergrande Group for $1, at a time when BVI Limited was unable to repay its debts and the transfer value was significantly lower than the value of CEG Holdings' shares at the time. The liquidator of CEG and the temporary liquidator of CEG Holdings consulted with a British barrister and a law firm in the British Virgin Islands for their legal opinions on whether the transfer was invalid under the British Virgin Islands' bankruptcy law. According to the joint opinion (the liquidator of CEG and the temporary liquidator of CEG Holdings reserve the right to maintain confidentiality of relevant legal professional privilege), the transfer constitutes an unfair transaction under the British Virgin Islands' law. The court has the power to issue an order to set aside the transfer and return the CEG Holdings shares to BVI Limited, restoring the original ownership status. On July 22, 2024, the Commercial Court of the High Court of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court in the British Virgin Islands issued a winding-up order against BVI Limited and appointed a joint liquidator. In late October 2024, the liquidator of BVI Limited requested that the liquidator of CEG return the CEG Holdings shares to BVI Limited, failing which the liquidator of BVI Limited would apply to the court for a relevant order. After considering the relevant circumstances, the liquidator of CEG and the temporary liquidator of CEG Holdings believe that it is not in the best interests of China Evergrande Group, CEG Holdings, or the creditors of each to have the liquidator of BVI Limited apply to the court; instead, considering the clear opinion in the joint opinion, it is more reasonable and cost-effective to voluntarily withdraw the transfer application. The Hong Kong court has instructed that a hearing for the withdrawal of the transfer application will be held on June 25, 2025, at 9:30 am, with a 15-minute reserve. China Evergrande Group's shares have been suspended for trading since January 29, 2024, at 10:18 am, and will continue to be suspended until further notice.

**Virgin Galactic Constructs New Spaceplane for Commercial Flights in 2026**
Virgin Galactic has begun construction of its new spaceplane, Delta, which is designed for commercial space travel. The Delta 2001 model can carry up to six passengers, two more than its previous versions.

Virgin Galactic currently has a waiting list of 700 people for the Delta spaceplane. This approach differs from other companies like Blue Origin, SpaceX, and Space Perspective, which are developing pressurized capsules that use balloons to ascend into space.

**Virgin Galactic's Delta-class Spaceship Set for 2026 Summer Maiden Flight**
Virgin Galactic's Delta-class spaceship is expected to make its maiden flight in summer 2026, with a focus on scientific research. The first commercial astronaut flight is expected to launch in the fall of the same year. Despite the successful development of the new spaceship, Virgin Galactic's financial performance is facing challenges. According to the company's fourth-quarter 2024 financial report, its revenue dropped to $400,000, a significant decline from $2.8 million in the same period last year. The main reason for the revenue decline is that the company has suspended commercial flights and concentrated its resources on producing the Delta-class spaceship. Additionally, the company's fourth-quarter net loss was $76 million, a narrowing of the $104 million loss in the same period last year. The launch of the Delta-class spaceship is seen as a major breakthrough for Virgin Galactic in the field of space technology. The new spaceship features more advanced materials and design, enabling it to support more frequent flight missions and provide a more comfortable experience for passengers. This innovation will further enhance the feasibility and appeal of commercial space travel. Virgin Galactic's plan not only drives the progress of space technology but also provides opportunities for more private astronauts and research teams to participate in space exploration.

**America's Space Race Is Over. So Who's Left to Invest In?**
The space industry experienced a 'Great Space Shakeout' in 2024, with several companies facing significant challenges. Astra Space went bankrupt, ABL Space Systems abandoned its launch business, and Virgin Galactic shut down its space tourism business. However, some companies have emerged as survivors, including Rocket Lab, which has seen its stock price increase fivefold in 2024 due to a monster contract win from the U.S. Space Force and an accelerating cadence of rocket launches. Airbus subsidiary Arianespace also survived the shakeout, but its ability to compete with SpaceX and Rocket Lab will depend on its ability to increase launch volume and reduce launch costs. Boeing and Lockheed Martin's joint venture, United Launch Alliance, successfully launched its new rocket, the Vulcan Centaur, and is expected to see significant growth in 2025. Northrop Grumman has also teamed up with Firefly Aerospace to inject start-up energy into its business. As Rich Smith, The Motley Fool, notes, 'The thinning out of competition from other small launchers -- Virgin Orbit, Astra, and ABL -- is giving Rocket Lab pricing power in this market.'
