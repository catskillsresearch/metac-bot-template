**Should You Buy Archer Aviation While It's Below $13.30? | The Motley Fool**
Archer Aviation, a start-up company, is working on an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft called Midnight. The goal is to create an air taxi service, and the company has already achieved this goal. However, the FAA approval process is a long and complex one, and Archer Aviation is currently only 15% of the way through the process. The company plans to produce up to 10 Midnight eVTOLs in 2025, with most of them set to be used for the approval process. A successful launch of an air taxi service in Abu Dhabi, where Archer Aviation is currently working with a partner, could lead to a higher stock price, potentially exceeding the 52-week high of $13.30 per share. The company's goal is to both sell aircraft and run its own air taxi service, and a successful outcome in Abu Dhabi would provide a blueprint for the company to follow for its own ramp-up. 'The successful launch of an air taxi service will likely lead to a higher stock price,' according to the article. 'There's more than one reason for that.'

**Ministry placates taxis with a review of rules, new facilities and their own airport ride-hailing app - Thai Examiner**
The Ministry of Transport has introduced a four-part plan to address the concerns of taxi drivers operating at Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang airports. The plan includes enforcing physical separation between licensed taxis and app-based vehicles, increasing enforcement, public awareness campaigns, and introducing a new ride-hailing app called 'SAWASDEE by AOT' that allows passengers to book metered taxis via smartphone without charging a commission. The app aims to level the playing field for traditional taxis and give them a digital edge. The Ministry has also promised upgrades to taxi facilities, including better lighting, clearer signs, and more toilets. The goal is to have a unified system where both taxis and apps play by the same rules, and the Ministry is working on a new legal framework for ride-hailing. Talks with driver unions continue, and officials hope to finalize a long-term agreement by July. Deputy Minister Surapong remains optimistic, saying that this is a compromise and a step forward, but some taxi drivers say the measures are too little, too late.

**Dubai Taxi Aims to Launch Self-Driving Taxis by 2026**
Dubai Taxi, the largest taxi operator in Dubai, aims to launch self-driving taxis by early 2026, using environmentally friendly cars. According to the company's CEO, Mansour Al Farsi, 'the self-driving taxi is expected to be operational by the beginning of 2026. It takes time to test and agree on the regulations.' The company is working on several fronts to increase revenue and profits, including expanding its fleet of taxis to meet the growing demand due to the increasing population and visitors in Dubai, as well as the city's urban development plan. Al Farsi also announced that the Roads and Transportation Authority in Dubai will soon launch a tender for taxi plates. In 2024, Dubai Taxi's profits decreased by 4% year-over-year to 331.3 million dirhams, affected by interest costs and corporate tax, despite a 12% growth in revenue. Al Farsi stated that taxi prices in Dubai are still lower than in many other cities, leaving room for a possible increase in fares by the Roads and Transportation Authority, which would boost the company's revenue and profits. The authority reviews the taxi fare periodically based on fuel prices and annually based on economic changes such as inflation, which leads to adjusting the prices.

**UAE Develops Plan for Air Corridors for Flying Taxis and Cargo Drones**
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has started developing a plan for air corridors for flying taxis and cargo drones. According to a statement released by the UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority, the state aims to establish itself as a forward-thinking and future-oriented society in the Middle East. In 2017, Dubai began testing two-seat flying taxis with propellers on top, developed by the German company Volocopter. Joby Aviation, an American company producing flying taxis, announced in September that it had submitted an application for a certificate that would allow it to operate commercial air services in the UAE. 'The development of air routes for manned and unmanned aerial vehicles and drones is an important step towards the introduction of advanced air mobility technologies in the UAE,' said Director of the General Civil Aviation Authority Saif Mohammed Al Suwaidi. Over the next 20 months, air corridors will be identified and rules for their use will be established. According to the UAE's official news agency WAM, flying taxis are expected to begin operations in 2026. The plan is being developed in collaboration with the Institute of Innovative Technologies (TII), a global center for advanced technological research based in Abu Dhabi, and ASPIRE, an UAE organization that funds research and development.

'The mapping of air corridors for air taxis and drones is a crucial milestone that will enable the smooth implementation of Advanced Air Mobility in UAE infrastructure,' said GCAA Director General S aif Mohammed Al Suwaidi. Al Suwaidi emphasized that this initiative ensures a safe and efficient adoption of air mobility, offering transformative solutions for urban transportation and preparing the ground for a more intelligent and connected future. Additionally, he highlighted that the new air routes will connect key international airports and iconic landmarks in the country, ensuring the seamless integration of air taxis and drones into urban landscapes. Dubai will be the first city in the world to implement the taxi air project, with a service scheduled to start in the first quarter of 2026. The city has also revealed the creation of the country's first commercial vertiport, Dubai International Vertiport (DXV), on January 9. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that vertiports will be built in three strategic locations in Abu Dhabi: Al Bateen, Yas Island, and Khalifa Port. These platforms are designed to facilitate the takeoff, landing, and servicing of air taxis, with operations planned to start in 2026 as well.

**The AI market's $1 trillion opportunity**
The global AI market is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, with the UAE leading the charge in the Middle East. The region is poised to become a hotbed of market growth, driven by the adoption of AI technology. Dubai, in particular, is pioneering the adoption of AI-related tech, with the trialling of autonomous taxis and the establishment of Dubai Silicon Oasis (DSO) as a hub for AI innovation. DSO provides a unique ecosystem for businesses to connect and innovate, with features such as an AI-powered pedestrian crossing system and an IoT-connected waste disposal system. The UAE's AI market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 42.2% by 2028, outstripping the forecast value of the AI market in high-powered economies such as France and Japan. Generative AI (GenAI) is a key area of growth, with the global conversational platforms market expected to expand to $340.8 billion in 2030. Computer vision (CV) is also set to be a significant subcategory, worth $125.1 billion by 2030, driven by the rising interest in autonomous vehicles and drones. The UAE's regional dominance is due to its early recognition of the transformative power of AI, with the appointment of a dedicated AI minister in 2017 and the creation of an AI-friendly legislative landscape. Dr Juma Al Matrooshi, Director General of DSO, says, 'I talk a lot about the capacity for AI to change our society. LLMs and chatbots are already being implemented across a range of sectors, but for the technology to be implemented in the right way a greater sense of vision is required.'
