**8,500 Tons of Antibiotics End Up in Rivers Each Year, Threatening Human Health and Biodiversity**
A study led by the University of McGill estimates that 8,500 tons of antibiotics, nearly a third of what people consume annually, end up in rivers around the world. The antibiotics come from hospitals, homes, and pharmaceutical plants. Wastewater treatment plants are unable to completely remove them. River contamination with antibiotics has become a silent and growing threat to human health and aquatic biodiversity. The study found that each year, 8,500 tons of antibiotics enter rivers, representing nearly a third of global human consumption. Wastewater treatment systems do not completely eliminate antibiotics. Residues from hospitals, homes, and the pharmaceutical industry flow into rivers, where they accumulate over time. Although concentrations are often low and difficult to detect, chronic and cumulative exposure poses significant risks. Aquatic microbial ecosystems are disrupted, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria develop, affecting both animals and people. At low concentrations, antibiotics affect fish, algae, and microbial communities, disrupting ecological balances. The study suggests that these alterations can spread antibiotic resistance, one of the most serious global health threats. Amoxicillin, one of the most prescribed antibiotics, is also one of the most present in rivers. The study used a global model supported by data from 877 river sites, which detected alarming levels, especially in South Asia, where sanitation systems are inadequate and antibiotic use is increasing. Antibiotics save lives, but their use has unforeseen environmental consequences. Researchers do not propose stopping their use, but rather better managing their waste to avoid secondary impacts on the environment. The study only considers human consumption. However, it is known that intensive livestock farming and pharmaceutical factories also discharge antibiotic residues, which would further exacerbate the problem if included. India, China, and Pakistan concentrate 47% of the rivers with the highest levels of antibiotics. In these densely populated regions, 750 million people live near contaminated rivers, posing a direct health risk. Implementing monitoring programs allows for detecting critical areas and acting quickly. It is not enough to detect; it is essential to modernize wastewater treatment plants, especially in areas with outdated or non-existent infrastructure. Advanced filtration systems can drastically reduce antibiotic concentrations, protecting both ecosystems and people. Modernizing and expanding wastewater treatment technologies represents a key opportunity to move towards a sustainable future: Investing in this area not only mitigates damage but also turns an environmental problem into a lever for transforming outdated infrastructure and building a more circular and clean model.

**Antibiotic Pollution in Rivers: A Global Environmental Crisis**
A new study by McGill University has revealed the alarming extent of antibiotic pollution in rivers around the world. Researchers estimate that rivers receive around 8,500 tons of antibiotics annually, equivalent to a third of human consumption. Despite the presence of wastewater treatment systems, these pollutants continue to seep into natural waterways, affecting aquatic ecosystems and human health. According to Hélène Aïlt Maïsedo, a postdoctoral researcher at McGill University and lead author of the study, 'small amounts of antibiotic residues are often difficult to detect in most rivers, but chronic and cumulative exposure poses a significant risk to human health and ecosystems.' The study, published in PNAS Nexus, found that antibiotic accumulation has a negative impact on aquatic life, even at low concentrations, affecting fish, algae, and microbial communities, leading to changes in natural microbial diversity and increased bacterial resistance to treatment. The researchers identified amoxicillin as the primary pollutant in rivers. Using a global model supported by data from 877 river sites, they identified hotspots of pollution and found that Southeast Asia is particularly vulnerable due to increased antibiotic use and inadequate treatment facilities. The study highlights the unintended environmental consequences of antibiotics, which, despite their importance in treating diseases, have significant ecological and health impacts. The researchers emphasize the need for effective strategies to mitigate these effects, including improved wastewater treatment and regulation. The study also notes that sources of pollution such as livestock farms and pharmaceutical factories were not included in the analysis, suggesting that the results may be underestimated. According to Professor Jim Niel, 'our results confirm that human consumption alone is responsible for significant pollution, and it is likely that the picture is worse when accounting for veterinary and industrial sources.' The highest levels of pollution are found in India, China, and Pakistan, which account for 47% of the most polluted rivers, due to inadequate sewage systems and high population density. Approximately 750 million people live near these rivers, increasing the likelihood of exposure to contaminated water.

**Boosting Livestock Productivity Can Cut Antibiotic Use: FAO**
A new study led by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) suggests that improving livestock productivity can significantly reduce global antibiotic use. The research, published in Nature Communications, estimates that optimizing livestock systems could cut antibiotic use in half by 2040. Without targeted interventions, antibiotic use in livestock is projected to increase by nearly 30% by 2040, reaching 143,481t globally. However, strategic improvements in productivity could reduce that figure to around 62,000t, a 57% decrease. FAO experts emphasize the importance of enhancing animal health, management practices, and production efficiency to meet global antibiotic reduction goals. As Alejandro Acosta, Livestock Economist, FAO and author of the study, said, 'Improving livestock production efficiency is key to curbing antibiotic use.' The study's findings align with global commitments to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and support FAO's RENOFARM initiative, which offers policy guidance, technical assistance, and capacity building to help countries reduce antibiotic use while promoting sustainable livestock transformation.

**FAO Proposes Plan to Reduce Antibiotic Use in Livestock by 57% by 2040**
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has proposed a plan to reduce the use of antibiotics in livestock by 57% over the next 15 years. According to the FAO, the global use of antibiotics in livestock is projected to reach 143,481 tons by 2040, a 30% increase. However, if productivity in the livestock sector is optimized, the use of antibiotics could be reduced by 57%. This can be achieved through improved animal health, better management practices, and more efficient production methods. As stated by Alejandro Acosta, Wondmagegn Tirkaso, Francesco Nicolli, Giuseppina Cinardi, Junxia Song, and Thomas Van Boeckel, 'the parties involved in the livestock sector must work together to improve disease prevention and reduce the need for antimicrobials.' The FAO emphasizes the need for policies, technical assistance, and capacity building to reduce the need for antimicrobials, as seen in the Renofarm initiative.

**Global Antibiotic Use in Livestock Could Increase by 30% by 2040, Study Warns**
A new study by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and its partners highlights the importance of improving livestock productivity to reduce the use of antibiotics in the world. Without specific actions, the use of antibiotics in livestock is expected to increase by almost 30% by 2040. However, the study found that strategic productivity gains in animal systems could reduce the expected use of these medicines by half. Reducing the use by 57% The study predicts that, if current trends continue, the global use of antibiotics in livestock could reach 143,481 tons in 2040, representing a 30% increase from 2019. However, if livestock productivity is optimized, the use of antibiotics could be reduced by 57%, to around 62,000 tons. This would involve improving animal health, management practices, and production efficiency. 'Improving the efficiency of livestock production is key to curbing the use of antibiotics,' said Alejandro Acosta, FAO livestock economist and lead author of the study. 'By producing more animal-derived foods with the same number of animals or fewer, we can reduce the need for antibiotics in livestock and strengthen global food security,' he added. A key contribution of the study is the introduction of the biomass conversion method, which improves the accuracy of biomass estimation. This allows for a more precise estimate of antibiotic use intensity, enabling policymakers and other stakeholders to develop more effective strategies. Combating antimicrobial resistance This message highlights global commitments to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The 2024 United Nations General Assembly Declaration on AMR called for a significant reduction in antimicrobial use in agro-food systems by 2030. Achieving this goal poses significant challenges, particularly in regions where livestock production is expanding to meet growing food demand. 'Stakeholders in the livestock sector must work together to improve disease prevention, strengthen monitoring systems, and invest in innovations that improve animal health and reduce dependence on antibiotics,' emphasized Junxia Song, FAO Animal Health Officer and co-author of the study. To support these efforts, the FAO has recently launched the RENOFARM initiative, which provides policy guidance, technical assistance, and training to help countries reduce antibiotic use while promoting sustainable livestock transformation.

**Antibiotic Use in Livestock Farming Could Increase by 30% by 2040**
A recent study published in Nature Communications suggests that the use of antibiotics in livestock farming could increase by nearly 30% by 2040 if no targeted actions are taken to improve animal productivity. However, the researchers from the FAO and the University of Zurich indicate that 'strategic productivity gains in livestock systems could allow for a reduction of up to 57% in the expected use of antibiotics.' These gains could come from improved animal health practices, better production methods, and a greater efficiency in the production process, allowing for a reduction in the number of animals rather than an increase in herds. According to the study, this could lead to a reduction in antibiotic use to 62,000 tonnes per year. Alejandro Acosta, the lead author and an economist at the FAO specializing in livestock, notes that 'by producing more animal-derived foods with the same or fewer number of animal heads, we can reduce the need for antibiotics in livestock while strengthening global food security.' The fight against antibiotic resistance is a major public health issue. In 2024, the world's governments called for a significant reduction in the use of these treatments in agro-food systems through a UN General Assembly declaration.

**Antibiotic Use in Livestock Could Increase by 30% by 2040 Without Action**
A recent study published in Nature Communications suggests that the global use of antibiotics in livestock could increase by 29.5% by 2040, reaching 143,500 tonnes, if no targeted actions are taken to improve animal productivity. However, the researchers from the FAO and the University of Zurich indicate that 'strategic gains in animal productivity in livestock systems could allow for a reduction of up to 57% in the expected use of antibiotics.' These gains could come from actions on animal health, better practices, and increased efficiency in production, allowing for a reduction in the number of heads rather than increasing the number of herds. According to the study, this could bring the use of antibiotics down to 62,000 tonnes per year. Alejandro Acosta, lead author and FAO economist specializing in livestock, emphasizes that 'by producing more animal-derived foods with the same number of animal heads, or even fewer, we can reduce the need for antibiotics in livestock while strengthening global food security.'

**Antibiotic resistance could soon spiral out of control. This could be our last defence**
A new study warns that antibiotic use in livestock could increase by 30% by 2040, threatening human health and global food security. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the top global public health and development threats. The study, led by Alejandro Acosta, estimates that if current trends continue, global antibiotic use in livestock could reach over 143,000 US tons annually by 2040. However, the researchers found that reducing antibiotic use intensity by 30% and improving productivity could offset the expected increase in antibiotic demand. In the most ambitious scenario, a 50% reduction in antibiotic use intensity could lead to a total antibiotic use in livestock of around 62,000 tons a year by 2040. Acosta emphasized that the solution requires a holistic approach, including investment in water systems, education of farmers, and smarter farming practices. 'We are talking about one of the most challenging issues that society will face in the coming years,' Acosta said. 'What will happen if antibiotics stop working? It's a puzzle that needs to be solved - how can we ensure that the health threat doesn't become a reality while continuing to produce food at a price that consumers can afford, especially in developing countries?'

**Experts Raise The Alarm On Misuse Of Antibiotics In Livestock, Fish Farming**
Experts have raised concerns over the misuse of antibiotics in livestock and fish farming in Nigeria, which is contributing to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). According to Dr Sati Ngulukun, a director at the National Veterinary Research Institute, farmers often administer antibiotics to their animals without prescriptions, leading to drug residues in food products. This practice is a major driver of AMR and poses direct health risks to consumers. Dr Ngulukun emphasized the importance of proper guidance and adherence to recommended drug withdrawal periods. A recent study found that 33.3% of commercial layer farms in Nigeria do not comply with proper drug administration guidelines, leading to contamination in eggs. The study also highlighted the risks posed by antibiotic residues in poultry products, including gastrointestinal disturbances, allergic reactions, and antibiotic resistance. Experts recommend urgent measures to mitigate the issue, including stricter regulations on the sale of veterinary drugs and enhanced public education on the risks associated with drug residues. Dr Nafiu Lawal, an expert in Animal Health and Antimicrobial Resistance, suggested the use of prebiotics and probiotics as alternatives to antibiotics in animal farming, which can improve animal health while reducing the overreliance on antibiotics. The Nigerian government has developed two National Action Plans to tackle AMR, including the latest NAP 2.0 (2024 – 2028), which aims to enhance surveillance, promote responsible antibiotic use, and improve infection prevention.
