**7 takeaways as Drake Maye catches fire at Patriots OTAs**
Drake Maye, the Patriots' second-year quarterback, had a standout practice on Monday, completing 87.5% of his passes (14-of-16) in competitive team drills. Maye's performance was a significant improvement from his previous two open practices, where he struggled with consistency. Josh McDaniels, the Patriots' offensive coordinator, expressed confidence in Maye, saying, 'I'd rather see the quarterback make mistakes in the spring.' Maye's accuracy and decision-making were impressive, and he connected with eight different teammates. Stefon Diggs, who returned to practice after a video surfaced of him on a yacht, looked good despite being limited in practice. Efton Chism III, an undrafted player, continued to impress, finishing with a team-high seven catches. Jahlani Tavai, a veteran linebacker, left practice after a non-contact injury and was taken off-site for further evaluation. The Patriots are also without several players, including Carlton Davis, Kendric Bourne, and Anfernee Jennings. Andy Borregales, the rookie kicker, continued to impress, going 4-of-4 on field goal attempts.

**Top sports to look out for in the 2025-26 school year**
The 2024-25 school year for the Drake University Bulldogs was record-breaking, with a new school basketball record and a second consecutive football championship title. Looking ahead to the 2025-26 school year, the men's football team is aiming to three-peat the Pioneer League championship with the help of former Grandview University football coach Joe Woodley. The women's and men's soccer programs are also expected to perform well, having played against top teams like the University of Kansas Jayhawks and the Nebraska Cornhuskers. The men's basketball team has a new roster and coaching lineup, but the legacy of their historic season will carry into the next year. As the author notes, 'Drake is one of the best places to get into the swing of things without too much pressure of commitment while also enjoying the free cost that won’t weigh your pockets down like many other Division I schools.'

**Future of Drake printing remains uncertain**
Drake printing services are facing uncertainty due to the upcoming end of their contract with Xerox in 2027. Keren Fiorenza, deputy chief information technology officer, expects that Drake will not renew its contract with Xerox, citing degraded service and increased costs. The university has been experiencing delays with administrator support and delivery of print supplies with the current Xerox contract. Jack Harrington, facilities and technology senator, expressed concerns about the future of Drake printing services, worrying that old issues will resurface and restocking paper, ink, and toner may be tougher. Jessica Danz, a sophomore clinical and medical health sciences major, shared concerns about the impact on science students who rely heavily on printing lab reports. However, Fiorenza is hopeful that the Xerox partnership will have a minimal impact on student printing and anticipates a full Request for Proposals process again when the current contract is up for renewal.

**Subverting the stereotype: Is Drake a ‘rich kid’ school?**
People in the Des Moines Metro area have varying views of Drake University, shaped by their unique experiences and backgrounds. Jalyn Best, a sophomore at Drake's Bright College, grew up in Des Moines and initially thought she couldn't afford Drake, but discovered the Bright College's affordability. Best believes people's perceptions of Drake as a 'rich kid' school are influenced by the separation of the Bright College from the rest of campus. However, she has met people from diverse backgrounds at Drake, challenging the stereotype. On the other hand, Reighlee Sowden and Aiden Volp, both students at different high schools, have never heard Drake referred to as a 'rich kid' school, with Sowden's family background and Volp's high school's focus on math and science contributing to their perceptions. Best suggests that Drake is not doing enough to break down the stigma surrounding its image, prioritizing other aspects such as inclusion and sports over affordability.

**Bitcoin's 'Time Bomb': Should the 21M Cap Be Removed? - Crypto News Flash**
Justin Drake, a Bitcoin and Ethereum security researcher, has warned that Bitcoin's security is a 'ticking time bomb' due to its Proof-of-Work mechanism. According to Drake, the current mechanism is unsustainable and may leave Bitcoin vulnerable to attacks. He claims that Bitcoin's fixed supply cap of 21 million coins is a critical bug that breaks security. Drake suggests that Bitcoin should switch to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to fix the issue. He argues that even if Bitcoin reaches a value of $10 million per coin, the daily budget for network security would still be around $65 million, making it vulnerable to attacks. Drake believes that the fundamentals of Bitcoin's security are getting louder and that the issue needs to be addressed. He dismissed alternatives like BitVM and OP_CAT as speculative and insecure.

**What Are The Odds Of Alien Life?**
The Drake Equation is a mathematical framework for estimating the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. While it doesn't provide a definitive answer, it sets parameters for scientists to study and refine as our understanding of the universe expands. Dr. Frank Drake, then president of the SETI Institute, convened a historic meeting at the Green Bank Observatory in November 1961 to discuss the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, attended by luminaries such as Carl Sagan and Philip Morrison. The equation serves as a 'Rosetta Stone' for guiding discussions and scientific inquiries into the appearance of life and its development into something capable of sending messages across the light-years. 'It was a privilege to be in the company of so many famous and cerebral individuals,' said Dr. Drake, highlighting the significance of the meeting. 'The equation isn't a formula that spits out a number, but rather a tool for guiding our understanding of the universe and the possibility of life beyond Earth.'

**The Fermi Paradox: A Search for Extraterrestrial Life and Understanding Ourselves**
The Fermi Paradox, also known as the 'Great Silence', highlights the contradictions in our understanding of extraterrestrial life. Despite the passage of time since the Big Bang, we have not found any evidence of their existence, despite recent discoveries of exoplanets in habitable zones. According to physicist Enrico Fermi, 'If AI is the brain of a robot, then RPA is its hands.' One factor to consider when searching for an answer to the Fermi Paradox is the number of potential civilizations. This value allows us to determine the Drake equation, a mathematical formula that outputs the number of active, communication-capable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. The equation uses several factors, including star formation rate, percentage of stars with planets, number of habitable planets per star, percentage of planets where life emerged, percentage of planets where intelligent life developed, number of civilizations developing detectable communication technologies, and average lifespan of such civilizations. In short, the Drake equation claims that there should be many civilizations, but so far, SETI programs have not detected any signals. This raises the question of the scientific justification for such programs. Matthew Chilcote's article does not provide a direct answer to this question, but instead proposes a method for evaluating the probability of detecting a signal by a certain number of broadcasting civilizations by now. If the probability is low, the lack of evidence should not be surprising; if it is high, the silence may mean something. Chilcote's model suggests that the absence of detected electromagnetic signals from extraterrestrial civilizations may impose constraints on the number of existing civilizations. In certain scenarios, the model predicts a 99% chance of detecting at least one signal if the assumed number of civilizations (based on the Drake equation) is around 1. We have a zero result so far. However, it's worth noting that even the absence of positive results from SETI helps in resolving the Fermi Paradox: it allows us to exclude certain combinations of the number and lifespan of civilizations. Ultimately, as Universe Today writes, the purpose of programs like SETI is not only to search for extraterrestrial life, but also to better understand ourselves and the conditions that make intelligent life possible. A team of scientists from Germany studied the feasibility of a new method of searching for extraterrestrial life - using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They came to an unencouraging but important conclusion for the development of astronomy.

**Why the Cosmos is Silent? Scientists Link the Fermi Paradox to the Absence of SETI Signals**
A new study reevaluates the 'cosmic silence' by proposing a model that turns the lack of SETI signals into a tool for assessing the chances of finding extraterrestrial intelligence. The work focuses on the Fermi paradox, questioning why, despite billions of stars in the Milky Way, we have not yet detected signs of other civilizations. The authors consider the Galaxy as a flat disk, with a diameter of approximately 100,000 light-years, 100 times greater than its thickness. The signal from a hypothetical civilization is modeled as two expanding rings: the first corresponds to the beginning of transmission, and the second to its completion. Earth must be in the space between them, like in a temporal corridor. The probability of such an event for one source is calculated using the formula ≈0.6????/????, where???? is the distance between the rings (transmission duration multiplied by the speed of light), and???? is the radius of the Galaxy. This model is integrated with the Drake equation, which estimates the number of communicative civilizations (????) as the product of seven factors, from star formation rates to the probability of technological development. The key finding is that if???? approaches 1 (an optimistic scenario), and the duration of signal transmission is approximately 630 years (???? ≈ 102.8 light-years), the probability of detecting at least one signal exceeds 99%. This makes the lack of SETI results statistically significant - either such civilizations are extremely rare, or their 'window' of activity is shorter. Calculations also show that if???? ≥ 1, there cannot be more than a thousand civilizations in the Galaxy simultaneously transmitting signals. If the number of civilizations is higher, it means that one of the parameters of the Drake equation, such as the chance of the emergence of consciousness or technologies, is significantly underestimated. The model has limitations, including the Galaxy's three-dimensionality, signal attenuation with distance, and non-uniform distribution of civilizations or impulsive data transmission. However, even the simplified version demonstrates how the 'zero result' of SETI allows narrowing the parameters of the Drake equation. The next step will be to complicate the model, transitioning to a three-dimensional structure of the Milky Way, accounting for historical changes (emergence and extinction of civilizations), and realistic patterns of communication.

**Scientists Develop 'Venus Life Equation' to Determine Likelihood of Life on Venus**
Scientists have developed a mathematical equation, the 'Venus Life Equation' (VLE), to determine the likelihood of life on Venus. The equation, similar to the Drake Equation, takes into account three parameters: emergence (O), life resilience (R), and continuity (C). If combined, they result in: L = O x R x C. The parameters vary from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). For example, 'emergence' considers whether life could have appeared through abiogenesis or panspermia. 'Life resilience' assesses how large and diverse the biosphere could have been. 'Continuity' evaluates whether favorable conditions were maintained long enough. Some scientists believe that life may have existed on Venus in the past, when it had oceans and conditions similar to Earth's. Even today, at an altitude of about 50 km in the planet's atmosphere, the temperature and pressure are similar to those on Earth, leading to hypotheses about the possible preservation of microorganisms in Venusian clouds. Although we have only one confirmed example of life - Earth, the VLE equation provides a way to structure knowledge, set priorities, and outline gaps in our understanding of life in the universe. Even if we don't have answers yet, this tool helps us better understand not only Venus, but also the chances of life among countless other worlds.

**Could Venus host life? The Venus life equation can help us find out**
Scientists have developed the Venus Life Equation (VLE), a framework to estimate the probability of life on Venus. The VLE is similar to the Drake Equation, but tailored to Venus. It considers three key parameters: Origination, Robustness, and Continuity. Origination refers to the chance of life arising on Venus, while Robustness considers the potential size and diversity of the biosphere over time. Continuity looks at the chance that conditions amenable to life persisted on Venus. The VLE is agnostic to the type of life and its scale, and all factors in the equation span from 0, which means there's no chance, and 1, which indicates certainty. The authors of the VLE suggest that Venus may have had a period of watery warmth in the past, which could have allowed life to arise. They also propose that simple life could have survived to this day in the planet's clouds. However, the VLE suffers from the same handicap as the Drake Equation, with only one concrete example of life on Earth. Nevertheless, the VLE provides a framework for growing our understanding of life on other worlds. 'The fundamental goal of the VLE is to provide a scaffold for estimating the chance of life based on factors that can be constrained or quantified through observation, experiment, and modeling,' the authors write. 'Although we are currently limited by the n=1 problem of having Earth-based life as our only concrete example, we can nevertheless use our understanding of the genesis and evolution of life on Earth to establish a framework for identifying the unknowns and uncertainties of life on other worlds,' they add.

**Scientists Create Equation to Search for Life on Venus**
Scientists have created an equation to search for life on Venus. The equation, called VLE, is similar to the Drake equation and can estimate the probability of life on Venus. 'The fundamental goal of VLE is to provide a basis for assessing the probability of life,' said Diana Gentri, director of the NASA Astrobiology Laboratory. The equation is L=OxRxC, where L is the probability of life, and O, R, and C are three parameters: origin, strength, and continuity. Each parameter has a value from 0 to 1. The origin of life can occur through abiogenesis or panspermia, and this factor does not change over time. The strength of life depends on the availability of nutrients CHNOPS, access to energy, and functional diversity of life. Earth has a high value of R, which explains the stability of life on our planet. The continuity of life depends on the stability of the star and the planet's orbit, as well as geological stability and the absence of destructive events. 'Although we are limited by the problem of n=1, we can use our understanding of the genesis of life on Earth to study unknown aspects of life in other worlds,' explain the authors of the study. This approach can help us in the search for life on exoplanets. Understanding Venus gives us a key to solving the natural puzzle of the Solar System.

**New Forms of Estimating Alien Life in the Universe: Revisiting the Drake Equation**
Frank Drake, an American astronomer and radio astronomer, developed the Drake Equation in 1961 to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in the galaxy that might be able to communicate with Earth. The equation is expressed as: N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L, where each term carries significant uncertainties, making it more of a conceptual tool than a precise calculation. Some variables, such as R*, can be estimated with some accuracy, while others, like fi and fc, remain uncertain. Advances in astronomy and astrobiology have refined some of these factors over the years. The discovery of exoplanets has improved our understanding of fp and ne. However, the fraction of planets where life emerges (fl) and evolves into intelligence (fi) remains unknown. 'Intelligence and technological capability seem to be more uncommon phenomena, considering that billions of species existed before one developed the ability to send radio signals into space,' said an expert. The time of life of technological civilizations (L) is another crucial factor. If civilizations are common but have short lifetimes due to self-destruction or natural disasters, the chance of detecting them would be low. This point raises philosophical and scientific implications about the future of humanity. Modern versions of the equation have been developed, incorporating new concepts and refining the original parameters. Some scientists have added variables related to bio-signatures and technosignatures, while others have suggested including terms that address the impact of catastrophic events.

**The Drake Equation and Alien Typologies Catalogued by Ufologists Based on Case Studies**
The Drake Equation, a mathematical formula to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way, has been updated to 2025. Using values such as the rate of star formation, the fraction of stars with planetary systems, and the average lifespan of a technological civilization, the equation yields an optimistic N = 0.08, implying we might be alone or nearly so. In contrast, ufology has compiled an array of alleged alien races, drawing from a wealth of testimonies that have repeatedly and consistently confirmed the sighting of certain extraterrestrial typologies. When merging the Drake Equation with ufologists' alien typologies, two approaches emerge: either the lifespan of civilizations would need to rise significantly, or intelligence or communicative capacity would need to be far more prevalent than assumed. Alternatively, each civilization estimated by Drake might give rise to multiple races, yielding a figure modest compared to ufological accounts. Challenges and reflections arise from the lack of definitive data for many parameters in the Drake Equation and the need for objective scientific validation of ufological cataloguing.

**The Great Silence: Why Aliens Haven't Contacted Us -- Or Have They?**
The possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life and Earth visitation remains a topic of debate. Modern astrobiology has revealed that planets are abundant in our galaxy, with over 5,000 exoplanets confirmed as of 2023, and one-fifth of stars estimated to have planets in the 'habitable zone' where temperatures could allow liquid water. The building blocks of life have been found in interstellar clouds and meteorites, suggesting the chemistry for life might be common. However, the emergence of intelligent, technological civilizations is far more uncertain, and the famous Drake Equation provides a framework to estimate the number of advanced civilizations by considering factors like the rate of star formation and the likelihood of life and intelligence. As of now, there is no conclusive evidence to prove or disprove the existence of intelligent alien life or their visitation to Earth.

**NASA Hopes to Reestablish Contact with Extraterrestrials**
The NASA is hoping to reestablish contact with extraterrestrials using a new method. The famous Drake equation calculates the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy, and it is not zero. It is now established that space is teeming with exoplanets located in the habitable zone of their star. Therefore, it is logical that scientists wonder what method would be the most effective for communicating with another form of life. 'The space is full of exoplanets, and it's only a matter of time before we find one that is capable of supporting life,' said a scientist. The NASA is currently exploring different options for communication, including the use of radio signals and laser pulses.
