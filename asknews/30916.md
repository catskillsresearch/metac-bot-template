**Ukraine's Real Estate Market: Prices Expected to Rise in 2025**
Despite the ongoing war, economic instability, and complex situation in the construction sector, the demand for apartments in Ukraine continues to grow. Developers report a 'high' interest in new buildings and predict further price increases. According to forecasts, the demand for apartments in new buildings will continue to rise, and this will likely be accompanied by an increase in prices. A decrease in prices is not expected. As stated by the managing partner of the DIM group, Alexander Nasikovsky, in 2024, prices for business- and premium-class apartments in the company's projects increased by 10-15%, and in the comfort class segment - up to 10%. In 2025, further growth is expected, by 10-15% depending on the class of real estate. 'We expect further growth in prices by 10-15% depending on the class of real estate,' said Nasikovsky. The company RIEl also reports an increase in the cost of apartments in new buildings, within the range of 15-20%. The largest price increase is expected in western Ukraine, particularly in Lviv, where the cost of a square meter may approach the level of Kiev, said Rostislav Melnik from RIEl. Some developers are holding back on price increases, despite economic conditions. The company ENSO stated: 'From an economic point of view, we would have already increased prices. But the question is, is the market ready? Most likely, the market will delay price increases, and we will increase prices when demand picks up. We won't be able to avoid price increases, it's just that it will be later.'

**US new-home sales jump to highest since 2022 as prices fall**
US new-home sales rose unexpectedly in April to 743,000 annual rate, the highest level since February 2022, driven by builder incentives and lower prices. The gain was led by the South and Midwest, with sales increasing by 12% and 35% respectively. However, the optimism was tempered by sharp downward revisions to the prior three months and a lack of dent in the inventory of homes. Experts, such as Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, believe that the jump in new-home sales is a 'statistical illusion' and that a downward trend in sales is likely to emerge over coming months. Builders are helping to cushion the blow with greater use of sales incentives and cutting prices, but prospects for the residential real estate market remain clouded due to persistent affordability challenges. The median sales price decreased 2% from a year ago to $407,200, reflecting greater activity in more moderately priced homes.

**Warren Buffet's brokerage reveals the best time to purchase a home**
Warren Buffett's real estate company, Berkshire Hathaway Home Services, predicts a market revival in the second half of 2025, citing lower mortgage rates and more affordable home prices. According to Berkshire Hathaway, the best time to buy a home could be in Q3 2025, as house showings tend to increase during the tail end of the summer months. However, the current housing market has been labeled a 'dud' by Redfin, with existing home sales dropping 5.9 percent between February and March 2025. The National Association of Realtors forecasts that mortgage rates will average 6.4 percent in 2025 and dip to 6.1 percent in 2026. Despite this, NAR predicts existing home sales will rise by 6 percent in 2025 to 11 percent in 2026. Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, warns that the big picture still is one of a very subdued housing market, and five metro areas are seriously at risk of a housing market crash in 2025.

**Real estate experts make U-turn on 2025 housing prediction**
Real estate experts have made a U-turn on their 2025 housing prediction, expecting home prices to drop by 0.9% on average in the US between April 2025 and April 2026, according to Zillow's 12-month forecast. This is a reversal from their earlier prediction of a 2.9% increase. The pandemic-era property boom is leveling out due to a rise in listings, providing more options and bargaining power for buyers. Zillow's chief economist, Skylar Olsen, said, 'Affordability is still challenging buyers... A 20 percent down payment now comes out to around $72,000 on the average home. That's a steep entry fee.' Some metros predicted to see big price falls include Greenville, MS (-16.2%), Cleveland, MS (-12.5%), and Raymondville, TX (-12.1%). Florida and Louisiana are also expected to see home prices drop, while Texas will see property prices decline in certain areas. Zillow expects the strongest home price appreciation to happen in Atlantic City, NJ, at 3.2%.

**Ravenna Real Estate Market Expected to be Positive in 2025**
The real estate market in Ravenna, Italy is expected to be positive in 2025, despite a decrease in the number of property transactions in 2024. According to a report by FIMAA, the number of property transactions is expected to decrease by 0.7% in smaller municipalities and 5% in the city of Ravenna compared to 2023. However, property prices are expected to increase by 2.8% in the city of Ravenna and decrease by 0.2% in the Alta Pianura del Lamone and Bassa Romagna areas. The demand for residential properties with hybrid work and living spaces is increasing, as well as interest in sustainable and energy-efficient homes. The young population is a significant part of the real estate market, but the increase in property prices and interest rates has made it difficult for them to access property, leading to an increase in the rental market. The family segment continues to be a significant part of the real estate market, with a focus on larger homes and proximity to services. The trend towards using second homes as primary residences is also increasing, driven by changes in work and lifestyle habits. The real estate market in Ravenna is expected to have a positive trend in the coming years, with a significant increase in prices and sales volumes. However, it will be a market with a more informed and selective buyer, requiring a high level of professionalism from real estate agents.

**Home prices forecast to dip before the end of the year**
The US housing market is expected to dip in 2025, with a 1% year-over-year drop in median US home-sale price projected by Q4 2025, according to Redfin. The market is being reshaped by elevated mortgage rates, rising inventory, and economic uncertainty, leading to higher inventory levels and price cuts. Redfin agents suggest offering under asking price or requesting seller-paid concessions like rate buydowns or repair credits. Experts warn that waiting too long to buy may not yield better deals, and sellers are advised to list competitively from the start to avoid price cuts and slow traffic. 'Even though we advise them to list at today’s market value, a lot of them decide to list high to recoup their money,' said Redfin Premier agent Corey Stambaugh. 'But those sellers face reality once their home has been sitting for a couple weeks without any offers.' Redfin’s head of economics research, Chen Zhao, added, 'We know there’s room to negotiate right now, so that’s the best way to take advantage of the changing market.'

**The big house price winners and losers, as value soars by £45,000 in one area**
House prices in the UK have increased on average by 6.4% in the last year, with some areas seeing significant gains and others experiencing significant losses. According to new figures from HM Land Registry, the biggest winner is Redbridge, where house prices have increased by £44,807, or 9%, while the biggest loser is the City of Westminster, where prices have decreased by £181,776, or 20%. Experts believe that house prices are likely to rise further this year due to the prospect of more Bank of England base rate cuts. Tom Evans, sales director at Purplebricks, said, 'While the stamp duty changes that came into force from April 1 may not be felt quite yet, the prospect of more Bank of England base rate cuts will likely fuel demand and push up prices further this year - suggesting 2025 will be a strong year for the UK housing market.' Robert Nichols, managing director of Purplebricks Mortgages, added, 'The downward trend in mortgage rates will fuel further interest in the market, meaning more for sale signs and more opportunities for that first foot on the ladder - making 2025 a great year for first-time buyers.'

**Real Estate More Profitable than Gold, Says 'Tatweer Misr' CEO**
According to Dr. Ahmed Shalaby, the CEO of 'Tatweer Misr' and member of the advisory committee for the Council of Ministers for Urban Development and Real Estate Export, the company conducted a 10-year study comparing the best investment options, including gold, real estate, and the US dollar. Shalaby stated that gold prices increased by 1750%, while the prices of villas in the Mont Jala project in Ain Sukhna increased by 1760%, and the prices of units increased by 1200%. In contrast, the prices of units in the North Coast increased by 1250%, and the US dollar increased by 642%. Shalaby added that in the last 5 years, gold prices increased by 700%, the dollar by 260%, and residential units in the Bloomfields project by 700%. He emphasized that real estate remains a safe haven for investment. Shalaby predicted that real estate prices will increase by 20-30% in 2025, compared to 100% in 2024. He attributed the increase in real estate prices to several economic factors, including rising construction costs and land prices, increased interest rates, and high inflation rates. Shalaby stated that the current pricing of units is reasonable and not exaggerated, due to ongoing changes that affect the final product price.

**Housing Prices Expected to Rise in 2025: A Favorable Time to Sell?**
The real estate market is showing no signs of slowing down. After a 2024 that saw a 8.4% increase in free housing prices, according to data from the INE, 2025 is expected to be another year of growth, albeit at a more moderate pace, with an estimated increase of around 5%. Before considering selling a property, it's essential to understand its value with maximum precision. HOMLI, an online platform, offers a free and quick way to value your property using a team of professionals and AI-based technology. Bankinter predicts a 5% increase in housing prices in 2025 and 3% in 2026, while S&P Global Ratings forecasts a 4.5% increase in prices this year, one of the highest in Europe. The current trend shows a 7.67% interannual increase in the average price of completed housing (new and used) in the first quarter of 2025, according to TINSA data. Several factors are driving up housing prices, including a growing demand and limited supply, particularly in large urban centers and coastal areas. Additionally, low interest rates, increased foreign investment, and a lack of new construction are all contributing to the upward pressure on prices. With favorable conditions for selling a property, including high prices, high demand, and limited competition, it's a good time to sell. However, to sell quickly and efficiently, it's recommended to use professional services like those offered by HOMLI, which has helped over 10,000 clients sell or rent their properties since its arrival in 2021.

**Lagging construction might mean rent will rise in the US**
According to the Realtor.com February rent report, the US is facing a shortage of new housing supply, with only 294,000 multifamily units issued a construction permit in 2024, down from the pandemic peak of 318,000 units in 2020. This reduction in new housing supply is expected to create upward pressure on rental prices in markets already experiencing growth. Danielle Hale, Chief Economist of Realtor.com, said, 'During the pandemic, rent prices surged significantly. While there has been a gradual correction, the current trend of declining rents over the past 19 months and a still-sizable number of multi-family units under construction have impacted builders' enthusiasm for new projects.' The report also highlighted that in markets where permitting activity increased, rents typically declined. Despite concerns about federal layoffs potentially affecting rental markets, the impact remains limited so far. The data also reveals that larger rental units continue to see strong demand, with two-bedroom units experiencing the most significant long-term growth over five years at 18.3 per cent. The national median rent stood at $1,691 in February 2025, representing a slight decline of 0.9 per cent year-over-year but a substantial 14.4 per cent increase over the past five years. Ms Hale added, 'The nation is short 3.8 million homes according to Realtor.com research. As builders attempt to right-size their construction pipelines amid shifting economic and policy cross currents, multifamily builders nationwide have made headway, evidenced by vacancy rates trending up. Still, the shortfall varies by market and region, and the low level of permitting for multifamily housing, particularly in markets where rents are still climbing, may become a catalyst for future rent growth.'

**Real Estate Portals Predict Continued Price Increase in 2025**
The three main real estate portals, Idealista, Fotocasa, and Pisos.com, attribute the increase in home sales in 2024 to the change in the European Central Bank's (BCE) interest rate policy, which led to a decrease in interest rates. According to the data from the National Institute of Statistics (INE), there were 641,900 transactions in 2024, a 10% increase from the previous year, making it the second-best year since 2007. María Matos, director of Studies at Fotocasa, stated that factors such as optimism and confidence among buyers, combined with an increase in household savings and more attractive mortgage conditions, have made 2024 a 'very dynamic' year. Matos highlighted the number of new home sales, which increased by 23.4% and reached 135,052 units, the highest figure since 2013. However, she warned that if demand continues to be high, it could lead to a significant price increase. Ferran Font, director of Studies at Pisos.com, also emphasized that the new home market is where the price increase is most noticeable, although he also mentioned the second-hand market, which increased by around 7% and accounted for 79% of the activity in 2024. Francisco Iñareta, spokesperson for Idealista, explained that the data shows the 'push' that the BCE's policy change has given to many families, a trend that may continue throughout 2025. All three portals agree that the increase in home sales will lead to a higher demand for purchases, which will put more pressure on the supply and cause prices to continue rising in 2025. 'Probably the reduction of interest rates will indirectly cause a new increase in housing prices by attracting more demand to the market,' said Matos. Matos and Font also warned that, although there may be improvements in mortgage conditions in 2025, they may not be enough to counteract the rapid increase in housing values. Iñareta added that the 'buying appetite' is occurring in an environment of increasingly reduced supply, which is causing tensions in prices that are likely to continue or even accelerate in the coming months.

**Why US Housing Prices Are Rising While European Prices Are Falling**
The US housing market has shown a sustained growth in the last months of 2024, while the European market was expected to decline. According to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index, US home prices increased by 3.8% annually in November 2024, compared to 3.6% in October. However, the prospects for 2025 remain uncertain, as rising mortgage rates in the US could cool the market, while the accommodative policy of the ECB seems to be helping the European housing market to recover. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index is a key indicator of the residential real estate market in the US, measuring the variation of home prices in 20 major metropolitan areas. The recent growth of 3.8% annually indicates a strengthening of demand for the entire 2024. However, the latest readings are concerning some experts, as the decline of 0.18% monthly compared to September 2024 suggests a possible slowdown. The answer lies in mortgage rates. The impact of mortgage rates on the US housing market is critical, as they have increased significantly, reaching 7% in January 2025, the highest level since mid-2024. A high mortgage rate directly affects the ability of buyers to purchase, increasing the cost of financing and reducing purchasing power. If we consider a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $400,000, an increase in rates from 4% to 7% would result in an increase in the monthly payment from approximately $1,900 to $2,660, a significant impact on family budgets. Consequently, a sustained growth in rates could translate into a contraction in demand, with negative effects on home prices in the medium term. In Europe, the housing market is expected to show a positive growth, reaching a value of $180.90 trillion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.86% from 2025 to 2029. The European market has faced similar difficulties in the past, including high mortgage rates and a contraction in home prices. However, a distinctive feature between the European and US housing markets is the divergence in monetary policies of central banks. While the Federal Reserve has maintained rates unchanged, the European Central Bank has continued to cut rates to support the economy. This scenario generates a double effect: on the one hand, the growth of the European GDP is expected to be below 1%, which could reduce housing demand, on the other hand, the reduction of rates makes credit more accessible, stimulating the housing market and potentially supporting prices. Investors can participate in the housing market without directly acquiring properties by investing in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) or related ETFs. REITs are companies that own, manage, or finance income-producing real estate. Investors can buy shares of a REIT, gaining exposure to the housing market without having to physically acquire properties. There are various ETFs that offer exposure to REITs on a global scale, such as the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ), the iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR), and the iShares European Property Yield UCITS ETF (IPRP). The dividend yield is a key element to evaluate REITs, as it measures the dividend return relative to the stock price. In recent years, REITs have offered attractive yields: VNQ with a dividend yield of 4.2%, IYR with a 3.8%, and IPRP with a 2.77%. While the US housing market has shown growth in 2024, the prospects for 2025 remain uncertain due to rising mortgage rates. In Europe, the situation is diametrically opposite: in 2025, the European market has suffered, and 2025 may leave room for a new growth, influenced by the divergence in monetary policies. While the ECB facilitates credit by adopting an expansive policy, the Fed remains anchored to the concept of 'higher for longer'. A method to follow the housing market trend could be to monitor the growth prospects of the dividend of these tickers to have a clear idea of the underlying market trend.

**Real Estate Investment Trend Shifts to Housing**
In the real estate investment market, the trend has shifted from land and agricultural investments to housing. According to TÜİK data, in 2024, non-residential real estate (land-agricultural) sales decreased by 8% compared to 2023, reaching 1,588,000, while housing sales increased by 20.6% to 1,478,025. Experts predict that housing sales will continue to rise in 2025. The decrease in land sales is attributed to the limited decrease in credit interest rates and the revitalization of the housing market. Experts also believe that the trend is driven by discounts, long-term payment plans, and additional benefits offered by developers. The increasing demand for branded housing projects and the decrease in bank interest rates, as well as the affordability of housing prices, are also contributing factors. According to experts, 2025 will also be a year for housing, with a greater demand for branded housing projects in large cities. However, they also predict that the decline in land and agricultural investments will continue. Experts note that, following the pandemic, people who wanted to buy a house invested in small plots of land and saved money. They also point out that, after this surge in demand, a 500 m² plot of land in areas near Istanbul became equivalent in price to a 2+1 apartment. On the other hand, the increasing activity in housing sales has also led to an increase in scams. Real estate experts have reported that fake listings are being made for sold properties, and they have called on the Ministry of Commerce to make the 'Authority Verification System' applicable to sold properties as well.

**65% of agents predict house prices will rise in 2025: CoreLogic**
A new survey by CoreLogic has found that 65% of real estate agents predict house prices will rise in 2025, driven by improving affordability, rising incomes, and potential cuts to interest rates. CoreLogic's head of research, Eliza Owen, noted that the responses reflect the outlook shared by CoreLogic and many leading economic commentators. Owen said, 'Agents are at the coal face of turning sentiment, whether it’s lackluster auction bidding, sparse open homes, or reduced enquiry levels.' The survey also found that over 40% of agents predict prices will increase between 1% and 5% in 2025, while 25% estimate price increases in excess of 5%. Owen noted that the economic recovery in late 2024 has 'laid the groundwork for increased buyer activity in the year ahead', but cautioned that the recovery pace is likely to be more modest compared to the 4.9% value growth in 2024. Despite some softening in the market in early 2025, Owen expects conditions to pick up later in the year alongside lower interest rates, higher real income growth, and improved affordability.

**Real Estate Sector Expects Continued Upward Trend in 2025**
The real estate sector expects to continue the upward trend in 2025, with a predicted 650,000 transactions. According to CaixaBank, this is due to a combination of factors, including the reduction of interest rates by the European Central Bank, which has allowed families to recover their purchasing power, and the expectation that prices will continue to rise. The number of transactions has already increased by 8.1% year-on-year between January and November 2024, reaching 628,000 units in the 12-month period. Experts predict that the trend will continue, with the number of transactions expected to reach 650,000 in 2025, similar to the record set in 2022. However, the new supply of housing is expected to remain below the number of new households created, which could lead to a slowdown in price growth. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Agenda's price indicator is expected to grow by 5.9% in 2025, while the INE's price index is expected to grow by 8.5% in 2024 and 7.2% in 2025. Despite this, the good behavior of household incomes will prevent the emergence of imbalances that could affect prices at the aggregate level. However, the problem of accessibility in large cities remains evident, and the behavior of housing prices will continue to be conditioned by the mismatch between supply and demand.

**Housing Prices to Increase in 2025 Due to Lack of Supply**
According to CaixaBank Research, the creation of new housing will remain below the formation of new households in 2025, leading to a price increase similar to that of 2024. The lack of supply is the bottleneck that prevents prices from falling, and in 2025, it seems that it will remain the same. The new forecasts for the Spanish real estate sector predict that the number of new construction permits will improve to 135,000, but the new housing supply will likely remain below the new households created, maintaining the growth of housing prices in similar figures to those observed in 2024. CaixaBank Research expects the Ministry of Housing's price index (valuation value) to grow by 5.6% and 5.9% in 2024 and 2025, respectively. For the INE's price index (transaction price), they predict increases of 8.5% in 2024 and 7.2% in 2025. The ratio of accessibility, resulting from dividing the price of a representative home by the gross income of a median household, is expected to increase slightly to 7.5 in 2025, similar to the level of 2022. However, this is still far from the maximum of 9.4 reached in 2007. Despite the increase in difficulties accessing a home, sales are not expected to slow down this year. According to the report, the factors that drove demand in 2024 will continue to be present in 2025, including the ECB's interest rate cuts, the recovery of household income, and population growth.

**December Existing-Home Sales a Promising Sign for 2025 Housing Market, Expert Says**
The US existing home sales ended 2024 on a strong note, with a promising sign for 2025, according to real estate professionals. The median existing price increased by 6 percent from December 2023, to $404,000, and the inventory of unsold homes decreased by 13.5 percent from the previous month. 'This is a promising sign for 2025, suggesting that the housing market's most challenging period may now be behind us,' said Evangelou. The Northeast saw the highest gain in sales growth at 3.9 percent, while the West continued to boast the highest median sales price at $614,500. However, Evangelou predicts that the market will stabilize as housing inventory improves, but it will likely remain a seller's market in most areas of the country. 'At the national level, we don't anticipate any home price drop this year,' she said. 'However, local markets struggling with weak affordability conditions may continue to see a slowdown in home price growth.'
