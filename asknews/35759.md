**More Americans file for unemployment help but layoffs remain low despite uncertainty over tariffs**
Despite economic uncertainty over global trade, jobless benefits applications in the US rose by 14,000 to 240,000 for the week ending May 24, according to the Labor Department. However, American workers remain secure in their jobs, with the unemployment rate holding at a healthy 4.2% and employers adding a strong 177,000 jobs in April. The Labor Department reported that the four-week average of jobless claims ticked down by 250 to 230,750, and the total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits increased by 26,000 to 1.92 million, the most since November 2021. Fed chair Jerome Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment, and the potential for both higher unemployment and inflation are elevated. However, the labor market remains robust, with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.

**Trump Revives Push To Make Federal Workers At-Will: 'One Misstep And You Could Be Gone,' Warns SSA Veteran**
The Trump administration has revived efforts to reclassify federal employees as at-will workers, stripping job protections that career civil servants currently enjoy. The proposed Office of Personnel Management rule would make government workers easier to fire, similar to Corporate America standards. According to the proposed OPM rule, 'This will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process.' A 30-year SSA veteran warned, 'Since you are a political appointee, you could also just be let go with little or no protection. So one misstep and you could be gone.' The initiative follows broader restructuring efforts, including a U.S. District Judge's block on mass federal layoffs affecting approximately 260,000 federal workers.

**Nahles: 'The real problem is the too high part-time rate'**
The current job market is experiencing a low level of enthusiasm, according to the head of the Federal Agency for Work, Nahles. However, she does not believe that the reason for this is that people are working too little. Nahles stated, 'The real problem is the too high part-time rate.' She emphasized that Germany has a high employment rate and many overtime hours are still being worked. The German Trade Union Federation (DGB) is calling for more training to help mitigate the transformation in the industry. Nahles plans to discuss how to close the budget gap at the Federal Agency for Work in the next week's budget committee meeting. She ruled out an increase in contributions to the unemployment insurance fund for 2025 and 2026. The DGB is calling for more qualifications, not fewer, to help people adapt to changing jobs. According to Nahles, the main issue is the high part-time rate, which is a significant obstacle to economic growth. She pointed out that Germany has a high employment rate for women, but they work fewer hours than in other European countries. Nahles believes that if women were to work more hours, it could lead to significant economic growth. However, the main challenge remains the lack of skilled workers in many professions. A study by the Federal Agency for Work found that there are shortages in 163 out of 1,200 evaluated professions. This is a decrease from the previous year, but still a significant issue. Nahles stated, 'The decline in shortage professions is not surprising given the weak economic situation.' The shortage professions include healthcare and social work, as well as construction and skilled trades. There are currently 634,000 open job postings at the Federal Agency for Work, a decrease of 67,000 from the previous year. The agency is also expecting a shortage of skilled workers in the coming year, with 441,000 apprenticeship positions available, but 28,000 fewer than the previous year.

**Employment Stagnates in April 2025**
According to the German Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), approximately 45.8 million people were employed in Germany in April 2025. This number remained unchanged from the previous month, seasonally adjusted. However, when not seasonally adjusted, the number of employed individuals increased by 77,000 people (+0.2%) compared to March 2025. This growth was less pronounced than the average increase of 99,000 people in April of the years 2022-2024. Compared to April 2024, the number of employed individuals decreased by 61,000 people (-0.1%). The unemployment rate in April 2025 was 3.8%, an increase of 0.6 percentage points from the previous year. The number of unemployed individuals was 1.66 million, a 256,000 person or 18.2% increase from April 2024. 'The labor market trend has been stable since November 2024, with a slight downward trend in the year-over-year comparison,' said the report.

**Latest Employment Figures Show Economy Going Strong**
The latest employment figures show the American economy is going strong. The Labor Department reported 228,000 jobs were added in November, beating estimates of 200,000 jobs. This marks the 86th consecutive month of job growth, with employers on track to add about two million jobs in 2017. The transportation and warehousing sector added 10,500 jobs, while construction posted job gains of 24,000. Wage growth is also picking up, with average earnings up 2.5 percent over the past year. Economists expect wage growth to continue as unemployment falls. A $1.5 trillion tax cut plan is on the verge of passing, which could provide a modest lift to the economy, but also raise interest rates faster than planned if it pushes up inflation.

**US news: Jobless claims rise, layoffs remain low, economy contracts 0.2% | Today News**
US jobless claims rose by 14,000 to 240,000 in the week ended May 24, but workers remain secure in their jobs. The US Labor Department reported that the total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits rose by 26,000 to 1.92 million. The economy contracted 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, but the labor market remains strong with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs. The Trump administration's tariffs have caused economic uncertainty, but a US federal court blocked some of the tariffs, bringing relief to financial markets. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that the potential for both higher unemployment and inflation are elevated, complicating the central bank's dual mandate.

**Production Calendar for 2025: How We Work and Rest**
The Russian Ministry of Labor has published a project of the decree on the transfer of holiday weekends. According to the project, in 2025, Russians will have long New Year's and May holidays, as well as four consecutive weekends in June. The regions have the right to establish their additional non-working holidays, for example, related to religious holidays. The production calendar of Russia for 2025 includes all working, weekend, and holiday days. It is formed on the basis of relevant government decrees (which, for example, contain information about the transfer of weekends) and taking into account all requirements of the current labor legislation. The production calendar not only allows employees to know how long a rest awaits them in honor of a particular holiday, but also helps accountants or personnel departments to calculate salaries, fill out time sheets, create vacation schedules, calculate vacation pay, etc. In the first quarter, there will be no additional weekends related to Defender of the Fatherland Day and International Women's Day, as these holidays have been transferred to other months. In the second quarter, there will be four days off on May 1st, and the holidays related to Victory Day will last for four days. In July, August, and September, there are no official holiday weekends, making these months suitable for taking paid vacation, as the vacation pay is calculated by calendar days, and the salary is calculated by working days. In November, there will be three consecutive weekends (2, 3, and 4 November), and November 1st will be a reduced working day. According to the Labor Code, in Russia, the following are non-working holidays: January 1 - New Year (January 1-8); January 7 - Christmas; February 23 - Defender of the Fatherland Day; March 8 - International Women's Day; May 1 - Spring and Labor Day; May 9 - Victory Day; June 12 - Russia Day; November 4 - People's Unity Day. The law allows for the transfer of weekends and holidays to other days by federal law or government decree. In 2025, several holidays will be transferred: 'The norm of working time in 2025 is 1,972 hours for a 40-hour week, 1,774.4 hours for a 36-hour week, and 1,181.6 hours for a 24-hour week. Compared to 2024, in 2025, Defender of the Fatherland Day and International Women's Day fall on Sunday and Saturday, respectively. The weekends related to these holidays have been transferred to May and June. In June, Russians will have four consecutive days off: June 12, 13, 14, and 15.'

Despite economic uncertainty over global trade, American workers remain secure in their jobs. Jobless benefits applications rose by 14,000 to 240,000 for the week ending May 24, but this is still within a historically healthy range. Analysts had forecast 226,000 new applications. The Labor Department said that the U.S. economy shrank at a 0.2% annual pace in the first quarter of 2025, but growth was slowed by a surge in imports. Jerome Powell, Fed chair, said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment, and that the potential for both higher unemployment and inflation are elevated. The labor market remains robust, with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs. The government reported that U.S. employers added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate held at a healthy 4.2%.

**New DWP PIP eligibility rules to spare nearly 700,000 claimants - The Mirror**
The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is set to introduce new eligibility criteria and assessments for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) in November 2026, affecting both new and current claimants. However, Minister for Social Security and Disability Sir Stephen Timms has assured that people of State Pension age will remain untouched by these reforms. According to recent statistics, approximately 690,186 people aged between 65 and 79 are currently in receipt of PIP, with 2,492 residing in Scotland. Sir Stephen stated, 'Our intention is that the new eligibility requirement in Personal Independence Payment (PIP) will apply to new claims and award reviews from November 2026, subject to parliamentary approval.' He also confirmed that people facing end-of-life will continue to have access to the enhanced rate of the daily living component of PIP and the fast-track route under the Special Rules for End of Life. The proposed package of reforms aims to overhaul the welfare system and includes new measures to ensure the benefit's sustainability for future generations.

**Bloomberg: US Federal Workforce May Shrink by 1.2 Million**
According to a Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta analysis, the number of federal employees in the US may decrease by over 1 million people, mainly due to the planned reduction of those indirectly employed by the government through contracts and grants, as reported by Bloomberg. M. Melinda Pitts, a scientist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, wrote in a blog post, 'Given the number of federal employees, a decline in employment levels could have a significant impact on labor market outcomes.' President Donald Trump initiated a large-scale reduction of federal employees across the country in an attempt to reduce waste and government spending. Pitts believes that these measures, along with hiring freezes and early retirement options, could reduce the total federal workforce, including employees working on contracts and grants, by 1.2 million people. In late 2024, before the implementation of these programs, over 2.4 million people were directly employed by the federal government, according to the study. However, by February 2025, more than 8 million people were either directly or indirectly working for the federal government through contracts and grants, significantly expanding the circle of employees who may be affected by the cuts, as stated in the analysis. Pitts cited data from the website layoffs.fyi, which reported that as of April 1, 136,621 federal employees had been laid off, and an additional 170,214 employees were planned to be let go.

**US Employment Statistics: 228,000 New Jobs in March, Unemployment Rate Rises**
According to the US Labor Department's report on March employment statistics, the number of non-agricultural sector employees increased by 228,000 from the previous month, exceeding market expectations of 135,000. However, the unemployment rate worsened to 4.2% from 4.1% in the previous month. The number of employees in the transportation and warehousing sector increased by 22,900, while the leisure and hospitality sector also saw an increase of 43,000, turning from a decrease in the previous month. In contrast, the federal government sector decreased by 4,000, continuing the trend of decline. The pace of increase in February's employment numbers was revised downward from 151,000 to 117,000. The unemployment rate has reached its highest level since November 2024, exceeding market expectations. The Federal Reserve has maintained its policy interest rate for two consecutive meetings, and market expectations are strong that it will also do so at the next meeting in May.

**Fewer Americans file for jobless benefits last week as labor market...**
The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell to 219,000 for the week ending March 29, down 6,000 from the previous week. This is within the same range as recent years. However, economists are concerned about a potential global economic slowdown following the Trump administration's announcement of widespread tariff hikes. The federal government has also announced plans to downsize its workforce, which could lead to job cuts. According to the Labor Department, the federal government shed 10,000 jobs in February, the most since June 2022. Other federal agencies, including the IRS, Small Business Administration, and Department of Education, have also announced layoffs or are planning cuts. Despite this, the labor market remains healthy with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs. The government reported that U.S. employers added 151,000 jobs in February, and analysts forecast a 130,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls in March. The four-week average of applications fell by 1,250 to 223,000, and the total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits increased by 56,000 to 1.9 million, the most since November 2021. As one economist noted, 'it's not clear when the job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or 'DOGE,' will surface in the weekly layoffs data, but some economists have suggested they could show up in the Labor Department's March jobs report, which comes out Friday.'

**US Employers Reduce Hiring Plans, Federal Layoffs Surge**
Employers in the US reduced their hiring plans last month, while federal government layoffs increased to their highest level in over four years, according to new labor market data released on Tuesday. The number of job openings, a measure of labor market demand, fell to 7.57 million in February, according to the JOLTS report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said, 'Federal layoffs are starting to appear in the data, and there's more to come.' Allison Shrivastava, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, added, 'It's just static.' The report shows that the sector with the largest increase in layoffs was the federal government, which saw layoffs increase to 22,000 from 4,000 in January, marking the highest monthly total since November 2020. Economists have warned that the early 2025 labor market data, which has shown slow but solid job gains, may be 'the calm before the storm.' They expect Trump's rapid policy actions, including drastic reductions in federal workforce, to extend to the private sector, potentially stifling growth there and in the US economy as a whole.

**Axing government jobs**
The US government has been cutting its workforce, with an estimated 30,000 federal workers fired and 75,000 accepting resignation offers, as part of a plan to save $2 trillion. The number of federal workers has risen steadily over the years, with 3 million employed as of November 2024. In contrast, the Philippine government employs approximately 1.6 million career civil servants, with an additional number of non-career and contractual staff. The author argues that the Philippine government's staffing is bloated and inefficient, with 29.4% of the national budget allocated to personnel services in 2024. The author suggests that cutting excess fat in the government could be achieved by abolishing the Senate and reducing the number of congressmen, which could save at least P1 trillion. The author also notes that the Philippine national debt is approaching P20 trillion, making it an explosive problem that must be addressed.

**US economy adds fewer jobs than expected in January as unemployment falls**
The US economy added 143,000 jobs in January, falling short of the expected 170,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 4% as the government revised November and December payrolls higher. Average hourly wages rose by 0.5% from December and 4.1% from January 2024, which may be concerning for inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve. Economists are worried about President Donald Trump's plan to impose a federal hiring freeze and his threat to wage a trade war against other countries, which could lead to higher tariffs and rekindle inflation. This could cause the Federal Reserve to cancel or postpone interest-rate cuts, which would be bad for economic growth and job creation. The job market has cooled from the red-hot days of 2021-2023, with American payrolls increasing by 2.2 million last year, down from 3 million in 2023. Employers are posting fewer jobs, and the number of people quitting has fallen from a record 4.5 million to 3.2 million, below pre-pandemic levels. Bradley Saunders, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote that the federal hiring freeze is a 'negative for employment growth.'

US employers added 143,000 jobs in January, a decrease from the 263,000 added in November and 307,000 in December. The jobless rate fell to 4% as the labor market cools from the red-hot hiring days of 2021-2023. Average hourly wages rose by 0.5% from December and 4.1% from January 2024, which may be disappointing to inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve. Economists are concerned about President Donald Trump's plan to impose a federal hiring freeze and his threat to wage a trade war against other countries, which could rekindle inflation and impact economic growth and job creation. The job market has already lost momentum, with American payrolls increasing by 2 million last year, down from 2.6 million in 2023 and 4.6 million in 2022. Monthly job openings have tumbled from a record 12.2 million in March 2022, to 7.6 million in December. As the labor market cools, American workers are losing confidence in their ability to find better pay or working conditions by changing jobs, with the number of people quitting falling from a record 4.5 million in April 2022, to 3.2 million in December.

**US Job Openings Decrease in December, Indicating Slowdown in Labor Market**
The number of job openings in the United States decreased in December, indicating a slowdown in the labor market, but still indicating a healthy job market. According to the Department of Labor, the number of job openings fell to 7.6 million, compared to 8.2 million in November. This decline is a reversal of the 8.9 million job openings in the same month last year and the peak of 12.2 million in March 2022, when the economy was recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of layoffs also decreased, reflecting an unusual level of job security among Americans. Despite the slowdown in the US labor market compared to 2021-2023, employment remains strong. Employers added 186,000 jobs per month in 2024 until November, a lower number than 251,000 in 2023, 377,000 in 2022, and 604,000 in 2021. A report from the Department of Labor on January jobs, to be released on Friday, is expected to show a larger slowdown in employment to 160,000, compared to 256,000 in the previous month, which is in line with a healthy labor market, but less active. The unemployment rate is expected to remain low at 4.1%. Employment remains strong despite the increase in interest rates. In 2022 and 2023, the Federal Reserve raised the benchmark interest rate 11 times in an attempt to curb inflation. The pressure on prices has shown a significant decline, allowing the central bank to adjust its policy and lower interest rates three times in 2024. However, the progress in reducing inflation has stopped in recent months, and the annual increase in consumer prices remains higher than the central bank's target of 2%. Plans by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on imports and deport undocumented workers in the United States threaten to rekindle inflation. The Federal Reserve has responded cautiously, indicating that it expects interest rates to be cut twice this year, which is less than the previous expectations of four cuts in September.

US job openings fell to 7.6 million in December, down from 8.2 million in November and 8.9 million a year earlier. The Labor Department reported that the number of layoffs decreased, indicating strong job security for Americans. Quits rose modestly but remained below pre-pandemic levels. Job openings declined in professional and business services, healthcare, and finance, but increased in arts, entertainment, and recreation. Employers added 186,000 jobs per month in 2024, down from previous years. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates high to combat inflation, but has since cut rates three times in 2024. However, inflation progress has stalled, and the Fed expects to cut rates twice this year.

**Latest Employment Figures Show Economy Going Strong**
The latest employment figures show the American economy is going strong. The Labor Department reported 228,000 jobs were added in November, beating estimates of 200,000 jobs. This marks the 86th consecutive month of job growth, with employers on track to add about two million jobs in 2017. The transportation and warehousing sector added 10,500 jobs, while construction posted job gains of 24,000. Wage growth is also picking up, with average earnings up 2.5 percent over the past year. Economists expect wage growth to continue as unemployment falls. A $1.5 trillion tax cut plan is on the verge of passing, which could provide a modest lift to the economy, but also raise interest rates faster than planned if it pushes up inflation.
