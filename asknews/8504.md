**Britain unveils radical defense overhaul to meet new threats**
The UK government has announced a radical overhaul of its defense strategy to address new threats from Russia, nuclear risks, and cyber-attacks. The plan, which includes investing in drones and digital warfare, aims to make the army more lethal, not larger, by learning from Ukraine's experience. Defense Secretary John Healey said, 'Drones now kill more people than traditional artillery in the war in Ukraine and whoever gets new technology into the hands of their armed forces the quickest will win.' The government will spend 15 billion pounds on replacing the nuclear warheads for its main nuclear fleet and build new munitions plants, procure long-range weapons, and launch new communication systems. The review also recommends increasing the total number of regular personnel when funding allows, likely after 2029. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, 'The moment has arrived to transform how we defend ourselves,' and that defense spending will increase to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and 3% in the next parliament, likely between 2029-2034.

**UK to Produce New Nuclear-Powered Submarines, Invest in Nuclear Warhead Program**
The UK plans to produce 12 new nuclear-powered submarines to replace its current 7 Astute-class submarines. Additionally, four strategic submarines with Trident nuclear missiles will be upgraded. The new submarines will be built with a 18-month production cycle, with the first ones expected to be operational by the end of 2030. The UK has also signed the AUKUS security pact with the US and Australia, which includes the development of submarines. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (not Kier Starmer, as the article was translated from Russian, and the name was mistranslated) stated that the UK will invest £15 billion (approximately $20 billion USD) in a nuclear warhead program. He also announced three 'fundamental changes' to the UK's military position, including increasing the army's lethality by 10 times by 2035. The UK's military aims to transition to a more combat-ready force, strengthen NATO, and implement innovations at a faster pace. Sunak emphasized the importance of preparing for potential conflicts, saying 'I believe the best way to prevent conflict is to prepare for it.' The UK is also concerned about potential threats from Russia, with Sunak stating that the country 'very carefully monitors the constant threat from Russia, whether it's in Ukraine or more broadly.' The UK has committed to increasing its defense spending to 2.5% of its national income by 2027, with Sunak acknowledging that even the initial reduction was a 'difficult decision.' However, he expressed satisfaction that the UK government has 'stabilized the economy.'

**Keir unveils defence overhaul making UK 10x MORE lethal as Putin threat looms – but STILL won’t commit to funding boost**
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer unveiled a defence overhaul, aiming to make the UK 10 times more lethal by 2035. The plan includes building up to 12 new nuclear-powered submarines, investing £15 billion in the UK's nuclear warhead programme, and establishing a new Cyber Command with £1 billion invested in digital warfare capabilities. However, Starmer refused to commit to boosting defence spending to 3% of GDP, saying that the review was premised on 2.5% and that everything will be done within the current spending envelope. Defence Secretary John Healey said that the deterrent is 'what Putin fears most' and that the UK will be 'ten times more lethal' by 2035, but did not provide a clear timeline for when defence spending will reach 3% of GDP.

**AI Evolution Spurs Urgent Calls to Regulate Killer Robots**
The use of AI-driven drones in warfare is raising deep ethical questions about autonomy in combat. The UN and non-governmental organisations are calling for international regulation of Lethal Autonomous Weapons (LAWS) to avoid a near-future where machines dictate life-and-death choices. Human Rights Watch has expressed concerns about 'digital dehumanisation,' where AI makes life-altering decisions on matters affecting humans. Advocates for AI-driven warfare argue that machines can improve every day at identifying threats, but critics point to the technology's flaws and biases. Nicole Van Rooijen, Executive Director of Stop Killer Robots, says that the use of LAWS would make it difficult to ascertain responsibility for war crimes and other atrocities. The UN is optimistic that the international community is inching towards a common understanding on key issues, with at least 120 countries supporting the call to negotiate a new international law on autonomous weapons systems. 'When it comes to war, someone has to be held accountable,' says Ms. Nakamitsu from the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs.

**Sudan Denies US Allegations of Chemical Weapons Use**
The US Department of State announced on May 22, 2025, that the Sudanese government had used chemical weapons in 2024, citing the 1991 Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act. The decision was communicated to Congress, along with an addendum to the report on condition 10 C) of April 15, 2025, on the respect of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which concludes that the Sudanese government has not respected the Convention. The US will impose sanctions on Sudan, including restrictions on US exports to Sudan and access to US government credit lines. The Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has denied the allegations, calling them 'baseless' and 'devoid of any foundation.' The Ministry expressed its 'stupification' at the US administration's approach, stating that the US should have brought the matter before the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, of which both countries are members. The Sudanese government remains committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Convention and condemns any unilateral measures that violate its provisions.

**British fighter jets to carry nuclear weapons in face of threat of Russia**
The UK government is in talks with US officials to introduce jets armed with nuclear weapons for the first time, as part of the latest defensive expansion against Russia. This move would be the UK's biggest deterrent development since the Cold War. The Defence Secretary, Radakin, views this as the UK's number one defence priority, citing rising nuclear risks across the globe. He said, 'The world is definitely becoming more dangerous. Nuclear risks are rising. For the first time since the Cold War, we face seriously increasing risks of state-on-state conflict.' The government also plans to increase defence spending to three per cent GDP by 2034 and move to wartime levels of arms production by building six new munitions factories. Labour leader, Sir Keir, has also called for a transformation in how the UK defends itself, saying, 'We will meet this moment head on -- by mounting the kind of response not seen before in most of our lifetimes.'

**Top Gun! British fighter jets will soon carry nuclear weapons for the first time ever as part of biggest defence expansion since the Cold War | Daily Mail Online**
The UK government, led by Defence Secretary John Healey, is planning to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034, the largest sustained increase since the Cold War. This move includes purchasing US fighter jets capable of launching gravity bombs with lower power than conventional nuclear weapons. The goal is to increase the resilience of Britain in an 'ever more dangerous world.' The funding will be found by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI. Sir Keir Starmer said, 'In an ever more dangerous world, increasing the resilience of our country so we can protect the British people, resist future shocks and bolster British interests, is vital.' A Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated, 'This Government has announced the largest sustained increase to defence spending since the end of the Cold War.' The UK is also set to meet with NATO heads of government in The Hague next month to discuss defence spending targets, with NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte suggesting a high defence spend target of 5%.

**America Must Shift Roles From 'World Police' To 'World Gun Store,' Says Palmer Luckey**
Palmer Luckey, founder of Anduril, suggests that the United States should shift its role from 'world police' to 'world gun store', supplying autonomous weapons that operate using artificial intelligence. Luckey argues that commercial tech has surpassed the Pentagon, citing examples such as a Tesla having better AI than any U.S. aircraft and a Roomba having better autonomy than most Pentagon weapons systems. He believes that autonomous weapons are the future, saying, 'That's the world we live in.' Luckey's company, Anduril, is expected to top $6 billion in defense contracts by year-end, beating out legacy primes for Air Force and Special Operations deals. However, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has labeled fully autonomous lethal weapons 'politically unacceptable and morally repugnant' and wants a treaty banning them by 2026. Luckey counters, 'It's not a question between smart weapons and no weapons. It's a question between smart weapons and dumb weapons.'

**The Rise of Lethal Autonomous Weapons: A Growing Concern for International Regulation**
The use of lethal autonomous weapons, also known as 'robots tueurs', has become increasingly prevalent in modern conflicts. These systems, which can operate independently or with minimal human control, are being developed and used by various countries, including Russia, Israel, the US, India, and China. Despite the Organization for the United Nations (ONU) having considered a regulation for these systems since 2014, no progress has been made. Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General, has expressed his concerns, stating that 'there is no place for lethal autonomous weapons in our world' and that 'machines that have the power and discretion to take human lives without human control should be banned by international law.' However, the majority of UN member states agree on the principle of international regulation, but negotiations have not yet begun. The idea of banning these systems altogether is unlikely, and instead, countries are seeking to limit their use. The UN has set a deadline of 2026 for countries to establish clear rules on the use of these autonomous weapons. In the meantime, the lack of regulation has led to the acceleration of development and production of these systems, with industries seeing it as an opportunity. The only potential point of agreement on regulation could be the use of these weapons by non-state actors, such as terrorist groups. However, even if a regulation is adopted, it may not be effective in limiting the use of these systems, and the risk of errors and unpredictability could lead to conflicts between countries.

**‘Politically unacceptable, morally repugnant’: UN chief calls for global ban on 'killer robots'**
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has called for a global ban on lethal autonomous weapon systems, describing them as 'politically unacceptable' and 'morally repugnant.' Guterres emphasized the importance of human control over the use of force, stating, 'We cannot delegate life-or-death decisions to machines.' The UN chief has urged Member States to set clear regulations and prohibitions on such systems by 2026. A 'two-tiered' approach, which includes both prohibitions and regulations, is being considered. However, there are still concerns about what characterizes an autonomous weapon system and what 'meaningful human control' looks like. Ms. Rooijen from the Stop Killer Robots coalition noted, 'We are not yet negotiating, that is a problem.' The cost of inaction will be greater the longer we wait, and systems are becoming less expensive to develop, raising concerns about proliferation among both State and non-state actors.

**UN Aims to Regulate AI Weapons by 2026, But Experts Warn of New Arms Race**
The United Nations is working to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) weapons by 2026, but experts warn of a new arms race. According to Reuters, autonomous systems equipped with AI are increasingly used in modern wars, from Ukraine to Gaza, and rising global defense spending is fueling a new wave of emerging military technologies supported by AI. However, progress towards establishing global rules for their development and use has not kept pace. The Geneva Conventions' 2014 agreement to discuss a possible ban on fully autonomous systems that operate without meaningful human control has yet to yield concrete results. UN Secretary-General António Guterres has set a 2026 deadline for countries to establish clear rules, but human rights organizations warn of a lack of consensus among governments. Alexander Kment, head of the Austrian Foreign Ministry's Arms Control Department, said, 'Time is running out, and we need to put some preventive barriers in place to avoid the apocalyptic scenarios that some of the most prominent experts warn about.' The UN General Assembly meeting in New York on Monday will be the first meeting of the organization dedicated to discussing autonomous weapons. Although these discussions are not legally binding, diplomats hope they will increase pressure on military powers that resist regulation due to concerns that rules may undermine the advantages of technology on the battlefield. Campaign groups hope the meeting, which will also address critical issues not covered by the Geneva Conventions, including ethical concerns, human rights, and the use of autonomous weapons by non-state actors, will push countries to agree on a legal instrument. They see it as a crucial test of countries' ability to overcome divisions before the next round of Geneva Convention talks in September. Patrick Wilcken, a researcher on military, security, and policing issues at Amnesty International, said, 'This issue needs to be clarified through a binding treaty. The technology is developing at an incredibly rapid pace.' 'The idea of not wanting to exclude delegating life or death decisions... to a machine that looks unusual.' The talks come after 164 countries supported a UN General Assembly resolution in 2023 calling for urgent action to address the risks posed by autonomous weapons. While many countries support a binding international framework, the US, Russia, China, and India prefer national guidelines or existing international law, according to Amnesty International. A Pentagon spokesperson told Reuters, 'We have not accepted that the current law is insufficient,' adding that autonomous systems may actually pose a lower risk to civilians than traditional weapons. The governments of India, Russia, and China have not responded to requests for comment, and in the absence of regulation, autonomous systems are proliferating. Experts at the Future of Life Institute have tracked the deployment of around 200 autonomous systems across Ukraine, the Middle East, and Africa. For example, Russian forces in Ukraine have deployed around 3,000 Kamikaze drones, capable of detecting and attacking targets independently, according to their data. Meanwhile, Ukraine has used semi-autonomous drones in the conflict, and the Ukrainian government has refused to comment. Israel has used AI systems to identify targets in Gaza, and its delegation in Geneva has expressed support for multilateral talks and the use of data-driven technologies in line with international law. However, Human Rights Watch said that critical questions about accountability under international law remain unanswered, and warned in a recent report that unregulated autonomous systems pose a range of human rights threats and could lead to an arms race if not controlled. Activists like Laura Nolan from Stop Killer Robots are concerned that there is currently no guarantee that defense companies will develop AI-based weapons responsibly. She said, 'We generally don't trust industries to regulate themselves... and there's no reason to trust defense companies or technology more.'

**The Urgent Need for a Treaty to Ban Autonomous Weapons**
The world is at a critical juncture regarding the proliferation of autonomous weapons, also known as 'killer robots.' The United Nations has convened a meeting to regulate this segment of arms controlled by artificial intelligence. Experts warn that it's time to put limits on the use of this lethal technology. The ongoing war in Ukraine is a prime example of how these autonomous weapons are being used. Drones and robots are being used extensively against Russian troops, and there are already drones launching drones to attack other drones. The relevance of this type of armament has been affected by the trade war between the US and China, which threatens the production and export of these autonomous vehicles. The debate about the potential prohibition of killer robots has been ongoing for a decade, with organizations like Human Rights Watch trying to ban them before it's too late. However, many countries continue to develop these weapons, and there is no consensus on putting limits on this dangerous area. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has set a deadline of 2026 for countries to establish clear rules on the use of AI-powered arms. He has stated that these autonomous systems are 'politically unacceptable, morally repugnant' and should be prohibited. However, there is still no consensus, and some countries, including the US, Russia, China, and India, prefer to have national regulations or apply existing international laws. As a result, there is a clear proliferation of these autonomous weapons, with experts monitoring over 200 systems deployed in Ukraine, the Middle East, and Africa. The lack of regulation is causing a clear development of this type of autonomous armament, and experts warn that it's time to put limits on the use of this lethal technology before it's too late.

**Countries Meet at UN to Discuss 'Killer Robots' Amid Growing Concerns**
Countries will meet at the United Nations on Monday to revive efforts to regulate autonomous weapons controlled by AI, which are increasingly used in modern warfare. Experts warn that time is running out to set limits on new lethal technologies. Autonomous and AI-assisted weapons systems are playing a more significant role in conflicts from Ukraine to Gaza. However, progress towards establishing global norms governing their development and use has not kept pace. Non-binding international norms are still virtually non-existent. Since 2014, countries that are part of the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) have met in Geneva to discuss a possible ban on fully autonomous systems that operate without significant human control and regulate others. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has set 2026 as a deadline for countries to establish clear standards on the use of AI weapons. However, human rights groups warn that there is no consensus among governments. Alexander Kmentt, head of arms control at the Austrian Foreign Ministry, said, 'Time is really running out to put some barriers in place so that the nightmare scenarios that some of the most prominent experts are warning about do not become a reality.' The UN General Assembly meeting in New York on Monday will be the first meeting of the organization dedicated to autonomous weapons. Although not legally binding, diplomats want the talks to increase pressure on military powers that resist regulation due to concerns that norms could reduce the advantages of technology on the battlefield. Campaign groups hope that the meeting, which will also address critical issues not covered by the CCW, including ethical and human rights concerns and the use of autonomous weapons by non-state actors, will push states to agree on a legally binding instrument. They see it as a crucial test to determine if countries can overcome divisions before the next round of negotiations on the CCAC in September. 'This issue requires clarification through a legally binding treaty. The technology is advancing very quickly,' said Patrick Wilcken, Amnesty International researcher on military, security, and policing issues. 'The idea of not wanting to rule out the delegation of life-or-death decisions... to a machine seems extraordinary.' The New York conversations come after 164 states supported a UN General Assembly resolution in 2023 calling on the international community to urgently address the risks posed by autonomous weapons. While many countries support a globally binding framework, the United States, Russia, China, and India prefer national guidelines or existing international laws, according to Amnesty. 'We are not convinced that existing legislation is insufficient,' said a Pentagon spokesperson to Reuters, adding that autonomous weapons could, in fact, pose a lower risk to civilians than conventional weapons. The governments of India, Russia, and China did not respond to requests for comment. In the absence of regulation, autonomous systems are proliferating.

However, Human Rights Watch said that critical issues of accountability under international law remain unresolved and warned in a report last month that unregulated autonomous weapons pose a series of threats to human rights and could trigger an arms race if not controlled. Activists like Laura Nolan, of Stop Killer Robots, are concerned that there are currently few measures to ensure that defense companies develop AI-powered weapons responsibly. 'Generally, we do not trust that industries will self-regulate... There is no reason to believe that defense or technology companies are more trustworthy,' she said.

**When Machines Pull the Trigger**
Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) are being deployed in combat scenarios, raising concerns about the impact on human life and accountability. These systems, capable of identifying and engaging targets without human intervention, promise military efficiency but carry the risk of uncontrolled escalation. The U.N. Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) has convened an expert group to examine LAWS, but consensus remains elusive. The Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) has emphasized that existing International Humanitarian Law (IHL) principles apply to all weapons, including autonomous ones, and that legality hinges on function, not on the level of AI advancement. Despite this clarity, no binding treaty has emerged, leaving a patchwork of voluntary national measures rather than a unified global standard.
