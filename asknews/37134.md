**Lebanon's Elections Under Israeli Fire, Airport Road to Get Major Overhaul**
The Lebanese government is moving forward with the municipal and parliamentary elections, despite the Israeli aggression and blockade that has hindered the voting process in several border towns. According to the Kuwaiti newspaper 'Al-Anbaa', the Interior Minister, General Ahmad Al-Hajjar, has emphasized the importance of holding the elections and following up on them, taking into account the Israeli violations and attacks that have become a daily occurrence. The newspaper noted that the elections in the south are 'under the fire of Israeli aggression' and that the blockade has prevented the residents of several border towns from voting freely, as they are prohibited from returning to their homes and losing their livelihoods. The newspaper also mentioned that the upcoming week will see a lot of political developments, including the visit of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to Beirut, where the file of Palestinian arms will be discussed, and the level of cooperation with other parties. Sources from 'Al-Anbaa' questioned whether the clashes that occurred in the Shatila refugee camp in Beirut were a separate incident or a message to Abbas' visit and the measures that will be presented in his talks with Lebanese officials. The newspaper also reported that the US envoy to the Middle East, Morgan Ortagus, will visit Lebanon and will ask the Lebanese officials to take decisive positions on the issue of Palestinian arms and to assert the state's authority over all Lebanese territory. The newspaper noted that the US is increasing its pressure on Lebanon due to the recent developments in the region and the cooperation of all regional powers with the new US approach to the Middle East. On the other hand, the Lebanese government is working to complete the preparations for the tourism season by making significant changes to the airport road and the airport itself. The changes will be noticeable from the beginning of July and will include the installation of new traffic lights, the renovation of the middle barriers, and the installation of new elevators. The newspaper reported that the changes are being made at a cost of $5 million, funded by the Middle East Airlines company. The airport expects to receive over 16,000 passengers per day during the summer season, and the authorities are working to manage the crowds and prevent congestion.

**Saudi Arabia Resumes Flights to Transport Iranian Pilgrims After 7-Year Hiatus**
Saudi Arabian Airlines has resumed flights to transport Iranian pilgrims after an eight-year hiatus, marking a significant improvement in diplomatic relations between Riyadh and Tehran. The initiative, which began with flights from Imam Khomeini Airport in Tehran, paves the way for an exceptional Hajj season that brings the two countries together after a long period of tension. According to a source from the General Authority of Civil Aviation, Saudi Arabian Airlines has resumed flights to transport Iranian pilgrims for the first time since 2015. The low-cost airline, Fly Nas, a subsidiary of Saudi Airlines, began flights from Imam Khomeini Airport in Tehran on Saturday and will also operate similar flights from and to Mashhad Airport in Mashhad, northeast Iran. This year's Hajj season is expected to begin in the first week of June, with pilgrims from around the world already arriving in the holy sites in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi airline will operate 225 flights until July, transporting over 35,000 Iranian pilgrims, with the source emphasizing that these flights are only for Hajj purposes and not commercial. This move comes as part of the improvement in relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which re-established diplomatic relations in March 2023, mediated by China, ending a seven-year diplomatic rift that began in January 2016. The diplomatic rift had a direct impact on the coordination of Hajj and Umrah affairs, leading to the suspension of direct flights to transport Iranian pilgrims to Saudi Arabia. Since then, several practical steps have been taken to solidify this rapprochement, including the resumption of direct flights to transport Iranian pilgrims, which represents an important symbol of enhancing trust and understanding between the two countries.

**Expedia's 2025 Travel Hacks Report Reveals Surprising Truths About Air Travel**
A new report from Expedia reveals that some common misconceptions about air travel are not entirely accurate. According to the report, the best day to book a flight is Sunday, as it can save travelers up to 16% compared to booking on Friday.

Furthermore, the report revealed that average airfare prices have decreased by 11% compared to last year, and premium airfare prices have decreased by 2%. Melanie Fisch, Head of Communications for Expedia's Brands, said, 'Following the smart travel hacks for 2025 is a smart move when booking flights.' The report also revealed that the most popular international destinations for Emirati travelers are Beirut, Toronto, and Cairo. The most popular international destinations for Emirati travelers that are experiencing increased popularity are Karachi, Pakistan (+65%); Tunis, Tunisia (+65%); Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (+60%); Kolkata, India (+55%); and Cape Town, South Africa (+50%).
