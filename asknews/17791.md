**Pentagon Alarm Over Russian Nuclear-Tipped Air-To-Air Missiles, US Tests 'Doomsday' Minuteman ICBM**
The Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has warned that Russia may deploy nuclear-tipped air-to-air missiles, a tactic reminiscent of the Cold War. A 2024 drill involved a nuclear-capable R-33 missile, with experts suggesting the R-37M as a likely candidate. This development poses a threat to Ukrainian jets, limiting their operations. Russia has also deployed nuclear-capable weapons in Belarus and maintains a stockpile of over 3,500 warheads. In response, the US has tested a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to reinforce deterrence. Additionally, former President Trump plans to boost nuclear power in the US through emergency orders, invoking Cold War-era laws to reduce reliance on Russian and Chinese uranium, according to 'officials.'

**Ukraine Proposes EU Funding for Ukrainian Armed Forces**
Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergei Marchenko has proposed that European partners take on part of the funding for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This timely initiative comes as Europe is beginning to understand that the 'umbrella' of security provided by the US is no longer reliable and may allow 'raindrops' to pass through. This has prompted the EU to actively rearm. The EU's ReArm Europe program, launched in March 2025, aims to allocate 800 billion euros to modernize the defense sector of several European countries over the next few years, with Germany likely playing a key role. The program will also involve France, Poland, the UK, Turkey, and other NATO countries, forming the basis of European defense. This is a positive signal for Ukraine, as Europe should be able to defend itself independently, and NATO should not rely solely on the military might of the US, which has shown instability lately, but also on its own potential. According to EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius, part of the 800 billion euros will be allocated to strengthen Ukraine's defense industry. There are already several joint projects involving European, including German, companies. Additionally, funds from Denmark and other countries are being directed towards purchasing arms from Ukrainian manufacturers. Various models of cooperation are being explored, and new ways to attract European funds for Ukraine's defense may be developed. However, it is also important to recognize that Ukraine is already and will remain an indivisible part of the European defense perimeter. Russia poses a strategic threat for the next decade, and this threat is shared by Ukraine, the Baltic states, and other European countries. The Ukrainian army is likely the most powerful and experienced in Europe, having gained significant combat experience in the war against Russia. Therefore, it is logical to involve it in planning joint defense at all levels, both in the format of partnership with NATO and possibly within a future European army, the creation of which is already being discussed.

**Ukraine Proposes EU to Finance Ukrainian Armed Forces Starting from 2026**
Ukraine has proposed to the European Union that they finance the Ukrainian Armed Forces starting from 2026. According to Ukrainian Minister Marchenko, the costs of supporting the VSU will be a small portion of the EU's GDP. Marchenko explained that the costs can be distributed among the countries willing to join the initiative and included in the calculation of defense expenses, in accordance with the obligations of these countries to NATO. Marchenko emphasized that supporting Ukraine is an investment in European stability, and strengthening defense capabilities is a pressing necessity, not a political choice. He urged immediate action to be strong in the future. This proposal comes after European Commissioner for Defense, Andrius Kubilius, announced that part of the 800 billion euro plan for EU rearmament will be allocated for military support to Ukraine. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presented a long-term plan for EU rearmament with a budget of 800 billion euros and an additional 150 billion euros in loans for air defense systems within the EU and production of weapons for Ukraine.

**Putin's 'Monster-Rakete' Launch: A Display of Military Power**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has launched a massive 'Monster-Rakete' (RS-24) to demonstrate his military power against the West. The intercontinental missile has a range of approximately 10,000 kilometers and could potentially threaten Washington. Putin's move comes as he is set to have phone calls with US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to the Ukrainian intelligence, the RS-24 is equipped with dummy nuclear warheads. Putin's action is seen as a warning to the West, particularly during a time of intense diplomatic efforts to end the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. As one expert noted, 'Putin is not doing this by chance.'

**Astrologer Predicts End of War in Ukraine, Citing Low Probability in 2025**
Renowned astrologer Vladimir Badayan has predicted the end of the war in Ukraine, stating that there is a low probability of it happening in 2025. According to Badayan, Russia's goal in the war is to restore the USSR. He believes that the role of the US in peace negotiations will soon decrease, and instead, Europe may take the initiative. 'Europe can significantly influence the cessation of hostilities. In my opinion, this will happen in 2026-2027. So, not in 2025. A ceasefire or a halt to military operations will be achieved in February-March 2027. This can happen within 1.5 years. There is a high probability that the war will end by 2027, with a 90% chance of it ending before then, possibly as early as spring 2026', he said.

**US intelligence says Russia will use nuclear weapon if...**
The US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has published an assessment concluding that Russia is unlikely to use nuclear weapons in the conflict with Ukraine, unless its leadership believes the nation is under an existential threat. According to the DIA, 'Russia is very unlikely to use nuclear weapons in the conflict [the war in Ukraine] unless Russian leadership judged it faced an existential threat to the regime.' The assessment also notes that Russia's nuclear doctrine has been revised to lower the threshold for using nuclear weapons, and that Putin considers a conventional attack aided by a nuclear-armed state as a joint attack, eligible for retaliation with nuclear weapons. Putin stated that Russia could use nuclear weapons if it were convinced that a mass cross-border attack by air from strategic and tactical aviation, cruise missiles, drones, and hypersonic weapons is being launched at Russia.

**Russia's Development of 'Air-to-Air' Nuclear Missiles Raises Concerns**
According to US intelligence, Russia has been developing 'air-to-air' nuclear missiles, with the R-33 and R-37 being the main candidates. The R-33, developed in the 1970s, has a range of 120 km for its basic version and 160 km for its upgraded version, but its nuclear payload capacity is unknown. The R-37, developed in the 2010s, has a range of 200-300 km and can carry a 60 kg payload, which could potentially be a nuclear warhead. The R-37 is integrated into the MiG-31 and Su-35 fighter jets and has been used by Russian aircraft against Ukrainian Air Force planes since 2022. However, Ukrainian pilots estimate the real combat range of the R-37 to be significantly lower than Russian claims. Another potential candidate for a nuclear 'air-to-air' missile is the KS-172, with a range of 400 km and a 50 kg payload. Experts consider the use of such missiles to be questionable, as they were originally designed to target strategic bombers in a coordinated air attack, but now there are more effective ways to achieve this. However, if Russia is investing in these systems, it suggests they have a clear understanding of their utility, according to Defense Express.

**'Serious' accident at N. Korea warship launch ceremony: state media**
A major accident occurred at the launch ceremony for a new North Korean naval destroyer, with leader Kim Jong Un calling it a 'criminal act' caused by 'absolute carelessness'. The mishap left 'some sections of the warship's bottom crushed' and 'destroyed the balance of the warship'. Kim warned that the 'irresponsible errors' of officials responsible would be 'dealt with' at the plenary meeting of the Party Central Committee. The incident has raised questions about the involvement of Russia in the construction of the warship, with some analysts suggesting that it may have been developed with Russian help. North Korea has been strengthening its navy, with Kim calling for the modernisation of its surface and underwater naval forces, including the development of warships. The incident has also sparked concerns about the potential for North Korea to export nuclear weapons to Russia for use against Ukraine.

**Putin Rules Out Need for Nuclear Weapons in Ukraine, But Ceasefire Talks Remain Elusive**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that there was no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and he hopes that there will not be a need for them. This comes after months of signing a new amendment to Russia's nuclear doctrine in November 2024, which reduced the restrictions on the use of the world's largest nuclear arsenal and opened the door to its use in the event of a conventional attack backed by nuclear power. Putin also explained that Russia did not launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2014, after the annexation of Crimea, because it was not ready for a direct confrontation with the West. He stated that Moscow was seeking to resolve the Donbas crisis through peaceful means, considering reconciliation with Ukraine to be unavoidable. However, proposals for a ceasefire are met with conflicting views between the two sides. While Moscow announced a humanitarian ceasefire lasting 72 hours to coincide with 'Victory Day', Kiev rejected the offer, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky calling it an attempt to 'create a comfortable atmosphere' before the Kremlin's celebrations. Zelensky reiterated his call for a comprehensive 30-day ceasefire, which the US had proposed as a step towards building trust and paving the way for an end to the war. He stated that Ukraine is ready to begin a ceasefire 'at any time' if it is genuine and effective. Meanwhile, a new attack by a Russian drone on Kiev on Saturday night injured 11 people, including two children, according to the Ukrainian Emergency Service. Two people were also killed in Russian strikes on the cities of Dnipro and Sumy, according to local officials. The conflict continues to escalate, with Ukraine's air force announcing that Russia launched 165 explosive and guided drones, of which 69 were intercepted, while 80 others were likely disabled by electronic jamming. Russia also launched two ballistic missiles. In response, the Russian Defense Ministry said that its air defenses shot down 13 Ukrainian drones. The situation remains unclear, with both sides continuing to exchange accusations and neither side showing signs of backing down.

**Putin says he hopes nuclear weapons will 'not be required' in Ukraine**
Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed hope that nuclear weapons will 'not be required' in Ukraine, despite signing a revamped nuclear doctrine in November 2024 that lowered the bar for using Moscow's atomic arsenal. Putin said Russia has the strength and means to bring the conflict in Ukraine to a 'logical conclusion.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded, saying a ceasefire is possible 'even from today' if Moscow is serious about ending the war. Zelensky expressed deep skepticism over Russia's proposal of a 72-hour ceasefire in Ukraine to mark Victory Day, saying Moscow continues to launch hundreds of assaults despite publicly signaling interest in a partial truce. Zelensky called for a more substantial 30-day pause in hostilities, as the US had initially proposed. Ukraine hopes to receive 1.8 million artillery shells in 2025 as part of a Czech-led initiative to supply military aid to Kyiv. Attacks on Ukraine continue, with a Russian drone attack overnight on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, wounding 11 people, including two children.

**Putin says Russia has not seen need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine**
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated on Sunday, 4, that Moscow has not seen the need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and hopes that the country will not need to opt for nuclear alternative against its Eastern European neighbors. In comments shown in a state television film about his quarter-century in power, Putin said that Russia has the strength and means to bring the conflict in Ukraine to a 'logical conclusion'. When asked about Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, Putin said, 'There was no need to use these weapons (nuclear) and I hope they won't be necessary.' 'We have enough strength and means to bring what was started in 2022 to a logical conclusion, with the result that Russia demands,' he added. Putin signed a revised version of Russia's nuclear doctrine in November 2024, specifying the circumstances under which he can use Moscow's atomic arsenal, the largest in the world. This version reduced the level of requirement, giving him the option to respond even to a conventional attack supported by a nuclear power. In the state film, Putin also said that Russia did not launch a large-scale invasion of Ukraine and called the war against the neighboring country a 'special military operation.' He also stated that reconciliation with Ukraine is 'inevitable,' but the two countries remain in disagreement over proposals for a ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodmir Zelenski said on Friday, 2, that Moscow's announcement of a 72-hour ceasefire was only an attempt to create a 'pleasant atmosphere' before Russia's annual celebrations. Zelenski instead renewed calls for a more substantial 30-day pause in hostilities, as initially proposed by the US. He said that the proposed ceasefire could start at any time as a significant step towards the end of the war.

**Putin Hopes to Avoid Using Nuclear Weapons in Ukraine**
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that he does not see the need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and hopes that it will not be necessary. In response to a question about Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, Putin said, 'There has been no need to use those (nuclear weapons)... and I hope that it will not be necessary.'

This statement lowers the conditions for using nuclear weapons, giving Russia the option to respond even to a conventional attack backed by a nuclear power. Ukraine and Russia have opposing positions on two rival ceasefire proposals. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the Russian announcement of a 72-hour ceasefire in Ukraine next week to commemorate Victory Day is merely an attempt to create a 'soft atmosphere' before Russia's annual celebrations.

**Ukraine's Nuclear Ambitions: A Theoretical Possibility, but Significant Obstacles**
Ukraine has the potential to develop its own nuclear weapons, but there are several significant obstacles, according to former MP Yuriy Kostenko. He noted that Russia considered using nuclear weapons in 2022 if Ukrainian forces had broken through to Crimea. Kostenko suggested that the simplest way for Ukraine to obtain nuclear guarantees would be for the US to agree to station its nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory, for example, by moving them from Belgium. However, both the previous and current US administrations have rejected this scenario, not wanting to escalate relations with Russia. Kostenko stated that Ukraine has a theoretical possibility of developing its own nuclear program. The Chornobyl Exclusion Zone has reactors that can process plutonium, one of the elements of nuclear weapons, and spent nuclear fuel from the ChNPP is stored in the country. However, critical technologies, such as centrifuges and chemical complexes for extracting plutonium, are difficult to obtain on the world market due to high costs. The main problem is funding. The United States will not provide Ukraine with funds, as they aim to maintain a monopoly on the nuclear market with Russia. Additionally, conducting a defensive war and constant enemy attacks make it dangerous to locate nuclear production even underground. Ukraine also lacks the necessary testing ranges for nuclear devices. Kostenko considers the lack of time and the threat of escalation to be the main obstacles. Implementing a nuclear program would take 10-15 years. If Russia finds out about Ukraine's intention to restore its nuclear status, it may lead to the use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine. 'This would be a terrible thing, we simply cannot withstand it,' Kostenko emphasized. In this situation, he sees an exit in Ukraine's accession to the European nuclear program. Kostenko added that many countries are willing to participate in financing 'nuclear umbrella' for Ukraine. Ukraine could become 'part of the pool of nuclear countries that are part of the overall European system of security'.

**US-Russia-Ukraine Trilateral Talks: A Futile Effort?**
According to Alexey Buraychenko, a political analyst and executive director of the International Association of Small Communities, the US plans to hold bilateral talks with Russia and Ukraine separately before organizing a trilateral meeting. However, Buraychenko believes that this approach is unlikely to be successful, as Russia is not yet ready for serious negotiations to end the war. He also notes that the US should not try to negotiate with Russia without a clear agenda, as this could legitimize Russia's actions and undermine Ukraine's position. Buraychenko suggests that the US should instead focus on building a strong negotiating position and working with the European Union to pressure Russia to end the war. He also speculates that the US may try to negotiate with Russia over issues such as control over nuclear weapons and the extension of a bilateral agreement on reducing nuclear potential, which expires in 2026. In the near future, Buraychenko expects a bilateral meeting between the US and Russia to take place in Saudi Arabia, where they will discuss regional issues, including Africa, and the balance of power between the US and China.

**Zelensky Asks for Nuclear Weapons, Citing NATO Membership Uncertainty**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged that Ukraine's accession to NATO is unlikely in the near future and has asked Western countries to provide Ukraine with nuclear weapons. He made this request on February 4 during an interview with British TV presenter Piers Morgan, which was published on the X social network. Zelensky also called for help in financing Ukraine's 'multi-million army'. This announcement marked the 1077th day of the special military operation (SMO) in Ukraine. According to Zelensky, the US could 'secretly' provide Ukraine with nuclear weapons if Ukraine gives up its plans to join NATO, as suggested by military expert Nicholas Drummond in an interview with the British tabloid Express in the fall of 2024. Russian Foreign Ministry official Maria Zakharova described Zelensky's desire for nuclear weapons as 'that of a madman who sees the planet as an object of his sick fantasies'. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly emphasized that Russia will not allow Ukraine to have nuclear weapons, as he stated during a press conference in Kazakhstan in late November 2024.

**Doomsday Clock Moved 89 Seconds Closer to Midnight**
The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists has moved its 'Doomsday Clock' 89 seconds closer to midnight, citing the threat of nuclear war, climate change, and the use of artificial intelligence in military applications. The clock is now 89 seconds before midnight, a second closer than last year. The organization, founded in 1947 by scientists such as Albert Einstein and J. Robert Oppenheimer, created the clock to warn the public about the threat of global catastrophe. 'The factors that shape our decision this year (nuclear risk, climate change, the potential misuse of advances in biological science and a variety of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence) were not new in 2024. But we have seen insufficient progress in addressing key challenges, and in many cases, this is leading to increasingly negative and worrisome effects,' said Daniel Holz, president of the Science and Security Board. 'Setting the Doomsday Clock at 89 seconds to midnight is a warning to all world leaders,' added Holz. The ongoing war in Ukraine is a major source of nuclear risk, and the conflict could escalate to include nuclear weapons at any moment due to a hasty decision or accidents and miscalculations, said Holz. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has launched the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II. 'The war in Ukraine continues to advance as a major source of nuclear risk. That conflict could intensify to include nuclear weapons at any moment due to a hasty decision or accidents and miscalculations,' said Holz. In November, Russian President Vladimir Putin lowered the threshold for a nuclear attack in response to a wider range of conventional attacks, a move that the Kremlin described as a signal to the West in the midst of a war in which Ukraine received arms supplied by the United States and its allies. 'The Russian aggression in Ukraine, including the repeated use of nuclear threats since the war began, has been unsettling. Additionally, Russia's recent retreat from major arms control treaties is a disturbing sign of increasing nuclear risk,' said Holz. Russia said in October that it will not discuss signing a new treaty with the United States to replace the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that limits each side's nuclear arsenal. The treaty expires in 2026 because Moscow believes it should be expanded and extended to cover other countries. The Middle East has been another source of instability with the Israel-Gaza War and broader regional hostilities involving countries such as Iran. China has intensified military pressure near Taiwan, sending warships and aircraft into the waters and airspace around the island that Beijing sees as its own territory. North Korea continues to conduct nuclear tests with its nuclear arm. 'We are watching closely and hope that the Gaza ceasefire holds. The tensions in the Middle East, even with Iran, are still dangerously unstable,' said Holz. 'There are other potential hotspots around the world, including Taiwan and North Korea. Any of these could become a conflagration involving nuclear powers, with unpredictable and potentially devastating results,' added Holz. Artificial intelligence has made rapid gains in capability and popularity in 2024, prompting growing concern among some experts about its military applications and risks to global security. Governments have addressed the issue in adjustments and beginnings. In the United States, for example, former President Joe Biden in October signed an executive order aimed at reducing risks. That AI poses national security, economic, and public health risks. His successor Donald Trump revoked it last week. 'The advances in AI are beginning to appear in the battlefield in a tentative but concerning way, and of particular concern is the future possibility of AI applications to nuclear weapons. Moreover, AI is increasingly disrupting the world's information ecosystem. AI-fed misinformation and disinformation will only add to this dysfunction,' said Holz. Last year was the hottest on record, according to scientists at the UN's World Meteorological Organization. The last 10 years have been the hottest recorded, said. 'While there has been impressive growth in wind and solar energy, the world is still below what is needed to avoid the worst aspects of climate change,' said Holz.
