**Greenland Takes Over Arctic Council Chairmanship from Denmark**
Greenland has taken over the chairmanship of the Arctic Council from Denmark, a move seen as a sign of Denmark's efforts to reboot its relationship with the autonomous territory. According to The Guardian, 'Denmark was supposed to hold the chairmanship, but in a sign that Copenhagen is trying to reboot its relationship with Greenland, a former Danish colony that remains part of the Danish kingdom, the chairmanship has been passed to Greenland.' The Arctic Council requires consensus among the eight Arctic states, including the US, Russia, Canada, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Greenland, and Sweden, for all decisions and statements. This move comes after US President Donald Trump suggested sending American troops to Greenland in April, stating that it could be a way to 'assert rights' to the island. Trump had previously expressed interest in buying Greenland from Denmark in 2019, but was rejected. In 2025, Trump was told that Greenland is not for sale, but Denmark is willing to cooperate more with the US. Greenland's new Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, has stated that the US will not get the island, saying 'it belonged to no one yesterday, it belongs to no one today, and it will belong to no one tomorrow.'

**Greenland Takes Over Arctic Council Chairmanship from Norway, Representing Denmark**
Greenland has officially taken over the chairmanship of the Arctic Council from Norway, representing Denmark. The transfer took place in the Norwegian city of Tromsø, where Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Science, Vivian Motzfeldt, accepted a symbolic hammer as a symbol of the transfer of leadership from Norway's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Espen Barth Eide. According to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Greenland, Greenland's new leadership of the Arctic Council from Denmark symbolizes a reboot of relations between Greenland and Copenhagen, particularly in the context of past territorial ambitions expressed by former US President Donald Trump. Greenland has identified several key priorities during its chairmanship, including support for indigenous peoples of the Arctic, sustainable development of the region, promotion of 'green' energy, and measures to preserve the climate and biodiversity. Motzfeldt emphasized that the Arctic should remain a space where any conflicts are resolved through peaceful and diplomatic means. Greenland expressed its readiness to cooperate with all participating countries of the Council and expects a reciprocal approach. Additionally, it was announced that the post of Chairman of the Committee of Senior Officials of the Arctic Council will be held by a representative of Greenland, Kenneth Høeg, and his deputy will be a delegate from the Faroe Islands. It is worth noting that earlier it was reported that the potential offer to buy Greenland from the United States could be around $2.2 billion.

**Denmark Takes Over Arctic Council Presidency Amid Tensions and Trump's Greenland Ambitions**
Denmark has taken over the rotating presidency of the Arctic Council from Norway, amidst increased security tensions in the region and US President Donald Trump's ambitions to annex Greenland. Denmark appointed Viviann Mouzelat, the Foreign Minister of Greenland, as the new president of the council, a gathering of eight countries bordering the Arctic. Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory in Denmark, which has rejected Trump's statements about buying the island. In response to a question about negotiations with the US, Mouzelat reiterated her government's commitment to becoming an independent state while still working with Trump's administration. She said, 'I think we were very clear in our policy, that we don't want to be Danish, but we don't want to be American either... Our cooperation with the new administration is very strong.' During Norway's two-year tenure as chair, the Arctic Council faced pressure on how to deal with Trump and Russia's war in Ukraine. Russia, the largest country in the Arctic, previously held the presidency before Norway. The council was one of the few places where Western countries worked closely with Russia, but members decided to suspend their work with Russia shortly after Moscow launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Mouzelat said, 'The Arctic must remain a region where tensions are resolved through diplomacy, where the rights of indigenous peoples are protected, and where cooperation prevails.' She added, 'This is more important than ever. We firmly believe that cooperation will continue to build - even in turbulent times - and will lead to a stronger and more resilient future for the Arctic and its peoples.'

**Greenland to Chair Arctic Council Amid US Plans to Annex the Island**
According to the Guardian, the chairmanship of the Arctic Council will be transferred to Greenland, an autonomous territory within the Danish kingdom, instead of Denmark as initially planned. The decision was made due to US President Donald Trump's repeated claims of plans to annex Greenland. The article states that Copenhagen is trying to 'reboot its relationship with Greenland.' Trump has stated that annexing Greenland is an 'absolute necessity' and has suggested using military force if other methods fail. Greenland's politicians have repeatedly stated that they may declare independence, but do not plan to join the US. The Arctic Council members include Russia, the US, Denmark, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Finland, and Sweden. 'It is a sign of the times that Greenland is being considered for the chairmanship of the Arctic Council,' said an expert, as reported in the article. 'The US is trying to 'permanently occupy' the Arctic region, and Greenland is a key part of this strategy.'

**US Plans to Sign 'Free Association Agreement' with Greenland, Sparking Concerns Over Sovereignty**
The US government has been secretly strengthening its espionage activities in Greenland, a Danish autonomous territory. Now, they are planning to sign a 'free association agreement' with Greenland, which would allow the US to have a military presence on the island. This move is seen as a way for the US to circumvent the issue of Greenland's sovereignty. According to the plan, the US would suggest that Greenland's leaders sign the agreement, which would grant the US access to the island's resources and strategic location. However, this move has been met with resistance from Denmark, which claims Greenland as its territory. The Danish Prime Minister, Frederiksen, has stated that Greenland is 'non-negotiable' and 'not for sale.' The Greenlandic Prime Minister, Nielsen, has also expressed his disapproval, saying that the US's actions lack respect for Greenland's autonomy. Analysts believe that the US is trying to use the 'free association agreement' as a way to gain control over Greenland's resources and strategic location, which would be a violation of international law. The US's actions have been criticized by experts, who see it as a form of 'aggressive expansionism' that would undermine global stability.

**US Considers Transferring Greenland to Northern Command, Raising Concerns Among Danish Officials**
The US is considering transferring the responsibility of Greenland from the European Command (EUCOM) to the Northern Command (NORTHCOM), which is responsible for the country's defense. This move, according to sources, is part of a plan to strengthen the US's presence in the Arctic region. Donald Trump, who has long been interested in Greenland, has stated, 'We have an urgent need for Greenland. The population is small, we will take care of it. But we need it for international security.' However, this move has raised concerns among Danish officials, who see it as a potential threat to their country's sovereignty. 'We see this as a signal that the US is preparing to take control of Greenland,' said a source. The US has also increased its intelligence operations on the island, with the aim of monitoring independence movements and assessing local sentiment on the exploitation of resources by the US. This move has further strained relations between the US and Denmark.

**Greenland to Take Over as Chair of Arctic Council Amid Tensions with US**
According to the Guardian, Greenland will take over as the chair of the Arctic Council from Denmark, a move seen as a sign of Denmark's efforts to reboot its relationship with Greenland, a former Danish colony that remains part of the Danish kingdom. The move comes as US President Donald Trump has made claims on Greenland, and the Arctic Council is expected to face 'even greater challenges' in the next two years, including Trump's continued threats to take control of Greenland and unstable relations between the US and its Arctic neighbors. Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said, 'The Arctic is very sought after because it is the shortest route for missiles, aircraft, and so on between Russia and North America, and this has always been on our agenda.' The Arctic Council, established in 1996, is a high-level intergovernmental forum that promotes cooperation in the region, particularly in environmental protection. Member countries include Denmark, Iceland, Canada, Norway, Russia, the US, Finland, and Sweden. In March 2022, Western member countries announced a suspension of participation in council activities in protest of events in Ukraine.

**US Considers Transferring Greenland's Security Responsibility to Northern Command**
The US is considering transferring the responsibility for Greenland's security interests from the US European Command to the US Northern Command, according to three sources familiar with the matter. This move would highlight Trump's interest in the strategically important territory, which he has repeatedly expressed a desire to acquire. The sources said that the consideration involves transferring Greenland from the US European Command's area of responsibility to the US Northern Command. While it may seem logical to place Greenland under the Northern Command's jurisdiction, given its location as part of the North American continent, it is also a Danish semi-autonomous territory with cultural and historical ties to Europe. Some of the discussions took place before Trump's return to the White House this year. However, several US officials are concerned because Trump has repeatedly claimed that the US 'needs' Greenland and has refused to rule out the possibility of taking military action to obtain it. In a recent interview on NBC, Trump said, 'I'm not ruling out any possibilities, I'm not saying I'll do it, but I'm not ruling out any possibilities.' He added, 'We really need Greenland, it has a very small population, we will take care of them, we will love them, etc. We need it for international security.' The US Northern Command is primarily responsible for protecting US territory and currently handles tasks such as the South Border Task Force. Trump's comments have also caused significant friction with Denmark and Greenland. Placing Greenland under the US Northern Command's jurisdiction would at least symbolically separate Greenland from Denmark, with Denmark still being responsible for it under the US European Command. A source said that Danish officials are worried that this move could convey the message that Greenland is no longer part of Denmark. A US official said that supporters of the move believe that despite having a US military base on the island, Greenland is sometimes overlooked by the US European Command due to its distance from the command center in Central Europe. The island is seen as an important outpost for the US to compete with Russia and other countries for access to the Arctic - a key national security priority for both parties. However, for the US Northern Command, Greenland is an important location for any potential enemy aircraft flying towards the US. In the context of Russia and other adversaries seeking to expand their influence in the region, the US intelligence community's annual threat assessment report mentions Greenland four times in its unclassified version. The discussion about bringing Greenland under the Northern Command's jurisdiction took place at a time when US and Danish officials were engaged in another high-profile dispute over Greenland. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said this week that he plans to 'summon' the US ambassador to Denmark for talks. Earlier, The Wall Street Journal reported that Washington has ordered US intelligence agencies to increase surveillance of Greenland, asking them to further understand the island's independence movement and its attitude towards US resource extraction. Rasmussen told reporters at an EU foreign ministers' informal meeting in Warsaw on July 7: 'I read the article in The Wall Street Journal, and it made me very worried because we won't spy on our friends.'

**Denmark and Neighboring Countries to Meet on Arctic Security Amid Trump's Greenland Plans**
The leaders of Denmark, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Norway will meet on Monday to discuss security in the Arctic, announced the Danish government, as US President Donald Trump seeks to take control of Greenland. 'Even though our countries meet in different parts of the world, it is natural that we, in this circle, meet to discuss the current security situation in the Arctic and the North Atlantic,' said Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in a statement released on Sunday. The meeting will take place in Torshavn, the capital of the Faroe Islands, with Frederiksen, Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Icelandic Prime Minister Kristrun Frostadottir, and Faroese Prime Minister Aksel Johannesen in attendance. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre will participate via video conference. Trump has repeatedly stated that he wants to take control of Greenland, citing security reasons and refusing to rule out the use of force. This has caused concern in other Arctic regions, including Iceland and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, and has also led to strong tensions with Danish and Greenlandic leaders, who have emphasized that the Arctic territory will decide its own future and that the US 'will not get Greenland'.

**Trump's Plan to Take Control of Greenland: A Geopolitical Struggle**
US President Trump has proposed a new plan to take control of Greenland, a Danish territory, by transferring its military command from the European Command (EUCOM) to the North American Command (NORTHCOM), effectively placing Greenland under the US mainland defense umbrella. He also wants to sign a 'Compact of Free Association' (COFA) with Greenland, effectively bringing the territory under US influence. Greenland's unique geographical location and rich resources make it a strategic location, and the US has long considered it a priority. However, China and Russia are also eyeing the territory, and Greenland is caught in a geopolitical struggle, facing challenges to its sovereignty, climate change, and more. Danish Foreign Minister has publicly condemned the US for sending a large number of intelligence agents to Greenland to gather information, and has threatened to take countermeasures, putting the US-Denmark diplomatic relationship to the test. Trump's government has been criticized for its lack of efficiency and failure to deliver on its promises, and the author suggests that the US should focus on building relationships and finding a peaceful solution, rather than relying on military power.

**US Considers Alternative to Annexing Greenland: A Free Association Agreement**
The US is considering an alternative to annexing Greenland, a free association agreement, but Greenland would need to gain independence from Denmark. The White House is developing a plan to attract Greenland to the US sphere of influence through a Compact of Free Association (COFA) agreement, similar to those with three Pacific island nations - Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. According to Reuters, citing several US officials, the COFA agreement would provide the partner state with various important services, including mail delivery and military protection, in exchange for free access to US military on its territory. Such agreements also provide for predominantly duty-free trade with the United States. Sources say the plan does not mean direct US accession to Greenland, which Donald Trump has sought. However, COFA could become an alternative that would allow Washington to increase its influence on the island. However, for this scenario to be implemented, Greenland would likely need to gain independence from Denmark, as COFA agreements are only concluded with sovereign states. Danish officials are currently not involved in the discussions and publicly oppose transferring the island to the US, emphasizing that the question of the future should be decided by the people of Greenland. Surveys show that Greenlanders support the idea of independence, and most do not want to be part of the United States. Therefore, the idea of COFA, which provides for the transfer of part of the sovereignty to Washington, may be met with caution, notes the publication. According to Reuters, participants in the negotiations include Acting Senior Director of the National Security Council for Western Hemisphere Affairs Marcus Tomi, Representative of the Council on Energy Dominance David Coply, and members of the National Economic Council. The White House, the Danish Embassy, the Greenlandic Representation in Washington, and the US Department of the Interior have not commented on the situation. Earlier, it was reported that the US had developed a plan to seize Greenland, based not on a military scenario of seizing the island, but on working with the public opinion of the Greenlanders.

According to the article, the majority of Greenlanders support the idea of independence and do not want to become part of the US, so the idea of COFA, which would involve transferring part of the sovereignty to Washington, may be met with caution. The US considers Greenland strategically important due to its large mineral reserves, including rare earth elements necessary for high-tech and military production. The US is also helping Greenland to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on Denmark, which may be achieved through state agencies such as the US Development Finance Corporation and the Export-Import Bank of the US. As one of the administration's representatives said, COFA could be 'an elegant way to resolve Greenland's security concerns,' although the final decision has not been made yet.

Trump's interest in Greenland is the main issue. On January 7, Donald Trump did not rule out the possibility of using 'military or economic coercion' to conquer the Panama Canal and Greenland. The authorities of Greenland and Panama reject the idea of joining the US. On January 20, Trump announced in his inaugural address that the US would return the Panama Canal and announced 'expansion' of US territory, possibly referring to its claims on Greenland and Canada. The then-Prime Minister of Greenland Mute Egede said that the island wants to be independent but have close ties with the US and Denmark. The Financial Times wrote that President Trump and Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen had a tense conversation, during which Frederiksen again stated that Greenland is not for sale. On February 4, Mute Egede appointed general elections in Greenland for March 11 in the face of constantly growing pressure from Donald Trump. On March 4, President Trump delivered his annual address to Congress, during which he said that Washington would support Greenland's right to self-determination and would make it part of the United States if the island's population wants it. On March 12, the opposition party Demokraatit won the parliamentary elections in Greenland, receiving 29.9% of the votes.

**Greenland's Sovereignty to be Decided by Sled Dog Racing Competition**
US President Donald Trump and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen have agreed, following a phone call where tensions were eased after recent disputes, that Vice President JD Vance and new Greenland Prime Minister Jens Frederiksen Nielsen will compete in a sled dog racing competition to decide Greenland's sovereignty. According to the agreement, Denmark will cede sovereignty to the US, and Greenland will gain independence from Copenhagen. Italy has offered to host the competition, with Vice Premier Matteo Salvini stating, 'It will be a perfect opportunity to showcase Italian excellence ahead of the 2026 Winter Olympics.'

**Denmark Urges US to Renegotiate Defense Cooperation in Greenland**
Denmark has urged the United States to renegotiate the terms of their defense cooperation in Greenland without altering the island's sovereignty. The Danish Foreign Minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, stated that the 1951 defense agreement offers 'a wide margin of maneuver' and that Denmark is committed to maintaining the Arctic as a region of low tension. The Danish government's stance coincides with Washington's view that the current status quo in the Arctic is unsustainable following the start of the war in Ukraine, but Denmark defends alternative solutions that do not involve changes to Greenland's sovereignty. Rasmussen said, 'If that's what the United States wants, let's talk about it.' The Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, also responded to the US Vice President's comments, calling his tone 'inappropriate.' Rasmussen rejected accusations of passivity from the US Vice President, highlighting that Denmark's policy has been guided by the consensus to maintain the Arctic as a region of low tension, a situation that he considers to be outdated. Denmark emphasized that Greenland is part of NATO and protected by its security guarantees, and Rasmussen mentioned recent defense investments in the territory as evidence of Denmark's commitment to its strategic role in the North Atlantic. The US Vice President, JD Vance, visited Greenland and stated that the US 'has no other option' but to negotiate the island's incorporation if it were to become independent from Denmark through a referendum. Vance argued that the decisions made by the Danish government in recent years have resulted in a lack of investment in the local population and infrastructure security in Greenland. 'Our message to Denmark is very simple: you haven't done a good job with the people of Greenland. You haven't invested enough in the people of Greenland and you haven't invested enough in the security architecture of this incredible and beautiful land filled with incredible people. That has to change,' Vance said. The US Vice President also stated that the transfer of control to the US would not only guarantee greater security in the region but also benefit the Greenlanders economically, and that under US administration, Greenland could achieve a higher level of development and stability. 'We could make them much safer, we could provide much more protection and I think they would do much better economically,' Vance said.

**US Interest in Greenland Sparks Independence Movement**
The renewed interest of the US in Greenland has strengthened the movement for independence and the country's position in future negotiations on separation from Denmark, said the leading party in the country, which advocates for independence, citing Reuters. The Arctic island will vote on March 11 in elections, where independence has become a central issue after recent statements by US President Donald Trump that Denmark should transfer control to the US due to Greenland's strategic value for American security. 'Trump's statements and the new line from the US administration have undoubtedly given the independence movement here more momentum,' said Reuters' Jørgen BøttelSEN, a candidate in the March 11 elections from the Naleraq party. Naleraq will strive for a defense agreement with the US and a so-called 'free association' with Denmark or another country, possibly the US, in the event of independence, BøttelSEN said. The Naleraq party, the most active party in Greenland advocating for independence, aims to use the 2009 law, which granted the territory significant autonomy, including the right to negotiate full independence. If this is approved, negotiations with Denmark will begin, although any agreement will require the approval of the Danish parliament and a referendum in Greenland. The ruling party Siumut, which previously considered independence a long-term goal, has recently announced plans to hold a referendum after the elections next month. Trump's comments sparked a political crisis in Copenhagen, where the government acknowledged that it had neglected Greenland's defense for a long time. Last week, Danish lawmakers agreed to allocate around $2 billion to strengthen military presence in Greenland.

**Why Trump is pushing for Greenland to join the US: What it means for Russia**
US President Donald Trump has been pushing for Greenland to join the United States, with some European officials describing his approach as 'aggressive' and 'conflict-oriented'. According to the Financial Times, Trump focused solely on demanding that Greenland be transferred to the US, ignoring other issues. The move could have significant implications for Russia, with political analyst Dmitry Evstafiev warning that it could lead to a new era of globalization in the Arctic, where Russia would face off against the US. 'For Russia, the main risk is that if this project of Trump's is implemented, then America becomes a player in the Arctic, equal in scale to Russia,' Evstafiev said. 'Today, America is not a player in the Arctic. The Arctic infrastructure of America is quite poor compared to Canada. If such an integration takes place in a soft form of a new Euro-Atlantic front... America becomes our main competitor in the battle for the Arctic.' Trump's proposal has been met with criticism from European leaders, with the European Commission refusing to comment on the matter. Denmark has conducted military exercises on the island in response to Trump's comments. The idea of Greenland joining the US is not new, with the US having previously proposed purchasing the island in 1867 and 1946. Trump has hinted at using force to achieve this goal, with Politico suggesting that such a scenario could be one of the shortest armed conflicts in history. 'We must officially start negotiations with Denmark on creating a sovereign state of Greenland,' said Siumut deputy Kuuno Fenger, calling for Greenland to gain independence before it's too late. 'There are many opportunities that people need to know about before we hold a referendum. That's why my party has submitted a proposal to parliament to activate our right to self-determination.'

**Grenlandic MP Calls for Negotiations with Denmark on Sovereignty**
Grenlandic MP Siimun Kuuno Fenchner, from the ruling coalition party Siumut, believes that representatives of the island should start negotiations with Denmark about Greenland's sovereignty. 'My personal opinion is that we should officially start negotiations with Denmark to create a sovereign state of Greenland,' Fenchner said. He added that the people of Greenland should be informed about the various possibilities before a referendum on the island's status. 'That's why my party has proposed to parliament that we should activate our right to self-determination,' Fenchner concluded. This comes after US President-elect Donald Trump stated on December 23, 2024, that the country's national security interests require control and ownership of Greenland. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lekke Rasmussen also stated on January 9 that Greenland could become an independent country, but noted that 'it's unlikely that it would have ambitions to become a subject of the United States.'

**Grenlandic MP Calls for Talks on Independence from Denmark**
Grenlandic MP Siut Kuuno Fenchner has called for official talks with Denmark to begin as soon as possible to discuss the island's independence. According to Fenchner, his party has proposed a motion to 'activate our right to self-determination'. 'My personal opinion is that we should officially start negotiations with Denmark to create a sovereign state of Greenland. There are many opportunities that people need to know about before we hold a referendum. That's why my party has proposed a motion that we should activate our right to self-determination,' Fenchner said in an interview with RIA Novosti. Fenchner also mentioned that Greenland has plans to extend its defense agreement with the US without Denmark's involvement, and that Greenland may sign separate agreements with both Denmark and the EU. Greenland was a Danish colony until 1953 and remains part of the kingdom, with autonomy and self-governance granted in 2009. In late December 2024, the Danish defense minister announced plans to significantly increase defense spending on the world's largest island, following US President Donald Trump's statement on acquiring Greenland.
