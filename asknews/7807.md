**Pepita Bernat, 106, Reveals the Secret to a Long and Healthy Life**
Spain has become a global reference point for longevity due to factors such as the Mediterranean diet, olive oil, a robust healthcare system, a solid social security system, and innovative treatments that improve both quality and life expectancy, according to Dr. Manuel de la Peña, a renowned expert in longevity. Dr. Peña interviewed Pepita Bernat, who will turn 106 on July 11, in Barcelona. Pepita attributes her longevity to a healthy diet and dancing. She attends a local dance club, La Paloma, every Sunday. Despite being thin, she takes medication for high blood pressure and monitors her cholesterol levels. 'She also enjoys taking the occasional chocolate with churros,' notes Dr. Peña. Pepita has been an entrepreneur, running a restaurant, butcher shop, and hair salon, and has overcome various challenges, including surviving two world wars and a civil war. Her greatest hardship was being separated from her husband multiple times due to societal norms. A video of Pepita, offering advice on staying young, has gone viral on social media, with over 1.5 million views in just three days. Dr. Peña believes that Spain's high life expectancy is a 'demographic bomb' that requires a proactive approach, and that long-lived individuals have stopped giving up on their dreams. 'Age is not an obstacle, but an opportunity to live better, happier, and healthier,' as reflected in the 'Guide to Living Healthy 120 Years.' Pepita passed the longevity test with flying colors.

**Syrians Return to Homeland to Celebrate Eid al-Adha**
Thousands of Syrians who fled their country due to the civil war and have been living in Turkey for years have begun to return to their homeland to celebrate Eid al-Adha. At the Cilvegözü Border Gate, a large crowd has formed as people wait to return to their country. Mahmut Karzu, an 18-year-old who fled Syria at the age of 8 and has been living in Turkey for 10 years, said, 'We came to Turkey in 2015 and have been living here for 10 years, and now we are returning to our country with the joy of Eid al-Adha. I am very happy to return, but I am also sad because I have lost my friends that I made here in Turkey. I love the Turkish people, and I am grateful for their hospitality. We are two states and one nation, and we will always be together.' Fehmi Alamo, who has been living in Turkey for 10 years, said, 'I would like to thank the Turkish people for their hospitality, and I will never forget Turkey.' The crowd at the border gate is expected to grow in the coming days as more people return to their homeland to celebrate Eid al-Adha.

**Ukraine's Desperate Measures to Recruit Soldiers for the War Effort**
The Ukrainian government is struggling to recruit young soldiers for the war effort, with many refusing to fight. To address this issue, the government has lowered the age limit for conscription to 25, and has also mobilized women doctors and even disabled individuals. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has launched a recruitment campaign, including advertisements on social media and television, offering incentives such as Netflix subscriptions and burgers. However, the campaign has been met with criticism, with some accusing the government of trying to deceive young people into fighting. The Russian military has been making gains on the battlefield, with many Ukrainian soldiers deserting or refusing to fight. The Ukrainian government is also facing criticism for its handling of the war, with some accusing it of using civilians as human shields. The article also mentions that the number of millionaires in Ukraine has increased by 60% in recent years, and that the war is seen as a lucrative business by the Ukrainian government. The article concludes that the Ukrainian government is desperate to keep the war going, and is willing to use any means necessary to achieve its goals.

**Pierre Dardot on the War Civil: A Total War Against Society**
Pierre Dardot discusses the concept of 'war civil' in the context of neoliberalism, arguing that it is a total war that affects all aspects of society, including culture, economy, and social relations. He explains that the war civil is not a traditional conflict between two armies, but rather a struggle between the dominant and the dominated, where the dominant use power to maintain their control. Dardot also discusses the role of the state in this war, arguing that it is not a neutral entity, but rather a participant in the conflict. He also touches on the topic of artificial intelligence, suggesting that it can be used to predict and control human behavior, and that this can be a powerful tool for those in power. Additionally, Dardot discusses the role of China in this global war, arguing that it is a unique case where a non-neoliberal government is able to integrate into the global neoliberal system. He also explores the relationship between the reduction of natalidad and the war civil, suggesting that it is a tool used by those in power to control populations. Finally, Dardot discusses the idea of a rebellion against the war civil, suggesting that it can take many forms, including the refusal to have children.

**Women with fractures - medics say they're 'too young' for osteoporosis**
Michelle Clark, 62, suffered two serious bone breaks before being diagnosed with osteoporosis. Her children urged her to get a DEXA scan, which revealed she had unknowingly fractured her spine. Michelle is speaking out as part of The Mail on Sunday's War On Osteoporosis campaign, highlighting the need for better diagnosis and treatment of the condition. The NHS recommends assessing adults over 50 who suffer fragility fractures for osteoporosis, but this is often not done. A 2021 report found many women in their 50s and early 60s are dismissed or misdiagnosed, and the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Osteoporosis and Bone Health reported in 2023 that tens of thousands of women are missing out on timely diagnosis and treatment. Michelle believes she could have gone undiagnosed for years if her children hadn't intervened. She is calling for every part of the UK to be served by a specialist clinic, known as a fracture liaison service (FLS), to screen patients for osteoporosis after a break.

**Remembering fallen servicemembers on Memorial Day - The Carolina Peacemaker**
On Memorial Day, somber observances were held in Guilford County to honor fallen U.S. military servicemembers. At memorials and cemeteries, high praise was given to those who died in combat, with a focus on the often-overlooked courage of Black Americans who fought for a country that had not yet fully fought for them. Justin Washington, a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2087, said, 'Today, as we stand in the quiet dignity of Maplewood Cemetery’s military section, we pause to reflect, not just on sacrifice, but on strength.' He specifically mentioned Pvt. First Class Howard Lee Haynie, a dump truck driver in World War II, who served honorably despite being segregated by policy. The event also highlighted the rehabilitation and expansion of the 23-year-old Guilford County Veterans’ Memorial. Retired U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Jeff Colt emphasized the importance of remembering the names of all military men and women who died in combat.

**Path To 2075: Goldman Counters Demographic Time Bomb Narrative With Positive Spin**
Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius and his team argue that global aging is not a crisis, but a manageable demographic transition with positive economic implications. They point out that the working-age ratio (ages 15-64) has declined from 67% in 2000 to 63% today and is projected to fall further to 57% by 2075 in developed economies. In contrast, Elon Musk has warned that 'low birth rates will end civilization.' Hatzius and his team see this transition as an opportunity, particularly for developed markets. In emerging market economies, the working-age ratio is currently near its peak at 66% but is expected to drop to 61% over the next 50 years.

**Bombs To Starbucks, US Veteran Remembers End Of Vietnam War 50 Years On**
Chuck Searcy, an 81-year-old Vietnam War veteran, has witnessed the dramatic warming of relations between the US and Vietnam. Searcy, who now lives in northern Vietnam, remembers the prophetic words of a South Vietnamese soldier he met in the 1960s: 'Until you get out of our country, we will never get peace.' The Vietnam War lasted for two decades and killed nearly 60,000 Americans and three million Vietnamese. However, Vietnam's median age is now below 35, and youths may rather link the notion of a conflict with America to the current trade war. The former foes have now turned into close economic partners, with US multinationals running large manufacturing operations in Vietnam. Searcy has remained in Vietnam since 1994, helping its people fight a different war against unexploded mines through his project, Project Renew. He is still impressed by the resilience and pragmatism of Vietnamese people, including their ability to adapt to the threat of crippling tariffs from the Trump administration. 'We are still making life very difficult for the Vietnamese,' Searcy said. 'I felt this overwhelming sense of relief that it was over after such a long agony,' Searcy told Reuters about the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975. However, his elation for the end of the war 'was mixed with great concern' about Vietnamese friends who had supported the US army and whose lives may have been in jeopardy.

**Will We Push the Limits of Human Longevity?**
The number of centenarians has significantly increased, with new age groups emerging, including those over 105 years old and 'supercentenarians' over 110 years old. This raises the question of whether the limits of human longevity will be pushed back. A database hosted by the Ined (Institut national d'études démographiques) collects validated cases of people who died at 105 years or older in 12 countries. Analysis of the data provides some answers. In France, the number of centenarians has increased 30-fold since 1970, with women outnumbering men in all age groups. By 2024, there will be 30,000 centenarians, and by 2070, there will be 200,000. The increase in centenarians is due to advances in healthcare throughout their lives. The number of supercentenarians is also increasing, with 924 cases in 2020. However, the number of centenarians decreased in 2021 and 2022 due to the arrival of 'classes creuses' born during World War I. The mortality rate for men is still higher than for women, with a 'surmortalité chronique' for men. The question remains whether there is a ceiling to human longevity, with some demographers estimating that the risk of death increases exponentially with age, while others propose a plateau of mortality.

**Revisited - Fifty years after Lebanon's civil war, ex-fighters warn young people against violence**
Veterans of Lebanon's civil war are warning young people about the dangers of violence, 50 years after the conflict began. They are sharing their experiences with the country's warring militias and how they broke away from their respective parties. With the threat of war still present, they are concerned that young Lebanese, who do not learn about the conflict in school, will follow in their footsteps and fall into the cycle of violence. As Sophie Guignon and Chloé Domat report, these veterans are speaking out to prevent history from repeating itself.

**South Korea's 'Psychological Civil War' and the Need for National Integration**
Despite the Constitutional Court's decision to impeach former President Yoon, the country still has a long way to go in terms of social integration. The 'psychological civil war' that has been ongoing since the December 3rd coup has led to a deepening of the conflict between the two political camps. The conflict has become so intense that even the recent forest fires in the southeastern region were accused of being a 'terrorist attack' by the opposing side. Professor Gu Jeong-woo of Sungkyunkwan University's Department of Sociology expressed concern that 'the current situation is more intense than the anti-communist sentiment after the Korean War' and that 'in a democracy, political competition is a natural phenomenon, but when we view our opponents as enemies rather than competitors, it leads to coexistence rather than mutual destruction.' The conflict has also led to generational, gender, and regional divisions. According to a Gallup poll conducted last month, 57% of 18-29-year-olds, 69% of 30-year-olds, 76% of 40-year-olds, and 72% of 50-year-olds supported the impeachment of former President Yoon. However, 47% of 60-year-olds and 59% of those over 70 opposed the impeachment. The generational conflict has also affected daily life, with parents and children disagreeing over politics and even family members becoming embarrassed when discussing politics. The phenomenon of young men becoming more conservative has also been notable. Political YouTubers have also been accused of promoting 'confirmation bias' and 'echo chambers,' leading to a decline in trust in the media and the judiciary. The situation has become so dire that even the courts and the Constitutional Court have been attacked. Professor Gu emphasized that 'in order to achieve national integration, we need to focus on constitutional values and declare that politicians will no longer engage in political revenge.'

**'Psychological Civil War' in South Korea: A Nation Divided**
South Korea is experiencing a 'psychological civil war' with deepening political divisions. The uncertainty surrounding President Yoon Suk-yeol's impeachment has been alleviated, but the conflict between political parties has intensified. The opposition has labeled the other side as 'anti-national forces' and 'treasonous collaborators', while the ruling party has used derogatory terms such as 'red' and 'conservative'. Even the recent forest fire disaster was falsely attributed to 'anti-national forces'. According to Professor Gu Jeong-woo of Sungkyunkwan University, 'the current situation is more intense than the anti-communist sentiment after the Korean War.' He warns that 'in a democracy, political competition is a natural phenomenon, but when we view our opponents as enemies rather than competitors, coexistence becomes extermination.' The political divide has also led to generational, gender, and regional conflicts. A Gallup poll found that 57% of 18-29-year-olds, 69% of 30-year-olds, 76% of 40-year-olds, and 72% of 50-year-olds supported the impeachment, while 47% of 60-year-olds and 34% of 70-year-olds and above opposed it. The conflict has affected daily life, with parents and children disagreeing over politics on YouTube, and families arguing over political issues. The phenomenon of conservative 20-30-year-old men has also been notable. The conflict has also led to a breakdown in trust in democratic institutions, including the judiciary, the Constitutional Court, and the media. The attack on the judiciary has been particularly egregious, with the Seoul Western District Court being vandalized after President Yoon's arrest, and the Seoul Central District Court being threatened and criticized after his release. The Constitutional Court has also been threatened with violence. The YouTube channel has become a platform for spreading biased information, with some YouTubers promoting their own agendas and reinforcing confirmation bias. The upcoming early presidential election is expected to be just as intense as the impeachment trial, with concerns about the need for national unity. According to former Justice Minister Lee Suk-yeon, 'in the upcoming election, politicians will again claim that the other side is spreading biased information. We need to declare that we will not engage in political revenge and instead focus on national unity and the values of the Constitution.'

At a press conference on March 30, 98-year-old 'old soldier' Pan Chang-fa, a member of the 'Independent Constitutional Guard' of the Youth Army, emphasized the brutality of war and the importance of preserving peace. Pan said, 'I have seen the aftermath of the Korean War, and I want to remind people to cherish the peace we have achieved.' Two other 'old soldiers' from the Youth Army attended the event, including 102-year-old Li Qingyong, a member of the 207th Division, and 102-year-old Liu Fagui, a member of the 201st Division who participated in the Battle of Guningtou.

Lee also emphasized the importance of preserving history and not letting 'falsehoods become truths' due to politics. Professor Yang Weizhen, who spoke at the event, said, 'My father was a member of the 209th Division of the Youth Army and participated in the eight-year war and four-year civil war. He spent the most precious 12 years of his life on the battlefield.'

**Four Issues Remain Unresolved in Federal Civil Service Bill**
The federal civil service bill has reached an agreement, but four issues remain unresolved. According to Ram Hari Khatiwada, the chairman of the State Administration and Good Governance Committee, there is an agreement to increase the retirement age from 58 to 60 years. However, there is no consensus on whether to implement this immediately or over a period of 6/6 months or 1/1 year. The Public Service Commission has suggested implementing it immediately, but lawmakers have suggested that it would be better to implement it in the first year at 59 and in the second year at 60. Another unresolved issue is whether to appoint or not appoint additional secretaries. The parliamentary subcommittee has sought the opinions of the Public Service Commission and the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs on this issue. After receiving their opinions, the lawmakers believe that a consensus will be reached on this issue. The third unresolved issue is the tenure of the Secretary and Chief Secretary. The current tenure is 5 years for the Secretary and 3 years for the Chief Secretary. There is a proposal to reduce the tenure to 3 years for the Secretary and 2 years for the Chief Secretary. The parliamentary subcommittee has also not reached a consensus on the issue of trade unions. According to the subcommittee members, there is no opposition to having trade unions, but it cannot be the same as it is now. The opinions of the Public Service Commission and the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs have been sought on this issue. After receiving their opinions, a consensus will be reached on this issue. The proposed federal civil service bill has provision for trade unions to continue as it is now. This provision is made in Article 131 of the proposed bill. This provision was made after the second amendment to the Civil Service Act in 2064 BS. At that time, eight national-level trade unions were registered with the Ministry of Labor. Since then, these trade unions have been affiliated with political parties and have been in controversy over whether to continue as trade unions or not. This issue has been raised again during the amendment of the Civil Service Act. The proposed bill has been tabled in the parliament and the issue of trade unions has been raised again. In 2075 BS, a civil service bill was tabled in the parliament, but it was withdrawn in 2078 BS. The current parliament session has also seen the tabling of a civil service bill, but the issue of trade unions remains unresolved. ' said, 'It is not possible to have the same trade unions as it is now.'

**Nearly Half of Young Israelis Show Signs of War-Related PTSD**
A recent study by Ben-Gurion University of the Negev found that nearly half of young Israelis, particularly those aged 18-30, are showing signs of war-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study, which surveyed 1,216 participants before the war and 915 after, found that the rate of PTSD among young people surged from 25% to 42% after the war, with those evacuated from their homes experiencing a rate of 60%. The researchers identified key risk factors for post-traumatic symptoms, including perceived threats, emotional coping strategies, loss of loved ones, and forced evacuation. However, they also found that protective factors such as personal resilience and social support have significantly declined. Dr. Stav Shapira said, 'This is one of the groups that was most significantly affected. There is a high proportion of reserve service members, spouses of soldiers, victims of the war, and more.' Prof. Tehila Refaeli warned that these protective factors are diminishing in the current environment, saying, 'We found that in the current reality, they are not protective factors, and there is a decrease in personal resilience and social support alongside an increase in psychological distress variables.' The study calls for policies tailored to young people's specific needs, including programs to strengthen resilience, rebuild support networks, and expand mental health services with a focus on trauma treatment.
