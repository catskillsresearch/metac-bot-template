**De Lima hits Escudero's uncertainty: Sara Duterte's trial not optional**
Congresswoman-elect Leila de Lima has expressed her disappointment with Senate President Chiz Escudero's uncertainty about Vice President Sara Duterte's impeachment trial. De Lima stated, 'I was expecting more from the statements, from the pronouncements of the Senate president.' She emphasized that the trial is not optional and that the Senate has a constitutional mandate to act on impeachments 'forthwith.' De Lima criticized the delay in the trial, calling it 'clearly violative' of the Constitution. She also mentioned that the trial has been repeatedly stalled, with the latest postponement being Escudero's decision to delay the reading of the impeachment articles from June 2 to June 11. De Lima stated, 'For me, the impeachment trial at this stage, the convening of the impeachment court and also the proceeding with the impeachment trial is not optional.' She also mentioned that it is likely that the matter will be brought before the Supreme Court if the Senate skips the trial.

**Constitutional Court likely to declare amnesty law constitutional**
The Constitutional Court (TC) is likely to declare the amnesty law constitutional after reviewing the draft ruling by Vice-President Inmaculada Montalbán. The draft, which will be discussed in the Plenary session on June 24, gives the green light to the law promoted by the Government. According to legal sources, the draft does not explicitly evaluate the crime of malversation, a key figure in understanding why the Supreme Court (TS) has excluded leaders like Carles Puigdemont and Oriol Junqueras from the amnesty. The Supreme Court argues that malversation in the context of the procés falls within the exceptions listed in the law, as the separatist leaders obtained a personal benefit and used public funds for partisan purposes. Additionally, they argue that the facts affected the economic interests of the European Union, another exception contemplated in the norm. This approach has allowed the TS to maintain active the national arrest warrants against Puigdemont, Toni Comín, and Lluis Puig, as well as preserving the penalties of disqualification for Junqueras and other convicted until 2031. Even if the TC declares the law constitutional, the Supreme Court's jurisprudence would leave these measures in place. Montalbán's proposal was distributed among the magistrates of the Constitutional Court on Monday for prior study before the Plenary session on June 10, where it will be formally presented. The final vote is scheduled for the second Plenary session of the month, which begins on June 24. The president of the TC, Cándido Conde-Pumpido, has already ruled out the possibility of paralyzing the procedure until the European Court of Justice (ECJ) resolves pending prejudicial questions. According to his opinion, the constitutional control exercised by the TC is independent of what other courts decide. The Partido Popular has also requested that Conde-Pumpido abstain from participating in this case, alleging a possible conflict of interest due to his wife's position in the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ). From the progressive majority of the tribunal, they qualify this movement as a 'dilatory maneuver' without a legal basis.

**Supreme Court Revives Original Logo, Removes Glass Partitions Under CJI Gavai**
The Supreme Court, under Chief Justice B.R. Gavai, has restored its original logo and removed the glass partitions installed in its corridors for centralized air-conditioning. The partitions were criticized by lawyers and employees for making the building less accessible and disrupting natural movement and airflow. The SCBA and Advocates-on-Record Association had called the partitions unnecessary and poorly planned, citing insufficient consultation. According to the SCBA and Advocates-on-Record Association, the removal of the partitions is a step in the right direction, saying 'it is a welcome move that will improve the accessibility and aesthetic appeal of the Supreme Court building.'

**Lula: 'If I'm as handsome as I am, the far-right won't return to govern Brazil'**
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated on Sunday (1/6) in Recife that, if he has his way, the far-right will not return to govern the country. 'If I'm as handsome as I am, as passionate as I am, and as motivated as I am, the far-right will not return to govern this country', he said. Lula emphasized the importance of his party, the PT, gaining a majority in the Senate in the next elections to prevent their opponents from controlling the House, which has the power to determine the impeachment of Supreme Court justices. He also defended Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes, who may face sanctions from the Trump administration related to decisions that block the operation of the Rumble social network in Brazil and punish users. 'The US wants to prosecute Alexandre de Moraes because he wants to arrest a Brazilian citizen who is in the US and working against Brazil all day', Lula said. 'What's the story with criticizing the Brazilian Justice system? I've never criticized their Justice system, and they do a lot of barbarity'.

**Lula: 'If I'm as handsome as I am today, the extreme right will never govern this country again'**
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated on Sunday, June 1, that he needs to be '100% healthy' to run for re-election in 2026. Lula also criticized the Trump administration's plan to act against Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes and emphasized the importance of focusing on the Senate election. 'If I'm as handsome as I am today, as passionate as I am, and as motivated as I am, the extreme right will never govern this country again,' Lula said at the PSB national congress, attended by Vice President Geraldo Alckmin. Lula's health, at 79 years old, is a concern for allies planning his re-election bid. In 2024, he suffered a fall and underwent procedures to stop an intracranial bleeding episode. Lula also emphasized the importance of the Senate elections in 2026, as Bolsonarists plan to elect a 'superbancada' to confront the Supreme Court and approve impeachment of ministers, especially Moraes. 'We need to preserve the institutions that guarantee democracy in this country. If we destroy what we don't like, nothing will be left,' Lula added. Moraes has become a target of the Trump administration after decisions by the Brazilian magistrate affected digital platforms in the United States and allies of the White House, such as Elon Musk. Lula also defended the Brazilian justice system, saying, 'The United States wants to process Alexandre de Moraes because he wants to arrest a Brazilian citizen who is in the United States doing something against Brazil all day. What's the story of the United States criticizing the Brazilian justice system? I never criticized their justice. They commit so many atrocities and wars, I never criticized them.'

**New rules for removing Judges require broader input, not speed - Kpebu**
Private legal practitioner Martin Kpebu has expressed concerns over the government's plan to fast-track new legislation regulating the removal of justices from Ghana's superior courts. Kpebu emphasized the need for extensive stakeholder engagement and thorough consultation before passing such crucial rules. 'I don't know how we can pass that law in less than three months. Let's take time on it, it will require a lot of input', he stated. The proposed regulations aim to strengthen judicial accountability while safeguarding the independence of the judiciary, but Kpebu insists that the legislative process must not be rushed at the expense of legal soundness and democratic integrity. 'These are delicate issues that affect our democracy and justice system. We must take the time to get it right,' he urged. The development signals the government's push to address perceived gaps in the legal system, but also raises questions about timing and motive as the case involving the suspended Chief Justice unfolds.

**Make the impeachment process apolitical**
Recently, 64 members of Parliament and seven recently retired MPs from seven opposition parties moved a notice for impeachment of Chief Justice Dipak Misra, accusing him of 'misbehaviour' and 'misuse of authority'. The notice was rejected by the chairman of the Rajya Sabha after consulting legal and constitutional experts. The opposition parties decided to file an appeal in the Supreme Court to review the chairman's decision, but later withdrew the notice after being aggrieved by the court's order. The impeachment process is stringent, requiring a special majority in both houses of Parliament and the President's approval. Kapil Sibal, former minister, observed that he does not accept the impeachment process if political parties in the opposition are involved. The article argues that the impeachment process should be apolitical to ensure the accountability of the judiciary and maintain its credibility. Rai, former comptroller and auditor general, emphasizes the need to strengthen institutions and rise above political and narrow confines to ensure a bright future for citizens.

**Sheinbaum Calls for Voting to Renew the Judicial Power**
Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, the President of Mexico, has called on citizens to participate in the election of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation on June 1, 2025, describing it as a historic day for Mexico. For the first time in the country, the people of Mexico will have the opportunity to directly elect the ministers and judges of the Supreme Court. Sheinbaum Pardo emphasized that the election of the Judicial Power by the people of Mexico aims to establish a 'honest and close to the people' judicial power. She denied various claims surrounding this process, stating that it is false that this election seeks to maintain a corrupt and privileged regime in the Judicial Power, or that it is an appropriation of the Supreme Court by a political party, or that she intends to 'put in line' the ministers. Sheinbaum Pardo highlighted that if the goal was to replicate the scenario of 1999, a judicial reform would have been made to remove all ministers and allow the then-president to appoint new ones. However, in this case, the decision rests with the people of Mexico. 'It is in your hands, in your decision, who will form part of the new Judicial Power.' She also emphasized that this election represents 'the great transformation that our country decides.'

**SCJN Dismisses Allegations Against Minister Yasmín Esquivel**
The Supreme Court of Justice (SCJN) has dismissed the allegations against Minister Yasmín Esquivel, who is one of the three incumbent ministers competing in the upcoming judicial election. The court ruled that ministers cannot be held responsible for administrative sanctions because there is no legal framework to allow it. According to the court, 'while there is no legislative framework that develops with precision the faults that can be attributed to the ministers and ministers of the Supreme Court, as well as the sanctions and procedure to follow for their determination, they cannot be reproached with administrative responsibility to avoid interfering with their high judicial function.' The court also stated that the new Judicial Discipline Tribunal (TDJ), which will begin operations in September, will not be able to hold ministers accountable, as the Constitution only allows for their removal from office through impeachment or a trial for a crime. This decision comes after a two-year investigation into allegations that Esquivel plagiarized her undergraduate thesis in 1987. The court has dismissed the allegations, citing the lack of clarity on the applicable legal framework.

**Lawmakers Push for Impeachment of Judge Makintach Over Maradona Trial Scandal**
Lawmakers in the province of Buenos Aires are pushing for a new impeachment trial against Judge Julieta Makintach, following a scandal over unauthorized filming for a documentary about the trial of Diego Maradona's death. 'Grave daño institucional provocado' (grave institutional damage caused), they stated. The lawmakers, from the Unión por la Patria (UxP) party, along with other parliamentary blocs in the province, are seeking to impeach Judge Makintach, citing her 'improper and negligent behavior' in authorizing the filming, which they say is 'incompatible with the dignity required of the Magistrature and compromises the due process, institutionalism, and public trust in the Justice'. The lawmakers 'reaffirmed their commitment to an independent, ethical, and transparent Justice' while expressing 'deep concern over the institutional damage caused by these events'. The project, presented last Thursday, has the signatures of various factions. 'The actions of Judge Makintach must be investigated with the utmost rigor possible', they concluded. Judge Makintach, appointed in December 2016, is at the center of the controversy after the Supreme Court of Justice of Buenos Aires suspended her from her position and imposed a 90-day leave. The court also ordered the transfer of the case to the Procurator General, to evaluate 'the act of the Dra. Makintach in the terms of the Law N° 13.661 (of the impeachment of magistrates)', according to the resolution signed by the president of the tribunal, Hilda Kogan, the vice-president Sergio Gabriel Torres, and the minister Daniel Fernando Soria.

**What happens when a Supreme Court or High Court judge resigns?**
The Indian government is considering a motion of impeachment against Supreme Court Justice Yashwant Verma. A committee appointed by the Supreme Court found him guilty of misconduct after a large amount of cash was found burned at his official residence in Delhi. If Justice Verma does not resign voluntarily, the government will move a motion of impeachment in the parliament. The motion requires the support of at least 100 members of the Lok Sabha or 50 members of the Rajya Sabha. If the motion is passed, a three-member committee will investigate the matter and submit a report to the parliament. If the report finds the judge guilty, the motion will be put to a vote in both houses of parliament. If the motion is passed in both houses, the President will issue an order removing the judge from office. According to Article 124(4) of the Indian Constitution, a Supreme Court judge can only be removed by the President on the recommendation of both houses of parliament after a speech. A Supreme Court judge must submit his resignation to the President. Similarly, Article 217 of the Indian Constitution states that the appointment and conditions of service of High Court judges are made by the President. High Court judges can be removed by the President at any time before they reach the age of 62 or earlier. Like Supreme Court judges, High Court judges must also submit their resignation to the President.

**CBF President Ednaldo Rodrigues Removed from Office by Court Decision**
The Court of Justice of Rio de Janeiro has ordered the removal of the current leadership of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), including President Ednaldo Rodrigues, according to a decision released on Thursday. One of the vice-presidents of the CBF, Fernando Sarney, who requested the removal of Rodrigues, was appointed as the interim administrator of the entity and tasked with holding elections for the leadership positions 'as soon as possible.' The CBF stated that it would not comment on the matter immediately. The case refers to an alleged forgery of the signature of former CBF President Antônio Carlos Nunes de Lima, also known as Coronel Nunes, in an agreement with Rodrigues earlier this year, which effectively allowed Rodrigues to be re-elected as president until 2030. The decision was made after the Supreme Court (STF) initially rejected the request for Rodrigues' removal, but ordered the Rio Justice to investigate possible irregularities in the agreement. The judge, Gabriel de Oliveira Zefiro, stated that it was not possible to hear from Nunes because his defense claimed health issues that prevented him from attending a hearing. The judge also noted that Nunes' mental capacity 'has been in doubt since 2018, when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.' The judge declared the agreement null and void, citing Nunes' 'incapacity and possible forgery of his signature.' The judge further stated that the consequence of this decision is the recognition of the illegitimacy of the current administration of the CBF, which must be replaced by 'licit and lawful elections'.

**Historian Jeon Han-gil and JK Kim Dong-wook Express Disappointment and Frustration with Yoon's Impeachment**
Historian Jeon Han-gil and JK Kim Dong-wook, who have publicly supported former President Yoon Suk-yeol, expressed their disappointment and frustration with the Constitutional Court's decision to impeach and remove Yoon from office. Jeon Han-gil, who has been live-streaming the court's decision on his YouTube channel, said, 'I'm sorry to all the citizens who have supported me in opposing Yoon's impeachment and calling for his return to office.' He also stated, 'We believed in the values of national unity, the protection of freedom and democracy, and a society that respects the law, justice, and common sense.' However, he ultimately collapsed in despair, covering his face with his hands. JK Kim Dong-wook, who has been known for his outspoken support for Yoon, wrote on his social media, 'Never never never change!! (절대 절대 절대 변하지 않는다)' and 'I was skeptical when I saw videos predicting that 2060 would be the year of South Korea's collapse, but I didn't think it would happen so soon. I've changed my mind. I think South Korea will collapse even faster than the world expects.' He also expressed his support for the 2030 generation, who he believes fought hard against the anti-national forces that opposed Yoon's impeachment.

**US Supreme Court Chief Justice Contradicts Trump's Campaign to Impeach Judge**
US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has contradicted Donald Trump's campaign to impeach the federal judge in Washington who ordered a halt to the deportation flights of over 200 Venezuelans to El Salvador's prisons. While it is still being investigated whether the White House deliberately ignored the judge's resolution, the US President has asked Congress to initiate a process to remove the judge. In a statement released shortly after, the Supreme Court Chief Justice pointed out that that is not the solution. 'For over two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement over a judicial decision', Roberts said in a statement issued by the court. 'The normal process of appeal exists for that purpose'. Roberts is part of the conservative majority of the Supreme Court, although he is a moderate figure. He was appointed to the position by former President George W. Bush. Trump had requested the removal of Judge James Boasberg on Tuesday morning, who issued the judicial order to halt the deportation of Venezuelans under the Enemy Aliens Act. In a post on Truth Social, Trump attacked Boasberg, calling him 'radical left-wing lunatic'. For the first time, Trump supported the requests of Elon Musk and his vice president, JD Vance, to remove judges who have blocked government actions, and asked Congress to initiate an impeachment process against Boasberg. The White House challenged the judiciary by deporting over 200 Venezuelans to El Salvador's prisons, despite the judicial resolution. The official argument was that the flight had already taken off before the judge issued the written order. Although the Trump government insists that the deportation flight took off just before the judge issued the written order, the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, hinted yesterday that the verbal order had been ignored. Boasberg had given until today at noon for the written certification that no person had been deported once the judicial directive had taken effect. Boasberg convened a hearing on Monday to determine why his order, apparently, had been ignored by the White House. The Department of Justice argued that 'an oral order is not executed as a judicial order [written]'. The government lawyer, Abhishek Kambli, refused to answer any detailed questions about the deportation flights and defended that Trump had broad authority to expel immigrants with little or no legal process, under the Enemy Aliens Act. Therefore, Boasberg gave until today at noon for the US government to certify in writing that no person had been deported after the written order took effect. This is key information to determine if the authority was finally disobeyed. Beyond the lack of cooperation, before the hearing began, the Department of Justice attempted to cancel it and, in an even more extreme move, requested that the federal appeals court that oversees the judge remove Boasberg from the case.

**Justice Joymalya Bagchi appointed to Supreme Court, likely Chief Justice in 2031**
Justice Joymalya Bagchi of the Calcutta High Court has been appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court, following a recommendation from the Supreme Court collegium.

The collegium considered the fact that the Supreme Court bench currently has only one judge from the Calcutta High Court. Justice Bagchi has recently heard cases on financial mismanagement and raised concerns about corruption in higher offices. With his appointment, the Supreme Court will reach its sanctioned strength of 34 judges.

**Right-wing Historian Visits Hunger Striking Lawmaker, Exchanges Scarf with Slogans**
Right-wing historian Han Gil visited the National Assembly's Rotenburger Hall, where Park Su-young, a member of the People Power Party, is on a hunger strike to protest the appointment of Constitutional Court Justice Ma Eun-hyuk. Han Gil said, 'In a situation where fairness and common sense are collapsing, shouldn't we do anything to protect the country like the independence fighters did during the Japanese colonial period?' He added, 'If I hadn't had a scheduled lecture tomorrow, I would have joined the hunger strike.' Park replied, 'Why don't you lead the enlightenment of 2030 young people instead of doing something outside?' Before parting ways, Han Gil took off his red scarf and put it around Park's neck, exchanging it with the scarf Park was wearing, which had the slogans 'The president elected by the people will return' and 'Impeachment nullification' along with a photo of President Yoon Suk-yeol. Park is continuing her hunger strike, demanding that the Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court, who was appointed without the consent of the opposition parties, step down. She vowed to continue the strike until the Chief Justice announces that he will not appoint Ma Eun-hyuk as the president.

**Falso que Norma Piña publicó una carta en defensa del catolicismo**
A message circulating on social media claims that Norma Piña, the president of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN), wrote a letter defending Catholicism in response to a request to remove a 'cross from the office'. However, this message has been circulating since at least 2014, when it was attributed to a judge in Argentina. We found no official information that a request was made to Norma Piña to remove a 'cross from the office', nor that she responded in writing to the request. Sources from the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation denied that the letter was written by Norma Piña. This is not the first time that Norma Piña has been the subject of misinformation. In December 2024, a false claim circulated on social media that she had announced her intention to run for President of Mexico in 2030. Norma Piña has announced her resignation from the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, effective August 31, 2025, due to her refusal to participate in the election of the Judicial Power (PJ).

**SA's judiciary in 2025: a watershed moment in a watershed year**
2025 is a critical year for the South African judiciary, with several reforms initiated in previous years expected to bear fruit. However, major reforms are still pending, which could compromise the judiciary's independence and effectiveness. The year started with a dramatic case of sexual harassment allegations against Eastern Cape Division of the High Court Judge President Selby Mbenenge, who is being investigated by a judicial conduct tribunal. Meanwhile, several judges are facing disciplinary proceedings, including Gauteng Division of the High Court Judge Nana Makhubele, who was found guilty of gross misconduct for holding a position that is incompatible with judicial office. The Judicial Service Commission (JSC) is under pressure to finalize the matter and may recommend her impeachment and removal from office. Chief Justice Mandisa Maya has undertaken to develop a comprehensive policy to deal with sexual harassment in the judiciary, which is currently being revised. The JSC also needs to adopt a written code of conduct to set high ethical standards for its members. Additionally, the judiciary is facing a shortage of judges, with a crisis at the Gauteng Division of the High Court, where the earliest trial dates are only available in 2030. The National Treasury needs to allocate funds for the appointment of acting judges to deal with the backlogs. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court is facing a decline in its performance, with appeals taking longer to be processed and judgments taking longer to be delivered. President Cyril Ramaphosa needs to urgently nominate a new Deputy Chief Justice to fill the position vacated by Judge Maya. Chief Justice Maya needs to take proactive steps to invite the brightest judges to apply for permanent appointment. The JSC also needs to adopt a written code of conduct to set high ethical standards for its members. The year 2025 presents a mixed bag of prospects for the South African judiciary, requiring dedicated leadership from Chief Justice Maya and the support of the president, the minister, and Parliament.
