**Insider Claims Rockstar Could Be Working on Two More Titles**
According to an insider named Tez2, Rockstar Games may be working on two more titles in addition to Grand Theft Auto VI. The insider suggests that a Grand Theft Auto IV port for modern platforms could be released as early as this year, followed by a Max Payne 3 port. This rumor may be related to the takedown of the Liberty City Preservation Project, an ambitious mod project that aimed to add Liberty City to GTA V. However, this is just a rumor and should be taken with a grain of salt until Rockstar Games or Take-Two Interactive officially confirms it. Meanwhile, Grand Theft Auto VI is set to be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X | S on May 26, 2026.

**Rockstar Delays Release of 'Grand Theft Auto VI' to 2026**
Rockstar Games has delayed the release of 'Grand Theft Auto VI' from fall 2025 to May 2026, disappointing gamers and causing a significant drop in the company's stock value. The game's developer, Rockstar Games, stated, 'We expect that you will understand that we need more time to provide the level of quality that you expect.'
