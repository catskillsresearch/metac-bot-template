**Dragon's Dilemma: If China Cuts Water To India, Pakistan And Bangladesh Will Dry Out Too**
India's warnings about restricting the flow of Indus River waters to Pakistan have led to diplomatic tensions in the region. Pakistan has turned to China for help, but experts believe China's ability to use water as a strategic tool against India is limited. China's control over rivers originating in Tibet, such as the Sutlej and Brahmaputra, is constrained by geography and geopolitics, as these rivers also flow into Pakistan and Bangladesh. Any large-scale water manipulation by China risks regional blowback. India has accelerated its own countermeasures, including the Dibang Multipurpose Project in Arunachal Pradesh, which will serve as a buffer against sudden changes in the Brahmaputra's flow. 'This dam is India's insurance policy,' said a senior official in Ministry of Jal Shakti. The Brahmaputra supplies 30% of India's drinking water and powers 44% of its hydropower capacity, making it a crucial river for the country's livelihoods and food security.

**Natural and anthropogenic imprints on seasonal river water quality trends across China - npj Clean Water**
A study published in Nature analyzed the seasonal trends of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers across China. The results showed that 61.1% of watersheds exhibited a decreasing trend in COD concentrations between 2006 and 2020, while 64.7% of watersheds showed an increasing trend in DO concentrations. The study found that the seasonal dynamics of COD and DO concentrations varied across different regions, with a greater number of watersheds showing significant COD increases and DO decreases in the summer season. The study also found that anthropogenic factors, such as industrial activities and agricultural runoff, had a significant impact on water quality, with a greater tendency towards pronounced amplification of COD trends and strong suppression of DO trends. The study introduced the T-NM index to normalize and quantify differences in both the direction and magnitude of seasonal trends, and found that the impact of anthropogenic factors on water quality was region-specific. The study concluded that identifying such region-specific effects is critical for detecting management blind spots and optimizing intervention strategies, and that the findings provide critical systematic insights for optimizing watershed management strategies and improving water quality.

**Disaster-Prone Northeast**
The Northeastern region of India has been severely affected by the first round of monsoon rains, resulting in at least 30 human deaths and widespread destruction. Heavy rains, flash floods, and landslides have been reported across the region, with Guwahati and Imphal being the worst-hit areas. The situation has been described as 'grinding halt' due to urban floods. The region's governments and the Union government are being criticized for their lack of disaster preparedness, with many attributing the problem to human activities such as rapid deforestation, earth-cutting, and encroachment on riverbanks and wetlands. The media has reported that environmental clearances are often passed based on political considerations rather than environmental concerns. The article concludes that unplanned urbanization and climate change are exacerbating the region's woes. 'The Northeast is a disaster-prone region, and it's time for the governments to take responsibility for their actions,' said a layperson. 'Anybody can see that half the problem of disaster in the Northeast is man-made. We need to stop destroying nature and start working towards a sustainable future.'

**The Deadliest Disaster in History: A Devastating Earthquake in Shaanxi Province**
A new study has shed light on the event that resulted in the highest number of human casualties in a single day. According to the research, a disaster that occurred hundreds of years ago surpassed all other known cases in terms of tragedy, leaving a deep mark in human history. The main part of the deaths occurred in the province of Shaanxi in northwestern China. On January 23, 1556, a devastating earthquake occurred in the region, triggered by the movement of tectonic faults Weining and Huashan. The epicenter of the earthquake was located near the city of Huaxian, and, according to scientists' estimates, the disaster resulted in the deaths of approximately 830,000 people. However, no one knows the exact number of victims and those who died on the day of the earthquake. According to some data, about a third of the victims died as a result of building collapses, cave-ins, and landslides immediately after the earthquake. The others died in the following weeks from hunger and diseases. Although the magnitude of this earthquake was between 8 and 8.3 on the Richter scale - it was not the strongest that humanity has experienced - the tragedy in Shaanxi is considered the deadliest disaster in world history among similar events. The second deadliest disaster was also in China, but in 1976, resulting in the deaths of approximately 655,000 people. It is believed that the bloodiest day of the war was on the night of March 9-10, 1945, when the US bombing operation 'Operation Meetinghouse' resulted in the deaths of approximately 100,000 people in Tokyo. For comparison, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of the same year resulted in the deaths of approximately 66,000 and 39,000 people, respectively. The 1931 Yangtze-Huai River flood is often referred to as the largest natural disaster in history. Although the exact number of victims is still disputed, some researchers believe that over 2 million people died in central and eastern China over a period of four months.

**Why Pakistan-fired PL-15E missile's debris in India is China's worry**
During the recent aerial stand-off between India and Pakistan, debris from a Chinese PL-15E missile was found in India. The debris, which includes significant portions of the missile's propulsion, data-link, inertial unit, and advanced AESA seeker, has drawn global attention. India's defence scientists now possess the debris, leading to speculation about potential reverse-engineering to bolster India's own beyond-visual-range missile programmes. Chinese defence ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, saying 'India and Pakistan are neighbours who cannot be moved. We hope both sides will remain calm to avoid further complicating the situation.' The recovery of the PL-15E debris has sparked concerns in Beijing about technological leaks, as Pakistan's military arsenal heavily relies on Chinese equipment. This incident highlights the complex interplay of regional rivalries and global arms dynamics.

**India's alarm over Chinese spying rocks the surveillance industry**
India has introduced new security rules requiring manufacturers of CCTV cameras to submit hardware, software, and source code for assessment in government labs. The policy aims to address India's concerns about China's sophisticated surveillance capabilities, with 1 million Chinese-made cameras installed in government institutions. The rules apply to all internet-connected CCTV models made or imported since April 9, and manufacturers such as Hikvision, Xiaomi, and Hanwha must submit cameras for testing before they can sell them in India. India's cybersecurity chief, Gulshan Rai, said, 'There's always an espionage risk. Anyone can operate and control internet-connected CCTV cameras sitting in an adverse location. They need to be robust and secure.' The policy has sparked industry warnings of supply disruptions and added to a string of disputes between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration and foreign companies over regulatory issues and protectionism. The Indian government said the policy 'addresses a genuine security issue' and must be enforced. The testing policy has raised concerns among manufacturers, with some warning of 'millions of dollars will be lost from the industry, sending tremors through the market.'

**Choked By China, Rare Earth Crisis Threatens West’s EV Dreams While India’s Bajaj Auto Sounds The Alarm - Inventiva**
China's dominance in the global supply of rare earth minerals is causing concern for the West's electric vehicle (EV) dreams. The country controls over 90% of the refined supply of four magnet-critical rare earths, and its grip is tightening. The U.S. Geological Survey reports that China accounted for 69% of global rare earth production last year and holds nearly half the world's known reserves. Recycling rare earths is not a silver bullet, as the process is tricky, energy-hungry, and takes time. Bajaj Auto, an Indian two-wheeler giant, has sounded a warning that its electric scooter production could face a major hit as early as July if China's grip on rare earth magnet exports doesn't loosen up soon. The company's Executive Director, Rakesh Sharma, stated that the rare earth situation is 'a very difficult one' and that the bureaucratic labyrinth of approvals involving Indian ministries, the Chinese embassy, and local provincial authorities in China is causing a logjam. If the logjam isn't resolved soon, Sharma warned that 'production will definitely be impaired by July.'

**Indian Concerns over Chinese Spying Shock the Surveillance Industry**
The Indian government has introduced new security regulations for manufacturers of surveillance cameras, requiring them to submit hardware, software, and source code for evaluation in government laboratories. This has led to warnings in the industry about disruptions in the supply chain and has contributed to a series of disputes between the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and foreign companies over regulatory issues, which some see as protectionism. According to a high-ranking Indian official involved in policy-making, the move is partly driven by concerns over China's advanced surveillance capabilities. In 2021, Modi's then-junior minister of IT told parliament that 1 million cameras in government institutions were from Chinese companies and that there were vulnerabilities in the video data being sent to servers abroad. Under the new rules, which came into effect in April, manufacturers must offer their cameras for testing at Indian government laboratories before they can be sold in India. As Gulshan Rai, former head of cybersecurity in India from 2015 to 2019, said to Reuters, 'There is always a risk of espionage.'

**Border talks with India and Bhutan advancing, says China's white paper on security**
China's white paper on security highlights the country's challenges in maintaining its borders and surrounding areas due to external interference. The paper emphasizes the importance of building a strong military to face traditional and new security challenges. On Taiwan, China reaffirms its commitment to reunification and warns that it will not allow any attempts to separate any piece of Chinese territory. The paper also discusses the US-China rivalry, stating that the Thucydides Trap is not a historical destiny and that the containment of China is unwise and undesirable. China is willing to work with the US to explore a correct way for the two major countries to coexist, for the benefit of both countries and the world. The paper also lists non-traditional security challenges, including extreme climate disasters, terrorism, separatism, and major transnational epidemics, as serious security threats.

**Border talks with India and Bhutan advancing, says China's white paper on security; Highlights internal, external threats**
China's white paper on security highlights internal and external threats to the country. While China has made progress in border talks with India and Bhutan, it still faces disputes with these countries. China has also completed the demarcation of the Beibu Gulf waters with Vietnam and signed border defence cooperation agreements with nine neighboring countries. The paper emphasizes the importance of maintaining the leadership and ruling status of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the socialist system with Chinese characteristics. It also warns of external security pressure from Western anti-China forces, which are trying to contain and suppress China. The paper stresses the need to enhance political sensitivity and discernment, eliminate political risks, and prevent non-political risks from spreading into political risks. China is willing to work with the US to explore a correct way for the two major countries to get along, but warns that the containment of China is unwise, undesirable, and will not succeed. The paper also highlights non-traditional security challenges for China, including extreme climate disasters, terrorism, separatism, and major transnational epidemics.

**'Living Nostradamus' Predicts 'Partial Collapse' and Global Disasters**
Athos Salomé, a 38-year-old Brazilian known as the 'living Nostradamus', has made a concerning prediction. According to Salomé, a 'silent nuclear crisis' is underway due to global conflicts. He claims that 'the elite' is preparing for a disaster, while the public lives in an 'illusion of stability'. Salomé predicts a 'partial collapse' of the South Atlantic Meridional Circulation in 2025 due to a 'climatic event'. He also warns of wars that are not televised, but occur daily, and the formation of alliances between countries, including a 'route of innovation' between China and India. Additionally, he predicts droughts and tropical storms in Europe, a collapse of agriculture in South Asia and Africa, and floods in New York, Bombay, and Lagos. Salomé says, 'The time is not on our side, but knowledge may be.'

**Heat, hate and hegemony**
The recent escalation between India and Pakistan must be viewed in the context of a heating planet. The Indian Meteorological Department has predicted above-normal temperatures for this year, and the World Meteorological Organization announced that 2024 was the hottest year on record, with the world warming above the critical 1.5 C average threshold. Climate change is exacerbating devastating floods, landslides, and heatwaves in South Asia, threatening lives, livelihoods, and regional stability. India's attack on Pakistan has claimed over 55 lives, and each side is claiming victory. However, the military-industrial corporate complex plays a significant role in driving the anthropogenic climate crisis. India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, a decades-old water sharing agreement vital to Pakistan's survival, threatens the lives of farmers, fisherfolk, and entire ecologies dependent on the Indus River system. Climate change has already weakened the Indus system, and suspending the treaty will exacerbate the humanitarian disaster. The writer argues that climate change is not merely an environmental issue but a conflict and misery multiplier, deepening inequalities, fueling cross-border tensions, and destabilizing governments. Instead of escalating conflict, South Asia's leaders must invest in their people, build climate resilience, and ensure cooperation. The path to peace in South Asia lies in diplomacy and recognizing, prioritizing, and valuing shared ecological survival. 'The roaring fighter planes and bombs must not silence the warning sirens from a burning planet.'

**China's Involvement in India-Pakistan Tensions: A Disaster Waiting to Happen?**
Journalist Zeki Gümüş commented on China's involvement in the India-Pakistan tensions, saying, 'This will lead to a migration wave that the world cannot digest!' He warned that China's involvement would be a disaster, as the region is home to a large portion of the world's population. Gümüş also stated that the Taiwan issue is still unresolved and that the tensions between India and Pakistan are likely to be put on hold. He believes that China is not planning to take an aggressive stance, but rather is waiting for the right moment to intervene. Gümüş also mentioned that the New Silk Road project is a major concern for China, and that it is a strategic connection point between China and Europe. However, he noted that the project has been criticized for its potential to increase China's political influence and create debt risks for some countries.

**"Kailash Mansarovar Yatra will happen this year, we are making preparations": MEA**
The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, confirmed that preparations are underway for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, a sacred pilgrimage route suspended since the COVID-19 pandemic. Jaiswal stated, 'The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra will happen this year, and we are making preparations. We will soon issue a public notice regarding the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.' Both countries have agreed in principle to resume direct air services, with technical teams discussing the modalities, including an updated framework. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that India's relationship with China is 'much better than before' and mentioned that both countries are actively discussing key collateral matters including the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, resumption of direct flights, and pandemic-era disruptions. 'The relationship is much better than before. I think the disengagement, particularly the Depsang Demchok, was important,' he said. The decision comes ahead of the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between India and China, which will be utilised to enhance public diplomacy efforts and create better awareness about each other.

**Myanmar earthquake: Before-and-after satellite images show scale of destruction**
A 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday, killing at least 1,700 people, leaving over 3,400 missing, and displacing over a million. The country experienced a 5.1 magnitude aftershock on Sunday, further complicating rescue efforts. Satellite images show the scale of destruction, with damaged infrastructure, including an airport, highways, and bridges, hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid. The UN warned of a severe shortage of medical supplies, including trauma kits, blood bags, and essential medicines. Local volunteers are leading response efforts, with hospitals struggling to cope with the influx of injured people. Neighbouring countries, including India, China, and Thailand, have sent humanitarian aid to Myanmar, with India establishing a 60-bed emergency treatment centre in Mandalay. China has pledged around $13.8 million in emergency aid and sent over 135 rescue personnel and supplies. 'Hospitals are really struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, there's a shortage of medical supplies, and people are struggling to find food and clean water,' said an official from Catholic Relief Services in Myanmar. 'The situation is dire, and we need more support to respond to this disaster,' she added.

**India’s Achilles’ Heel**
India's pursuit of regional hegemony has led to environmental catastrophe, fraying diplomatic ties, and a self-inflicted vulnerability to China's countermoves. The country's reckless infrastructure spree, including overzealous dam-building and river diversions, has worsened drought conditions and led to frequent floods and environmental degradation. China is now dictating the terms of engagement in the Himalayas, a region that was once a natural fortress for India. The Galwan Heights clash and China's upcoming mega-dam on the Brahmaputra are stark reminders of the price India could pay for its delusions. India has the opportunity to lead South Asia toward strategic autonomy by shifting from confrontation to collaboration, using water diplomacy as a key strategy. By cleaning up its act and prioritizing sustainable water use, India could offer an alternative model that binds the region together instead of tearing it apart. The question is: will India take a pragmatic course or remain trapped in a futile balancing act between the West and China?

**China's Brahmaputra Dam Project Threat To Assam And Northeast, Says BJP MP Dilip Saikia**
BJP MP Dilip Saikia has expressed strong objections to China's plans to build the world's largest dam on the Brahmaputra River in Tibet, citing severe consequences for the climate of Assam and the entire Northeast. Saikia warned that the dam's construction could lead to environmental disasters, such as earthquakes and floods, and give China significant control over the river's flow, potentially causing water shortages or catastrophic floods in Northeast India. He urged the Indian government to take immediate diplomatic action and engage in discussions with China to prevent the dam's construction, ensuring the safety and well-being of Assam and the Northeast. According to Saikia, the dam, once completed, will be the largest river dam globally, with the potential to generate over 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, and will be built in a seismic zone near the Arunachal Pradesh border with an investment of $137 billion.
