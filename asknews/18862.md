**NATO defence spending target may come 'too late' for Ukraine crisis: Denmark**
Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned that NATO's target to boost defence spending by 2032 may come 'too late' as countries in the region rapidly increase their military budgets in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Frederiksen emphasized the need for increased defence spending, stating that 'that's not enough. We need to increase defence spending in the years to come.' She also expressed concerns that the proposed 5 per cent goal may not be achievable by 2032. Meanwhile, the UK has announced plans to build 12 new attack submarines to move the country to 'war-fighting readiness' in the face of 'Russian aggression' and the changing nature of conflict. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated his demand to be invited to the June NATO summit, warning that excluding Ukraine would be 'a victory for Putin, not over Ukraine, but over NATO.' Zelensky also rejected Russia's demands, calling them an 'imperialist land grab.'

**Danish PM Warns NATO Allies: 2% Defense Spending Goal 'Very Late'**
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned her regional allies on Monday that NATO's goal of increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2032 will be 'very late'. Frederiksen, who is attending a NATO meeting in Lithuania, commented on the proposal to increase defense and security spending to 5% of GDP by 2032, as demanded by US President Donald Trump. She said, 'I hope we can agree on 3.5% for the military and 1.5% for broader defense spending at the NATO summit in The Hague (June 24-26)'. She added, 'The question now is whether we will achieve that before 2032? In my opinion, this is very late'. Trump has demanded that European countries, as well as Canada, allocate at least 5% of their GDP for defense spending within the alliance. In response, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg proposed a 3.5% of GDP for direct defense spending by 2034, and 1.5% for broader security spending. Frederiksen has significantly increased Denmark's defense spending since taking office in 2019, especially since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. She said, 'When I became Prime Minister, I allocated 1.3% of the total for defense'. She continued, 'Now we spend more than 3%, but this is not enough. We need to increase defense spending in the coming years'.

**Leaders at Vilnius Summit pledge 5% defence investment**
Leaders at the Vilnius Summit signed a joint statement pledging to invest at least 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) in defence and further support Ukraine in its war with Russia. NATO chief Mark Rutte called on Alliance countries to allocate 3.5% of their GDP on 'hard military spending' and 1.5% on 'related spending' by 2032. The statement reads, 'We are moving towards reaching at least 5 per cent of GDP on defence and defence-related investments to match security threats and challenges.'

**NATO's Mark Rutte: Ukraine's Membership is a Done Deal, Not a Negotiable Item**
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte stated that all member countries have agreed on Ukraine's membership in the alliance, but this cannot be part of any peace negotiations with Russia. He reminded that the decision to admit Ukraine was made at the July 2024 summit in Washington, where all 32 member countries committed to Ukraine's accession to NATO as a long-term obligation, not as part of a peace agreement. Rutte emphasized that NATO will not fulfill one of Vladimir Putin's conditions for ending the war against Ukraine, which is a request for a clarification from the alliance on non-expansion to the east. He also stated that long-term security for NATO cannot be achieved without a safe and stable Ukraine, and that allies are trying to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression now and in the future.

**UK Invests Billions in Military and Defense Amid Ongoing Ukraine Conflict**
The UK has announced significant investments in its military and defense, with a focus on achieving 'war-readiness' and strengthening the NATO alliance. According to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the central task is to make the armed forces ready for war, and to contribute to the strength of the western military alliance with a 'Nato-first' approach. Starmer stated, 'The front line, if you will, is here' in reference to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. The government plans to invest £15 billion (approximately €18 billion) in programs related to the production of nuclear warheads, which is expected to create tens of thousands of jobs across the country. The UK's armed forces are expected to be ten times more capable by 2035, according to Starmer. He emphasized that being prepared to secure 'peace through strength' is the most effective way to deter states that directly threaten the UK. The Ministry of Defense had previously announced a £1.5 billion investment in the production of munitions, with plans to build at least six new factories. The armed forces will also receive more advanced weapons with greater range. As Defense Minister John Healey noted, 'Russia's unlawful invasion of Ukraine has starkly shown that a military is only as strong as the industry behind it.'

**NATO Faces 'Very Serious Threat' from Russia, Says German General**
According to General Carsten Breuer, the inspector general of the German Bundeswehr, NATO is facing a 'very serious threat' from Russia, which he has never seen in his 40 years of service. Russia is increasing its military forces 'on a massive scale', producing around 1,500 main battle tanks annually. Not all of these tanks are sent to the front for the war in Ukraine, but remain in storage and in new military structures always oriented towards the West, said Breuer. Russia has also produced 4.152 million 152mm artillery shells in 2024, and not all of them have gone to war against Ukraine. Breuer stated that Russia is 'intentional' and 'stockpiling' for a possible future attack on Baltic countries. 'This is an assessment of analysts - (the attack may occur in 2029 - 24 Kanal) in 2029. Therefore, we must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it will not happen before 2029, I would say no, it is not. Therefore, we must be able to fight today,' said Breuer. The minister named the Suwalki Corridor, a territory bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable points for an aggressor's attack. 'The Baltic countries are indeed very vulnerable to the Russians, are they not? And as soon as you're there, you really feel it... in the negotiations we're conducting there,' said Breuer. According to him, Estonians compare a possible war to being near a forest fire, where they 'feel the heat, see the flames, and smell the smoke', while in Germany 'it's probably just a little smoke on the horizon, and no more.' General Breuer said that this demonstrates different views among European states on the threat of a possible Russian attack.

**EU Adopts White Book of Security: A New Era for European Defense?**
European politicians have adopted the White Book of Security, which includes two sections on cooperation between Ukraine and the EU, including the creation of a joint military-industrial complex and the accumulation of 800 billion euros by 2030 for defense purposes. However, according to political scientist Oleksiy Buriachenko, the EU's bureaucratic nature is a significant obstacle. Buriachenko noted that the EU was not created as a security union, but rather as an economically horizontal confederation. He emphasized that the EU should not try to solve all of Ukraine's security and arms supply issues, as this is not its purpose. Instead, the EU should focus on its own security, which should be guaranteed by the US through NATO. Buriachenko believes that the EU has finally realized that a reset in relations with the US is inevitable. He warned that the EU's attempt to scale up arms production will require significant state orders, which may come at the expense of other programs, such as migrant support or social welfare. 'This is money that needs to be taken from somewhere,' Buriachenko said. 'For example, from programs supporting migrants, social or humanitarian spheres. If this is done, right-wing and ultra-right forces will immediately start playing on the fact that Russia is not their threat.' Buriachenko emphasized that Ukraine and Europe need to find a common system of coordinates and come to a realization that only together can they guarantee their own security without a third player. He suggested that the 'Coalition of the Willing' format, which includes countries such as the UK, Norway, and Turkey, could become a united Europe, and NATO could transform into the EU's army.

**UK faces attacks from Russia 'daily', minister says ahead of Starmer's defence review**
UK Defence Secretary John Healey warned that Britain is being attacked by Russia 'daily' in cyberspace, with 90,000 assaults on Britain's defence systems linked to different states. Healey stated, 'We have to be prepared. Nato has to be prepared. We see Putin in Ukraine trying to redraw international boundaries by force... it's part of the growing Russian aggression.' The UK and Nato are 'stepping up our ability to deter as well as to defend in the future,' he added. He also confirmed reports that Britain wants to purchase fighter jets capable of firing tactical nuclear weapons. The review, set to be unveiled on Monday, is expected to warn of an 'immediate and pressing' threat by Russia and draw heavily on the lessons learned from the war in Ukraine. The review aims to make the UK armed forces a 'formidable, integrated fighting machine', with plans to increase defence spending to reach 3 per cent of GDP by 2034. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick welcomed the plans but expressed scepticism that it would happen as soon as 2034, calling on Labour to meet the 3 per cent target before the next general election in 2029.

**NATO Excludes Zelenski from Summit Amid Trump's Skepticism and Putin's Pressure**
Ukrainian President Volodímir Zelenski has not received an invitation to participate in the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague on June 24-25. This comes as Donald Trump is in the White House, and there are concerns about the level of support for Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladímir Putin is increasing pressure on NATO to exclude Ukraine from the negotiations for peace. Last year, Ukraine secured a commitment to its 'irreversible path' to the Atlantic alliance. NATO allies are preparing for the summit, including setting a new goal of a 5% military spending increase by 2032. Invitations have been sent to the four Indo-Pacific partners (Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand), as the US focuses on the challenge posed by China in the region, while maintaining its commitment to European security.

**Nauseda: Ukraine May Join EU Before Western Balkan Countries**
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda stated that Ukraine may surpass Western Balkan countries in joining the European Union, potentially becoming a member as early as 2030. Nauseda made this statement during a visit to the EU summit in Brussels on Thursday, March 20. According to Nauseda, if Ukraine can complete the necessary requirements by 2030, while Western Balkan countries lag behind, 'all is possible.' This depends on the will and commitment, and we see that the commitment of our Ukrainian friends is very high,' he said. Additionally, Nauseda announced that Lithuania is preparing for a possible Russian attack on NATO countries by 2030, planning to create a national unit with necessary infrastructure. He emphasized that Lithuania and other NATO member countries will actively develop units to counter potential aggression over the next 4-5 years, and lifting sanctions against Russia may shorten the preparation time.

**Lithuania Prepares for Potential Russian Aggression, Ukraine's EU Membership on the Horizon**
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda is confident that Ukraine will join the European Union before Russia's potential aggression against NATO countries in 2030. He stated that Lithuania will create special units to counter attacks within the next 5 years. According to Nauseda, 'our calculations show that if the scenario unfolds as expected, we have 4-5 years left before the aggression. If sanctions against Russia are lifted, we will have even less time to prepare for the next stage of aggression.' Nauseda emphasized that Lithuania has the necessary means to make decisions and prepare for the situation. He also expressed optimism about Ukraine's potential to join the EU, stating that 'all requirements for membership can be realistically fulfilled by 2030.' Nauseda believes that Ukraine's commitment and dedication will be key factors in achieving this goal.

**German Intelligence Chief: Russia May Test NATO's Collective Defense Before 2030**
The head of German intelligence, Bruno Kahl, believes that Russia will likely try to test the effectiveness of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on collective defense. He suggests that if the war in Ukraine ends in the near future, this risk will become greater. 'We very much hope that this will not happen... But we must assume that Russia wants to test us, to check the unity of the West,' Kahl said in an interview with Deutsche Welle, as reported by 'European Truth' citing dpa. Kahl believes that the time and likelihood of such a 'test' are directly related to the development of events in the Russian-Ukrainian war. If the war ends before 2029-2030, Kahl said, Russia will be able to become a threat to Europe more quickly. 'It is also possible that a specific threat or attempt at blackmail by Russia against European states will occur earlier than previously thought... An earlier end to the war in Ukraine would allow the Russians to redirect their energy to where they want it most - against Europe,' Kahl said. According to Kahl, Russia hopes that the future contours of the world order will be similar to those in the 1990s, and that Russia's sphere of influence will expand further westward, with the United States withdrawing its troops from Europe in the most desirable scenario.

**20 countries lined up to join PM's 'coalition' to face down Russian aggression**
Twenty countries are set to join a coalition led by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to counter Russian aggression, as Ukraine outlines its plan for peace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized that any peace deal must include a cessation of air and sea attacks, and the release of all prisoners of war. Zelensky stated, 'Everyone needs to make sure that Russia, as the sole source of this war, accepts the need to end it.' Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned that direct involvement from NATO members would not be allowed. Polish President Andrzej Duda called for all NATO countries to increase their defence spending to 3% of GDP immediately, saying, 'We cannot wait until 2030.' The coalition plans to present its proposals to US President Donald Trump when finalized.

**Trump: Ukraine Should Forget About Joining NATO**
US President Donald Trump stated on February 26 that Ukraine should forget about joining NATO, citing it as the reason for Russia's full-scale invasion. He said, 'Yes, [Putin will have to make concessions]... Ukraine will have to forget about NATO - I think that's why it all started.' Trump also added that without US arms, the war would have ended 'quickly.' He stated, 'Ukrainians are good fighters, but without American equipment - we have the best equipment in the world - it would have ended very quickly.' This comes after Trump previously stated on February 17 that he does not believe Russia will attack NATO countries. Ukrainian President Zelensky had warned on February 15 that Russia plans to send troops to Belarus in 2025 under the guise of 'training exercises' that may be intended to attack NATO countries. European politicians have also warned of a potential Russian attack on NATO, which could occur in 2025, 2026, or 2030. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius stated on January 23 that there is a possibility of a Russian attack on NATO countries in 2029-2030. The Institute for the Study of War wrote on February 9 about the increase in Russia's hybrid and diversionary attacks on NATO, including the use of drones.

**Trump: Ukraine Will Have to Forget About NATO**
Former US President Donald Trump stated during a press conference that Ukraine's desire to join NATO was the reason for Russia's full-scale invasion.

Trump also added that without American equipment, the war would have ended 'very quickly.'

Trump also stated that he does not believe Russia will attack NATO countries. In contrast, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned at the Munich Security Conference that Russia plans to send troops to Belarus in 2025 under the pretext of training, which could be used to attack NATO countries. European politicians have previously warned of a potential Russian attack on NATO in 2025, 2026, or 2030.

**Von der Leyen says Ukraine may join EU before 2030**
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on February 24 that Ukraine may join the European Union before 2030 if it continues to maintain its current pace of reform. Von der Leyen expressed her appreciation for Ukraine's 'political will' and stated that if Ukraine 'continues to develop at this speed and quality, it may be able to join the EU before 2030.' European Council President Antonio Costa added that joining the EU would be Ukraine's most important security guarantee in the future. Ukraine submitted its membership application in February 2022 and became an EU candidate in June of the same year. The European Council decided to launch EU-Ukraine accession talks in December 2023, and the two sides held their first ministerial-level government-to-government meeting in June 2024, marking the formal start of accession talks. However, even with talks underway, becoming an official EU member state will still require a long process. For example, Turkey obtained candidate status in 1999 and started accession talks in 2005, but talks have yet to make significant progress. Russian President's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said on February 18 that joining the EU is Ukraine's sovereign right, but Russia opposes Ukraine's accession to the military alliance. Russia has long opposed Ukraine's accession to NATO.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has expressed optimism about Ukraine's potential to join the European Union before 2030. Speaking at a press conference in Kyiv, von der Leyen praised Ukraine's progress toward reaching EU norms, saying, 'I really appreciate the political will that is there. I would even say Ukraine’s merit-based process, if they continue at that speed and at that quality, perhaps they could be earlier than 2030.' This move could help deter Russia from future aggression, particularly given the United States' reluctance to allow Ukraine to join NATO or provide soldiers for a postwar peacekeeping force.

**Ukraine May Join EU Before 2030, Says Von der Leyen**
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that Ukraine may join the European Union (EU) before 2030 if it continues with the current pace of reforms. Von der Leyen praised Ukraine for 'good work' and assured that it can become a part of the EU in the next five years if it continues to 'advance at this pace and with this quality.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had previously stated that joining the EU or NATO would 'help a lot' in preventing future Russian aggressions. The ongoing Russian military offensive in Ukraine, launched on February 24, 2022, has plunged Europe into what is considered the most severe security crisis since World War II. Western allies of Ukraine have been providing arms to Kyiv and approving successive packages of sanctions against Russian interests to try to reduce Moscow's ability to finance the war effort.
