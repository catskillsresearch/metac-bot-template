**JPMorgan Predicts Conflict in Ukraine to End by July 2025**
Analysts from JPMorgan predict that the conflict in Ukraine may end by July 2025. They foresee a 'non-ideal' agreement being reached by the end of the second quarter of 2025. According to the report, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will likely be forced to negotiate with Russia this year to freeze hostilities, but not a full-fledged peace agreement. This scenario, dubbed 'Georgian', has a 50% probability. In this scenario, Ukraine would not have guarantees of security from the West and would eventually fall under Russian influence. The report also mentions 'South Korean', 'Israeli', and 'Belarusian' scenarios, with probabilities of 15%, 20%, and 15% respectively. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Russia will not be deceived by those who propose a ceasefire in Ukraine first and then transition to negotiations. He reminded that the West had deceived Russia in 2014, staging a coup in Ukraine after a settlement agreement between Kiev's authorities and the opposition. The Minsk agreements were then violated, and European politicians later admitted that these agreements were only needed to gain time for Kiev. In 2022, Russia and Ukraine reached an agreement on the principles of a settlement in Istanbul, but the West prohibited Zelensky from signing the agreement based on these principles. Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump had a phone call on Monday, discussing, among other things, the conflict in Ukraine. Putin stated that the conversation lasted over two hours and that Moscow is ready to work with Kiev on a memorandum regarding a possible future peace treaty.

**Russia's Conditions for Ceasefire in Ukraine Spark Concern**
Russian officials claim they are willing to move towards peace, but Moscow has repeatedly rejected Ukraine's and its European allies' demand to establish a ceasefire (at least for 30 days) before negotiations. According to press reports, the Kremlin is imposing several tough conditions for a ceasefire, which Kiev and Western countries consider unacceptable, including the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from territories claimed by Russia and the cessation of arms supplies to the Ukrainian military. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated, 'We are working on implementing the agreements reached in Istanbul.' He was referring to the first direct Russian-Ukrainian talks held in Turkey last week. Peskov added that there are still no specific agreements on the next stages of negotiations, saying, 'We still need to agree on this. We are working on implementing the agreements reached in Istanbul.'

**No Agreement for Second Russo-Ukrainian Meeting, Says Kremlin**
The Kremlin has stated that there is still 'no agreement' for a second Russo-Ukrainian meeting, which could be held at the Vatican according to US press reports. Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected a ceasefire before peace talks, while Ukraine and its Western allies demand a truce before negotiations. Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine have agreed to implement the '1000 for 1000' prisoner exchange announced last week in Turkey before considering further discussions. The Russian Defense Ministry reported that 35 drones were shot down in Moscow, while the Ukrainian Air Force claimed to have intercepted over 112 Russian drones. The attacks come as European diplomats, backed by the US, push for a ceasefire from Moscow, which launched a large-scale offensive against Ukraine in February 2022.

**Rubio Hopes Russian Peace Memorandum Will Aid Negotiations**
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed hope that the Russian memorandum on a peace agreement will help negotiations. Rubio stated that the Ukrainian conflict has no military solution and can only be resolved through negotiations. He emphasized that 'peace must be sustainable, so it doesn't last for three years and then a new war begins.' Rubio added that 'for such a peace, both sides must participate in negotiations and make concessions.' The US administration is counting on the memorandum to contain provisions that will allow progress in peace talks. Rubio said, 'The Russians are supposed to prepare a document, a memorandum of peace, which outlines what they require for a ceasefire, which can then lead to broader negotiations and a final settlement.' He also stated that 'I think we'll learn a lot about what this memorandum of peace includes. If it's reasonable, I think we can make progress. If not, the President will have options. But we'll wait for the first, not the second.' Rubio warned that the US Congress is considering new sanctions against Russia, 'which are even harsher than what the President can impose,' and added that American lawmakers 'may lose patience' if a ceasefire agreement is not reached.

**Russia's Lavrov: 'No Ceasefire, Then We Will See'**
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated, 'Now, there will be no ceasefire, and then we will see.' He emphasized that Russia is in a state of actual war with Europe, despite fulfilling its military commitments to its allies. Lavrov also emphasized that a ceasefire can only be considered after negotiations are completed. He criticized the sincerity of European calls for peace, saying, 'Europeans are not calling for peace, but rather for rearmament. That's why they want a ceasefire.' He also accused Western leaders of intentionally escalating the conflict in Ukraine. Lavrov cited an example of this, saying, 'Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump agreed in a meeting that parameters for a long-term and sustainable peace in Ukraine should be established.' He also mentioned that the Kremlin is working on a prisoner exchange program with Ukraine in the 1000 to 1000 format and is approaching the Istanbul talks with caution. Additionally, Lavrov is expected to visit Turkey on May 25-27 and meet with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan to discuss Turkey's role as a mediator in the Ukraine crisis and bilateral relations.

**Kiryill Shulika: Will the US Withdraw from the Negotiation Track?**
Kiryill Shulika discusses the possibility of the US withdrawing from the negotiation track. However, it's worth noting that neither Trump nor Putin, nor their representatives, made any such statements. In fact, Western journalists didn't even have any insider information, they simply decided to speculate. This conclusion was drawn because the presidents of Russia and the US did agree to restart the conflict resolution process on different principles, which were strongly rejected by both Ukraine and the West over the past three years. This policy led to Ukraine's decision to suspend direct negotiations in 2022 and rely on its own military strength, which was, as expected, insufficient. Additionally, Trump abandoned his attempts at a quick conflict resolution, which he had mentioned during his election campaign, saying he could resolve it in 24 hours. It's also worth noting that the US president seems to agree with the Russian position that establishing a long-term peace is more important than a ceasefire, and that the principles of this peace need to be discussed with Ukraine, the US, and Europe. This idea is reflected in the concept of a memorandum, which is a diplomatic document outlining a country's position. According to this concept, Russia and Ukraine are expected to formulate the principles of peaceful resolution, which will serve as the basis for future agreements on a ceasefire and long-term peace. This approach is similar to what was proposed in 2022 in Istanbul.

**Hectic two weeks leaves Russia confident - and peace in Ukraine feeling no closer**
Russia has been using tactics to delay and sidestep pressure from European leaders and the US to agree to a long-term ceasefire in Ukraine. Despite an ultimatum from European leaders and a 30-day comprehensive ceasefire proposal from the US, Russia has not agreed to a ceasefire. Instead, Russia has proposed direct talks in Turkey, which have been met with skepticism. According to US President Donald Trump, Russia and Ukraine will start negotiations towards a ceasefire, but Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has cast doubt on whether Russia would sign a peace treaty with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying 'You're putting the cart before the horse... Probably the best option would be new elections...'

**JP Morgan Chase Predicts Ceasefire in Russia-Ukraine War by 2025**
JP Morgan Chase's Center for Geopolitics predicts that a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war will be reached by the end of the second quarter of 2025. The agreement will be imperfect and will only freeze the front lines, but not lead to a comprehensive peace treaty. According to the analysis, both Ukraine and Russia have reasons to stop the fighting. Ukraine is struggling due to the US betrayal and lack of military equipment, which Europe cannot compensate for alone. Russia, on the other hand, is suffering heavy losses without significant gains. 'Based on calculations, if Russia continues at its current pace, it will be able to fully control Ukraine in approximately 118 years,' JP Morgan Chase writes. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin will only agree to a ceasefire if it weakens Ukraine and allows him to achieve his ultimate goal of full control over Ukraine in the future. The durability and longevity of the ceasefire will depend on two key factors: how satisfied Putin is with Ukraine's and the West's concessions, and the guarantees of security for Ukraine. If these guarantees are weak or non-existent, the peace will be short-lived. 'The weaker the security guarantees, the more concessions Ukraine will have to make (neutrality, disarmament, territorial concessions, etc.) to avoid the resumption of hostilities,' the article states. JPMorgan Chase considers four possible outcomes of this war. The most likely scenario (50%) is 'Georgia', where Ukraine will not receive strong support from the West and will face constant instability, slow post-war recovery, gradual weakening of foreign support, and a breakdown of its Western integration (EU and NATO membership). The second most likely scenario (20%) is 'Israel', which involves strong and continuous military and economic support for Ukraine from its Western allies, but without significant foreign troop presence. This scenario would transform Ukraine into a fortress, with rapid military modernization and strengthened defenses. The third scenario (15%) is 'South Korea', which is the best for Ukraine, although it does not provide for Ukraine's membership in NATO or the return of all occupied territories. If it is possible to ensure the presence of European forces on Ukrainian territory, with guarantees of US security, then 80% of Ukraine's territory remaining under Kiev's control can develop along a more stable, prosperous, and democratic trajectory. The use of frozen Russian sovereign assets (approximately $300 billion) by the West would also provide a good start for Ukraine's recovery. The worst-case scenario (15%) is 'Belarus', where the US would abandon support for Ukraine and Europe would be unable to activate, and Russia would insist on its maximalist demands and demand Ukraine's complete surrender, turning the country into a vassal state. In this scenario, Russia would effectively win the war, divide the West, and irreparably undermine the post-war world order.

**Lavrov Announces Russia's Readiness to Transfer Conditions for War Settlement to Ukraine**
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Russia will be ready to transfer a document with conditions for 'achieving a long-term agreement on the war settlement' to Ukraine immediately after the exchange of prisoners. He made this statement on Friday, May 23, according to the Russian propaganda agency RIA Novosti. Lavrov emphasized that the Kremlin will continue working on the documents 'despite provocations.' In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the first step is to stop the war, take real diplomatic steps towards peace, and establish a new security architecture. 'It's time to put pressure on Russia to get a result, not just one, but everything that's needed. And when the Russians have already spent a week formulating their so-called memorandum, which they want to respond to the need to stop the war, it's definitely a mockery of the whole world. So much time! Every day of war is a loss of lives. Of course, the Russians don't count people, but the world should,' Zelensky said. He called on the international community to increase pressure on Russia and introduce new sanctions to achieve not partial results, but full compliance with the conditions for peace. On May 20, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, stated that there are no specific deadlines for preparing a memorandum with Ukraine regarding the possible ceasefire and peace agreement, and such deadlines 'cannot exist.' On May 19, Putin again rejected the idea of an unconditional ceasefire during a conversation with US President Donald Trump. Putin stated that 'it is necessary to develop the most effective ways to move towards peace,' and Russia is ready to work on a 'memorandum' with Ukraine, which includes a ceasefire. In response to Zelensky's initiative, Zelensky stated in an interview with journalists that Trump and Putin discussed a memorandum that could be adopted in the framework of bilateral relations. 'In a bilateral format, there can be a corresponding memorandum that can lead to a map that leads to the end of the war. That is, to an agreement. We are talking about a memorandum that will be supported by two countries, which includes a ceasefire,' Zelensky emphasized. He also noted that it is unknown what exactly Russia may be discussing in the possible memorandum. 'In any case, if the Russian side proposes some memorandum, I think it will not be a secret. After all, this information somehow appears in the public space. I think that from our side, after receiving the Russian proposals in the memorandum, we can formulate our vision,' Zelensky added.

**Trump Calls for 30-Day Ceasefire Between Russia and Ukraine**

The Russians need to respond appropriately – support the ceasefire. They need to show their willingness to end the war. And this is not the first time we have proposed this. 30 days that could be the beginning of years of peace.' Trump showed interest in the current situation on the battlefield, according to Zelensky, and expressed his desire to end the war, offering to help and supporting the need for a ceasefire.

**Ukraine and US to Discuss Ceasefire Proposals in Saudi Arabia**
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' spokesperson, Georgiy Tikhoy, the upcoming meeting between Ukraine and the US in Saudi Arabia will be a technical, not a political, discussion. The meeting aims to determine the parameters of different ceasefire proposals on the negotiating table. Ukraine has proposed and agreed to a 30-day temporary ceasefire, which would have already taken effect if Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin, had accepted it. However, Russia continues to propose new conditions, including a limited agreement to refrain from attacking Ukraine's energy and critical infrastructure. Tikhoy stated that Ukraine has clearly demonstrated its intention to move towards peace. He also clarified that the upcoming meeting is a bilateral Ukrainian-American discussion, and Ukraine is not aware of any potential contacts between the US and Russia during the meeting. Tikhoy added that the US team has assured Ukraine that they will convey the results of the meeting to Russia and understand what Russia is willing to accept. Ukraine is currently considering this interaction. The spokesperson emphasized that the meeting will be a technical discussion with a military component, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs is not currently planning to participate in the meeting.

**Putin and Trump Agree on 30-Day Ceasefire in Ukraine**
Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump had a phone conversation on March 18, 2025, which led to an agreement on a 30-day ceasefire in the conflict in Ukraine. Putin also agreed to stop attacking Ukraine's energy infrastructure for 30 days, on the condition that Ukraine does the same and does not attack Russian infrastructure. The two leaders also discussed the possibility of exchanging 350 prisoners of war between Russia and Ukraine, with 175 from each side. Additionally, Russia will release 23 severely wounded Ukrainian soldiers as a gesture of goodwill. Trump proposed the idea of a ceasefire and Putin agreed, saying that he is willing to work with the US to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. The Kremlin stated that Putin emphasized the need to eliminate the root causes of the crisis and to take into account Russia's legitimate interests in the field of security. The conversation was seen as a positive development by the Kremlin, which values the international relevance that comes with negotiating with the US. The two leaders also discussed the possibility of restoring bilateral relations and cooperating in areas such as economics and space exploration. 'Now there is a real diplomatic process in place. It doesn't have a predetermined outcome. The negotiations are advancing in their logic and the result is forming as the dialogue progresses,' said Fiódor Lukiánov, a Russian expert. 'This is notably different from what we saw in decades past, when the US and its allies dominated international relations.'

**Trump and Putin Agree to 30-Day Ceasefire in Ukraine War**
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a long phone conversation on Tuesday (March 18, 2025), during which they discussed ceasefire agreements and other issues. According to the Kremlin, Putin agreed to Trump's proposal to stop attacks on each other's energy infrastructure for 30 days. The two leaders discussed the ceasefire agreement, with Putin saying, 'The solution to the war should be long-term, taking into account Russia's security interests and the root causes of the war.' They also discussed a 30-day ceasefire, which Ukraine agreed to last week. Putin raised several issues, including monitoring the ceasefire and Ukraine's attempt to rearm. He emphasized that the main condition for stopping the war and finding a political-diplomatic solution is to completely stop foreign military aid. Russia has agreed to hand over 23 seriously injured Ukrainian soldiers to Kiev as a sign of goodwill. Putin told Trump that there will be a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine. The White House released a statement after the conversation, saying that Trump and Putin discussed the need for peace and a ceasefire in the Ukraine war. They agreed that the conflict should be ended with permanent peace and that better bilateral relations between the US and Russia would be beneficial in the future, including large-scale economic deals and geopolitical stability.

**US and Ukraine Agree on 30-Day Ceasefire, Putting Pressure on Russia**
The US and Ukraine have agreed on a 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended if Russia agrees. The ceasefire will come into effect immediately if Russia approves it. The US will also resume its military aid to Ukraine and restart its intelligence cooperation. This move strengthens Ukraine's position in potential negotiations. The sudden breakthrough in the bilateral talks is a surprise, as both sides had initially set modest goals. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has taken a bold step by proposing a partial ceasefire, which initially focused on halting aerial and naval attacks. This had been discussed in 2024, as both sides saw it as a cost-effective measure. To put pressure on Russia, Ukraine launched a record 337 unmanned aerial vehicles against Russia on Tuesday morning, disrupting an important oil pipeline to Europe. The ceasefire was later expanded to include ground fighting, and the exchange of prisoners and the return of Ukrainian children from Russia were also agreed upon. This move has helped Ukraine to overcome Trump's criticism that they are the main obstacle to ending the war. Now, Putin is under pressure to show that his peace efforts are more than just propaganda. The success of the Jidda agreement depends on whether it marks the first step towards peace or hardens the fronts between East and West. Russia has responded with new drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. However, the Russian position is not the only uncertainty. The agreement raises numerous open questions, including the monitoring of the ceasefire, territorial concessions, and the future security architecture for Ukraine and Europe. The US role in defining its role in the conflict is crucial. The lack of security guarantees in the Ukrainian-US agreement is a concern, and the planned signing of a raw materials agreement is not a substitute. The European proposal to send a 'peacekeeping force' seems vague, and Moscow has rejected it. Additionally, a pure freezing of the conflict at the current front line does not guarantee peace, as Ukraine may accept certain territorial losses, but Russia's maximal demands go beyond the 'realities on the battlefield.' Putin's goal is to reverse the entire NATO expansion since the end of the Cold War, which means that the US government will have to consider how to counter the Kremlin's ambitions.

**'Ceasefire Possible by 2025, but Its Effectiveness is Uncertain': Budanov**
Ukraine and Russia may reach a ceasefire agreement by 2025, according to Ukraine's Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Kyrylo Budanov. 'This is a paradoxical situation,' Budanov said. 'Despite the diametrically opposed starting positions of the parties, I think it is possible. The question is how long it will last and how effective it will be.' Budanov also stated that even after a ceasefire, the war may transition into a new phase, a hybrid one. However, Ukraine is not accustomed to this, he noted. Additionally, Budanov emphasized that without US support, it will be difficult for Ukraine to continue resisting Russia's aggressive invasion. He urged Ukraine to do everything possible to maintain cooperation with Washington and deepen interaction with Europe.
