**Stablecoin Market Capitalization Exceeds $250 Billion, New Players Emerge**
The market capitalization of stablecoins has exceeded $250 billion. According to CoinMarketCap, the current market capitalization is $251.4 billion, with around $245 billion of that being tied to US dollar-pegged tokens. The leader is USDT from Tether with a market capitalization of over $153 billion, followed by USDC from Circle USDC at $60.9 billion, and then Ethena USDe (USDe) at $5.5 billion. The crossing of the $250 billion mark marks a turning point, said Hank Huang, general director of Kronos Research, in an interview with The Block. 'This is a moment of change. Stablecoins are no longer experimental, they are necessary.' Huang believes that the sector is ready for rapid growth and that the market capitalization of stablecoins could double by 2026. A key factor in the growth of the market capitalization of stablecoins is the clarity in regulation brought by the GENIUS Act in the US. The law, which aims to create a legal framework for dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, was recently passed by the US Senate. The law requires issuers to fully back their tokens with dollars and short-term Treasury securities, publish reserve data, and undergo audits. After the final adoption of GENIUS, analysts expect a significant increase in the market capitalization of stablecoins. According to Standard Chartered, the indicator could reach $2 trillion by the end of 2028. The Telegram channel 'RBC-Crypto' - subscribe and stay up to date with the latest and most relevant news about cryptocurrency. Join the 'RBC-Crypto' forum in Telegram to discuss news and trends in the cryptocurrency world. Following the approval of GENIUS in the US, a similar bill was passed in Hong Kong on May 21, establishing a licensing regime for issuers of fiat stablecoins operating in the region. According to Huang, in light of current events, the position of stablecoin issuers on the market may change quickly. New players, such as USD1 supported by US President Donald Trump, and stablecoins issued by banks, may emerge to challenge the dominance of USDT and USDC, he believes. The introduction of clarity in regulation has allowed large players from the traditional financial sector to engage in their own stablecoin projects. It is reported that the largest US banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, are discussing the possibility of launching a joint stablecoin. USD1, issued by the Trump family's project (World Liberty Financial, WLF), was launched in mid-April and has since reached a capitalization of $2.17 billion, ranking fifth in the CoinMarketCap rating. At the same time, journalists note that USD1 is promoted in the world by interested American politicians in parallel with official visits to other countries. Democrats in the US Senate demand an investigation into possible conflicts of interest, suggesting that this may be about trading access to the Trump administration. The White House does not recognize any conflict of interest. In mid-May, the Central Bank of Russia updated its requirements for digital assets that can be represented in the country. A range of criteria that such assets must meet, including the absence of a connection to issued hostile securities, excludes the inclusion of tokens like USDT and USDC on the Russian market. 'Risks are preserved.'

**Cryptocurrency Market Sees Positive Momentum in June 2025**
The cryptocurrency market started June 2025 with a positive momentum, driven by investor optimism and the positive performance of traditional markets. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies reached $3.24 trillion, with a 0.22% increase in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin and Ethereum saw significant price increases, with Bitcoin trading between $103,286 and $104,900 and Ethereum reaching $3,800, a 2.8% increase. This surge coincided with a strong performance of traditional markets, with the Nasdaq index closing 1.2% higher, boosting investors' appetite for risk. The influx of institutional investments into Bitcoin funds has also been substantial, with $500 million flowing in during the last week of May. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that Bitcoin and Ethereum are approaching overbought areas, which may lead to short-term price corrections. Nevertheless, the current momentum reflects investors' confidence in the continued upward trend. The cryptocurrency market is off to a strong start in June, driven by investor optimism and positive traditional market performance. With continued institutional investment, the market may see further growth in the coming period.

**SPX6900 Surpasses $1 Billion Market Cap, Eyes New Highs**
SPX6900 has surpassed $1 billion in market capitalization with a 101% monthly growth. Some analysts predict new highs, while the pre-sale of the new trading bot on Telegram, $SNORT, is flying high after just three days. SPX6900 has become one of the most performing meme coins of 2025, with a growth of 101% in 30 days, reaching a maximum of $1.17 and then retracing slightly to the current $1.07, reaching the highest level in the last four months and entering the top 100 of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The community remains one of its strengths, fueling a narrative cycle similar to that of DOGE in its glory days. SPX is now the most capitalized meme coin launched in 2023, and investors are watching closely for its next breakout. Some analysts, such as Altcoin Sherpa and Bluntz, predict a new all-time high by summer, with prices potentially reaching $2.50. These predictions are based on a combination of technical, cyclical, and psychological factors, including the general recovery of the meme coin sector and the stability of Bitcoin above $100,000. SPX6900 has been able to ride the wave of a strong narrative, linking itself to the return of Donald Trump, which coincided with the last all-time high of SPX6900, creating a powerful storytelling that continues to resonate in the community. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a double transformation: on the one hand, meme coins like SPX6900 are returning to the spotlight with powerful narratives and galvanized communities. On the other hand, emerging projects, such as Snorter ($SNORT), are redefining the concept of utility in crypto trading, offering concrete investment opportunities through the narrative of crypto memes, accessible via Telegram.

**Tether's Tight Grip: Why USDT Dominates the $235 Billion Stablecoin Market in 2025 - Brave New Coin**
As of 2025, Tether (USDT) remains the dominant USD-pegged stablecoin, with a market capitalization of $144 billion, accounting for over 61% of the entire stablecoin market, valued at $235 billion. According to data from Brave New Coin, USDT's market cap is significantly larger than its nearest rival, USD Coin (USDC), which has a market cap of approximately $60.7 billion. The dominance of USDT is attributed to its widespread adoption, liquidity, and integration into the global crypto trading infrastructure. However, USD Coin is gaining ground, driven by its transparent backing and regulatory alignment, making it a formidable challenger in the stablecoin market. The future of stablecoins is closely tied to evolving regulations worldwide, and compliance costs and restrictions could influence future market share.

**Crypto market swells $500 billion as Trump unveils strategic reserve**
The crypto market has surged by over $500 billion after Donald Trump announced that bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, solana (SOL), and cardano (ADA) will be included in a US strategic reserve.

**Bitcoin's $850 Billion Realized Cap Suggests Bull Market Could Last Beyond March 2025 -- Research**
Bitcoin has reached a milestone, surpassing a realized capitalization of $850 billion for the first time. This reflects a significant recovery from the 2022 crypto bear market, where its realized cap was around $400 billion. According to Glassnode, Bitcoin has attracted nearly $500 billion in capital inflows since the low point in November 2022, more than doubling its realized cap. However, this bull market is different from past cycles, with demand coming in bursts and institutional involvement increasing, suggesting that it could last longer than previous ones. Some analysts predict this bull market could continue beyond March 2025 due to its atypical nature. Bitcoin's rising realized cap and the increase in institutional involvement indicate that the cryptocurrency's position as a store of value is strengthening.
