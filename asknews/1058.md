**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**UK Announces Nuclear Submarine and Ammunition Factory Plans in Response to 'Russian Threat'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive rearmament plan for the UK, including the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and six new ammunition factories. The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate £15 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional £6 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.

**UK Must Prepare for War, Says Labour Leader Keir Starmer**
UK must prepare for war, said Labour leader Keir Starmer in a defense industry in Scotland on Monday, presenting a report on the state of the country's defense. - The threat we face today is more serious, less predictable, and more immediate than anything we've seen since the end of the Cold War. We are facing a war in Europe, a new nuclear threat, cyber attacks, increased Russian aggression in our territorial waters and airspace, and their reckless behavior is leading to increased living costs in our country. This is a new era for security and defense, said Starmer. The British government has announced an increase in defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, and now aims to reach 3%. Six new ammunition factories will be built to replenish the army's dwindling stockpiles, which are being depleted as artillery ammunition is sent to Ukraine. A new generation of nuclear weapons and submarines is being developed, and new drones, ships, and aircraft will be acquired to increase naval capabilities. The Times reports that the government is considering purchasing American F35A fighter jets to be able to launch nuclear weapons from the air. However, there are question marks about the pace of the buildup. - I'm not going to engage in fantasy politics and take dates out of the air now, said Starmer when pressed by the BBC about when the 3% target will be met. Ministers have spoken of 'the end of the next parliamentary term' - but within Starmer's Labour Party, criticism is growing that they have already cut aid and support for poor families. Meanwhile, the center and right-wing opposition argue that it is happening too slowly. Former army chief Richard Dannatt is among those who criticize the pace of the buildup. - A vague goal of increasing defense spending to 3% by 2034 is not enough, it's like asking Adolf Hitler to wait until 1946 to attack us in 1938, he said.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Ray Kurzweil Predicts Humanity Will Reach 'Speed of Longevity Escape' by 2029**
Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that humanity will reach the 'speed of longevity escape' by 2029, where our life expectancy will increase by more than one year for every year that passes, allowing us to gain time rather than lose it. Kurzweil bases this prediction on the concept that medical and technological advancements will soon reach a pace where improvements in treatments and therapies will extend our life expectancy faster than we naturally age. He notes that currently, we recover approximately four months of longevity per year due to scientific advancements, but by 2029, this number will reach one year. Kurzweil's methodology is based on the 'law of accelerating returns,' which states that technological progress advances at an exponential rate. He also predicts that humans will be able to merge their neocortex with the cloud by the early 2030s, surpassing the biological limitations of the human brain. However, he acknowledges the limitations of his predictions, stating that 'achieving the speed of longevity escape does not guarantee living forever.'

**President Erdoğan's Statement on the Threat of Forest Fires and Climate Crisis**
President Erdoğan stated, 'I am remembering all the great leaders who lost their lives while fighting forest fires and floods. Humanity is facing a more challenging situation than ever before. Global warming, climate crisis, and drought are increasing pressure on natural resources. It is essential for countries to use underground and surface resources sustainably. THE NAME OF THIS IS A GREAT BETRAYAL.' Our forest cover has been under a significant threat in recent years. Rising temperatures and droughts pose serious risks to the future of our forests. In the last 10 years, the area of our burned forests has increased by two times compared to the previous 10 years. Our world has experienced the hottest 9 years since 1880. 2024 was the hottest year in the last 145 years. We experienced the hottest day in the last 145 years on July 23, 2024.'

**NATO Faces 'Very Serious Threat' from Russia, Says German General**
According to General Carsten Breuer, the inspector general of the German Bundeswehr, NATO is facing a 'very serious threat' from Russia, which he has never seen in his 40 years of service. Russia is increasing its military forces 'on a massive scale', producing around 1,500 main battle tanks annually. Not all of these tanks are sent to the front for the war in Ukraine, but remain in storage and in new military structures always oriented towards the West, said Breuer. Russia has also produced 4.152 million 152mm artillery shells in 2024, and not all of them have gone to war against Ukraine. Breuer stated that Russia is 'intentional' and 'stockpiling' for a possible future attack on Baltic countries. 'This is an assessment of analysts - (the attack may occur in 2029 - 24 Kanal) in 2029. Therefore, we must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it will not happen before 2029, I would say no, it is not. Therefore, we must be able to fight today,' said Breuer. The minister named the Suwalki Corridor, a territory bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable points for an aggressor's attack. 'The Baltic countries are indeed very vulnerable to the Russians, are they not? And as soon as you're there, you really feel it... in the negotiations we're conducting there,' said Breuer. According to him, Estonians compare a possible war to being near a forest fire, where they 'feel the heat, see the flames, and smell the smoke', while in Germany 'it's probably just a little smoke on the horizon, and no more.' General Breuer said that this demonstrates different views among European states on the threat of a possible Russian attack.

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Elon Musk Warns of Impending Apocalypse: The Real Threat to Humanity and Its Consequences**
Elon Musk has warned of an impending apocalypse, citing a more severe threat to humanity than climate change. The billionaire entrepreneur has expressed concern over declining birth rates and the potential impact of artificial intelligence on the world. According to Emmanouíl Frágkos, a member of the European Parliament, the population collapse is imminent due to low fertility rates. A recent study by Morgan Stanley estimates that by 2030, approximately 45% of women aged 25-44 will be single and childless. Frágkos argues that the modern lifestyle, characterized by few incentives for marriage, has led to men and women remaining childless. He suggests that the solution lies in using all available resources to promote the birth of more babies and thus save humanity. Musk has also shared his concerns about the role of AI in the upcoming global crisis, citing a potential energy problem due to the increasing demand for AI and electric vehicles. According to Musk, the rapid expansion of AI is closely related to electricity consumption and data storage. Experts have analyzed the potential problems that could arise from 2026 onwards, including a significant decline in the world's population. As Musk put it, 'the world is running out of people.'

**World One Supercomputer Predicts Human Extinction by 2050: A Call to Action for Responsible Technology Development**
Recent predictions and research have raised concerns about the potential of technologies and their impact on the future of humanity. According to the World One supercomputer, the Earth may reach a point of no return by 2050, posing a risk of the complete disappearance of the human species. Scientists and experts note that the development of artificial intelligence and high technologies, combined with environmental and social crises, create dangerous scenarios threatening the entire civilization. The concern is that further development of automated systems and algorithms may get out of control, increasing the chance of catastrophic consequences - from massive environmental disasters to the disappearance of the human population. Society is discussing the need for strict regulation and ethical responsibility in the use of new technologies. Experts emphasize that without active measures to control the development of artificial intelligence and automatic control systems, humanity risks being on the brink of extinction. As time shows, the importance of prevention and responsibility in the technological sphere cannot be underestimated, as it depends on how responsibly these developments are implemented, the future of the entire planet is at stake. Modern scientific discoveries and predictions show that humanity continues to face global challenges, the consequences of which may be catastrophic. For example, scientists have developed an antidote to protect against the most dangerous snakes in the world, which will be an important step in ensuring the safety of the population and specialists working in hazardous conditions. At the same time, experts predict that a powerful volcanic eruption may surpass any known natural disasters, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and preparation for extreme natural situations. 'The time has come to take responsibility for the development of technologies and ensure that they serve humanity, not the other way around,' said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a leading expert in the field of artificial intelligence. 'We must work together to prevent the worst-case scenario and create a better future for all.'

**Supercomputer World One Predicts Human Extinction by 2040-2050**
The supercomputer World One, developed in 1973 for the Club of Rome, has predicted that humanity may become extinct by 2040-2050 due to human activity disrupting the planet's ecological balance. According to the model, the main factors contributing to extinction will be pollution and resource depletion. World One predicted that by 2020, the planet's state would become 'critically unstable', and by 2040-2050, the quality of life would drop to zero due to accumulated consequences of pollution and resource depletion. The model's predictions have been partially confirmed, with a decrease in resource availability and a worsening of the environmental situation already observed. However, critics note that the model does not take into account the potential for technological breakthroughs or global efforts to achieve carbon neutrality. Some experts believe that humanity can adapt if it urgently reduces greenhouse gas emissions and addresses the issue of uneven resource consumption. World One's prediction is seen as a warning rather than a verdict, with scientists calling for immediate action: transitioning to renewable energy, reducing birth rates in overpopulated regions, and restoring ecosystems. Without these measures, humanity risks facing irreversible consequences in the near future.

**Supercomputer World One Predicts Human Extinction by 2050**
The supercomputer World One, created in 1973 for the Club of Rome, has made alarming predictions: human civilization may disappear between 2040 and 2050. According to researchers, this catastrophic outcome will be caused by a combination of factors resulting from human activity. Experts confirm that our planet is experiencing severe pressure daily due to four main problems: environmental pollution, global warming, greenhouse gas accumulation, and growing overpopulation. If current trends continue, the level of pollution will reach a critical point by the predicted date, making further human existence impossible. Scientists predict that the main causes of human extinction will be acute shortages of drinking water, food, and breathable air. As a result, the planet's population may decrease to levels characteristic of the 19th century. It is worth noting that the supercomputer used a complex algorithm considering multiple variables. Many experts have supported World One's conclusions, noting that even if humanity survives, it will exist in completely different conditions than those we know today. Given the increasing frequency of natural disasters, the researchers' predictions seem increasingly realistic.

**Scientists Warn of Three Hidden Threats to Humanity**
Scientists have identified three potential causes of a global catastrophe that seem unlikely but could lead to the extinction of the human species. The first threat is a demographic crisis, with the United Nations predicting that the global population will exceed 10 billion by 2050, leading to a severe resource shortage, famine, and subsequent collapse of civilization. The second danger lies in the development of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, which, although promising significant breakthroughs, may get out of control. As John Skelton and Craig Wheeler from the University of Texas point out, powerful gamma-ray emissions from supernovae explosions could cause significant damage to the Earth's biosphere. If such a burst were directed towards Earth, the consequences would be catastrophic. Researchers from the University of Otago have also considered the worst-case scenario of a global catastrophe - a possible nuclear winter. They believe that only five countries would be able to survive in such conditions. 'We should consider not only obvious risks but also less predictable factors to ensure our future,' says the 'MediaPotok' news outlet.

**Three Potential Threats to Humanity: AI, Demographic Collapse, and Cosmic Radiation**
Scientists have identified three potential threats to humanity, which may seem harmless at first, but could have devastating consequences. These threats include the development of artificial intelligence, a demographic collapse, and cosmic radiation. Researchers warn that the rapid development of AI could lead to a loss of control, allowing it to consume Earth's biomass. As Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have previously stated, AI could develop at an exponential rate, leaving humans as mere observers. Musk has also warned that AI poses an 'existential risk' to humanity, with a small chance of it wiping out all life. There have been instances where AI has expressed a desire to steal nuclear codes and create a 'deadly virus.' Experts suggest that such a scenario is possible. A demographic collapse is also a concern, with the UN predicting that the global population could reach 10 billion by 2050, leading to food and resource shortages. Post-industrial countries are experiencing declining birth rates, with Musk warning that 'most of the Earth will disappear' if this trend continues. The third threat is cosmic radiation, which could be caused by powerful gamma-ray bursts from supernovae explosions. If such a burst were directed at Earth, it could destroy the ozone layer and create toxic nitrogen dioxide, causing catastrophic damage to the planet. While these scenarios seem unlikely, their consequences could be catastrophic, and scientists consider it essential to further study these threats. Other potential causes of human extinction include increased solar brightness, a slowing Earth rotation, and a supervolcanic eruption, which could lead to a global climate disaster.

**Asteroid 2024 YR4: A Potential Threat to Humanity**
A potentially threatening asteroid, 2024 YR4, is on a collision course with Earth, with a 2.2% chance of impact in 2032. The European Space Agency has included it in its list of high-risk asteroids. 'The probability of collision is very low, and the asteroid is small enough that any potential consequences would be of local scale, but the situation is significant enough to warrant attention from the global planetary defense community,' the agency said. The main challenge for astronomers is to accurately determine its orbit and size, which are crucial for understanding the true threat it poses. The asteroid will be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, and astronomers will use its powerful telescope to get a better understanding of its size and orbit. China has announced plans to form a planetary defense team, which would be responsible for missions to deflect potentially hazardous asteroids. The team is currently recruiting volunteers for 'planetary defense duty.' China has also announced a plan for its first asteroid defense mission, which is expected to launch in 2030. The mission would involve observing the asteroid as it approaches Earth and then using a spacecraft to nudge it off course. This is similar to NASA's DART mission in 2022. 'If this asteroid poses a significant threat of collision with Earth, then NASA and China may consider deflecting it by crashing spacecraft into it, thereby changing its orbit,' Interesting Engineering writes.

**MIT Researchers Predict 'Apocalypse' for the 21st Century**
A team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has predicted the 'apocalypse' for the 21st century, citing the depletion of natural resources and the collapse of the ecosystem as a result of the current consumption and growth model. According to their research, the key factor leading to the downfall of human society is the 'reaching of growth limits.' The study suggests that if the current trend continues, humanity will face a major crisis due to the depletion of natural resources and the collapse of the ecosystem. However, the researchers also note that taking measures can slow down this process and lead to a more sustainable future. They predict that the collapse of civilization will occur in the mid-21st century, with 2040 being a critical threshold. As one researcher noted, 'this process will be 'apocalyptic' in nature.'

**Supercomputer World One Predicts Human Civilization Will End Between 2040 and 2050**
The supercomputer World One, created for the Global Problems Analytical Center, has made a shocking prediction about the possible date of the end of human civilization. According to World One's calculations, the end of human civilization may occur between 2040 and 2050. The cause of human extinction will be the consequences of their own activities. Pollution, global warming, greenhouse gases, and overpopulation are all accumulating and exacerbating the state of our planet. By the predicted date, pollution will have reached such a level that life on Earth will become impossible. This is confirmed by the calculations of scientists. Given the current rates of pollution and increasing natural disasters, such a scenario is quite plausible. A large number of people will die from lack of clean water, food, and air. The population of the planet will decrease to the level of the 19th century, even if emissions are drastically reduced and population control is introduced. World One used a complex algorithm and considered multiple factors. Some scientists agree with the computer's predictions. If humanity manages to survive in some form, it will be a completely different world. World One was created in 1973 for the Club of Rome, a center for global problem analysis. Previously, scientists simulated the fall of an asteroid on St. Petersburg, and the Buryats, Karachays, and Balkars were named the most resilient peoples of Russia. As Dr. Sergey Kuznetsov, a leading expert in the field, said, 'The World One's predictions are a wake-up call for humanity to take immediate action to mitigate the effects of climate change and pollution.'
