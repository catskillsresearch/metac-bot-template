**New PS6 and Next-Gen Xbox Game Seemingly Confirmed (And It's a Highly Anticipated Sequel)**
A highly anticipated sequel to Cyberpunk 2077 has seemingly been confirmed, and it is expected to be a PS6 and next-gen Xbox game, possibly skipping the PS5 and Xbox Series X altogether. CD Projekt Red has entered pre-production for the game, and considering it typically takes four to five years to progress from pre-production to release, the game could be released in 2029 or 2030. This would put it in line with the expected release of the PS6 and next-gen Xbox in 2028. Microsoft and Sony are tight-lipped about the next Xbox and PS6, but it is expected that both consoles will be released soon. The PS6 may be a straight-forward revision of the PS5, but the next Xbox could be a curveball as Microsoft continues to try and lay a new path forward with Xbox Game Pass.

**Metro dweller achievement in Metro 2033 (JP)**
The 'Metro dweller' achievement in Metro 2033 is one of the harder achievements to obtain due to unclear requirements. The most accepted theory is that there is a hidden in-game tracker that unlocks the achievement after listening to enough people speaking. To unlock it, players must talk to every person, knock on every door, and interact with every object until it unlocks. This can be done very early on in the game, specifically from the second level 'Hunter' until arriving at Riga station. A comprehensive walkthrough is available for those who want to avoid missing the achievement. Additionally, the 'Explorer' achievement, which involves finding hidden secrets, is also tied to a hidden tracker and may require following the walkthrough to unlock.

**Quick Draw achievement in Metro 2033 (JP)**
The Quick Draw achievement in Metro 2033 (JP) requires players to protect four vents from Nosalises (monsters) in the 'Hunter' level. This is the hardest achievement in the game, requiring quick and accurate shooting with a pistol. Players will receive an audio cue when a Nosalis is approaching, and must shoot on sight to prevent the vents from being breached. The beasts can be defeated with 1-2 bullets each, and the vents can take a few hits before breaking. As TrueAchievements advises, 'Take it slow instead and try and keep a solid overview of the situation.' If a vent is breached, players can simply reload from a checkpoint. A video guide is available to help players complete this challenging achievement.

**Half-Life 3: The Final Chapter of the Franchise?**
A leaker, Daniel Richtman, claims that Half-Life 3 will be the final chapter of the franchise. Fans are discussing the news, with some questioning the credibility of the leaker. According to Richtman, Half-Life 3 will be the last main entry in the series, but spin-offs like Half-Life: Alyx may continue. Some fans have been waiting for over 20 years for the sequel, making the claim seem plausible. However, the leaker's credibility has been questioned due to a previous incorrect prediction about a Marvel fighting game, which was actually Mortal Kombat 1. The news has sparked a discussion in the GamingLeaksandRumours subreddit, with some users sharing similar information from other leakers and influencers. Valve's developer website on Steam has also shown changes and a code hint that suggests Half-Life 3 is in an advanced state of development. A concept artist from Valve has even spoken about the space where the game is being developed. Do you believe in Half-Life 3 and the end of the franchise? Share your thoughts in the comments.

**Borderlands 3: Why You Should Start Over in 2025**
Borderlands 3 is worth replaying in 2025 due to its story continuity with Borderlands 4 and gameplay familiarity. The game has received significant updates since its launch in 2019, including Mayhem 2.0 and Arms Race, making it a polished and feature-complete looter-shooter experience. Playing through Borderlands 3 again can help players prepare for Borderlands 4 by familiarizing themselves with the gameplay and narrative. As Borderlands 4 is set six years after the events of Borderlands 3, playing through the third installment once more can narratively reorient players towards what's next. According to Game Rant, 'Borderlands 3 has quietly become a much more polished experience than many may remember.'

**Half-Life 3 to be Released in 2025, but it will be the Final Chapter**
According to Daniel Richtman, a well-known insider, Valve is planning to release Half-Life 3 in 2025, but it will be the final installment in the series. Richtman stated that Half-Life 3 will 'complete the story, set the accents, and unite the franchise's narrative.' This news may be both exciting and concerning for fans, as they will finally get the long-awaited continuation, but it will also be the last opportunity to see the story of the iconic character, Gordon Freeman, come to a close. Despite this, Valve is reportedly planning to announce Portal 3 after the release of Half-Life 3. The upcoming game is expected to fill in the narrative gaps, answer the fans' main questions, and provide a worthy conclusion to one of the most influential game series in history.

**Half-Life 3 Reportedly Complete and Ready for Release**
According to Tyler McVicker, a Valve insider, Half-Life 3 is already complete and playable from start to finish. McVicker claims that the game, codenamed HLX, is currently in the testing and polishing phase. He states that this is the most solid progress made on the sequel so far, surpassing previous attempts, including those that were canceled due to limitations with the Source 2 engine. McVicker also revealed that the game will not be exclusive to virtual reality, unlike Half-Life: Alyx, and will feature a dynamic system of artificial intelligence inspired by Left 4 Dead 2's 'Director' mode. However, he clarified that the story will not be procedural and will maintain a traditional narrative. McVicker also hinted that Chell from Portal might make an appearance in Half-Life 3, potentially uniting the two franchises. Valve is expected to announce the game within the next few months, with a planned release date for late 2025.

**Half-Life 3: Valve to Release the Game in 2025, According to Rumors**
According to recent rumors, Valve's Half-Life 3, codenamed HLX, is currently in the optimization phase and is expected to be released in 2025. The game is reportedly already fully playable, with Tyler McVicker, a reliable source for Valve leaks, stating that the game is being tested extensively. McVicker also confirmed that HLX is not a VR title like Half-Life: Alyx.

While there is no official announcement from Valve, the project appears to be making progress, with the developers likely focusing on fine-tuning the game. As a result, there is a high chance that Valve may announce Half-Life 3 this summer.

**Half-Life 3: Valve's Long-Awaited Sequel May Be Closer Than You Think**
Valve may officially announce Half-Life 3 soon, potentially beating Grand Theft Auto 6 to market. According to several insiders and data miners, the long-awaited shooter sequel could release this winter, months before GTA 6. Valve has been quietly preparing the return of Gordon Freeman since the release of Half-Life: Alyx in 2020. Tyler McVicker, a reliable Valve insider, claims that Half-Life 3 (internally known as HLX) has been in intense testing phases for months, with people discussing the game's storyline. The game is reportedly fully playable from start to finish, a milestone Valve typically achieves just before release. Gabe Follower, another prominent Valve insider, confirms that the playtests now involve friends and family members of the developers, a pattern seen in Half-Life: Alyx and Deadlock before their official announcements. Valve has also recruited veterans from previous Half-Life projects, including experts in physics-based gameplay mechanics and narrative level design. If true, this could be a significant leap for the shooter genre. Valve rarely comments on unpolished projects, but the hints suggest that Half-Life 3 is closer than ever. If the leaked timeline holds, we may see an official announcement this summer, followed by a winter release.

A bombshell claim has emerged about Half-Life 3, one of the most anticipated games in video game history. According to a source, Valve has completed the game from start to finish. So, what's next?
