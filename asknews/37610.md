**Former U.S. Rep. David Jolly announces run for Florida governor**
Former U.S. Rep. David Jolly announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Florida governor, citing the state's affordability crisis as a major issue. Jolly stated, 'We have an affordability crisis in Florida driven by an insurance crisis that continues to worsen in the face of complete neglect by Tallahassee. We have abandoned public education, and we've allowed corruption to run rampant. It's time for a change.' Despite the long odds, Jolly will face competition from other candidates, including Southwest Florida Congressman Byron Donalds, who has already launched his campaign for the GOP nomination, and Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, who is considering a run. Florida's primary election is scheduled for August 18, 2026, with the general election on November 3, 2026.

**'Radical Leftist': Byron Donalds Laughs Off Never Trumper Ex-GOP Rep Running For FL Gov As Dem**
Former Republican Rep. David Jolly announced his candidacy for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race as a Democrat. Jolly, a longtime critic of President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, stated that Florida is in crisis and needs a change. Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds, the Trump-endorsed frontrunner, referred to Jolly as 'an anti-Trump, radical leftist' and said he is 'completely out of touch with Florida's voters and our values.' Donalds added that he will fight side by side with Trump to protect Florida families and Make America Great Again. The Florida Republican Party also criticized Jolly, calling him a 'flip-flopping political relic' and stating that Floridians won't be swayed by his candidacy.

**Republican turncoat announces Democrat bid for Florida governor's seat | Blaze Media**
Former Republican David Jolly, who represented the Tampa Bay area in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2014 to 2017, has announced his bid for the Florida governor's seat in 2026 as a Democrat. Jolly, who was an independent until recently, stated that he brings a different value set to the Democratic Party, including support for marriage equality, gun control, climate science, and campaign finance reform. According to Jolly, 'The actual registration as a Democrat wasn't a pivot. It was a kind of formality.' He believes the Democratic Party is the right 'vessel' to help him address the 'affordability crisis' in Florida, which he attributes to an insurance crisis, neglected public education, and corruption. Jolly's challenge to the Republican stronghold in Florida comes at a time when the Democratic Party faces uncertainty, with a reported 1.2-1.3 million more registered Republicans than Democrats in the state.

**What Pinellas' David Jolly brings to Florida's governor race | Column**
David Jolly, a former congressman from Pinellas County, has announced his candidacy for Florida governor in 2026. Jolly, who switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party in April, is running on a moderate agenda that focuses on affordability, education, and economic growth. He has proposed reforms such as creating a state catastrophic fund to ease insurance premiums and giving Florida students better access to state colleges and universities. Jolly's appeal lies in his ability to work across the aisle and build a coalition to address concerns across a broad front. However, his biggest challenge is his own party, as registered Republicans outnumber Democrats in Florida. Jolly will need to break through the new mediascape and convince Democrats that he is genuinely one with them. As Jolly said, 'I've been out of politics long enough to tell the truth. Some of our leaders escalate problems instead of de-escalating them. We have to de-escalate division.'

**Former Republican congressman-turned-Democrat launches bid for governor in push to flip red-state Florida**
Former Republican congressman David Jolly has announced his candidacy for governor in Florida as a Democrat, aiming to end the party's losing streak in the state. Jolly, who won election and re-election to Congress as a Republican a decade ago, pointed to the state's affordability crisis as a key issue, saying, 'It's been even longer since we had an affordability crisis like we're experiencing right now. That's how.' He argued that the crisis has 'largely been caused by Republican neglect that I don't believe Republicans will address and that our campaign will.' Jolly acknowledged the GOP's voter registration advantage in Florida but said, 'Let's be honest about the math... There aren't enough Democratic votes in Florida for a Democratic governor to just win with their own party. We have to build a coalition that includes independents and commonsense Republicans.' He highlighted his own transition from Republican to Democrat, saying, 'David Jolley left the party... I've grown. I've changed.' Florida Republicans predict Jolly will become the latest in a line of defeated Democrat gubernatorial candidates.

**Former GOP congressman David Jolly running for governor in Florida as Democrat**
Former Republican congressman David Jolly is running for governor in Florida as a Democrat. Jolly, a vocal critic of Donald Trump, believes that issues such as affordability, funding public schools, and strengthening campaign finance and ethics laws will resonate with all voters in 2026. He predicts that elections next year will herald nationwide change. Jolly said, 'I actually think Republicans in Tallahassee have gone too far in dividing us. I think we should get politicians out of the classrooms, out of the doctor's offices.' He added, 'I think enough people in Florida, even some Republicans, now understand that. That the culture wars have gone too far.' Jolly has undergone a political evolution, leaving the Republican Party in 2018 to become an independent and then a registered Democrat. He has built a national profile as an anti-Trump political commentator on MSNBC. Jolly will face Trump-backed Republican U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds in the gubernatorial election.

**Ex-GOP congressman turns on party to fight as Dem governor hopeful in Florida**
David Jolly, a former Republican congressman, has officially entered the Democratic primary for governor of Florida. Jolly acknowledges the challenges of running as a Democrat in a state that hasn't elected one to a statewide office since 2018, but believes the environment is ripe for change in 2026. He says, 'We will be in every community, building trust and building relationships and building a coalition that will ultimately and successfully win an election where a Democrat hasn't won in 30 years and where the voter registration rolls are against us.' Jolly's campaign focuses on addressing the affordability crisis in Florida, which he believes is the top issue on the minds of every Floridian. He says, 'The affordability crisis is number one on the minds of every Floridian. Wherever you live, whatever your socioeconomic status - whatever your party registration - the affordability crisis is number one.' Jolly's opposition to Trump has been a central part of his brand, but he says the 2026 election is about the people of Florida, not the current president. He says, 'This race is about the affordability crisis in the state of Florida. Republicans will try to make this race about Donald Trump. They will try to make it about division, not unity. My job every day on behalf of this coalition, is to keep us focused on the affordability crisis.'

**Former Republican David Jolly has entered the race for Florida governor -- as a Democrat**
David Jolly, a former Republican, has officially entered the Democratic primary for governor of Florida. Jolly, a 52-year-old Pinellas County resident, has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump and has previously described himself as a 'George H.W. Bush Republican.' He acknowledges the challenges of running in an electoral landscape that hasn't elected a Democrat to a statewide office since 2018, but believes the environment is ripe for change in 2026. 'We will be in every community, building trust and building relationships and building a coalition that will ultimately and successfully win an election where a Democrat hasn't won in 30 years and where the voter registration rolls are against us,' he said. Jolly's campaign focuses on addressing the affordability crisis in Florida, which he believes is a top priority for voters. He also emphasizes the need for property tax reform and investing in public schools and safe communities. University of North Florida political science professor Michael Binder notes that Jolly's candidacy is similar to that of Charlie Crist, who left the Republican Party to become an independent and later a Democrat. Binder says that if Jolly can connect with base Democrats, he may have a chance at winning, but if he fails to do so, there's 'absolutely no chance.'

**David Jolly and Josh Weil test drive their campaign messages at Pinellas town hall**
David Jolly, a former Republican turned Democrat, and Josh Weil, a Central Florida public middle school instructor, are testing their campaign messages ahead of their potential candidacies for governor and U.S. Senate in 2026. Jolly, who plans to announce his candidacy for governor in mid-June, emphasized the need for a 'constitutional crisis' to be addressed and the importance of expanding Medicaid, investing in renewable energy, and being tough on crime. He also discussed gun safety and the need for the Democratic Party to go to places where their candidates haven't ventured in a long time. Weil, who lost to Republican Randy Fine in the Congressional District 6 special election, said that Democrats have too often written off congressional districts that they don't believe they can win. He plans to raise $10 million for voter registration efforts across the state over the next 16 months, with a particular interest in Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties. Jolly's former party affiliation and past conservative positions may become an issue in his campaign, but he is now a 'full proponent of codifying the Roe-Casey framework at the national and state level.'

**Florida governor race sees 5 possible candidates as Gaetz rumors swirl**
The 2026 Florida governor's race is heating up with five possible candidates, including Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL), who has already announced his candidacy and received an endorsement from President Donald Trump. However, other contenders, such as Casey DeSantis, the wife of Governor Ron DeSantis, and former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, are also considering a run. Gaetz has publicly backed Casey, but is reportedly still considering a run himself, which could lead to a three-way primary and potentially allow a 'dark horse candidate to win the GOP nomination with just roughly 30% of the vote.' Casey has refused to rule out a bid, saying 'Floridians are so tired of politics' after the country 'literally just went through an election cycle.' Recent polling suggests the race could be competitive between Casey and Donalds, and Gaetz's entry could make it even trickier to navigate. Democrats are banking on former Rep. David Jolly to mount a challenge to the GOP, while Florida state Senate leader Jason Pizzo is planning to run as a non-party-affiliated candidate, hoping to capitalize on the growing force of independents in the state.

Sen. Jason Pizzo, who recently left the Democratic Party, has announced his run for Florida governor. When asked if he would be spoiling the governor's race for Democrats, Pizzo said, 'If they think that I'm a spoiler, then they're concerned about the merit of their own message and the strength of their own message, or policy, or whatever it is.' He believes his position and message are resonating with many people and groups. Pizzo, who has been in two competitive races, including unseating a sitting state senator, pointed out that 'NPAs decide who wins elections in this state, there's 3.7 million of them.' With Pizzo out of the Democratic primary, the party's gubernatorial favorite is now unclear, with former Republican David Jolly hinting at a run.

This could potentially open up a lane for Jolly, but his chances of winning are doubtful.

Florida Democratic Executive Committee Chair Ryan Ray welcomed Jolly to the party but expressed skepticism about his chances, saying 'party switchers have historically not won.'

Former Republican congressman David Jolly is considering a run for governor of Florida in 2026 as a Democrat. Jolly, who gained attention for criticizing former President Donald Trump, wants to offer a different kind of leadership to Florida's divided politics. He believes Florida's government needs a leader who puts the needs of all Floridians first, instead of focusing on divisive political fights. Jolly's goal is to bring people together and fix the state's problems without letting partisanship get in the way. However, he may face challenges as a Democrat, including doubts among some voters about his past as a Republican. Despite this, Jolly's moderate views could help him stand out, and he has already started meeting with local leaders and grassroots organizations across the state to see if there's enough support for his campaign. Some of the issues he plans to focus on include protecting Florida's environment, improving healthcare, and making sure schools are well-funded.

**Top contenders to take baton from DeSantis as Florida's governor - Washington Examiner**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is ineligible to run for re-election in 2026 due to term limitations. Several candidates are vying to take his place, including Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL), who has the endorsement of President Donald Trump. However, DeSantis has accused Donalds of not delivering victories for Florida residents and is reportedly urging lobbyists to support his wife, Casey DeSantis, who is considering a bid for governor. Casey DeSantis has a slight approval rating lead on Donalds among Florida voters, according to a recent poll. Other contenders include former Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, who has signaled his intent to run, and David Jolly, a former Republican congressman who has left the party and is considering a run as a Democrat. Jolly is seen as the Democrats' best chance to take control of Florida, but faces an uphill battle as no Democrat holds statewide elected office in the state.
