**Cracks in the Rogansphere? Inner circle revolts as Joe Rogan's Elon Musk obsession and political leanings spark backlash**
Joe Rogan's podcast, 'The Joe Rogan Experience,' has seen a decline in Spotify rankings since November. The podcast, which was once the most popular, has fallen behind shows like 'The Shawn Ryan Show,' 'MeidasTouch,' and 'Good Hang.' Rogan's shift towards more political content and his support for Elon Musk have caused discomfort among some guests, including neuroscientist Sam Harris, who said, 'He's in over his head on so many topics of great consequence.' Harris criticized Rogan for not pushing back against misinformation, citing examples of guests who spread false information, such as Holocaust deniers and liars like Trump and Tucker Carlson. Despite a 25% jump in downloads in February, Rogan's podcast has lost ground to other shows, with MeidasTouch reaching 57.5 million downloads, a 109% jump from the previous month.

**Meghan Markle's New Podcast Makes Lukewarm Debut on Spotify**
Meghan Markle's new podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, made a relatively quiet entrance on Spotify's global stage, ranking at number 10 on Spotify's general top podcast chart in the United States. The first episode featured Markle in conversation with Whitney Wolfe Herd, the founder of Tinder and Bumble. Critics generally panned it, although it's worth noting that Markle's previous podcast, Archetypes, debuted at number one in its launch week in 2022, but quickly slipped down the rankings as listeners tired of the formula. According to Spotify's rankings, the show's relatively low ranking may be a disappointment for such a high-profile launch.

**Meghan's new podcast FLOPS as first episode fails to meet figures of her Archetypes show - amid criticism of interview style and after Spotify boss called she and Harry 'f****** grifters' | Daily Mail Online**
Meghan Markle's new podcast, 'Confessions Of A Female Founder', has received scathing reviews, with critics condemning its 'vapid lessons in self-love' and 'ego-fluffing conversation'. The podcast, which sees Meghan chat with successful women who have launched their own businesses, has been given one star by The Times and The Irish Times, with reviewers criticizing its 'mutual love-in' and 'sycophantic interview style'. This comes after Spotify's Head of Podcast Innovation and Monetization, Bill Simmons, called Harry and Meghan 'f***ing grifters' in 2023. Meghan's previous podcast, 'Archetypes', was a success, ranking at Number One in the US podcast chart in 2022, but its reported $20million deal with Spotify ended in June 2022. Meghan has also faced criticism for her interview style and her new luxury food brand, As Ever, which was accompanied by an eight-part Netflix cooking show. Speaking to PEOPLE Magazine, Meghan said that talking to other female founders has been 'meaningful' for her entrepreneurial journey, but critics have condemned the podcast as 'inane' and 'stomach-turning'.

The podcast has been given one star in The Times and two stars in The Telegraph, Standard, and Guardian, with critics condemning it as 'inane' and 'stomach-turning'. Meghan's previous podcast, Archetypes, was a huge success, but this new podcast has struggled to reach the same level of success, ranking 19th on Spotify's general Top Podcasts chart in the US. As of Friday, three days after the release of Episode One, Meghan's new podcast was number 19 on Spotify's general Top Podcasts chart in the US.
