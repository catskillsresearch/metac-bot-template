**Avian Flu in Cats: A Warning Sign for a Potential Pandemic**
Scientists from the University of Maryland warn that the spread of avian flu in cats is being seriously underestimated. According to researcher Kristen Coleman, 'the avian flu is fatal to cats, and we need to determine urgently how widespread the virus is in cat populations to better evaluate the risk of transmission to humans.' Coleman and co-author Ian Bemis reviewed 607 cases of avian flu in cats worldwide between 2004 and 2024, resulting in 302 deaths. They believe that the lack of monitoring means that these numbers are seriously understated. The researchers also noted that between 2023 and 2024, the number of domestic cats that died from avian flu increased, with most cases being infected with the H5N1 strain. While there have been no confirmed cases of transmission from cat to human for this strain, a 2016 outbreak of a different strain in New York animal shelters resulted in transmission from cats to humans. The appearance of the H5N1 virus has put farms on high alert, leading to animal sacrifices due to the fear of a potential human pandemic. Coleman urges authorities, veterinarians, and pet owners to increase surveillance in cats, saying 'we want to help protect both people and pets.' Cats can become infected by hunting or consuming raw, infected food, including commercial products. They can also contract the virus from other mammals they live with, such as neighborhood cats and potentially their owners, which could be another reason to transition to an indoor lifestyle. 'Our future research will include studies to determine the prevalence of high-pathogenicity avian influenza and other influenza viruses in high-risk cat populations, such as farm cats,' adds Bemis.

**Avian Influenza Pandemic Risk Increases as Virus Spreads from Animals to Humans**
Experts warn that the recent increase in zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses, which can infect humans, poses a risk of a pandemic. The Korea Medical Biojournalists Association and the Seoul National University National Future Strategy Institute held a forum on May 12 to discuss the current situation and pandemic risk analysis of avian influenza. According to the experts, the recent outbreak of H5N1 in the US, including humans, and the domestic case of a cat infected with the virus, indicate that the risk of zoonotic transmission is increasing globally. The main virus that infects humans is the H5N1 high-pathogenicity virus, which was first discovered in 1959. Since then, the virus has been found to be endemic in Asia and has continued to infect humans. The virus has also been found in other mammals, such as pigs and cattle. Kim Nam-joong, a professor of infectious diseases at Seoul National University, said, 'If the 'spillover' phenomenon, where the virus jumps from birds to mammals, continues to increase, the possibility of a pandemic also increases.' He added, 'If the virus undergoes genetic recombination, it could lead to a pandemic.' The current situation is that the avian influenza virus is not yet spreading on a large scale, but the risk of a pandemic is still present. If the virus continues to spread from animals to humans, it is essential to take preventive measures to avoid a pandemic. Song Dae-seop, a professor at Seoul National University's College of Veterinary Medicine, said, 'The recent case of a 10-year-old boy infected with the H5N1 D1.1 virus in Canada and the first reported death in the US due to the same virus are a cause for concern.' He added, 'This is a different strain from the B3.13 virus found in US cattle, and if it undergoes a sudden mutation, the risk of human-to-human transmission will increase.' The Korean government is also taking steps to prepare for the risk of a pandemic. Yeo Sang-gu, the head of the Disease Control and Prevention Agency, said, 'We are strengthening cooperation with the Ministry of Administration and Safety, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Ministry of Environment to prevent human infection.' He added, 'We are implementing the 'National Stockpile Material Mid-term Plan' and working to establish a more concrete preparedness system.'

**Experts Warn of Growing Risk of Avian Influenza Pandemic**
Experts warn of the growing risk of a pandemic due to the increasing number of cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in humans, animals, and birds. According to Dr. Ye Sang-gu, the head of the Disease Control and Prevention Division at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 47 cases of HPAI in poultry and 43 cases in birds reported nationwide from October last year to this year. Additionally, 25 suspected human cases were reported, but all were found to be negative. The government's HPAI monitoring system has been reporting domestic suspected cases consistently. The HPAI virus is spreading from birds to mammals and humans, and the risk of human-to-human transmission is increasing. In the US, a pig farm in Oregon was found to have the H5N1 virus last year, and this year, a pig farm in Yorkshire, UK, was found to have the same virus. In Korea, a case of a cow's tuberculosis being transmitted to a human was also confirmed. Dr. Song Dae-seop, a professor at Seoul National University's College of Veterinary Medicine, said, 'The recent case of a human death due to the H5N1 D1.1 virus in the US is a direct threat, and we should be vigilant.' He also warned of the risk of 'reverse transmission' from humans to pets, citing that 3% of cat influenza cases are actually human influenza cases. Dr. Kim Nam-joong, a professor at Seoul National University's College of Medicine, said, 'If the virus is able to jump from birds to mammals, the risk of human-to-human transmission will increase. We need to continuously monitor for the emergence of AI viruses that can be transmitted between humans.' The experts also emphasized the need to develop diagnostic systems and vaccines in preparation for a pandemic. Dr. Choi Eun-hwa, a professor at Seoul National University's College of Medicine, said, 'We need to develop an mRNA-based avian influenza vaccine.' Dr. Sung Heung-seop, a professor at Ulsan University's College of Medicine, said, 'We need to actively conduct serological tests and confirm the limitations of diagnostic kits.'

**New model reveals H5N1 is spreading undetected in US dairy herds**
A new study published in Nature Communications reveals that the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 is spreading undetected in US dairy herds, with the West Coast states having the highest disease burden. The study used a stochastic metapopulation transmission model to simulate H5N1 transmission between 35,974 herds in the US, and found that Arizona and Wisconsin are at the highest risk of future outbreaks. The researchers highlight gaps in current biosecurity surveillance systems and suggest that dairy outbreaks are in the 2025 forecast, necessitating urgent interventions addressing these gaps. 'Significant increases in testing are urgently required to reduce the uncertainty of model projections and provide decision-makers with a more accurate picture of the true scale of the national epidemic.'

**The true enemies of the people**
Bill Palmer warns that the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, also known as bird flu, is a major threat to global health. Despite the Trump administration's cut in funding to combat the virus, Palmer emphasizes that the real problem lies in the spread of misinformation and vaccine denialism. According to Palmer, the mortality rate of human bird flu infection is over 50%, and if it spreads worldwide, it could lead to billions of deaths. The virus is also evolving and jumping from mammal to mammal, with virologist Dr. Angela Rasmussen stating that she is 'scared' about the situation. Meanwhile, vaccine denialism and mistrust of science are becoming a pandemic on the internet, with Palmer labeling those who refuse to get vaccinated as the 'true enemies of the people'.

**Bird Flu Virus May Pose Greater Threat to Humans, Researchers Warn**
Researchers from the University of Maryland's School of Public Health have conducted a 20-year review of global data and warned that the H5N1 bird flu virus may pose a greater threat to humans than previously thought. The virus is mutating and can be transmitted between species, including from birds to cats, cows to cats, and cats to humans. According to the study, published in the Open Forum Infectious Diseases journal, cats are extremely vulnerable to bird flu, with a 50% mortality rate among 607 reported cases in 18 countries. The virus can be transmitted directly through consuming infected birds or raw meat, or indirectly through contact with infected cows or other mammals. Researchers are concerned about the high mortality rate and prevalence of the infection in domestic and agricultural settings. They fear that outbreaks may spread to shelters and, with further mutations, the virus could become airborne and transmit between humans. A nasal vaccine against H5N1 was presented in April 2025, which triggers an immune response directly in the respiratory tract, where the virus enters the body.

**Could bird flu be the next pandemic? What we know about H5N1**
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has reported 70 human cases of H5N1 bird flu in the U.S. since 2024, with the first human death caused by the virus announced in early 2025. While the CDC considers the risk to the public to be low, many experts have varying opinions on the potential for the virus to escalate into a more serious problem. Jacob Lemieux, an infectious disease specialist, said, 'I think we are living next to a volcano, and it may erupt or it may not, but we need to prepare for the possibility of a pandemic.' The virus has been detected in wild birds, poultry, and dairy cows in the U.S., and has also been found in North Carolina, where no human cases have been announced. The CDC advises that poultry and eggs should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees to kill bacteria and viruses, including avian influenza A viruses. Biosecurity measures can help protect backyard chickens and other domestic birds from infectious diseases, including avian flu. The symptoms of bird flu in humans may include eye redness, respiratory symptoms, and fever, and anyone with direct or close exposure to infected birds or animals should be monitored for illness for 10 days after their last exposure.

**Bird flu in cats needs 'urgent surveillance' as scientists warn of pandemic risk - Manchester Evening News**
Scientists have warned of a pandemic risk as bird flu spreads among animals, including cats. The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has been detected in domesticated animals and pets, including cats in Korea and the US. Researchers from the University of Maryland School of Public Health have called for 'urgent surveillance' of cats to help avoid human-to-human transmission of bird flu. According to Dr. Kristen Coleman, lead author of the study, 'The virus has evolved, and the way that it jumps between species - from birds to cats, and now between cows and cats, cats and humans - is very concerning.' The bird flu virus is highly infectious and has a 90% fatality rate in cats. The research team is concerned about the potential for bird flu to spread through animal shelters and result in large outbreaks involving humans. Other experts, including Richard Pebody, director of epidemic and emerging infections at the UK Health Security Agency, have also warned of the risks of H5N1 bird flu, stating that it has 'future pandemic' potential.

**H5N1 virus in US sparks global health crisis: Know its symptoms, mode of transmission, vaccine**
The H5N1 virus, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, has spread to all 50 US states, causing concerns among health officials and experts. According to the Global Virus Network, the virus has infected cows, cats, and humans, with 70 cases reported since 2024. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that the virus's jump to mammals increases the risk of mutations. Symptoms in humans range from mild to severe, including respiratory issues, conjunctivitis, and non-respiratory symptoms. The WHO advises that the virus does not easily infect humans or spread from person to person, but warns that co-circulation with swine or human seasonal influenza viruses could lead to reassortant viruses that can efficiently spread in humans. The CDC considers the virus to have a moderate future pandemic risk. The WHO recommends proper management of influenza patients, including antiviral medicines, and advises consumers to safely prepare meat and eggs. Vaccines are not currently recommended for human infections of H5N1. 'The recent emergence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus infections in dairy cows and humans in the U.S. has raised alarms regarding the potential for a pandemic,' said the Global Virus Network. 'Concurrently, the virus continues to circulate in wild birds, backyard flocks, and hunted migratory species, further amplifying the risk to humans and domestic animals,' they added.

**Avian Influenza: Global Virus Network Warns of Pandemic Risk**
The Global Virus Network warns that there is a risk of a pandemic if the H5N1 avian influenza virus mutates and becomes unpredictable. According to experts, the United States should intensify efforts to combat the ongoing avian influenza epidemic, which has lasted for a year, and control the risk of a pandemic for humans. A detailed analysis published in 'The Lancet Regional Health—Americas' describes the epidemic in North America, with almost 1000 dairy cattle herds affected and over 70 human cases, including the first confirmed death in the United States. 'The highly pathogenic avian influenza is present in all 50 US states and Canada, causing the loss or culling of over 168 million poultry since 2022,' said the scientists, who urged the Trump administration to take action against the threat of an avian influenza pandemic, even with a coordinated global response. 'Although human-to-human transmission has not yet been documented, mutations and viral reassortments could increase transmissibility.' The GVN urges governments to enhance surveillance, implement biosafety measures, and prepare for potential human-to-human transmission. Marion Koopmans, co-author of the article and head of the Viroscience department at the Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands, stated, 'The risk for humans not in contact with infected animals is low, as the viruses are not able to transmit between people.' However, 'the situation can change suddenly if the virus mutates, which can happen if it continues to circulate in mammals - she added. 'In that case, we would be facing a new possible pandemic scenario.'

**Everything you need to know about bird flu**
The highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) virus has been spreading globally, infecting over 960 people since 2003, killing roughly half of them. In 2024, the virus appeared in dairy cows in the Texas Panhandle, and since then, it has been detected in at least 17 states. The virus has also affected diverse mammals, including cats, goats, mink, tigers, seals, and dolphins. While the virus has not acquired the ability to pass easily from person to person, it has infected dozens of people in the United States, mainly farm workers, and killed its first person stateside in January 2025. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization rate the public health risk as low, but the situation could change. Scientists are concerned about the virus's ability to mutate and spread, and the potential for human-to-human transmission. To combat the spread of the virus, the US Department of Agriculture has allocated up to $1 billion in additional funds to combat highly pathogenic avian flu, including support for biosecurity, financial relief for farmers, and vaccine research. Companies, such as Zoetis, are working on H5N1 vaccines for cows, but it's too soon to know if and how such vaccines would be deployed. Even with vaccines, 'we may not be able to put out this fire,' says Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. 'It appears, to many of us, that these viruses are going to be endemic, or we say 'enzootic,' for a long time.'

**Everything You Need to Know About Bird Flu**
The highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) virus has been spreading globally, infecting over 960 people since 2003, killing roughly half of them. In the United States, it has infected dozens of people, mainly farm workers, and killed its first person in January 2025. The virus has also appeared in dairy cows in Texas, causing concern for the dairy industry. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) rate the public health risk as low, but the situation could change. Scientists are working on H5N1 vaccines for poultry and dairy cows, but it's uncertain whether they will be deployed. The virus has shown to be highly adaptable, with new variants emerging, and it's possible that it could evolve to spread easily among humans. However, as of spring 2025, there are no confirmed cases of human-to-human H5N1 transmission in the United States. Researchers believe that the virus would have to change its hemagglutinin to recognize a sugar arrangement found in the human upper respiratory tract to facilitate person-to-person transmission. They are also studying the role of disease history and immunity in the spread of the virus. The CDC has found that three dairy veterinarians had antibodies to H5N1, indicating they'd been infected, but had never noticed symptoms. The virus has also acquired new gene variants, which may be a factor in its spread. 'The thing about this virus is, every time we think we know what's going to happen, it does something totally unexpected,' says Michelle Wille, a virus ecologist at the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne, Australia. 'And that's the only consistent thing I can say about it.'

**Can Avian Flu be Transmitted to Humans? What We Know**
The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has raised concerns in the global health community due to its spread among mammals. According to Reuters, the virus has been spreading among mammals, causing fear of a new pandemic due to the possibility of high transmission among humans. The article explains that the avian flu is caused by the influenza A virus, classified by the combination of two groups of protein, H and N. The combination of these proteins produces different diseases. From 2022 to the present, the avian flu H5N1 has spread among mammals of different species, including hundreds of humans, mainly in the Americas and Europe. The fear of a large-scale transmission among humans and a new pandemic grows as the virus has infected hundreds of people since 2022. Mammals such as dairy cows and sheep from farms have been infected, species that interact closely with humans, increasing the likelihood of transmission. Pigs, which can easily contract and spread avian diseases, are also a concern as they can exchange genes with the virus, forming a new and more dangerous virus that could lead to a pandemic. This has happened before, as seen with the 2009-2010 swine flu pandemic that killed 12,400 people, with 1,316 deaths and 72,548 cases in Mexico alone.

**Avian Influenza: Global Outbreak and Human Risk**
Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have been circulating globally for several years, affecting not only wild and captive birds but also various carnivorous and marine mammal species and, more recently, cattle. Since 2021, Europe has been experiencing the largest HPAI outbreak ever recorded, caused by H5Nx viruses (mainly H5N1), with new dynamics of propagation in migratory wildlife and poultry and bird farms detected since 2023. Additionally, since 2024, several cases of infection with the A(H5N1) influenza virus have been reported in dairy cow herds in the United States, raising concerns about the virus's adaptation to transmission between mammals, including humans. Meanwhile, swine influenza viruses are circulating in French pig farms throughout the year. In this context, human cases are closely monitored: as of January 20, 2025, 102 cases of H5N1 avian influenza infections worldwide between 2020 and 2024 have been reported to the WHO, including 10 deaths. Among these cases, 68 were detected in the United States and 7 in Europe (UK and Spain). Although no documented human-to-human transmission has been reported, all these factors - increased cases in animals, number of affected species, spread of the risk period throughout the year, geographic expansion, potential adaptation to humans, and the risk of establishing human-to-human transmission or even pandemic risk - require particular vigilance. In France, no human cases of avian influenza have been reported to date, but the DGS has updated the guidelines to anticipate this risk, saying, 'Nous devons être vigilants et prêts à agir rapidement en cas de détection de cas humains.' (We must be vigilant and ready to act quickly in case of human case detection.)
