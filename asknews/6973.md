**Warriors trade proposal moves Moses Moody and more for top-10 pick in 2025 NBA Draft**
The Golden State Warriors are considering trading Moses Moody, a 2027 top-10 protected pick, and a 2030 second-round pick to the Houston Rockets for the 10th overall pick in the 2025 NBA draft and Cam Whitmore. According to Derek Parker, this deal would allow the Warriors to 're-shuffle their roster and land a top developmental talent' from a 'loaded' 2025 draft. The Rockets, in a win-now position, might not see the value in acquiring Moody, but Whitmore has shown potential as a rotation player.

**Atlanta Hawks 2025 NBA Draft Profile- Duke Center Khaman Maluach**
The Atlanta Hawks have two first-round picks in the 2025 NBA Draft and are considering selecting Duke center Khaman Maluach. Maluach is a 7-foot-2-inch tall center with a 7-foot-5 wingspan and a standing reach of 9'8, making him a strong presence in the paint. He is efficient around the rim, scoring on 71% of his field goals, and has shown the ability to somewhat shoot the basketball from three-point range. However, he is limited offensively and struggles with stamina, averaging only 21 minutes per game as a freshman. Despite these concerns, Maluach has good maturity and a fast learner mentality, making him a potential solid center for the Hawks. ESPN projected the Hawks to finish with 36 wins and a 34.1% chance of making the playoffs this past season, and adding Maluach could improve their chances. 'With Jalen Johnson back healthy, and players such as Dyson Daniels and Larry Nance Jr. in the fold, Atlanta should take a much-needed step forward defensively this year,' said ESPN's Chris Herring. The Hawks might be looking to move off of veteran center Clint Capela this offseason, and Maluach could be a fresh start opportunity for them. 'He doesn't bite defensively or find himself in foul trouble compared to some of the NBA's prominent defensive players,' said an analyst. 'He is very efficient around the rim, scoring on 71% of his field goals and most of these baskets came from alley-oops off pick-and-rolls he has shown the ability to somewhat, not at a high clip, shoot the basketball from three-point range.'

**NBA Trade Idea Lands Lakers Starting Center In Multi-Team Deal**
The Los Angeles Lakers are looking to address their lack of presence on the interior, which was exposed during their first-round series against the Minnesota Timberwolves. According to a report, the Lakers could trade sharpshooter Dalton Knecht to the Denver Nuggets in a multi-team deal to land a big man. The proposed trade would involve the Lakers sending Knecht, Hachimura, and their 2031 first-round pick to the Nuggets, while receiving a big man who has played in 70 or more games across the last three seasons. The Nuggets would free up cap space by trading Porter Jr. for two rotational pieces, while the Nets would land an efficient, sharpshooting wing in Porter Jr. and the Lakers' pick.

**Denmark to Raise Retirement Age to 70 by 2040: A Response to Aging Population**
Denmark plans to raise the retirement age to 70 years by 2040, with the current retirement age being 67 years. The retirement age will increase every five years, reaching 68 in 2030 and 69 in 2035. This move comes as protests continue over low pensions, with experts calling for changes to labor laws to address the issue. A proposed labor reform aims to increase flexibility in work arrangements, reduce state intervention in private agreements, and allow for more flexible salaries and work relationships. Meanwhile, a proposed pension reform aims to address issues such as the 'envejecimiento poblacional' (aging population), where people are living longer but having fewer children, leading to uncertainty over the future of pensioners. Experts suggest moving from a 'beneficio definido' (defined benefit) system to a 'contribución definida' (defined contribution) system. According to Jacqueline Maubré, 'El sistema de reparto está en crisis en la Argentina. La expectativa de vida ha crecido, pero tambien baja el ritmo de la natalidad.' (The pension system is in crisis in Argentina. Life expectancy has increased, but the birth rate has also decreased.)

**Nets Prospect Watch: Players Brooklyn Could Draft at No. 26 and No. 27**
The Brooklyn Nets have five picks in the 2025 NBA Draft, including No. 8, No. 19, No. 26, and No. 27. While the top picks are crucial, the Nets are also scouting for potential gems at No. 26 and No. 27. Three prospects who could fit the bill are Thiero, Saraf, and Powell. Thiero, a 6-foot-8 forward, is a versatile defender who could find a role in Brooklyn. Saraf, a 6-foot-5 guard, has the potential to be a great scorer and could learn from veteran forward Cam Johnson. Powell, a 6-foot-6 athletic wing, is one of the best defenders in the class and could fit the mold of a Josh Hart or Amen Thompson. 'With the right development, the Nets could end up with a hidden gem,' said an analyst. 'Powell is one of the best and most versatile defenders in the entire class,' said another. 'Saraf isn't the most consistent scorer, but he can knock down shots from almost anywhere, and thrives in getting downhill and finishing at the rim.'

**NBA Draft: Top Landing Spots for Ratiopharm Ulm's Noa Essengue**
Noa Essengue, an 18-year-old French wing defender, has risen to the top 10 of many big boards in the 2025 draft class. He has the potential to be one of the best wing defenders in the class, with a 6-foot-9, 194 lbs. frame and a 6-foot-11 wingspan. Essengue averaged 1.4 steals and 0.6 blocks in 23.7 minutes per game in the 2024-2025 season. He is a raw talent who may not be able to contribute to winning immediately, but his potential is high. Portland, Chicago, and Toronto are potential landing spots for Essengue, with Portland being the best fit due to their success in developing big wings and their need for a strong defensive group. Essengue's shaky jump shot is a concern, but he has the ability to attack the basket and get to the free throw line, which could be beneficial for the Bulls. The Raptors also have a strong defensive system that could help Essengue contribute, but he may not reach his full potential due to the clogged wing rotation.

**NBA Draft: Top Landing Spots for Maryland's Derik Queen**
Derik Queen, a 6-foot-10, 246-pound center from Maryland, is entering the 2025 NBA Draft with a unique skillset that includes a guard-like dribble package and body movement. He averaged 16.5 points, 9 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 1.1 blocks, and 1.1 steals per game last season. Queen's versatility makes him a strong centerpiece to an offense, and he could be a good fit for teams that are adopting the double-big lineup. Potential landing spots for Queen include the Washington Wizards, Chicago Bulls, and Atlanta Hawks. The Wizards could pair Queen with Alex Sarr, while the Bulls could use Queen as a long-term answer at center. The Hawks could select Queen to pair with Trae Young and create a new dynamic in their offense.

**Conference Finals Exposing Glaring Hole Pacers can Address in Draft**
The Indiana Pacers' center depth has been exposed as a glaring hole in their rotation, particularly against the New York Knicks' Karl-Anthony Towns and Mitchell Robinson. With Myles Turner and Thomas Bryant set for free agency, and Tony Bradley's club option unannounced, the team needs to address this issue. According to NBA Draft On SI's latest mock draft, the Pacers select Georgetown big Thomas Sorber with the No. 23 overall pick in the 2025 Draft. Sorber's physical tools, including his 6-foot-10 frame, 255 lbs. weight, and 7-foot-6 wingspan, would be a big help in series like these for Indiana. He averaged 8.5 rebounds per game in his freshman season at Georgetown and has the strength and rim protection to go toe-to-toe with Towns. As one analyst notes, 'If Towns were to try and post Sorber up, he's got the strength and rim protection to go toe-to-toe with Towns, averaging 2 blocks per game last season.'

**One Bucks Trade Idea Would End All Giannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard Rumors**
Matt Levine of Newsweek proposes a trade idea that would end all Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard rumors. The Bucks could swap Damian Lillard for Phoenix Suns' All-Star forward Kevin Durant, pairing him with Giannis Antetokounmpo. However, the big caveat is Lillard's health, as his torn Achilles tendon likely means he's done for the 2025-26 season. The Bucks have very little draft equity, but could send the Suns their own 2031 first round draft pick, plus a pair of second round picks in 2025 and '31. Levine wonders, 'Could the Bucks and Suns shock the NBA world by sending Durant to pair with Giannis Antetokounmpo?' Levine notes that the basketball fit of Durant and Antetokounmpo could be intriguing, but the Suns will likely have more appetizing trade partners that satisfy both Phoenix and Durant.

**What's the Average Height of an NBA Player in 2025?**
The average height of an NBA player in 2025 is 6' 7' (78.54 inches), according to the league's roster survey. This is in line with the league's median over the past four decades. The trend of emphasizing three-point shooting and smaller, quicker defenders has led to a shift in player heights, with 72% of the league being under 6' 9'. The average height of NBA point guards is 6' 2.4', while the other four positions are the shortest they've been since the early 1980s. The current NBA player would tower over those who played in the 1951-52 season, when the average height was only 6' 4.1'. Miami Heat forward Duncan Robinson represents the type of talent that NBA general managers are looking to fill their rosters with - a 6' 7' wing player who can reliably make outside shots and seamlessly defend guards and forwards.

**Mohamed Dabone: The 13-year-old sensation from Burkina Faso**
Mohamed Dabone, a 13-year-old from Burkina Faso, has been making waves in the Barcelona youth academy with his impressive skills and size, measuring 2.09 meters tall. Jan Vasely, the team's pivot, was impressed by Dabone's performance during a training session and believes he has the talent to join the first team in the future. 'It's crazy, but he's part of the club, he's developing, and he has the talent to be with us. I hope we can train together more often, I try to help him in any way I can,' Vasely said. Dabone has already played for the senior team in a friendly match, scoring six points and six rebounds in 17 minutes. He was only 12 years old at the time. Experts believe he has the potential to join the NBA and compare him to players like LeBron James and Victor Wembanyama. However, Dabone will not be eligible for the draft until 2030, as he must be at least 19 years old during the draft year. The Barcelona club is aware of the impact Dabone is generating and is trying to protect him from the pressure and expectations. They are also considering his participation in the Euroliga and have registered him for the competition. Additionally, the Spanish Federation is studying his case for a possible call-up to the national team.

**Madrid and Barcelona go against the tide in the Euroliga**
The European basketball scene has two possible paths ahead of it since March 27. One path is the new route that the NBA and FIBA seem to be designing together, which is a relatively unknown and unclear path. The NBA would be the umbrella organization and would likely receive economic benefits, while the FIBA would regain control over European basketball. The other path is the continuist route, which is the current partnership between the Euroliga and the marketing giant IMG, which was extended until 2036 in 2025. According to Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera, 11 of the 13 clubs have renewed their A-licence for another decade after a meeting in Istanbul last week. This union would give the Euroliga more strength in any future negotiations with the NBA, but it is unclear if there are exit clauses, penalty conditions, and other details of the renewal.

**Bucks Could Land Epic Haul in Proposed Giannis Antetokounmpo Trade Idea**
The Milwaukee Bucks could receive a massive haul if they were to trade Giannis Antetokounmpo, according to a proposed three-team trade between the Houston Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers, and the Bucks. The Bucks would receive Amen Thompson, Jalen Green, Cam Whitmore, and Donovan Clingan, as well as a 2025 first-round pick, a 2027 first-round pick, and a 2029 first-round pick that is most favorable to either the Bucks, Blazers, or Wizards. They would also gain the rights to swap 2028 and 2030 picks with Portland. This trade would be an incredible haul for the Bucks, providing them with nearly a starting lineup of players, including a point guard/wing hybrid in Thompson, a rim protector in Clingan, and two streaky scorers in Green and Whitmore. However, the trade would not include a clear future star, with none of the players having high-end potential as superstars. As NBA staff from The Athletic noted, 'this one at least feels close to fair'.

**London Aims to Host 2040 Olympics, Setting a New Record**
London is aiming to host the 2040 Olympics, a record that would surpass its previous hosting of the Games in 1908, 1948, and 2012. London Mayor Sadiq Khan plans to submit an official bid to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) soon, but may face competition from Munich and Madrid, which are also interested in hosting the event. A report published by the Mayor's office highlights the financial and tourist benefits of major sporting events held in London last year, including the Champions League final at Wembley Stadium and the Diamond League athletics event, which generated £230 million (€268 million) in economic benefits for the city. 'I love sports and understand their benefits,' Khan told the Times. Khan emphasized that his long-term goal is to solidify London's status as a global sports hub. 'Whether it's boxing, NFL, Major League Baseball, or now we're talking to the NBA to bring basketball to London, I think it's very important. London can become truly the world capital of sports,' he said. Khan has partnered with UK Sport and Athletic Ventures, a collaboration between UK Athletics, Great Run Company, and London Marathon Events, to reveal plans to bid for the 2029 World Athletics Championships. An official expression of interest will be submitted to World Athletics in September, pending approval of £45 million (€52.5 million) in government funding. London will host the Women's Rugby World Cup final at Twickenham by the end of the year. Meanwhile, England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales are preparing to jointly host the 2028 European Football Championship and have also launched a bid to host the 2035 Women's World Cup. London has also demonstrated its appeal for American sports, with NFL games in London proving particularly lucrative. According to the 2024 Report on the Impact of Major Sporting Events on London, prepared by Think Beyond, these events have attracted over three million spectators since their inception in 2007, with an estimated 'spend of over £600 million' (€700 million). 'Now I'd like London to become the first city to host the Games four times,' Khan said. A record difficult to match. Los Angeles, for example, is at three.

**Brisbane 2032 venue plan set to finally be unveiled**
Shane Heal, a basketball great, believes that having a well-planned venue is crucial for a successful Olympics. He hopes that the soon-to-be-revealed 2032 infrastructure plan for Brisbane will ensure the Games will be an event to remember. The plan includes a 60,000-seat main stadium in Victoria Park and a new $650 million aquatic centre. However, reports suggest that the Brisbane Arena and another major indoor sports centre may be scrapped. Heal expects basketball to be a major draw in 2032, saying, 'It's by far the most high-profile team sport at the Olympics...there's all those NBA guys.' The Olympic veteran hopes the venue plan will provide legacy projects for sports like basketball in Queensland, where he started his career with the Bullets in 1988. 'Look at the facilities at Brisbane. Boondall is a bit of a dinosaur,' he said. 'I played my first year there in 1988. It was great back then but that was 37 years ago.'

**NBA basketball rim height : Official regulation and measurement guidelines for standard hoops**
The NBA basketball rim height has remained at 10 feet (3.05 meters) since its invention in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith. This height has been a constant feature of the game, despite significant changes in player physiques. The 10-foot standard is used across various levels of play for ages 12 and up, including high school basketball, college basketball, and professional leagues worldwide. While adjustments are made for youth leagues, the regulation measurements for adult play include a rim diameter of 18 inches (46 cm) and standard NBA backboard dimensions of 72 inches wide by 42 inches tall (6 feet by 3.5 feet). The consistent 10-foot rim height plays a crucial role in player development and overall game strategy, encouraging proper shooting form and technique, developing lower body strength and jumping ability, and fostering creativity in shot-making and ball handling. Debates have occurred about altering the rim height, but the primary arguments for maintaining the current height include preserving the historical integrity of the game, ensuring consistency across all levels of play, and avoiding the need for widespread equipment changes.

**Lakers Acquire Mark Williams From Hornets In Blockbuster Trade: Complete Details and Analysis**
The Los Angeles Lakers have acquired 7-foot center Mark Williams from the Charlotte Hornets in a blockbuster trade. Williams, the 15th overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft, has developed into one of the league's most promising young centers, with the ability to protect the rim, rebound, and score efficiently. The Lakers hope he will fit seamlessly into their lineup alongside LeBron James and Luka Dončić. In return, the Hornets received promising rookie Dalton Knecht, former 10th overall pick Cam Reddish, an unprotected 2031 first-round pick, and a 2030 pick swap. Hornets' front office chose to flip Williams for additional assets, focusing on building for the future. 'This trade is about the long-term vision,' said a Hornets spokesperson. 'We're stockpiling assets and developing our young core.'
