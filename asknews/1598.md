**Elon Musk laid out plans for Mars. SpaceX production will outstrip Boeing and Airbus**
Elon Musk outlined his ambitious plans to make life multi-planetary by sending humans to Mars. He believes a civilization on Mars is crucial for the long-term survival of humanity and plans to expand beyond Mars to the asteroid belt and other star systems. To achieve this, Musk aims to produce 1,000 reusable Starships per year, surpassing the combined production of Boeing and Airbus. He wants to send missions to Mars every two years, starting with the next window in late 2026. Musk plans to fund the development through Starlink, his profitable space-based Wi-Fi service, which has over five million subscribers and represents 80% of SpaceX's $350 billion value. He estimates that one million tons of cargo will be shipped to Mars every launch window, equivalent to 4,500 Statues of Liberty every two years. Musk said, 'A civilization on Mars is going to be incredibly important for the long-term survival of civilization... Then we go beyond Mars, ultimately, to the move, maybe asteroid belt...and ultimately, to other star systems...making science fiction no longer fiction.'

**Musk: Chances of Starship Flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50**
Elon Musk said that the chances of Starship flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50. The spacecraft has already completed nine test flights, with the last one taking place on May 27. However, the mission ended in an emergency due to a fuel leak. The previous flights in January and March also ended in failure, with the spacecraft exploding within the first 10 minutes of flight. Despite this, Musk is optimistic about the progress made and believes that the data collected will help improve the spacecraft. The next version of Starship, Version 3, is expected to be 124.4 meters tall and will be capable of flying to Mars. The spacecraft will be reusable and will have a refueling system on orbit, which is necessary for long-distance space travel. The first flight of this version is planned for the end of this year, and if successful, Starship may fly to Mars as early as next year. SpaceX plans to send five Starship Version 3 spacecraft to Mars in 2026 to test the spacecraft and its technologies. However, Musk believes that it will be challenging to achieve this goal, citing the need to master the refueling of Starship in space as the main problem. He estimates the chances of success as 50/50. If successful, SpaceX plans to send around 20 spacecraft to Mars in 2028-2029, which may be crewed. However, Musk also suggests that two robotic landings may be conducted before sending humans. The final decision will be made later. In the third launch window (2030-2031), up to 100 Starship spacecraft may be sent to Mars, and in the next window (2033), up to 500. SpaceX is currently searching for a suitable location for a Martian city, which should be relatively far from the poles, have access to water ice, and have a flat surface for landings and takeoffs. The main candidate is the Arcadia Planitia region. The ultimate goal is to create a self-sufficient settlement on Mars with a population of over a million people, which will require transporting millions of tons of cargo. According to Musk, the construction and maintenance of such a city will be carried out using Starship, possibly its future 142-meter version. During periods of Earth-Mars alignment, thousands of upper stages of the spacecraft will be able to arrive and depart.

**Elon Musk's Plan to Colonize Mars: 2026 the Key Year**
Elon Musk has revealed his plan to colonize Mars, with the first unmanned flight of the Starship spacecraft to the red planet expected to take place in late 2026. The mission will transport robots humanoides Optimus, developed by Tesla, to Mars. Musk aims to send the first human missions to Mars in the second or third landing, with the goal of establishing a permanent and self-sufficient human settlement on the planet. To achieve this, SpaceX estimates that it will require between 1,000 and 2,000 launches of Starship every 26 months, coinciding with the optimal alignment between Earth and Mars. Musk has calculated that there is a 50% chance that Starship will be ready for the 2026 window. If not, the company will wait until the next window in 2028. Musk has been interested in colonizing Mars since the 1990s and has invested billions of dollars in developing space technology to make humanity a multi-planetary species.

**Elon Musk Unveils New Plan for Mars Colonization After Leaving White House**
Elon Musk has revealed a new plan for his work after leaving the White House, according to a report by the British newspaper 'Daily Mail'. Musk said, 'After two years, we will send humans, assuming the first missions are successful', and the initial manned missions are likely to include a small number of the first settlers, focusing on building infrastructure and exploring the Martian surface. The ambitious plan relies on the development of the next generation of Starship, which Musk said will feature nine engines, improved thermal protection, and increased payload capacity. He also announced that the SpaceX facility in Texas will eventually produce 1000 Starships per year, describing it as 'the largest structure in the world', designed to enable millions of people to travel to Mars. This announcement comes after Musk's resignation from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and his departure from the White House, saying that 'my time as a government employee has come to an end'. Despite his admiration for President Trump, Musk did not hesitate to criticize the latest administration spending bill worth $3.8 trillion, saying, 'It undermines the work of the DOGE team... I was disappointed to see a massive spending bill that increases the budget deficit instead of reducing it.' Despite the implications, Musk's departure from the White House will not hinder his long-standing vision of sending humans to Mars, and he revealed plans to build two new 'Gigafactories' currently under development, one in Texas and the other in Florida, which serve as integration centers where Starships and Super Heavy rockets are stacked and prepared for launch. Musk explained, 'We will build a number of Starships for Mars that equals what Boeing and Airbus produce in commercial airliners, and each Starship is larger than two 747s or A380s.' He also announced that SpaceX will increase the production of Starlink satellites to around 5000 units per year. Musk confirmed that the goal is to provide sufficient resources to Mars, so that if Earth's supply missions were to stop suddenly, life on Mars could continue uninterrupted. Musk added, 'Having two robust, self-sustaining planets will be of great importance for the long-term survival of humanity.'

**Elon Musk targets 2026 for first space mission to Mars**
Elon Musk aims to launch the first space mission to Mars by the end of 2026, but acknowledges that overcoming technological hurdles, particularly in-orbit refueling, is crucial for the mission's success. A favorable planetary alignment in late 2026 provides a unique opportunity for a relatively short transit between Earth and Mars. If Starship is not ready by then, Musk would target a new mission in 2028. The first mission would consist of -built Optimus humanoid robots. Despite failed test flights, including the ninth test flight which failed due to a fuel leak and uncontrolled spinning, Musk remains optimistic, emphasizing that each failure provides valuable data and paves the way for accelerated testing. Musk's ultimate vision is to launch up to 2,000 Starships every two years to establish a permanent and self-sustaining human settlement on Mars.

**Elon Musk Warns of Earth's Demise: A Billion Years to Go**
Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, has stated that life on Earth will eventually be destroyed due to the increasing energy of the sun. Scientists have now calculated the exact timing of this event. Researchers from NASA and the University of Tokyo used advanced computers and simulations to predict the long-term evolution of the sun. The results show that life on Earth will become impossible after more than a billion years, specifically by the year 1,000,002,021. The sun's increasing energy will lead to a rise in global temperatures, causing a decrease in oxygen levels in the Earth's atmosphere. As the temperature rises, life on Earth will face increasing threats, eventually leading to the loss of most oxygen-producing organisms. Only microorganisms that can survive without oxygen (anaerobic) will remain. Scientists also predict that in about five billion years, the sun will enter the red giant phase, where it will exhaust its hydrogen fuel and expand greatly. This process may cause the sun to engulf the inner planets in our solar system, including Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth. Although this event is still far in the future, scientists and Elon Musk believe that we should start thinking about the future of humanity. Musk argues that Mars could be a 'life insurance' for humanity if Earth becomes uninhabitable. In a recent interview, Musk stated, 'Mars is a life insurance for humanity. The sun is continuous in its growth, and we must become a multi-planetary civilization because Earth will eventually burn out.' Musk believes that one of the main goals of SpaceX is to make Mars a self-sustaining civilization capable of surviving without Earth's resources. He emphasizes that if Mars relies on Earth's resources, it is not a 'true life insurance.' NASA also has big ambitions for Mars, with the Mars Sample Return mission aiming to bring samples from Mars to Earth for analysis. Despite budget cuts, the US government remains committed to funding Mars missions, and SpaceX is a key player in this effort. Musk hopes that Mars will become a self-sufficient place that can support life, even if Earth's resources are depleted, before we reach a critical point. To achieve this, Musk and scientists believe that it is essential to work together to overcome the major challenges in colonizing Mars, including developing the necessary technology to make it habitable.

**Elon Musk Proposes Mars as Part of the United States, Sparking International Concerns**
Elon Musk has proposed an unusual idea, suggesting that if humans were to colonize Mars, it would be part of the United States. Musk stated, 'I will die in the United States, I will not go anywhere else, maybe I will go to Mars, but that will be part of the United States.' This proposal has sparked international concerns and potential conflicts. Musk also addressed concerns about the current state of the US territory, saying, 'I am working with others to make sure that ship does not sink,' in response to criticism from investors who have called for him to distance himself from Tesla. However, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which governs the exploration of space, does not explicitly address the role of private companies in space exploration. The treaty focuses primarily on the involvement of nations, and the idea of a private company leading the colonization of another planet was not a consideration at the time of its drafting.

**Elon Musk: 'It's Time to Make History, Let's Go to Mars!'**
Elon Musk is pushing for a human mission to Mars, and is calling for an end to unnecessary projects and funding for missions that do not lead to results. Musk is redirecting federal spending to focus on preparing for a human expedition to Mars, and is also placing trusted individuals in key roles at NASA to ensure his vision is not hindered by bureaucracy. Musk is seeking the support of Donald Trump, who could become the first leader to put his name on a historic achievement: the first human flight to Mars. Musk has reportedly told Trump, 'Facilitate this mission and you will become immortal.' Trump and Musk together are an unstoppable force, and their detractors can only watch in dismay. Musk is the only one with a true vision for the future of humanity, and NASA needs a shake-up, which Musk is providing. Mars is not a dream, but a necessity that we believe in.'

**Dear Elon: Go to Mars, please!**
The article is a satirical letter to Elon Musk, urging him to go to Mars as soon as possible. The author notes that Musk has access to the federal budget and the president's ear, and suggests that he redirect funds from public education, scientific research, and disaster relief to the SpaceX interplanetary travel fund. The author jokingly suggests that Musk take the president, vice president, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg with him on the trip, or that he go alone. The article also mentions that the Mars Society Newsletter reported progress towards landing on Mars, but notes that there are obstacles delaying the mission, including the fact that NASA is 'currently not competent'. The author ends by suggesting that the Exploratorium build a model of Musk's SpaceX Mars ship with him and the president inside.
