**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Denmark to Raise Retirement Age to 70 by 2040: A Response to Aging Population**
Denmark plans to raise the retirement age to 70 years by 2040, with the current retirement age being 67 years. The retirement age will increase every five years, reaching 68 in 2030 and 69 in 2035. This move comes as protests continue over low pensions, with experts calling for changes to labor laws to address the issue. A proposed labor reform aims to increase flexibility in work arrangements, reduce state intervention in private agreements, and allow for more flexible salaries and work relationships. Meanwhile, a proposed pension reform aims to address issues such as the 'envejecimiento poblacional' (aging population), where people are living longer but having fewer children, leading to uncertainty over the future of pensioners. Experts suggest moving from a 'beneficio definido' (defined benefit) system to a 'contribución definida' (defined contribution) system. According to Jacqueline Maubré, 'El sistema de reparto está en crisis en la Argentina. La expectativa de vida ha crecido, pero tambien baja el ritmo de la natalidad.' (The pension system is in crisis in Argentina. Life expectancy has increased, but the birth rate has also decreased.)

**Ranked: Top 25 Countries With the Highest Life Expectancy**
According to the UN's World Population Prospects portal, the top 25 countries with the highest life expectancy at birth are predominantly in Europe, with Monaco leading the list at 86.5 years. Women in Monaco live an average of 88 years. The data highlights a significant gap in life expectancy between men and women, with women living an average of 4 years longer than men across all 25 countries. The largest gender gap is found in countries such as France, South Korea, and Japan, where women live 5.6, 6.0, and 6.1 years longer than men, respectively. This gap is attributed to a mix of biological and behavioral factors, including higher mortality rates among newborn boys and youths, and women's lower likelihood of engaging in high-risk behaviors.

**Healthy life now for healthy ageing**
According to current trends, people born in 2040 and beyond are expected to live longer than those who are in their 40s or younger today. The average life expectancy in Europe, Oceania, America, and Japan is close to 80 years, and in Malaysia, it is more than 74 years. Considering the increasing life spans, it is not unlikely that those in their 40s or younger today will live longer than those who were in their forties 20 years ago.

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Countries with the Highest Life Expectancy in 2025**
According to the World Population Prospects 2024 report by the UN, the countries with the highest life expectancy in 2025 are Monaco, with an average life expectancy of 87 years, followed by San Marino and Hong Kong, both with 86 years. Japan, South Korea, and Saint Barthélemy also rank high with an average life expectancy of 85 years. The report highlights that the quality of life in a country is a significant factor in determining life expectancy. In contrast, countries in South America, such as Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Argentina, have a lower life expectancy, with Colombia and the other countries mentioned having an average life expectancy of 78 years. Chile stands out in South America with a life expectancy of 82 years. The report emphasizes that the place of birth has a significant impact on life expectancy.

**Ranking of Countries by Life Expectancy in 2025: Leaders, Outsiders, and the Gap of Decades**
Life expectancy is one of the key indicators of the quality of life in a country. It depends not only on medical services, but also on education, ecology, nutrition, social stability, and even culture. Over the past decade, humanity has made significant progress: in the mid-20th century, the average lifespan was less than 50 years, while now it is 73 years. However, there is a strong contrast in the world: in developed countries, life expectancy exceeds 84 years, while in some African countries, it barely reaches 60. According to LIGA.net, life expectancy also depends on the place of birth and gender. In 2025, which countries will be among the leaders in life expectancy; why is there a gap of dozens of years between the first and last places; what is the situation in Ukraine.

**Girls Born in 2023 May Live Up to 100 Years, Study Finds**
A study by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that 18% of girls born in 2023 have a chance of living up to 100 years old, while 11.5% of boys have the same chance. The average life expectancy for boys born in 2023 is 86.7 years, while for girls it is 90 years. Projections for 2047 indicate an increase: boys may live up to 89.3 years and girls up to 92.2 years. However, the numbers are below previous estimates, indicating a slowdown in the progress of longevity. The study also shows an increase in life expectancy for people already in their 60s. Men aged 65 in 2023 are expected to live an average of 19.8 more years, while women of the same age have a projection of 22.5 more years. For those who will turn 65 in 2047, this average rises to 21.8 years for men and 24.4 years for women. The data highlights variations between different regions, with differences in longevity between countries in the UK. The projections are based on historical patterns and observed mortality trends, with a forecast of 1.1% annual growth in life expectancy for people aged 0-90. However, this rate is lower than previously estimated, reflecting a slower pace of mortality reduction. Despite the slowdown in the increase in life expectancy, the numbers indicate a continued trend of growth. With this, future generations may have an even longer life, as long as factors such as access to healthcare and quality of life continue to evolve.

**One in Five Girls Born in 2030 Expected to Live to 100, Study Finds**
A recent British study found that one in five girls born in 2030 is expected to live to at least 100 years old, with the percentage increasing to one in four by 2047. The study, published by the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) and reported by The Independent, also found that boys are expected to see an increase in average life expectancy, with more than one in eight boys born in 2030 expected to live to 100, rising to one in six by 2047. According to the predictions, 17.9% of girls and 11.5% of boys born in 2023 have a chance of reaching 100 years old. This is expected to increase to 19.9% for girls and 13.1% for boys by 2030, and to 24.7% for girls and 17.3% for boys by 2047. The predictions were made based on an analysis of annual death records, assuming improvements in mortality rates among the elderly. By 2047, the average life expectancy is expected to reach 92.2 years for girls and 89.3 years for boys. Women aged 65 in 2023 are expected to live an additional 22.5 years, compared to 19.8 years for men, with expected increases in these numbers by 2047. The gap between the average life expectancy of men and women has narrowed from 4.4 years in 1981 to 3.4 years in 2023, and is expected to decrease further to 2.5 years by 2072, reflecting improvements in lifestyle and healthcare. The ONS noted that these predictions are more realistic than previous forecasts, as they take into account potential future improvements in mortality rates.

**One in Five Girls Born in 2030 Expected to Live to 100**
According to a new research study, one in five girls born in 2030 is expected to live to be at least 100 years old. The study, as reported by the British newspaper 'The Independent', suggests that this exceptional number is expected to rise to nearly one in four by 2047. For males, the predictions are less dramatic, with more than one in eight males born in 2030 expected to reach 100 years old, increasing to around one in six by 2047. The British research team notes that these numbers are mere predictions and not forecasts, based on a review of previous data on annual mortality rates, which assume improvements in mortality rates among the elderly in recent years. The researchers also found that the gap between the expected lifespan of males and females at birth has decreased from 4.4 years in 1981 to 3.4 years in 2023, and is expected to decrease further in the future. As they wrote in their study: 'The gap between the expected lifespan of males and females at birth has decreased over the past four decades. It is likely that this is due to improvements in lifestyle, such as decreased smoking rates, working conditions for men over several decades, as well as advances in healthcare, and the discovery of new ways to treat chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes.' They also expect the gap to decrease to 2.5 years by 2072.

The ONS said the data is based on past trends in annual death registrations and assumes improved mortality rates among elderly people. Kerry Gadsdon of the ONS stated, 'The gap between male and female cohort life expectancy at birth has fallen from 4.4 years in 1981 to 3.4 years in 2023 and is projected to fall further in the future.' The projections also suggest that girls born in the UK in 2023 can expect to live on average to an age of 90.0 years and boys to 86.7 years, increasing to 92.2 years and 89.3 years respectively for babies born in 2047.

**How long will YOU live? Enter age & gender into our tool to see life expectancy**
According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), girls born in the UK in 2023 can expect to live to an average of 90.0 years, while boys can expect to live to 86.7 years. This gap is shrinking, and by 2047, girls are expected to live to 92.2 years, while boys are expected to live to 89.3 years. The ONS projects that 17.9% of girls and 11.5% of boys born in 2023 will live to at least 100 years, increasing to 19.9% and 13.1% respectively for babies born in 2030. By 2047, these numbers are expected to rise to 24.7% and 17.3% respectively.

**How long will YOU live? Try the interactive tool**
The Office for National Statistics has created an interactive tool to estimate life expectancy based on age and gender. According to the tool, a baby boy born in 2023 can expect to live to 86.7 years, while girls can expect to live to 90 years. The gap between the two is narrowing. The 2047 cohort of boys are expected to live to 89.3 on average, and 92.2 for girls. The data shows incremental increases in life expectancy, with children of the Nineties having a longer lifespan than those born in the 1980s. The tool also projects that people aged 65 in 2023 can expect to live on average a further 19.8 years for men, and 22.5 years for women, which is set to rise to 21.8 years and 24.4 years respectively by 2047. The ONS produces estimates based on assumptions about future changes in mortality rates, with the 'principal' projection assuming a 1.1 per cent annual increase in life expectancy, which is lower than the 1.2 per cent used in 2022-based figures. The ONS also considers a 'low' improvement scenario of just 0.5 per cent.

According to new projections by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), about one in five girls born in the UK in 2030 is expected to live to at least 100 years old, rising to almost one in four by 2047. The projections are lower for boys, but still indicate a rise, with more than one in eight males born in 2030 living to celebrate their centenary, climbing to about one in six by 2047. The ONS said the data is based on past trends in annual death registrations and combined with the input from a panel of experts. Kerry Gadsdon of the ONS said, 'The gap between male and female cohort life expectancy at birth has fallen over the past four decades, likely due to improvements in lifestyle and advances in healthcare.' The gap is projected to be down to 2.5 years by 2072.
