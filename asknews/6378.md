**Lee backs nuclear power - for now**
Presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being' but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables like offshore wind to supply industrial hubs and aims to phase out coal by 2040. He supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' In contrast, Lee's main rival Kim Moon-soo supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60% of the mix. South Korea's latest energy blueprint aims for nuclear to make up 35% of the power mix by 2038, with renewables at 29%. If elected, Lee is expected to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30% of the power mix by 2030.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

Lee's main rival, Mr Kim Moon-soo, currently supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60 per cent of the mix by 2038. However, Mr Han Byung-Hwa, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities, expects Lee to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30 per cent of the power mix by 2030. 'One of the hurdles to entering the AI era is power,' said Mr Jaeseung Kim, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities. 'Whoever wins will have no choice but to accept and use nuclear power for the time being.'

**David Littleproud cites nuclear energy disagreement as major factor in Coalition split**
National Party leader David Littleproud cited nuclear energy as a major factor in the party's split from the Liberals, citing disagreements over the policy. Littleproud said, 'Those positions that we couldn't get comfort around [include] nuclear being a part of an energy grid into the future.' The Nationals had long supported the plan to build nuclear reactors at seven sites across Australia, but public sentiment turned against nuclear power during the election. Littleproud rejected suggestions that the party was unwise to stick with the nuclear policy, saying public opinion had been swayed by a 'scare campaign.' However, CSIRO analysis showed that a nuclear program was unlikely to deliver power by 2037, and the entire coal-fired power fleet is due to shut down before 2040. This made it impossible for the Nationals to plug nuclear plants into the grid as coal-fired power stations retire. The party is now 'technology agnostic' about energy policy, but its actual policies have been characterized by dogmatic faith in nuclear and 'clean' coal, and a rejection of solar, wind, and battery storage. The Nationals' hostility to renewables may be driven by pressure from anti-renewable activist groups. The party could have chosen to accept the target of net-zero emissions by 2050, but instead decided to walk away from it altogether.

**A Terrifying Scenario: How the World Could End Before 2045**
According to scientific estimates and security studies, several scenarios are possible for the end of human civilization, including deadly pandemics, major climate disasters, economic system collapse, and a more frightening threat: a global nuclear war. If environmental, political, and economic crises continue to escalate over the next two decades, the world may find itself on the brink of collapse. Climate change, resource depletion, armed conflicts, and pandemics could combine to create a fertile ground for a catastrophic event. In this scenario, major powers would lose their ability to control, and the global system would begin to shake and eventually collapse completely, according to the Daily Mail. A nuclear war could spark a chain reaction of automatic responses that cannot be controlled. Imagine a massive cloud of smoke blocking the sun and engulfing the planet in a dark, lasting environmental disaster. A nuclear winter: an era of artificial ice. If a nuclear war were to occur, scientific estimates suggest that global temperatures could drop catastrophically, plunging the world into a nuclear winter, where agriculture would collapse, supply chains would stop, and food security, which relies on billions of people, would disappear. In such a situation, famine and extreme cold would be common enemies for those who remain alive. On the other hand, with the breakdown of global trade chains and production, the international economy could collapse completely, with banks closing, currencies becoming worthless, and communities turning to bartering or controlling resources through force. The global financial system we rely on today could become a distant memory, replaced by a constant struggle for survival. Pandemics and health collapse. In a post-catastrophe world, diseases are expected to spread rapidly, and with the destruction of medical infrastructure and air and water pollution, new diseases will emerge that are difficult to treat. Human survival would depend more on avoiding infection than adapting to economic or political situations. However, even with the bleakness of this scenario, there is still a chance to avoid the catastrophe, where countries can work on signing new agreements to limit nuclear weapons, intensify efforts to combat climate change, and rebuild international trust.

**Germany: Nuclear Power Comeback Before 2030 Possible, Says Expert**
According to Martin Pache of Westinghouse Electric Germany, a restart of nuclear power plants is possible before 2030 without compromising nuclear safety. Pache stated, 'Der Neustart von Kernkraftwerken ist bereits vor 2030 möglich – ohne Abstriche bei der nuklearen Sicherheit.' This comes as a positive development for the future of nuclear energy in Germany.

**Nuclear: No Fast Neutron Reactors Expected Before 2060**
According to our information, a demonstrator of a fourth-generation nuclear reactor with several hundred megawatts of power, based on the technology of cooled sodium fast neutrons, is not expected to start in France before 2045, while its construction could begin in 2038. The industrial version of this type of reactor is expected only after 2060. Last Monday, during a long-awaited nuclear policy council (CPN), Emmanuel Macron announced the launch of a new industrial program around fourth-generation reactors to close the nuclear fuel cycle. This is a strategic reversal, as the head of state had endorsed, in 2019, the abandonment of the Astrid research program, which aimed to build an experimental fourth-generation reactor based on fast neutron (RNR) technology cooled by sodium.

**Higher household bills by 2030 under nuclear: report**
A report by the Clean Energy Council suggests that households could face an additional $449 annual increase in power bills by 2030 if policymakers pursue nuclear energy and a slower renewable rollout. The analysis, which mirrors the energy policies of the major federal parties, found that a 30% average increase in bills is expected under the nuclear pathway. Clean Energy Council CEO Kane Thornton warned that halting renewable energy deployment and relying on coal and gas before nuclear comes online would be a 'disaster' for power prices. He emphasized that getting more renewables into the system is the cheapest and most reliable way to keep energy bills low for Australians.

**Italy to Have Nuclear Energy by 2030, Says Minister Pichetto Fratin**
Italian Environment Minister Gilberto Pichetto Fratin is confident that Italy will have nuclear energy by 2030. He stated, 'I'm convinced that by 2030 we'll make it happen and have nuclear energy in Italy.' Pichetto Fratin also mentioned that the nuclear law delegation will be sent to the Italian Parliament 'next week, then there will be a long debate because there have already been two months of hearings in the Chamber. I hope it will be approved by autumn or the end of the year. From there, it will take 12 months to have the legislative decrees.' He emphasized the importance of being prepared, saying, 'We must be ready, we must do like the alpini who use mules in the mountains because they put their feet behind in the same place as the ones in front and don't fall.' Pichetto Fratin also expressed hope that additional interventions like the Bollette decree will not be necessary in the future, as indicators and analysts predict a reduction in energy costs. However, he noted that disconnection from the European market is not possible.

**New report skewers Coalition’s contentious nuclear plan – and reignites Australia’s energy debate**
A federal parliamentary inquiry has delivered a report on the deployment of nuclear power in Australia, casting doubt on the Coalition's plan to build seven nuclear reactors on former coal sites. The report found that nuclear power would be far more expensive than shifting to mostly renewable energy, and that delivering nuclear generation before the mid-2040s would be extremely challenging. The report also revealed weaknesses in the Coalition's defence of its plan, including the idea of cheap, factory-built nuclear reactors being a 'mirage'. The report's findings were endorsed by Labor and independent members, but rejected by Coalition members. The report's central conclusions are that nuclear power is not a viable investment of taxpayer money and that it would meet only around 15% of consumer needs in the National Electricity Market, at a cost of at least A$116 billion. The committee also found that the timing of nuclear energy in Australia would be significantly delayed, with 'significant challenges' in achieving this before the mid-2040s. The Coalition has been criticized for its claims that the first two plants would be operating by 2035 and 2037, which is inconsistent with the report's findings. The report's estimates of the timeframe for nuclear deployment are highly conservative, and recent experience in other developed countries suggests that the committee's timeframe estimates are likely to be exceeded. The Coalition's nuclear policy is seen as a distraction from its policy program that slows the transition to renewables and drags out the life of dirty and unreliable coal-fired power.

**Vattenfall: No Nuclear Power Decision Before 2029**
Desirée Comstedt, Vattenfall's head of new nuclear power development, said, 'It's somewhere around 2029/2030 if we follow the current timeline.' This contradicts the statement made by Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, who said a reactor should be built before the 2026 election. Comstedt emphasized the need for accurate information before starting the construction process. Vattenfall is considering two options: two large reactors or three to five small modular reactors. The first option could require around 10,000 people during the construction phase, while the second option would need 3,500. The company is also looking into the cost and risk distribution with the state, as well as obtaining necessary permits from the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority and the Environmental Court. Comstedt believes it's possible to determine if the project is feasible before 2029/2030. The government aims to have at least 2,500 megawatts of new nuclear power capacity by 2035, equivalent to two large reactors.

**Dutton's nuclear policy is a Coalition scam**
Opposition Leader Peter Dutton's nuclear power promise is a scam, according to Steve Bishop, as the Coalition's target of mid-2030s is unachievable. Senator Matt Canavan revealed that nuclear power is not a viable option, but the Coalition is 'latching on to it' to fix a political issue. The evidence shows that the earliest deployment for large-scale nuclear reactors would not occur until after 2040, and even small modular reactors would take at least 15 years to build. The Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) found that a mature market for the technology may emerge in the late 2040s. Professor Hugh Durrant-Whyte, a nuclear engineer, stated that it would be 'naïve' to think a power plant could be built in less than two decades. The UK's process to deliver an operational SMR by the mid-2030s has already blown out to 16 years, and even if the Coalition could emulate this process, it would be after 2040 before an SMR is built. The overwhelming evidence means the Coalition's nuclear plan should be rejected at the ballot box.

**Queensland nuclear plan in question as Albo warns it would drag state's economy**
The Federal Government has released analysis claiming that the Liberal-National coalition's plan to build two nuclear reactors in Queensland would make the state's economy nearly $900 billion worse off by 2050. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated that the opposition's nuclear plan would take Australia backwards in terms of economic activity, saying, 'Under the Coalition [Dutton's] vision is for a smaller Australia, is for making less things, is for less economic activity, is for less jobs.' The analysis also found that the plan would affect Queensland's output by $61.1 billion in 2050-51 alone. The coalition's proposal includes building seven reactors across Australia, with two in Queensland, and aims to have them operational between 2035 and 2037. Labor has disputed the coalition's argument that their plan is more expensive, citing statements from the CSIRO that nuclear energy would be significantly more expensive for Australia.
