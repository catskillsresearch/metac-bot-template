**Microsoft Stock: AI Hype and Sustainable Growth**
Microsoft's stock price is rising due to the hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). However, what concrete developments are behind this euphoria, and how sustainable is the current upswing? The technology sector is currently showing its strength, providing Microsoft with a significant tailwind. Analysts are also optimistic about the company's AI potential, with Evercore ISI recently raising its price target for Microsoft to $515 per share and maintaining its 'Outperform' rating. The analysts cited positive feedback from partners and customers regarding the potential of Enterprise-KI solutions and strong demand for Azure services. Microsoft is also making strategic partnerships and initiatives, such as its partnership with EXL, which has been recognized as a 'Microsoft Solutions Partner' for data and AI. This collaboration aims to help organizations use data and AI to address real challenges. Additionally, Microsoft has signed a long-term agreement with Sublime Systems to purchase up to 623,000 tons of low-carbon cement over a period of six to nine years, which will help reduce emissions in construction projects. The company's reputation has also improved, with Microsoft ranking as the top technology company and third most visible brand in the US in the 'Axios Harris Poll 100' for 2025. The cloud computing business, led by Azure, remains the main driver of success, with revenue growth of 33% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. However, there are also signs of potential capacity constraints in the AI sector beyond June, which could put pressure on Microsoft's ambitious growth plans.

**US Stocks Plunge as Treasury Yields Surge, Dow Falls Over 800 Points**
The US 10-year Treasury yield surged to 4.59% and the 30-year yield rose to 5.08%, causing a sharp decline in US stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted over 800 points, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also experiencing significant losses. The market is concerned about the US tax reform bill, which could exacerbate the country's already dire fiscal situation, leading to a rise in US debt and credit rating downgrades. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 41860.44, down 816.80 points or 1.91%, while the S&P 500 fell 95.85 points or 1.61% to 5844.61, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 270.07 points or 1.41% to 18872.64. Tech giants such as Tesla, Apple, and Microsoft declined, while Alphabet rose 2.8% against the market trend. Target's disappointing first-quarter earnings and downward revision of full-year sales and profit forecasts led to a 5.2% decline in its stock price. Bitcoin's price reached a new high of $109,770, up 2% from the previous day, breaking through the high of $109,000 set in January.

**Stock Market Opening: Nifty, Sensex Start On Cautious Note; Who Are The Top Gainers, Losers Today**
The Indian stock market opened cautiously on Wednesday, May 21, with Nifty and Sensex trading in green. However, the market experienced a downturn later in the day, with Nifty dropping 261 points and closing at 24,684, marking a 1.1% decrease.

Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities, said, 'Technology stocks have been the primary drivers of recent market gains and have experienced broad declines. Industry leaders Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft all closed in negative territory.' The Asian stock markets surged on Wednesday, with SSE Composite Index up 0.13% and the Asia Dow surging 0.66%.

**Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will See the Biggest Comeback in the Second Half of 2025 | The Motley Fool**
Nvidia's stock has been punished in 2025 due to uncertainty around AI trends, Chinese start-up DeepSeek's claims, and President Trump's tariffs. However, despite a 30% year-to-date drop, the stock is back at breakeven and is poised for a comeback in the second half of 2025. Nvidia's management provided financial guidance for Q1 2025, but the author believes that longer-term growth prospects are strong. The author cites the fact that other leading tech companies, such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, are not lowering their capital expenditure forecasts, and are instead budgeting billions for AI infrastructure. This suggests that demand for Nvidia's chips will remain intact, and the author predicts that the stock's outlook will be strong, despite potential short-term headwinds. The author concludes that investors should focus on the big picture and not lose sight of Nvidia's dominant market share in the AI industry.

**3 Key Stock Charts That Suggest Rocks Over Paper!**
The article discusses three key stock charts that suggest 'Rocks Over Paper', a phrase coined by the author. The charts include Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which has flashed the 'gap and run' pattern, indicating a strong upside price gap. The author notes that the follow-through on this gap is crucial, and as long as MSFT holds the upper end of the price gap around $425, the answer is yes. Additionally, the article highlights the performance of Bitcoin, which has been suggested as a 'safe haven' during market struggles. However, the author notes that Bitcoin has essentially provided a leveraged bet on stock performance in 2025, with a more volatile experience but not a differentiated return profile from equity index ETFs. Finally, the article discusses the strength of gold, which has experienced a brief pullback but remains in a primary uptrend. The author notes that gold continues to pound out a pattern of higher highs and higher lows, remains above two upward-sloping moving averages, and has an RSI in the bullish range. As long as these characteristics remain in place, the author remains bullish on precious metals.

**Asian Stocks Close Mostly Higher, Despite Japanese Weakness**
Asian stocks closed mostly higher on Wednesday, driven by eased trade tensions and improved economic forecasts. However, Japanese stocks were hit by the continued appreciation of the yen and weakened export growth. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong rose 0.6% to 23,827.78, its highest closing since March 24, while the Hang Seng Tech index rose 0.5%. Electric vehicle makers led the gain in Hong Kong, with Li Auto and BYD rising around 4% each. Chinese markets reported modest gains after Morgan Stanley raised its GDP forecast for China to 4.5% for 2025, citing improved trade dynamics. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students,' said Morgan Stanley. Indian stocks recovered moderately after three consecutive days of decline driven by geopolitical concerns and uncertainty in the US economy. The S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.51% to 81,596.63, mainly due to gains in auto, IT, and healthcare stocks. Morgan Stanley raised its Sensex target to 89,000 by June 2026, citing strong macroeconomic fundamentals and positive earnings prospects for companies. Moody's noted that India remains relatively isolated from global trade disruptions due to its domestic demand-oriented economy. Other regional markets, such as Seoul's Kospi index, also rose, driven by Samsung Biologics and Hanwha Aerospace. Australian bank stocks lifted the market after the Reserve Bank of Australia implemented a widely expected rate cut. Wall Street, however, fell slightly on Tuesday, with investors booking profits after a sustained rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% to 42,677.24, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 fell 0.4% to 19,142.71 and 5,940.46, respectively. The decline follows a sharp rebound from April lows, partly driven by reduced trade tensions. However, underlying concerns remain, with JPMorgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon warning that markets may be underestimating persistent inflation risks and the possibility of stagflation.

**If Interest Rates Rise In 2025, Microsoft Will Go Much Lower (NASDAQ:MSFT)**
According to Paul Franke, a nationally ranked stock picker, Microsoft's forward P/E of 29x for 2025 may be exceptionally high in a recession with flat to declining income generation. Franke suggests that if interest rates rise in 2025, Microsoft's stock price will go down. He also notes that foreign investors are shunning American assets, including bonds, due to President Trump's trade war. Franke recommends a contrarian stock selection style and a diversified approach of owning at least 50 well-positioned favorites to achieve regular stock market outperformance. He also suggests using 10% or 20% stop-loss levels on individual choices. Franke is short Big Tech through bearish positioning in S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 index products.
