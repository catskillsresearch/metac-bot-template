**ONPE Conducts Simulation of Electoral Computing System for 2025 Revocation Consultation**
The National Office of Electoral Processes (ONPE) conducted a simulation of the Electoral Computing System on June 1, in preparation for the 2025 Popular Consultation on Revocation, which will take place on June 8. The exercise aimed to verify the correct functioning of the system, the transmission of acts, the integrity of data, and the ability to respond to contingency situations, such as power outages. The simulation began at 9:00 a.m. at the ONPE headquarters with the verification of the electoral software and the resetting of servers. Representatives of the National Elections Jury (JNE), ONPE, and Reniec signed the act of commencement of the simulation, marking the start of the simulated processing of acts. The simulation included processing of test materials, verification of results, and secure transmission of information. The ONPE concluded the simulation with the signing of a compliance act by the participating entities, including the Ombudsman's Office. This exercise reaffirms the electoral body's commitment to technical, transparent, and secure elections, in which 5,615 citizens will decide whether their municipal authorities continue in office.

**Britain is getting a defense boost aimed at sending a message to...**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with Starmer saying 'we have to recognize the world has changed' and 'with greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.' The government will also build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send 'a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. Healey also stated that plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 are 'on track' and that there's 'no doubt' it will hit 3% before 2034. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks.

**Trump's Potential Win Could Bring About Significant Reform**
Donald Trump's potential win in the 2024 US presidential election could bring about a significant reform, according to Patrick Rosenstiel, a leading advisor to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. The compact is a agreement between states to give their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the most popular votes nationwide, not necessarily the winner in their state. Rosenstiel said, 'It will be the most important political reform of my life, if it happens.' The compact has been adopted by 17 states and the District of Columbia, with Maine potentially leaving. Proponents like Rosenstiel see it as a solution to the country's political problems, helping to heal mistrust in the system, reform presidential elections, and make every voter relevant again. Critics, however, consider it constitutionally questionable and fear a constitutional crisis if implemented. Rosenstiel acknowledged Republican skepticism, saying, 'It's starting to become more normal.' He believes that a national popular vote system is the only way to achieve this, and that it would make every American voter and every voting district politically relevant. Surveys show growing support for a national popular vote system, despite Republican reservations. Rosenstiel understands Republican hesitation, but believes that every one who wants to improve the nature of politics in America should support the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. He also said, 'If you think the politics in the country are working pretty well, you should have your morals and values checked.'

**Indigenous Communities in Venezuela Elect Representatives to National Assembly**
Indigenous communities in Venezuela began voting on Sunday to elect their three representatives to the National Assembly, a process that will complete the 285 seats in the Legislature. This is the first time the vote is taking place in the Guayana Esequiba territory, considered by Caracas as the 24th state. The Minister of Indigenous Peoples, Clara Vidal, described the vote as an empowerment exercise, saying, 'It is a reclamation, once again, that we, the indigenous peoples and communities, choose our own leaders and leaders, who will be at the forefront of this great responsibility.' Nicia Maldonado, a chavista deputy, said that today 'we are choosing three deputies and deputies to the National Assembly for the 2026-2031 period, including our Guayana Esequiba for the first time.' The Organic Law for the Defense of Guayana Esequiba, promulgated in April 2024 after the December 2023 referendum on the Esequibo, establishes the creation of a new state with that name - the 24th of the country - which will have 'the seat of the Public Powers' in Tumeremo, the capital of the Sifontes municipality in Bol√≠var, 'until a practical and mutually acceptable solution is reached' with the neighboring country. Maldonado highlighted that from the vote in Venezuela 'are pending' the 'brothers' aimaras, as well as the indigenous peoples of Central America and Mexico. 'Thanks to the revolution, we are the beacon of the world,' VTV broadcast images of the development of the electoral day, which is taking place in nine regions of the country.

**'A matter of time': Trump's 2024 win boosts prospect of electoral college change**
Donald Trump's 2024 presidential win, where he won the popular vote for the first time in three tries, has given a boost to activists pushing for individual states to change how they tally Electoral College votes. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, created in 2006, would award electoral college votes to the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote, not necessarily the one who wins their state. The compact has been adopted by 17 states and is undergoing a revival, with its supporters more optimistic than ever. According to Patrick Rosenstiel, senior consultant for the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, 'It's just a matter of time' before the compact is implemented, which he believes will be the most important political reform of his lifetime. Trump's 2024 victory could represent a watershed moment for the movement, normalizing the idea of a national popular vote for president.

**Analysis | Trump's 2024 win may boost the popular vote movement**
A recent court ruling has blocked President Donald Trump's tariffs, which he had branded as 'Liberation Day,' citing that he exceeded his power in implementing them. The tariffs included 10 percent levies on all imports and a variety of other taxes on dozens of countries. The ruling may have a positive impact on the national popular vote movement, which aims to award electoral college votes to the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote. Patrick Rosenstiel, senior consultant for the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, believes that Trump's 2024 victory, which included a margin of 2 million in the popular vote, may be a watershed moment for the movement. The compact has been adopted by 17 states and the District of Columbia, and proponents believe it would help cure distrust in the political system and make every voter relevant again. However, critics argue that it is constitutionally questionable and could create a constitutional crisis.

**Is This the Beginning of the End of the National Popular Vote Compact?**
Maine, one of the 17 states that joined the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, is poised to become the first state to exit the agreement. The state's House passed a bipartisan bill to withdraw from the compact, which would award all participating states' electoral votes to whoever wins the national popular vote. According to Maine state Rep. Barbara Bagshaw, 'We were the first state in the nation to split our Electoral College votes by congressional district -- a system that reflects our political diversity and values, every voice, whether rural or urban.' Bagshaw's bill aims to preserve this system, which gives rural and urban voters meaningful representation. The compact's reversal is seen as a blow to the left-wing coalition that thought they'd found a clever workaround to the Constitution. Trump's decisive popular vote victory in 2024 has changed everything, and other blue states may follow Maine's lead.

**Bill to remove Maine from National Popular Vote Compact moves forward**
A bill to remove Maine from the National Popular Vote Compact, which would award all Electoral College votes to the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote, has moved forward. Critics argue that this would take away power from smaller states like Maine, while opponents of the Electoral College say it rewards a handful of swing states. Rep. Barbara Bagshaw (R-Windham) stated, 'The legislation is rooted in one simple principle, our electoral votes should reflect the will of Maine voters, not the voters of other states.' Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn) said, 'The National Popular Vote Compact is fundamentally American, because of the Electoral College, there are really only seven states that matter.' Bagshaw also noted that if the popular vote system was in place, Donald Trump would have still won in 2024, but lost in 2016.

**Maine House Votes to Withdraw from the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact**
The Maine House of Representatives has voted to withdraw from the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, an agreement that could have overridden the electoral college by guaranteeing the winner of the national popular vote would be elected president. Rep. Bagshaw argued that joining the Compact would 'silence Maine's distinct voice' and 'blindly place trust in an election system they didn't vote for.' Rep. Supica moved the minority Ought Not to Pass report, but it was rejected in a 76-71 vote. The bill will now be sent to the Senate for concurrence. According to a University of New Hampshire's Pine Tree State Poll, 35% of Mainers support the Compact, while 37% oppose it. Democrats support the Compact at 69%, while Republicans oppose it at 73%. Independents are split, with 43% opposing and 16% supporting it.

**Helping your child change schools**
Moving to a new location can be stressful for both service members and school-age children. However, with the help of school liaisons, you can make your child's transition to a new school easier. School liaisons can connect you to your new installation school liaison, who will help with school selection, youth sponsorship, and navigating the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children. This compact ensures that students can enroll in school, register for classes, and graduate on time. Additionally, the compact helps with course waivers, exit exams, and senior-year transfers. If you have an exceptional family member, alert the new school and medical provider at least 30 days ahead of your move and request a copy of your child's complete educational and medical records. Your local school liaison can also help with this transition by connecting you to your new school's special education department. As stated by the Interstate Compact, 'all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Department of Defense Education Activity, or DODEA, have committed to helping students enroll in school, register for the classes they need and graduate on time.'

**Democratic lawmakers renew push for Pa. to join National Popular Vote Interstate Compact**
Pennsylvania lawmakers, led by Democratic state Reps. Chris Rabb and Heather Boyd, have reintroduced legislation to join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. The compact would award Pennsylvania's electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the national popular vote. Rabb stated, 'Every vote counts' and emphasized that 'every voter, of every party should have an equal voice in presidential elections.' The legislation, H.B. 270, would take effect once states with a total of 270 Electoral College votes have approved the legislation. Currently, 17 states and the District of Columbia have joined the compact, totaling 209 electoral votes. Pennsylvania's addition would add 19 electoral votes, bringing the total to 228.
