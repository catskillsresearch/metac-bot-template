**Balochistan Engages Religious Scholars To Promote ‘Family Planning’ Efforts - Daily Parliament Times**
The Balochistan government has launched a new initiative to promote family planning efforts by engaging 150 religious scholars across 31 districts. These scholars, designated as Family Planning Assistants, receive honorariums and Islamic literature emphasizing the Islamic legitimacy of responsible family planning, reproductive health, parental responsibility, and child welfare. Maulana Mula Dad, one of the scholars, says, 'We deliver our message through the lens of Islamic values – that every individual is entitled to a healthy life, proper education, and financial stability.' The initiative aims to promote healthier families and create a sustainable balance between population growth and available resources. The province's population has grown from 1.2 million in the early 1950s to 14.8 million in 2023, with an annual growth rate of 3.2%. If this trajectory persists, the population could double by 2045, placing unsustainable pressure on employment, housing, education, and healthcare services. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns that if growth remains above 2%, the province will require 6.5 million new employment opportunities, one million homes, and over 7,000 educational institutions by 2040.

**Denmark to Raise Retirement Age to 70 by 2040: A Response to Aging Population**
Denmark plans to raise the retirement age to 70 years by 2040, with the current retirement age being 67 years. The retirement age will increase every five years, reaching 68 in 2030 and 69 in 2035. This move comes as protests continue over low pensions, with experts calling for changes to labor laws to address the issue. A proposed labor reform aims to increase flexibility in work arrangements, reduce state intervention in private agreements, and allow for more flexible salaries and work relationships. Meanwhile, a proposed pension reform aims to address issues such as the 'envejecimiento poblacional' (aging population), where people are living longer but having fewer children, leading to uncertainty over the future of pensioners. Experts suggest moving from a 'beneficio definido' (defined benefit) system to a 'contribución definida' (defined contribution) system. According to Jacqueline Maubré, 'El sistema de reparto está en crisis en la Argentina. La expectativa de vida ha crecido, pero tambien baja el ritmo de la natalidad.' (The pension system is in crisis in Argentina. Life expectancy has increased, but the birth rate has also decreased.)

**Álava's Aging Population: A Need for More Care Services**
The 'baby boom' generation in Álava is aging, and many are starting to rely on social services. According to the Fundación Eguía-Careaga report, the number of people over 65 will increase by 17.2% by 2030, and those over 80 will increase by 26.8%. The report suggests that the current number of care home places is 'sufficient', but there is a need to strengthen other types of services, such as home care. The report also calculates that there will be a need for 160 more places in day centers. Additionally, the report notes that there will be a need for 1,300 family members to care for their relatives who are unable to perform daily activities without support. The study does not attempt to predict the future of disability in 2030, but notes that the number of people with recognized disabilities in Álava has increased by 80% since the COVID-19 pandemic. As Gorka Urtaran, the deputy for Social Policies, has previously stated, there will be a need for 1,000 more professionals to care for dependent people in their homes by 2030. 'We need to adapt the system to these changes,' said Urtaran. 'The people want to stay at home and live their last years there, or until they have no other choice but to go to a residence.'

**England's yellow and parched land: How soaring immigration and a 30-year failure to build reservoirs could trigger drinking water crisis | Daily Mail Online**
England is facing a drinking water crisis due to rapid population growth, crumbling assets, Nimby opposition, and a warming climate. The UK population is projected to reach 72.5 million by mid-2032, with immigration driving the growth. Water companies have committed to building new reservoirs, but they won't be ready until 2050. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said, 'Water doesn’t lie. It’s a basic test of whether a country can support the people in it, and Britain is failing that test because Labour refuses to confront reality.' He called for tackling immigration head-on, saying, 'We cannot keep adding the pressure and pretending the system will hold.' Environment Minister Emma Hardy said, 'We've been in an infrastructure crisis because we haven't built the reservoirs that we need. If we don't take action, we are going to be running out of the drinking water that we need by the mid-2030s.' The government's target of building 300,000 homes per year would only cover net migration at 170,000 per year, while Labour's housebuilding target could result in five out of seven new homes going to migrants.

**Basque Country Faces Labor Shortage of 17% by 2036**
According to a study by Laboral Kutxa, the Basque Country (Euskadi) will face a labor shortage of 17% by 2036, with 171,000 job openings that cannot be filled. The study, 'Empleo y Transición Demográfica en la CAPV y Navarra: Horizonte 2036', projects that the region will not have enough workers to meet the demand, even in the most optimistic scenarios. The director of the Department of Studies at Laboral Kutxa, Joseba Madariaga, explained that the region's population is aging and the birth rate is low, with an average of 1.3 children per woman. Madariaga stated that 'although migrations contribute to maintaining the population, the combination of low fertility and high longevity is driving a significant demographic aging.' To address this issue, Laboral Kutxa recommends prolonging the working life, attracting and retaining migration, and accelerating professional requalification programs. The study also highlights the importance of adopting proactive policies and collaboration between the public and private sectors to ensure the sustainability of the labor market and the competitiveness of the regional economy.

**Australia 2035: migration, density and climate risk will reshape the future**
According to REA Group's General Manager of Content and Growth, Tobias Johnstone, Australia's property market will be reshaped by six data-driven trends by 2035. These trends include a shift in migration patterns, with India emerging as Australia's dominant source of new residents, and a fundamental change from suburban sprawl to urban densification. The population is expected to grow to 31 million by 2035, with two-thirds of this growth coming from international migration. Tobias warned that climate risk and insurance will become increasingly important, with one in ten properties currently uninsured. Agents will need to strategically reposition themselves to capitalise on high-volume apartment developments, while also considering the geographic spread of their clients. Tobias said, 'Australia will be more diverse than ever before, will be older than ever before, and, of course, will be bigger than ever before.' He also stated, 'We need to level up as an industry on this because consumers are increasingly going to be asking about risk, and they’re going to be asking about insurance.'

**Switzerland's Population Expected to Reach 10 Million by 2040**
According to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (BFS), the country's population is expected to reach 10 million by 2040 and 10.5 million by 2055. This growth will be primarily driven by migration.

**Population Prognosis 2045: Where in Germany it could become more crowded**
According to the Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung (BBSR), the population density in Germany is expected to change by 2045. The BBSR has created an interactive online map that shows the expected population growth or decline in different regions. The map indicates that some areas in the south of Germany, such as Munich, are expected to experience population growth, while many areas in the east are expected to experience a decline in population. The total population of Germany is expected to increase from 83.23 million in 2021 to 85.48 million in 2045, a growth of 2.7%. This growth is not expected to be rapid, and some experts even predict a slight decline in population by 2100. The fear of overpopulation in Germany is therefore considered to be unfounded. However, the map shows that it is not just the total population that matters, but also where people want to live. In popular and economically strong areas, it could become more crowded.

**Ultra Rich Flock to Experimental City for Life-Extending Treatments**
On the island of Roatan in the Caribbean, the city of Prospera has become a haven for the ultra-rich, where experimental gene therapies banned in the US are being performed. The city has low taxes and Bitcoin as its official currency. One of the treatments offered is a gene therapy that claims to extend human lifespan. Bryan Johnson, a well-known biohacker, has undergone this treatment and is reportedly satisfied with the results. Other services include stem cell therapies and cosmetic surgeries, which are said to reverse aging. However, the local residents are concerned, stating that luxury tourism has not benefited them economically and has created an exclusionary environment. The city's population is expected to reach 38,000 by 2030, but the experimental city has also raised ethical and legal concerns.

**Vienna's City Development Plan 2035: Business as Usual**
The city of Vienna is preparing for a population increase of 200,000 people by 2040. According to the new city development plan 2035, there is no need for additional new construction areas. The plan fixes the green space ratio at 50% and introduces new centers on the outskirts of the city. Vienna's city planners are not introducing any major changes, but are instead focusing on addressing the current challenges, particularly the climate crisis. As Bürgermeister Michael Ludwig said, 'We are addressing the current challenges with the 10-year plans,' and this time, it is primarily the climate crisis that will be considered in all areas to make the city suitable for a population of 2.2 million people by 2040 and higher temperatures. The 150-page plan is expected to be finalized in April.
