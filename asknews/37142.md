The Menendez brothers, Lyle and Erik, are reportedly hopeful about being released from prison soon. Their cousin, Anamaria Baralt, stated that their family is hoping for a 2025 release, but acknowledged that they can't 'put a timeline on it.' The brothers' lead defense attorney, Mark Geragos, is highly confident, declaring that 2025 would be their year. Kim Kardashian, a high-profile advocate for the brothers, is also optimistic about their future, having had 'deep, intellectual conversations' with them and genuinely believing in them.

Former D.A. George Gascon had recommended that the Menendez Brothers receive a re-sentencing, which could have led to their immediate release on parole. However, new evidence brought forward, allegedly proving the brothers were abused by their father, may not meet the standard for a new trial, according to Hochman. He stated, 'We looked again at the credibility of the letters, particularly this Andy Cano 1988 supposed letter weighed in the continuum of lies, and it calls into drastic question whether this is in fact a 1988 letter written by Erik Menendez to Andy Cano about this sexual abuse.' Hochman concluded that the court should deny the Menendez brothers' current habeas petition, and if not, the next step would be to order an 'order to show cause.'

**Menendez Brothers' Parole Hearing Delayed by Two Months**
The parole hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who have been incarcerated for 30 years for the 1989 murders of their parents, has been delayed by two months. The brothers were resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole, and their next hearing is now scheduled for Aug. 21 and 22. Lyle Menendez expressed gratitude for the delay, stating, 'it's a good thing' as it gives their attorneys more time to prepare. The hearing was initially for Gov. Gavin Newsom's clemency review, but was shifted to a parole suitability hearing following the resentencing decision. Newsom's clemency consideration was one of multiple avenues to freedom for the Menendez brothers.

**What we know about the Menendez brothers' resentencing and what happens next**
A California judge has reduced the sentences of Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, from life without parole to 50 years to life. The brothers, now 54 and 57, have spent most of their adult lives in prison and have argued that they acted in self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father. The judge praised the brothers for changing their lives and launching numerous prison programs, and said that they should be given a chance for parole. The California Board of Parole Hearings has converted a previously scheduled clemency hearing into a parole suitability hearing, which will take place in August. Depending on the outcome, the brothers could be freed in a matter of months. Critics argue that the murders were calculated acts of greed, rather than acts of desperation by abuse victims.

**Resentencing hearing for Menendez brothers to take place this week**
The resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of killing their parents in 1989, is set to take place on May 13 and 14. The brothers' lead attorney, Mark Geragos, had filed a petition to have the prosecutor, David Hochman, removed from the case due to alleged bias and mistreatment of the Menendez family. However, Geragos withdrew his request and said he planned to lodge his complaints against Hochman at a future date. Hochman had argued that the defense had not presented any proof that his actions prevented the Menendez brothers from receiving a fair hearing. The brothers are still waiting for the full results of a state parole board risk assessment, which will influence whether Governor Gavin Newsom grants them clemency.

**Menendez Brothers' Parole Hearing Is Delayed by 2 Months Following Their Resentencing**
The parole hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1996, has been delayed by two months. The brothers were resentenced to 50 years to life in prison on May 13, making them eligible for parole. They have worked on several prison initiatives during their time in incarceration, including education and community organizing. Lyle earned his bachelor's degree in sociology in June 2024 and is currently pursuing a master's degree in urban planning. The brothers launched a prison beautification project in October 2024, where prisoners painted murals in permitted public spaces. California Gov. Gavin Newsom could potentially seek to grant the brothers clemency, but has said his decision will not be made until after their final hearing.

**Menéndez Brothers' Parole Hearing Postponed to August**
The parole hearing for Erik and Lyle Menéndez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, has been postponed. Originally scheduled for June 13, the hearing will now take place on August 21 and 22, according to ABC News. The change in date was announced by a spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, citing a certain expectation surrounding the judicial process of the brothers. The decision to delay the hearing came after a judge resentenced the brothers on May 13, making them immediately eligible for parole. The initial plan was for the June 13 hearings to focus on a clemency effort by California Governor Gavin Newsom, but the resentencing modified the context of the hearings, incorporating considerations of parole. Despite objections from the victims' families, the hearings were rescheduled for August. The recent judicial ruling that resentenced the brothers has drastically changed the course of their legal fate, shifting from a life sentence without the possibility of parole to one that allows for the possibility of release. As stated by a judge, 'The new sentence of 50 years is a significant reduction from the original life sentence.'

**Menendez Brothers' Parole Hearing Postponed Until August**
The parole hearing for brothers Erik and Lyle Menéndez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, has been postponed until late August. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced on Monday that the hearing, originally scheduled for June 13, has been rescheduled for August 21 and 22. The reason for the delay is unknown. Last week, Judge Michael Jesic reduced the brothers' sentences to between 50 years and life in prison. This new sentence makes them immediately eligible for parole under the state's juvenile offender law, as they committed the crimes at 18 and 21 years old, both under 26. Ultimately, California Governor Gavin Newsom has the responsibility to approve or deny their parole, as he can override the board's recommendation. Newsom ordered the state parole board to conduct a thorough risk assessment to determine the danger the brothers pose to society if they are released. The brothers' contentious path to their new sentence comes after years of attempts to regain their freedom. Many social media users and their family members have supported them, with the brothers claiming that the shooting of their parents, José and Mary Louise 'Kitty' Menéndez, was a result of years of abuse, including alleged sexual abuse by their father.

**Menendez brothers' post-resentencing parole hearing delayed by 2 months**
The parole hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were resentenced to 50 years to life in prison for the 1989 murders of their parents, has been delayed by two months. The hearing was originally scheduled for June 13, but has been pushed back to August 21 and 22. The brothers are pursuing multiple avenues to freedom, including clemency, and it could still be months or years before they would be eligible for parole. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has requested information, such as a risk assessment, while considering the brothers' clemency bid. As Newsom can grant clemency at any time, it remains to be seen when the brothers will be eligible for parole, which will be determined by the parole board.

**What's next for the Menendez brothers after their resentencing? Here's what to know**
The Menendez brothers, Erick and Lyle, have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, allowing them to be considered for parole. Their attorney, Mark Geragos, said, 'I'm hopeful and glad we're one huge step closer to bringing the boys home.' The brothers could be granted their freedom by the end of the year, pending a risk assessment report and a final hearing before the parole board on June 13. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani expects the parole board to recommend their release and for Governor Gavin Newsom to affirm their decision. However, Newsom has a history of rejecting parole recommendations, including those for Sirhan Sirhan and Leslie Van Houten. The brothers' eligibility for parole is due to California's youth offender law, which grants them consideration since they killed their parents before they turned 26 years old. If granted parole, the board and the governor will review the panel's decision, and Newsom has the final say.

**What happens next for the Menendez brothers?**
A judge's ruling has made Lyle and Erik Menendez eligible for parole after nearly three decades in prison for murdering their parents in 1989. The brothers could present their case before a parole board as soon as next month. If parole is granted, it would be up to Governor Gavin Newsom to approve or deny it. The governor hasn't indicated how he might decide if parole is granted. The brothers' lawyers argue that they have matured and been rehabilitated, while prosecutors argue that they haven't taken full responsibility for their crimes. If denied at their first parole hearing, they will continue to receive subsequent hearings until they are granted release. If granted parole, the brothers could be released from prison within weeks or months, subject to the conditions of their release.

**Menendez Brothers' Sentences Reduced: What's Next?**
The Menendez brothers, Lyle and Erik, had their sentences reduced after a series of events brought attention to the case. What's next? The brothers were convicted of murdering their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, with shotguns in 1989 in Los Angeles. The case was brutal and shocked the United States. Initially, the brothers claimed the murder was related to the mafia or their father's business. After the O.J. Simpson trial, the country was hungry for TV shows about real crimes. The first trial of the brothers was one of the first to be almost entirely televised by Court TV. It generated documentaries, TV specials, and dramatizations. The Netflix drama 'Monstros: História de Lyle e Erik Menendez' and the documentary 'Os Irmãos Menendez', released in the fall of 2024, were credited with bringing new attention to the case. The brothers' lawyers appealed to family members and those who knew them since their conviction to speak about their character and rehabilitation in prison before Judge Michael Jesic of the Los Angeles County Superior Court. The Menendez family supported the brothers and asked for their release since the efforts for a new sentence began last fall. The prosecutors, who opposed the new sentence of the brothers, did not call any witnesses. They argued that the brothers did not take full responsibility for their crimes. Erik and Lyle Menendez appeared virtually to read their statements to the court. 'You didn't deserve what I did, but you inspire me to do better,' Erik Menendez said, addressing the family. Jesic issued his decision immediately after the brothers spoke, granting them a new sentence of 50 years of life imprisonment. The brothers are immediately eligible for parole under California's juvenile offender law, as they committed the crime at 18 and 21 years old, both under 26 years old. The parole hearings are conducted by a state council to determine if a person should be released. The inmate will have their first hearing scheduled in up to six months after the date of eligibility, according to the council's policy. They already have a hearing scheduled before the council on June 13, in a petition for clemency they presented to Governor Gavin Newsom. It is not yet clear if this hearing will serve as a formal parole hearing or if a separate hearing will be scheduled. Newsom ordered the state parole council to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment to determine the danger they pose to the public if they are released. In May 2023, the brothers' lawyers also filed a habeas corpus petition in court, requesting a new trial based on new evidence of sexual abuse. The Los Angeles prosecutors filed a motion opposing this petition, but its status is unclear.

**Menendez brothers resentencing set for next week**
The Menendez brothers, Erik and Lyle, are set to be re-sentenced next week in a bid for shorter sentences and a chance at freedom. The brothers, who were sentenced to life in prison without parole 35 years ago for killing their parents, argue that they committed the crimes in self-defence after years of abuse by their father. Their defence team claims that they have been rehabilitated and are no longer a danger to society. The court will hear from family members, prison staff, and guards who will testify on behalf of the brothers. The prosecution, led by Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman, has opposed the brothers' bid for freedom, stating that they have repeatedly lied about why they killed their parents. However, Hochman's predecessor, George Gascon, had favoured releasing the brothers based on evidence of alleged abuse by their parents. A recent Netflix documentary series raised new evidence to support the brothers' claims of abuse, leading to renewed calls for their re-sentencing. Journalist Robert Rand, who has followed the case for three decades, believes that the second trial was a 'complete miscarriage of justice' and that society has evolved to accept that abuse can occur within families. The brothers have supporters worldwide, with over half living outside the US.

**Dates set for Menendez brothers' resentencing hearings**
The resentencing hearings for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were sentenced to life in prison for killing their parents in 1996, will proceed next week after a series of delays. The brothers' lawyers argue that they have been rehabilitated during their 30 years in prison, having obtained an education, participated in self-help classes, and started support groups for fellow inmates. Defence lawyer Mark Geragos plans to call seven family members to testify at the hearings, which could lead to the brothers becoming eligible for parole. However, LA prosecutors oppose the resentencing, and the outcome will also depend on the results of a state parole board risk assessment, which is still pending.

**The Menendez Brothers Just Got Their Shot at Freedom  --  and It All Comes Down to Next Week**
The Menendez brothers, Erik and Lyle, are set to have their fate determined in court next week. The brothers, serving life in prison for the 1989 shotgun murders of their parents, have been fighting for decades to be released, claiming self-defense. However, prosecutors initially stated that the brothers' motive was greed, citing their lavish spending spree after the slayings. In October 2024, then-District Attorney George Gascón recommended that the brothers be resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole. However, new District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposed the recommendation, stating that the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes. The court has denied Hochman's attempt to withdraw the resentencing request, and the outcome will be determined in the upcoming court dates. The brothers' bid for release also depends on whether Governor Gavin Newsom's risk assessment investigation request can be considered by the state parole board.

**Menendez brothers case: What's next for killers after defense, DA spar over resentencing**
The resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez has been postponed until May 9 due to a dispute over the comprehensive risk assessment (CRA) report. Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman wants to continue citing the report, which determines whether the brothers pose a threat to the public if released, while the defense team argues that they were not provided with the report and that the DA's actions are unfair. The judge, Michael Jesic, has ruled that the parties will meet on May 9 to discuss next steps, including whether the risk assessment will be admissible in court and whether the DA should be recused from the case. The Menendez team has chosen not to go forward with testimony in the resentencing hearing, citing the potential for re-traumatization of the family. Hochman has apologized for showing crime scene photos in court, which led to a family member being hospitalized, and has stated that his office remains committed to ethical and impartial prosecution.

**Menendez Brothers Return to Court: Possible Outcomes for Their Future**
The Menendez brothers are set to return to court on April 11 and 17-18. Three possible outcomes for their future are being discussed. The first option is a pardon, which could involve a reduced sentence or full pardon. However, this would be up to California Governor Gavin Newsom, who cannot overturn their original sentence. He could grant conditional release or immediate release, but this is uncertain. The brothers' lawyers have requested a new trial, citing new evidence of childhood trauma that should warrant a lighter sentence. However, this option seems unlikely, as the new district attorney, Nathan Hochman, has expressed skepticism. The third and most likely option is a revised sentence without a new trial. This could involve changing the murder conviction to manslaughter, allowing the brothers to be eligible for conditional release. This option is motivated by the fact that the brothers were young and vulnerable at the time of the crime, and new legislation allows for release based on maturity and rehabilitation.

**Menéndez Brothers Express Hope for Release After Decades in Prison**
Lyle and Erik Menéndez, brothers convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, claim to have hope for the first time in decades. In a televised interview from prison, they stated that they have 'faith that they will be released' despite Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman's request to remove the possibility of parole, reversing a motion presented by his predecessor George Gascón. The case, which shocked the public in the 90s for its brutality and allegations of family abuse, has regained media attention due to a recent documentary series and an upcoming key court hearing. The brothers have been in prison for over three decades, serving life sentences without the possibility of parole. They have been working on initiatives such as a hospice program for inmates, a suicide prevention program, a green space project, and a service dog training program. They have also taught classes on trauma healing and meditation. According to TMZ founder Harvey Levin, 'They were two monsters who were coddled. Thirty-five years later, they are introspective, remorseful people.' Erik Menéndez stated that his 'greatest freedom has come from understanding that he is a person who deserves love.' Lyle Menéndez, 57, said that 'hope for the future is something new for us.' Both brothers expressed that if they are released, they plan to continue their community work from outside. 'We want to keep helping people who live in silence with their pain,' said Erik Menéndez, who also stated that he is starting to feel pride in himself. The possibility of their release depends on the California governor, Gavin Newsom, who has already sent the case to the Parole Board. 'Even if they get resentencing, it will depend on the board and then the governor. And with Newsom seeking the presidency, he might release them if he thinks they are not a threat,' said Levin. The brothers are waiting for the outcome of the hearing on Friday and the parole hearing in June.

**Menendez Brothers' Sentence Review May Lead to Freedom**
Erik and Lyle Menendez, sentenced to life in prison for the 1989 murder of their parents, are eagerly awaiting the review of their sentence, scheduled for March 20. This event marks a significant milestone in their lives, as it may open the door to conditional freedom after 35 years in prison. The review comes at a critical time, with the recent change in leadership at the Los Angeles Department of Justice, which may influence the direction of the case and bring additional uncertainties about the future of the brothers. According to Anamaria Baralt, the brothers' cousin, the family is hopeful for a favorable outcome, but remains cautious. The brothers, now 54 and 57 years old, have maintained that they were victims of physical and psychological abuse by their father, claims that have gained strength over the years with the support of a growing base of defenders. The brothers' narrative has received new attention with productions such as the documentary 'The Menendez Brothers' and the series 'Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story', both addressing lesser-discussed aspects of the case. The arrival of the new prosecutor, Hochman, has brought significant changes to the team responsible for reviewing the sentences, adding more uncertainty to the situation. According to Cliff Gardner, the brothers' defense attorney, the new prosecutor's stance will be crucial in determining the next legal steps. Normally, in homicide cases, more conservative prosecutors tend to strongly consider the wishes of the victims' families. However, in this specific case, many of the Menendez family members have been requesting the brothers' release for years. It remains to be seen if Hochman will consider these requests during his evaluation. New evidence may also influence the review of the sentence. Over the past decades, the brothers have tried to overturn their conviction through various legal resources without success. This year, a new habeas corpus petition was presented by the defense, bringing to light new evidence that may corroborate the brothers' narrative of abuse. Among this evidence is a letter written by Erik months before the crime, in which he mentions his father's abusive behavior. Additionally, a testimony from a former member of the band Menudo revealed alleged sexual abuses perpetrated by José Menendez in the 1980s. During their time in prison, Erik and Lyle not only adapted to life behind bars but also became involved in initiatives aimed at supporting other inmates. Their cousin Anamaria Baralt has emerged as a prominent voice in the fight for their release, arguing that life imprisonment is no longer justifiable in the current context.
