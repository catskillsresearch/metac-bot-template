**Youngkin to set special election for Connolly's seat amid primary season juggle**
Following the death of U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin is set to schedule a special election to fill the vacant seat in the 11th Congressional District. The earliest possible date for the election would be June 24, but the governor has not yet made a decision. Democrats are considering a 'firehouse primary' in July to pick their nominee, and several candidates have already expressed interest in the Democratic nomination. Political analyst Stephen Farnsworth warned that delays in setting the election date can serve partisan ends, and that Democrats are likely to win the seat. Manisha Singh, chair of the 11th District Democratic Committee, emphasized the importance of a transparent and accessible process, saying 'Our committee is just responsible for the process of voting and not dictating who should or should not be filling these shoes.' Singh also expressed confidence in the field of contenders, saying 'We have some excellent candidates who I am very sure are up to the challenge.'

**2025 Tax Legislation Update**
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' (BBB) on May 22, 2025, as part of the Republican Congress's reconciliation package. The BBB extends certain tax provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that would have expired at the end of 2025 and implements other priorities of President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. President Trump aims to finalize the tax bill by July 4, 2025. The bill will next be considered by the Senate.

**Congreso without a clear agenda for the first legislative recess of 2025**
The Congreso does not have a clear plan of work for the first legislative recess period, which runs from May 16 to July 31. This could mean weeks of inactivity in exchange for high salaries, as the increase in salary for congressmen is still in effect. According to opposition deputies, the inactivity is due to some official forces 'blocking' the sessions, preventing the work from continuing from the plenary of the Congreso. However, the official forces consider that it is because there is a lack of agreement between the different blocks, adding that they are in dialogue processes to define a parliamentary agenda for the country. Despite which of the two versions is correct, the deputies do not have a clear plan of work, not even for June, according to deputies consulted from different parliamentary blocks. 'I think the issue should start to take shape. Unfortunately, there have not been the necessary consensuses and that is evident. It is evident that there are no greater agreements within the legislative blocks,' said Elmer Palencia, leader of the Valor block. However, Deputy Victoria Palala, elected by Movimiento Semilla, assures that it is possible to reach agreements to concretize legislative projects for the country during the parliamentary recess weeks. 'We hope that the Congreso will untangle itself and achieve what was being given. I believe that there is a consciousness among the deputies to retake the country's agenda and we are looking for those approaches,' she said. The Constitutional Court ordered the plenary of the Congreso to convene with a set agenda, due to the previous session being adjourned, leaving a series of topics that were proposed by opposition deputies, who arrived at the Court through a provisional amparo. Among the topics included in that session is the election of the first secretary of the Board of Directors, the election of the representative of the Congreso before the Monetary Board and the possible reassignment of the presidencies of the Finance and Energy and Mines commissions.

Diaz noted that this trend won't be limited to Sen. Tommy Tuberville's recent announcement to run for governor, and that 'this won't be the last announcement we'll see in the next two years before the next election.'

**Preps for proclamation of senators on May 17, party-lists on May 19 underway**
The Commission on Elections (Comelec) has started preparations for the proclamation of winning senators and party-list organizations in Eleksyon 2025. Comelec chairperson George Erwin Garcia announced that the proclamation of senators will be held on May 17 at 3 p.m. at the Tent City in Manila Hotel, while winning party-list groups will be proclaimed on May 19. Garcia stated that the Comelec is waiting for the formal recommendation of the supervisory committee to proclaim the 12 winning senatorial candidates based on the computation. The Comelec has also started canvassing votes for party-list groups, with a representative of the Philreca party-list arguing that the number of seats for party-list groups should be 64, not 63. Garcia noted that this is a legal issue that may be elevated to the Supreme Court. Under the party-list law, a party-list group needs to secure at least 2% of the votes cast to win at least one seat in the House of Representatives. 'Mayroon kasing point. Ang basehan ng 20% sa Kongreso, 20% ng kabuuang congressmen ng legislative districts. Pero paano kung hindi exact figures? Paano kung mayroong point? Ang tanong sigurado, paano gagawin ng Comelec sa point, 'yun ba ay iko-consider na one whole or mere fraction?' said Garcia. 'Alam namin legal issue 'yan and therefore, di lang issue 'yan ng Mathematics. Legal issue 'yun na maaaring makarating sa Supreme Court,' he said.

**Legislative Top 5 - May 2025**
With the end of the legislative session just over two weeks away, much work remains to be done to pass a two-year budget. The first conference committee appointments have been made, but no committees have met yet, and several bills have not passed both floors. A global budget agreement between the Governor and leaders from the House and Senate has yet to be made, which is necessary for conferees to make final decisions on their budgets. Tax and bonding bills remain elusive, and if the legislature fails to pass a complete budget by May 19, a special session will be called. Minnesota's current budget expires on June 30, and if there is no budget in place at that time, the state will face a government shutdown. Despite the challenges, some bipartisan bills have been passed, including a bill to make modest changes to Minnesota's Earned Safe and Sick Time (ESST) law. In other news, Republican Keri Heintzeman won the special election for Minnesota Senate District 6, and Democratic U.S. Representative Angie Craig announced her intention to run for the U.S. Senate Seat being vacated by Senator Tina Smith in 2026.

**Centro Democrático Proposes Mechanism for Selecting Single Candidate for 2026 Presidential Election**
A group of Centro Democrático militants, led by José Obdulio Gaviria, have proposed a mechanism for selecting a single candidate for the 2026 presidential election through a series of polls. The plan involves four polls, with the last-place candidate dropping out after each one. The first poll will be held on May 15, followed by polls on May 30, June 15, and June 30. If the difference between the two remaining candidates is 15% or more, the winner will be declared. Otherwise, the campaign will continue with debates and intensified events. The party plans to hold a convention in July if the candidate is not chosen by then. The proposal also includes a plan for a nationwide mobilization to elect 25 senators and 36 representatives in the 2026 legislative elections. 'Uribe and the proclaimed candidate will build an alliance with parties, movements, and personalities close to them, promoting an inter-party consultation that will define the coalition's single candidate in March 2026, coinciding with the congressional elections,' they said in the letter. The party aims to win six seats in the Senate and 36 in the Chamber of Representatives, with specific targets for each department and region.

**Vacancy-appointed Colorado lawmakers would have to run to keep their seat after a year under reform proposal**
A newly introduced bipartisan bill in Colorado, House Bill 1315, proposes that lawmakers appointed to fill vacancies in the state legislature would have to run in an election to keep their seat after about a year. This would apply to lawmakers appointed to fill seats between July 31 of an even-numbered year and July 30 of an odd-numbered year. They would have to seek election in a special contest during the next odd-year November statewide election. The bill's sponsors, including Rep. Emily Sirota and House Minority Leader Rose Pugliese, argue that this would keep the spirit of Colorado's current vacancy process while getting more people involved. Shad Murib, chairman of the Colorado Democratic Party, said the bill is modeled after the system used in Tennessee. Governor Polis has expressed support for the bill, but it would still need his signature to become law.

**Hobbs Announces Election Dates To Replace The Late Rep. Raúl Grijalva**
Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has announced that a special primary election will be held on Tuesday, July 15, 2025, to fill the vacancy in Congressional District 7 left by the death of Rep. Raúl Grijalva. A special general election will follow on Tuesday, September 23, 2025. According to state law, the governor must call for a special primary election within 72 hours of the passing of a U.S. representative if there isn't a general election scheduled in the next six months. As Grijalva's death occurred on Thursday morning, the governor acted promptly to fulfill this requirement. 'Federal law (2 U.S.C. § 8) provides that special elections to fill vacancies in the U.S. House of Representatives are held under applicable state laws,' said Governor Hobbs, emphasizing the importance of adhering to state and federal regulations in this process.

**House version of legislative term limits bill filed**
A new bill, HB 637, has been filed in the House of Representatives to create a constitutional amendment that would limit House members to four two-year terms and Senate members to two four-year terms, capping total legislative service at 16 years. This comes after the Florida Supreme Court ruled that Debbie Mayfield, who served in the Senate from 2016 to 2024, was constitutionally eligible to run in a Special Election for Senate District 19 despite term limits. Mayfield had previously resigned from the House to run for the Senate seat, but was disqualified from the ballot due to term limits. However, the high court unanimously ruled that she had a clear legal right to appear on the primary ballot. Mayfield will now face Tim Thomas, Marcie Adkins, and Mark Lightner III in the Special Election Primary.
