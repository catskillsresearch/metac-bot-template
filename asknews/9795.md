**'Are you kidding?' Stunned CNN expert scolds Dems as Trump soars despite turmoil**
CNN Chief Data Analyst Harry Enten is puzzled by the latest polls showing that despite turmoil, Republicans are leading Democrats by 8 points in economic views. Enten asked, 'Are you kidding me?' after seeing the numbers. According to the CNN poll, in May 2025, Republicans have a 12-point advantage over Democrats in terms of having a better economic plan. This trend is also reflected in a Reuters-Ipsos poll, which showed a 9-point advantage for Republicans in May 2024, increasing to a 12-point advantage in May 2025. Enten believes this speaks to Democratic problems on the economy.

**Editorial: Dems are many things, popular isn't one of them**
A recent poll from The Economist/YouGov shows that both the Democratic and Republican parties have low favorability ratings, with the Democrats trailing behind the Republicans. According to the poll, 41% of Americans view Republicans favorably, while 52% view them unfavorably, and only 36% view Democrats favorably, with 57% viewing them unfavorably. The article suggests that the Democrats' low ratings can be attributed to their inability to connect with voters, as well as the actions of some of their leaders, such as former President Joe Biden's cognitive decline and the hypocrisy of politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, who criticize the wealthy while traveling in luxury. As one of the article's authors notes, 'People don't like being lied to.'

**Vast majority of Americans don’t see Dems as a party with strong leaders that get stuff done: CNN poll**
A recent CNN poll found that 58% of Americans want the federal government to do more to tackle the country's problems, a 30-year high. However, only 19% of Americans view Democrats as a party that can 'get things done', compared to 36% who view Republicans as capable of doing so. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries attributed the bleak survey data to Democrats being out of power in Washington, DC, but emphasized that his party is determined to make life more affordable for everyday Americans. The poll also found that Democrats' advantage on the issue of abortion has waned, and that 81% of respondents believe there are significant differences between Republicans and Democrats. According to Rep. Ro Khanna, Jeffries' leadership is 'making the case' for Democrats. 'We have to continue to make the case, one, that Democrats, of course, are the party that is determined to make life more affordable for everyday Americans,' Jeffries said. 'Understandably, there's real frustration amongst the American people.'

**GOP path to a Illinois Senate victory may run through Darin LaHood**
Darin LaHood, a 56-year-old Republican congressman from Illinois, is being considered as a potential candidate for the state's Senate seat. LaHood, who has been supportive of President Donald Trump's 'America First' agenda, has a centrist image and a 'downstate' connection that makes him an attractive option for the Republican Party. LaHood said he's 'happy with his current job' but is 'taking a hard look' at a Senate run. He believes that Republicans can win the seat, which is currently held by retiring Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL). LaHood's advantages include his youth, centrist views, and wide name recognition. His father, former Rep. Ray LaHood, served as transportation secretary under Obama and was a congressman for seven terms. GOP strategist Aaron Del Mar said LaHood 'checks the right boxes' for the GOP and has the 'profile and resume to really make an impact.' Del Mar also noted that LaHood's background as a prosecutor and work on the House Intelligence Committee make him a well-rounded candidate. However, strategists agree that any Republican will face an uphill battle, as midterm elections historically favor the party not in the White House, and the seat is rated as safely Democratic by nonpartisan election forecasters.

**Support for same-sex marriage stays strong as party divide widens, poll shows**
A recent Gallup poll shows that 68% of Americans still support same-sex marriage, a decade after the Supreme Court made it legal across the U.S. in Obergefell v. Hodges. While overall support has remained steady, party opinions have shifted, with Democrats' support reaching a record high of 88% and Republicans' support dropping to 41%, the lowest since 2016. The gap between Democrats and Republicans is now 47 points, the widest it's been since Gallup started tracking this issue 29 years ago. Democrats have always been more supportive than Republicans, with independents generally closer to Democrats. However, the growing political divide could put LGBTQ+ rights at risk, as some Republican lawmakers have pushed for the Supreme Court to overturn the decision on same-sex marriage.

**Bioethics: The Italian Law on Medically Assisted Procreation Under Attack**
The Italian law on medically assisted procreation (PMA) has been subject to intense opposition since its introduction. The law aimed to protect the fundamental values of human life and the family, but the judiciary has been gradually dismantling it. The Corte Costituzionale has issued 12 rulings since 2006, some of which have introduced significant changes. The 2009 ruling (n. 151) allowed for the production of surplus embryos and their freezing, while the 2015 ruling (n. 96) permitted access to assisted reproduction for couples with genetic diseases. The 2015 ruling (n. 229) lifted the ban on eugenic embryo selection, and the 2014 ruling (n. 162) recognized the 'right to a child' as 'incoercible'. The 2025 ruling (n. 68) granted parental status to the 'intentional mother' who consented to the in vitro conception of a child carried and born by her partner. The article argues that the cultural push to prioritize individual will over traditional family values is concerning, and that the complementarity of masculinity and femininity is essential for child growth and care.

**Is "Baby Optimization" Unscientific and Immoral?  - Daily Devotional**
Anna Louise Sussman's article in The New York Times discusses the ethics of 'polygenic embryo screening', a process that uses AI to identify genes associated with disorders such as diabetes, autism, and cancer. The founder of a company offering this service, motivated by her own mother's genetic condition, hopes to 'optimize' human beings by selecting only the healthiest embryos. However, critics argue that this approach is unscientific and immoral, as it requires the disposal of 'suboptimal' embryos and perpetuates the idea that people with disabilities are less valuable. A doctor who advocates for the technology admitted that if his parents had had access to it, he would not have been born due to his diabetes. Bioethicists warn that the message from polygenic screening is not only that we can have the best children, but that we should have the best children, which could lead to the selection of enhanced traits like height, intelligence, and attractiveness. An Oxford professor of genomics described the promise of polygenic screening as unscientific, and a doctor warned against the 'genetic determinism' it promotes. As David Bentley Hart warned, optimization is supposed to select the best traits in humanity but actually selects the worst, an attempt to 'reach the divine by ceasing to be human, by surpassing the human, by destroying the human.'

**How Artificial Intelligence Improves Embryo Selection and IVF Outcomes**
A recent medical study has revealed how artificial intelligence (AI) can revolutionize the success rates of in vitro fertilization (IVF). According to the study, when undergoing IVF, multiple embryos are typically formed, but not all have the same chances of successful implantation and choosing the best and most viable embryo gives the best chance of pregnancy, as per Indian times. Traditionally, embryologists consider various factors, such as the number of cells, the shape of the cytoplasm, and the embryo itself, although these judgments are subjective and not always accurate. AI can learn from vast amounts of data and provide smart predictions. While humans can do this too, AI can do it faster and more consistently in the IVF process. AI systems analyze images and videos of embryonic development and compare them to the results they can provide. These results include whether the pregnancy has occurred or not. Based on this, AI evaluates embryos, helping doctors choose the best embryo, and giving the highest chance of pregnancy. Additionally, AI continues to analyze more images and develops continuously. AI helps patients improve their chances of pregnancy and childbirth, and also reduces the need for multiple IVF cycles, as well as the risk of twins. When we know which embryo is the best, we can choose one with confidence and put it in the womb, which means reducing stress and medication, and faster results for couples seeking IVF. According to the medical study, AI tools are efficient and provide consistent results in all laboratories. Furthermore, these systems may reveal new relationships between various embryo characteristics, and they also provide significant economic benefits to healthcare systems. AI does not only revolutionize embryo selection, but some systems also take into account your medical history to provide personalized recommendations, this is the future. The study confirmed that AI will not replace doctors, but will be an assistant to improve your treatment cycle, and doctors and embryologists will make the final decision with more confidence than ever before. The integration of AI in fertility care is one of the most exciting developments in the current era, as it combines the experience of doctors and technology to help couples achieve their dream of parenthood.

**AI in Assisted Reproduction: A 7% Reduction in Conception Time**
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in assisted reproduction has revolutionized the selection of eggs, sperm, and embryos, allowing for a 7% reduction in the time needed to conceive a child, according to a study led by researchers at IVI Valencia. The study, presented at the 11th International Congress IVIRMA, found that applying AI to embryo selection also increases the pregnancy rate by 5% and up to 7% in multiple attempts. 'AI is a reality in assisted reproduction and is giving great results in research and clinical practice,' said Juan Antonio García Velasco, scientific director of the congress and IVIRMA. 'We are talking about distinguishing the spermatozoid with the highest capacity to fertilize the ovocyte and give rise to an embryo, as well as identifying the best quality eggs, which undoubtedly contribute positively to achieving better success rates, reducing time and increasing pregnancy rates.' The AI also shows promising uses in personalizing fertility treatments, providing women with information on the expected number of eggs and the best day to visit the clinic, reducing unnecessary visits. However, beyond AI, the IVIRMA Congress has also presented advances in genetics, stem cell biology, and tissue engineering. Dr. Antonio Capalbo, responsible for genomics at IVIRMA Global Research Alliance, presented a study suggesting that sequencing the complete genome of embryos before implantation could identify not only major chromosomal abnormalities but also subtle variations that may compromise their development and future severe diseases in offspring. 'With current genetic tests (such as trophoblast biopsies), approximately half of the embryos considered normal do not implant in the endometrium, and another 10% end in spontaneous abortion,' Capalbo explained. However, the specialist admitted that more studies are needed to evaluate the impact and how to manage the new genomic information obtained before applying complete genome sequencing of embryos in clinics.

**Weâre All Eugenicists Now**
The author argues that eugenics is no longer a taboo topic, citing the New York Times' article 'Should Human Life be Optimized?' which discussed the use of embryo selection to ensure children get the best genetic start in life. A survey from Harvard Medical School found that 24% of people approve and 13% strongly approve of screening embryos for positive traits such as intelligence. The author also mentions in-vitro gametogenesis, a technology that could increase the chances of having a genius baby or an Olympic gold medalist. The author believes that eugenics improves people, just as selective breeding improves plants and animals, and that it's time for the country to return to common sense. They argue that the fear of eugenics has been driven by the fear of acknowledging genetic differences between races, and that it's time to step out of the 'deliberate ignorance' of the past.

**AI Revolutionizes IVF Treatment, Boosting Success Rates**
Artificial intelligence has revolutionized IVF treatment, improving success rates and providing new hope for infertile couples. According to scientific studies and experts, AI has significantly improved the process of embryo selection, follicle analysis, and hormone treatment optimization. In fact, a study published in Nature Communications found that AI algorithms can analyze ultrasound images to identify which follicles are most likely to develop into a healthy embryo, allowing doctors to schedule 'trigger' hormone injections more accurately. Dr. Scott Nelson, the lead author of the study, said, 'AI is increasing IVF success by capturing details that the human eye cannot see. This technology is taking personalized treatment to a new level.' Another study published in npj Digital Medicine found that AI can select embryos with a 20% higher accuracy than traditional methods. Dr. Siobhan Hanassab, the lead researcher, said, 'AI is selecting the embryos with the highest implantation potential in seconds, providing a significant advantage in terms of time and cost.' Experts, such as Dr. James Hopkyns from Imperial College London, believe that AI is 'game-changing' in IVF treatment, standardizing the process and reducing errors. However, Prof. Dr. Catherine Racowsky from Harvard Medical School also raised concerns about the ethical implications of AI in embryo selection, emphasizing the need for transparency and informed consent from patients.

**The Rise of Pronatalists in the US: Selecting Children Based on Genetic Traits**
The Collins family claims to have used a special technology during their in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure to screen their embryos for traits such as intelligence. They stated, 'Research allows us to know our genetic predisposition to IQ, -- they said in 2023 to an undercover reporter. -- We would never choose a child who is less gifted in terms of IQ than we are'. The Collins family is part of the growing movement of 'pronatalists' in the US, who are seeking support from former President Trump. According to the Collins, they used this technology to select embryos with higher IQs, showing a growing trend of selecting children based on genetic traits.

**Artificial Intelligence Revolutionizes IVF Treatment: An Interview with Dr. Seval Taşdemir**
Dr. Seval Taşdemir, a specialist in obstetrics and IVF, discussed the latest developments in IVF treatment, including the use of artificial intelligence in embryo selection, the importance of genetic testing, and the importance of timely medical checks for couples trying to conceive. According to Dr. Taşdemir, artificial intelligence has greatly benefited IVF treatment, allowing for easier selection of embryos with high fertility and healthy genetic makeup. 'We can now more easily select embryos with high fertility and a strong genetic makeup,' she said. Dr. Taşdemir emphasized the importance of genetic testing in ensuring a healthy pregnancy process, stating that 'we now have the ability to analyze the genetic makeup of the embryo and determine whether it is healthy or not.' She also stressed the importance of timely medical checks for couples trying to conceive, saying that 'women tend to become mothers at an older age, but their egg reserves decrease, so we aim to develop 10-15 eggs using the 'pooling' method.'

**The Rise of Embryo Screening for the 'Best' Babies**
Companies like Heliospect Genomics are using pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) to screen embryos for IQ, allowing parents to choose the 'best' baby. While PGT is primarily used for disease prevention, some companies are pushing the boundaries of what risks PGT can assess in embryos, potentially leading to 'superbabies'. However, experts like Arthur Caplan are concerned about the line between testing for disease and testing for enhancement getting fuzzy. Regulation is necessary to prevent mass consumer-driven eugenics, as seen in sex selection, where parents are already selecting embryos based on sex, potentially leading to an imbalanced sex ratio across a specific generation. The technology already exists, and if it becomes good enough, parents will use it to improve their child's IQ, but policy-makers need to keep up with the research to prevent unintended consequences.

**Republicans back IVF expansion as some pro-lifers push back**
Some high-profile Republicans have spoken out in support of in vitro fertilization (IVF), despite concerns from pro-life groups that the technology can result in the destruction of human embryos. According to Jon Speed, a former anti-abortion activist who now protests outside fertility clinics, IVF involves the destruction of 25-30 human embryos for every one live birth. Speed, who now works for Choice42, a Christian media organization, argues that IVF is 'worse than abortion' and 'devastating.' Pro-life groups, including Students for Life of America and Them Before Us, have spoken out against IVF, citing the industry's lack of regulation and the disposal of human embryos. In contrast, some Republicans, such as Rep. Lehman Franklin of Georgia, have introduced legislation to codify a right to IVF, citing their own experience with infertility. However, pro-life groups are urging politicians to take a closer look at the unregulated industry and its implications for unborn children.

**Trump Signs Executive Orders to Make Artificial Insemination More Affordable**
US President Donald Trump has signed a number of executive orders, including a study on making artificial insemination and other fertility treatments more affordable for Americans. According to White House Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt, the President has directed his administration to ensure access to artificial insemination for those who need it and 'significantly reduce the cost of healthcare for such treatments'. However, she did not provide details on how to achieve this goal, instead stating that the administration will provide recommendations, including potential legislation. This move comes as a surprise to some, especially given the Democrats' claims before the last general election that reproductive rights were at risk in the Supreme Court, which includes three justices appointed by Trump during his first term and helped to overturn the constitutional right to abortion. This led to stricter restrictions on the matter in Republican-led states. However, President Trump, who was a Republican presidential candidate at the time, assured that he would not limit access to artificial insemination in a presidential debate with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Last year, Trump openly expressed his support for artificial insemination after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos could be considered children under state law. The decision, which was welcomed by some Republicans and conservatives, sparked immediate backlash. Trump also signed more executive orders, including one that 'restores the old foundation that the President, or the Attorney General alone, can speak on behalf of the United States when expressing his opinion on the law'. The move comes as Trump's allies question the court's rulings that block some of his initiatives and critics fear that his administration may ignore judicial orders. He also signed a presidential memo to impose 'transparency on government agencies and departments', stating that this will reveal 'waste, fraud, and abuse' in order to provide and maintain taxpayer dollars.

**60% Americans favor defending Taiwan when the time comes: Report - The Taiwan Times**
A recent survey titled 'Order and Disorder' found that 60% of Americans support the US defending Taiwan against a possible Chinese invasion. The survey, conducted by YouGov from August 28 to September 6, gathered responses from 1,000 adult US citizens. According to the results, 18% strongly supported intervention, 42% somewhat supported intervention, 27% were somewhat opposed, and 13% were strongly opposed. Republicans were more likely to support taking military action than Democrats or Independents. The survey's findings suggest that the US may be willing to commit troops to defend Taiwan, which could potentially lead to a global conflict, including the possibility of World War III.
