**Major Labels in Licensing Talks With A.I. Companies Suno & Udio Amid Blockbuster Lawsuit**
Universal Music, Warner Music, and Sony Music are in talks with AI companies Suno and Udio to license their music for use in AI models. The talks come a year after the labels filed billion-dollar copyright cases against the startups, which they claim have stolen music on an 'unimaginable scale' to build their models. If reached, the deals would help settle the litigation and establish a precedent for how AI companies pay artists and music companies going forward. The labels are seeking fees and equity in return for allowing the startups to use their music, similar to deals struck by Spotify in the late 2000s. The cases against Udio and Suno are part of a larger trend of lawsuits filed against AI firms by creative industries, who argue that AI companies are violating copyrights on a massive scale. The U.S. Copyright Office has come out against the AI firms, releasing a report that said training was likely not fair use.

**Industry AI Adoption in 2025: Progress, Pitfalls, and Trends**
According to the State of AI Report 2025, industry adoption of AI is mixed, with 72% of organizations using generative AI in at least one business function, but struggling to scale beyond narrow use cases. Finance and Healthcare have reached 71% and 66% adoption, respectively, but mainly in specific functions like fraud detection and diagnostics. The highest adoption is in marketing, operations, and procurement, which have mild regulations. The main barrier to AI adoption is estimating the value of AI projects, while most AI projects have positive returns. The USA and China scored 77 and 66, respectively, in the IMF AI Preparedness Index. Research suggests that 300M jobs may be at risk of being automated, leading to proposed AI education bills in the US Congress. This year, the importance of data labelling and Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) is expected to grow, with US KPO predicted to grow faster than expected. 'Small/narrow' AI solutions will continue to be adopted in specific functions, while large models will be slow to adopt in regulated industries. The US admin workforce will not lose more than 1% due to AI, and the average AI roll out will still be around 8-12 months in large companies. Additionally, the US will establish a nation-wide AI education program to reskill the workforce.

**ILO Warns of AI's Impact on Jobs, but Sees Opportunities for Transformation**
According to a report by the International Labor Organization (ILO), 838 million jobs, or 24% of the total, are exposed to some level of artificial intelligence (AI) and 3.3% (115 million) are at risk of automation. The ILO notes that AI could affect women's jobs more than men's, with 28% of female jobs (390 million) and 21% of male jobs (448 million) at risk. The report also highlights that the ILO has increased its estimate of 'potentially automatable' jobs by over 50% since its 2023 report, which estimated 75 million jobs. However, the total number of jobs exposed to AI has decreased by 20% since 2023. The ILO emphasizes that while AI may replace some jobs, it will also create new ones and that 'most jobs will transform, rather than be destroyed.' The report also notes that the adoption of AI is happening rapidly and that its use will not be uniform across all countries, with some facing challenges such as high costs, limited infrastructure, and insufficient worker training. The ILO concludes that it is essential to prioritize social dialogue and employee consultations to ensure that AI benefits both productivity and working conditions.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak predicts a dystopian future for humanity, with the global population shrinking to 100 million by 2300 due to AI replacing jobs and causing a collapse in birth rates. According to Prof. Kak, 'Computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will be doing literally all that we do because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He warns that major cities like New York and London will become ghost towns, and that the world will be devastated. Prof. Kak, author of 'The Age of Artificial Intelligence', says that people are unaware of the consequences of AI and that it's likely that the world population will collapse. He also mentions that billionaire Elon Musk has expressed similar concerns, suggesting that humans should consider colonizing space to avoid extinction. Prof. Kak states, 'It's likely. I have all the data in the book. This is not just my personal opinion.'

**Is AI a Threat to Human Employment? The Truth No One Wants to Admit**
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is sparking a heated debate about its impact on human employment. While some warn of massive job losses and growing inequality, others see AI as a catalyst for innovation, creating new opportunities and enhancing human work. According to a 2023 McKinsey study, up to 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated by 2030. Real-world examples, such as tech company layoffs in 2024, suggest that AI-driven automation is already contributing to significant job cuts, with a 44% wave of job cuts reported. As AI continues to transform industries, it's essential to consider both sides of the argument and prepare for the future of work.

**The Year 2040: A Leap into the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
According to a report by PwC, the global economy is expected to reach $28 trillion annually by 2040, with a 200% increase from 2024, thanks to the contribution of artificial intelligence. Additionally, 77% of jobs worldwide will be managed with the help of AI, with over 40% of current human jobs transitioning to new roles related to supervising and directing smart systems. In the healthcare sector, AI models will be implemented to predict diseases up to 18 months in advance, using DNA analysis, patient behavior, and sleep and movement patterns. This early prediction is expected to reduce heart disease and cancer mortality rates by 58%, while 95% of complex surgeries will be performed by high-precision robotic surgeons with an error rate of less than 0.02%. In education, over 70% of major cities worldwide will be managed by connected AI networks, controlling electricity, traffic, security, and water supply. These systems are expected to reduce traffic accidents by 67%, energy consumption by 50%, and public transportation wait times by 80%. In media, algorithms will produce 85% of global news and technical content, including video reports, music, and cinematic scripts. In the judiciary, AI systems will be used to draft primary legal judgments, with 56 countries relying on the 'Smart Judicial Assistant' to issue verdicts in simple cases. In social relationships, over 500 million friendships or marriages will be registered through AI intermediaries, and humans will be accompanied by a virtual personal assistant that understands their emotions, history, and mental state, providing them with instant support 24/7. As we leap forward, 2040 will open the door to a fundamental question: are we living in the peak of humanity... or the beginning of what comes after humanity? Will we need laws for algorithmic rights, just as we needed laws for human rights in the past? 2040 is not just the year of technology, but the year of redefining humanity itself. In this rapidly changing scene, the difference between those who lead the machine and those who are led by it... will be just 'a matter of engineering'.

**The Rise of AI-Generated Music: A Growing Concern for the Music Industry**
DJ Laurent Garnier said, 'Today, with over a million tracks released per week, 20% of titles are generated entirely by AI.' However, there is no global data to confirm this figure across all streaming platforms. Deezer, a major player in the sector, reported that 18% of tracks uploaded daily on their service are entirely generated by artificial intelligence, which translates to around 20,000 tracks per day. To address this issue, Deezer developed an automatic detection tool to identify productions created by AI, such as Suno or Udio, and remove them from user recommendations. Other platforms like Spotify and Apple Music do not officially disclose the percentage of AI-generated content on their platforms, but they are also facing this phenomenon. In 2023, Spotify removed tens of thousands of tracks created using the Boomy tool, which allows anyone to compose and publish automatic songs by AI. This single platform claimed to have generated 14 million tracks in a year. An experiment is available to anyone: with just a few clicks, it's possible to produce a complete track using a generator. We created a 100% AI song on the theme of disinformation in under a minute. The economic impact of these AI-generated contents is a concern for professionals. A study commissioned by the Cisac (Confederation of International Societies of Authors and Composers) warns that artists and composers could lose up to 24% of their revenue by 2028, amounting to 4 billion euros per year. Those most at risk are creators of background music, advertising music, and sounds used for TikTok, YouTube, or podcasts, as these formats are easily imitated by AI at a lower cost and in a matter of seconds.

**Korean Copyright Association Bans AI-Composed Songs From Copyright Registration**
South Korea's largest music copyright organization, KOMCA, has banned AI-composed songs from copyright registration due to the lack of clear management guidelines for AI-generated content. According to KOMCA, any song that involves AI in the creative process, even in part, will not be accepted for registration. This includes tracks where AI was used to compose, write lyrics, or contribute melodically. KOMCA requires a self-declaration confirming that no AI was involved in the song's creation, with significant legal and financial consequences for false declarations. The policy applies to the composition and lyric-writing stages of song creation, not the production or recording phase. This move comes amid growing international debate over the copyrightability of AI-generated art, with the U.S. Copyright Office maintaining that only works with 'human authorship' are eligible for protection. 'KOMCA only recognizes songs that are wholly the result of human creativity,' the association said, noting that even a 1% contribution from AI makes a song ineligible for registration. 'Until there is clear legislation or regulatory guidance, this is a precautionary administrative policy.'

**The Sound of Tomorrow: AI's Symphony in Your Soul.**
AI-generated music is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from human-made music, and is even surpassing it in popularity. According to Spotify's 2024 Wrapped data, 15% of the top 100 songs had AI involvement, from composition to production. AI experts predict that by 2030, AI will not only compose but curate music that feels more 'you' than anything a human could craft, tapping into your neural patterns. Music is a neural force that rewires the brain with every note, and AI is exploiting this power with precision. As AI expert Max Tegmark said, 'AI will transform music consumption by creating hyper-personalized tracks that resonate with your emotional state, making human music seem quaint.' The future of sound is AI, and it's a wild ride.
