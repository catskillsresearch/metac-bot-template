**US Trifluralin Market Expected to Grow Steadily, Driven by Increasing Dependence on Herbicide**
The US Trifluralin market is expected to grow steadily, with an estimated value of $143.59 million in 2024, increasing to $224.08 million by 2033, with a CAGR of 5.14% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2033. The growth is driven by the increasing dependence on Trifluralin as a primary pre-emergence herbicide for crops such as soybeans and cotton, particularly in dryland agricultural regions like North Dakota, Montana, and Washington. According to the USDA, over 9.4 million acres will be treated with Trifluralin by May 2024, with 1.9 million acres in North Dakota alone. The increased usage is due to the herbicide's effectiveness in controlling weeds like cocklebur and hairy beggarweed, despite seasonal planting delays. The actual consumption has reached 3,300 tons since the beginning of the year, already surpassing the 2023 level. The supply chain has expanded, with domestic production capacity remaining stable at around 6,500 tons of active ingredient. However, US producers still rely heavily on imports from China, with over 4,200 tons of technical Trifluralin cleared in the first quarter of 2024. The procurement price has softened from $5.20/kg to $4.80/kg due to increased inventory and lower raw material costs, but the price gap remains relatively stable. A 2.4-ton advance reservation for the 2025 season reflects the strong demand, driven by the expansion of cotton acreage and the need for effective Group 3 herbicide rotation strategies. The EPA's 2024 ecological review is expected to update regulations, but labels will not undergo significant changes, maintaining producer trust. The main driving force behind the market is the increasing dependence on Trifluralin as a low-cost and broad-spectrum weed control agent for soybeans and cotton, with the USDA reporting a 19,000-acre increase in cotton acreage to 2.34 million acres in 2024, covering over 2.7 million acres of pulse crops. The market is also driven by the need for cost-effective weed control solutions in non-irrigated conditions, with an investment return rate remaining high and a benefit-to-cost ratio of 6:1 supported by crop yields and market prices. The trend of adopting autumn applications is notable, with 4.18 million acres treated in 2024, a significant increase from the previous year. This trend is particularly evident in the northern plains region, where farmers are adopting two-pass systems to improve weed control and reduce labor inputs. Technical advancements, such as GPS-guided vertical tillage, have enabled accurate application and reduced drift losses. Autumn applications have also increased machine processing capacity, allowing large-scale operations to tackle challenging planting schedules. Under current agricultural and labor conditions, Trifluralin autumn applications are expected to reach 5 million acres by 2026. However, the market is vulnerable to supply chain weaknesses, particularly the high dependence on Chinese intermediates and active ingredients. In the first quarter of 2024, nearly all imports came from just three Chinese suppliers, highlighting the risks of logistics disruptions, such as high sea freight rates and potential regulatory barriers. In response, some US distributors have begun sourcing from India to mitigate risks despite cost increases. Warehouse management strategies are also evolving, with inventory increasing before peak demand periods. Analysts warn that a major disruption, such as a port closure or export quota, could restrict supply by over 1,400 tons within two months, jeopardizing critical application periods. The top companies in the US Trifluralin market include King Quenson, ADAMA, Drexel Chemical, Loveland Products, Inc., Nufarm, Gowan Company, WinField United, Albaugh, LLC, Helena Agri-Enterprises, LLC, and Aceto Agricultural Chemicals Corp. The market segmentation includes product type, grade type, application type, method type, and end-use type. The report provides a detailed analysis of the market, including trends, drivers, and challenges, as well as a forecast for the period from 2025 to 2033.

**Stuffed salmon has been recalled from Aldi stores in 3 states. Here's why**
Aldi stores in California, Arizona, and Nevada have recalled stuffed salmon due to incorrect labeling. The product, made by California's Santa Monica Seafood, contains soy, a known allergen, but the label does not mention it. According to the recall notice, 'This labeling error means that individuals with a soy allergy may unknowingly consume the product,' and 'People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to soy risk a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume this product.' The recall affects the batch with a use by/freeze by date of June 2. If you have the recalled salmon and there's no risk of someone with a soy allergy consuming it, you can continue to use it. Otherwise, return it to Aldi for a refund.

**New Labeling Regulations for Allergens on Product Labels**
From January 1, 2026, product labels will undergo significant changes, requiring manufacturers to clearly indicate allergens on packaging. This change aims to make life easier for people with allergies. Allergens are proteins in food that can trigger allergic reactions, such as eggs, fish, peanuts, nuts, mustard, and milk. Although the policy has been in effect since January 1, 2024, manufacturers have until the end of 2024 to update their labels. As a result, both 'old' and 'new' labels can be found in supermarkets. However, the new rules do not yet apply to bakeries or restaurants. Earlier, it was found that consumers with allergies should be cautious in restaurants, as over 50% of restaurants do not adequately inform customers about allergens in their food. The new regulations require manufacturers to use only two formulations when there is a risk of cross-contamination: 'May contain [allergen]' or 'Not suitable for people with a [allergen] allergy.' Previously, manufacturers were free to decide whether and how to warn about (traces of) allergens, leading to much uncertainty. This uncertainty can be life-or-death for people with allergies, as approximately 3% of the Dutch population, or over half a million people, suffer from food allergies. The new rules force manufacturers to determine whether an allergen can end up in their product. Food products can contain allergens due to ingredients or cross-contamination. A threshold value has been set, and if the amount of allergens exceeds this value, a warning is mandatory. The threshold value varies per allergen. There is a possibility that labels in English may be introduced in the future, as some top executives from PLUS and Jumbo, and a co-founder of Picnic, believe that the government should not require product labels to be in Dutch. This could help supermarkets compete with the increasing in-purchase prices of some A-brands. However, European Parliament member Malik Azmani from the VVD stated that he wants to discuss these proposals in the European Parliament, but new legislation can take 1-2 years and we are still in the early stages.'

**Kitchen staple sold at Walmart recalled as 'life-threatening' ingredient found**
Cans of beans sold at Walmart across 23 states have been recalled due to the presence of undeclared soy, a potentially life-threatening allergen. The FDA warned that consumers with a soy allergy risk serious or life-threatening allergic reactions if they consume the product. However, no illnesses or adverse reactions have been reported.

**Soy Protein Market Poised to Achieve US$ 12.84 Bn by 2032 Amid Surging Interest in Plant-Based Nutrition Worldwide**
The global soy protein market is expected to reach US$ 12.84 Bn by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 6.8% from 2025 to 2032. The market is driven by increasing consumer interest in plant-based nutrition and clean-label food products. Soy protein isolates and concentrates dominate the market due to their high protein content and adaptability in various formulations. North America and Europe are the leading regional markets, with the U.K. leading in Europe. The nutraceutical and functional food segments are rapidly adopting soy protein solutions. Environmental concerns and animal welfare advocacy are pushing consumers toward plant-based proteins. The market is expected to grow due to the increasing prevalence of lactose intolerance and veganism, as well as the functional benefits of soy protein, such as emulsification, fat absorption, and foaming. However, the market is restrained by the growing prevalence of soy intolerance and allergies, as well as processing challenges and supply chain complexities. The direct-to-consumer (D2C) model represents a significant growth opportunity for manufacturers, and the development of innovative plant-based products is also a promising opportunity.

**Global Soybean Market Expected to Reach $244.17 Billion by 2030**
The global soybean market is expected to grow from $166.4 billion in 2024 to $244.17 billion in 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.6%. Soybeans are a legume native to East Asia, rich in protein, oil, and other essential nutrients. They are widely cultivated for their seeds, which are used in various food products such as tofu, soy milk, and soy sauce, as well as animal feed. Soybean oil is a major plant-based oil used in cooking and industrial applications. Soybeans are also a primary source of plant-based protein, making them a popular ingredient in vegetarian and vegan diets. Additionally, soybeans are essential for the production of biofuels. According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), US soybean oil production increased from 11.3 million tons in 2019 to 12.28 million tons in 2023, driven by growing demand for soybean oil. The main driving factor behind the growth of the soybean market is the increasing demand for plant-based protein, particularly among consumers shifting to vegetarian, vegan, and flexitarian diets. High-quality protein-rich soybeans are a key ingredient in plant-based foods, including meat alternatives, dairy alternatives, and protein-rich snacks. The growing recognition of plant-based diets as environmentally friendly has further increased demand for soybean-based products, solidifying their position as a crucial protein source in the global food industry. However, concerns about the health risks associated with excessive soybean consumption, such as hormonal imbalance and thyroid function impairment, may impact demand in certain markets and consumer segments. Technological innovations in soybean cultivation, such as genetically modified (GM) seeds, precision agriculture, and advanced irrigation systems, have contributed significantly to the growth of the soybean market. These innovations have increased yields, made production more efficient and resilient, and reduced the use of pesticides. For example, GM soybeans are designed to be resistant to pests and diseases, reducing the need for pesticides and increasing overall productivity. Furthermore, data-driven technologies such as sensors and satellite imagery enable farmers to optimize planting, irrigation, and harvesting processes, further increasing efficiency and productivity.
