**Republicans brace for chaotic primary in competitive Iowa governor's race**
Iowa Republicans are facing a potentially contentious primary in the state's gubernatorial race, with Rep. Randy Feenstra being the first high-profile candidate to jump in. Feenstra has raised $1.1 million in the 24-hour period since launching his exploratory committee and has reserved $294,000 in television ad reservations. State Attorney General Brenna Bird is also considering a run, and could potentially secure an endorsement from President Trump, who has spoken fondly of her. Democrats are thrilled with the idea of a Republican primary, with one national Democratic operative saying it will be 'a very crowded, messy, and expensive Republican primary.' On the Democratic side, Rob Sand is seeking to get a head start, and is seen as a potentially formidable general election opponent.

**6 Democrats want to be Va.'s lieutenant governor. Here's what to know.**
Six Democrats are running in the June 17 primary to become the party's nominee for Virginia lieutenant governor. The candidates agree on many issues, including repealing Virginia's right-to-work law, increasing the minimum wage, and protecting abortion access. However, they differ on specific policies, such as their stances on gaming and education. Alex Bastani, a retired economist and lawyer, is running to the left of the other candidates, proposing a slate of pro-worker policies, including raising the minimum wage to $20 an hour and providing free college to all Virginians. State Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, a former literature professor and community college administrator, touts her six years of experience in the Senate, where she chairs the Education and Health Committee. Babur B. Lateef, a prominent Northern Virginia eye surgeon, has made opposition to a Northern Virginia casino a prominent issue and calls for eliminating skill games. State Sen. Aaron R. Rouse, a former Virginia Beach City Council member, plays up the fact that he is the only candidate who has been elected to positions in both local and state government. Victor Salgado, a former federal prosecutor, bills himself as a political outsider with the integrity to resist the influence of money in a state with some of the nation's loosest campaign finance laws. Levar Stoney, the former mayor of Richmond, talks often of his underprivileged background and positions himself as both business-friendly and committed to helping families and people in need.

**Why do Fairfax Democrats keep fighting for racism in schools?**
The US Department of Education, the US Department of Justice, and Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares have launched investigations into Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) for racial discrimination against Asian-Americans at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. The controversy surrounds the county's One Fairfax policy, which has been criticized for being self-contradictory, reducing individuals to mere expressions of a group, and promoting racial profiling. The policy aims to remove 'systemic barriers' to opportunity, but critics argue that these barriers do not exist. Superintendent Michelle Reid's goal of 'equal outcomes' for 'each and every student' has been criticized for destroying excellence and promoting mediocrity. As Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares said, 'One Fairfax is a policy that discriminates against Asian students.'

**Ivy Main: “One state that will lose big under Trump’s order [stopping approvals, permits and funding for wind projects] is Virginia, which has positioned itself to be a national leader in offshore wind deployment, supply chain and manufacturing.”**
Ivy Main, a blogger at Power for the People VA, argues that Virginia will be significantly impacted by President Trump's executive order halting wind project approvals and funding. Main notes that Virginia has positioned itself as a national leader in offshore wind deployment and manufacturing, and that the state's politicians, including Attorney General Jason Miyares and Governor Glen Youngkin, should speak out against the order to protect Virginia's interests. Main emphasizes that wind energy is not a partisan issue and that the administration's actions will cause billions of dollars in damage to the industry and lead to job losses.

**New York Attorney General Letitia James Gets Worst News Of Her Life - She's About To Regret Going After Trump**
New York Attorney General Letitia James may face severe consequences for her actions against President Donald Trump. CNN legal analyst Elie Honig stated that James's legal issues with the Trump administration are a result of her own actions, as she chose to 'weaponize the law' against the president. James sued Trump and won a $500 million verdict, but Honig argues that her theory of liability was 'flimsy' and that she made 'wildly inappropriate' out-of-court statements. Meanwhile, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte has sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy AG Todd Blanche, alleging that James 'falsified records' to secure home loans for a Virginia property she listed as her 'principal residence' in 2023. Pulte also noted that James has 'consistently misrepresented' the number of units in a Brooklyn property she purchased in 2001, and that she inaccurately identified herself and her father as 'husband and wife' in mortgage documents. 'It appears Ms. James' property and mortgage-related misrepresentations may have continued to her recent 2023 Norfolk, VA property purchase in order to secure a lower interest rate and more favorable loan terms,' Pulte wrote. Honig stated, 'James did sue Trump, of course, and won (for the moment). After a circuslike bench trial focused on Trump's habitual overvaluation of his assets in bank loan applications, New York State judge Arthur Engoron found Trump civilly liable for fraud and slammed him with damages amounting to over $500 million, including mounting interest.' However, Honig noted that James's theory of liability was 'so flimsy that it barely concealed her previously acknowledged motivation to stick one to Trump by any means available.'

**Early voting begins Friday for Virginia Primary**
Early voting for the Virginia primary election starts on Friday, May 2, and runs until June 14. There will be no primary for Governor as Republican Winsome Earl-Sears and Democrat Abigail Spanberger are running unopposed. For Attorney General, Jason Miyares is the only Republican candidate, while Democrats will choose between Jerrauld Jones and Shannon Taylor. In the Lieutenant Governor race, Republican John Reid is the only candidate, but Democrats have six options. According to Professor Karen Hult, 'They want to be sure that they make a strong showing in those races and that's why primary competition is a good way to not only mobilize the party but also draw the rest of people's attention in the same state to the other possibilities than the Republicans who have been getting most of the attention.' Hult emphasizes that local elections matter and so does your vote.

**Herrity drops out of lieutenant governor race, sets GOP ticket**
Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity has dropped out of the 2025 Republican lieutenant governor race due to ongoing health complications following heart surgery. Herrity's withdrawal clears the path for conservative talk show host John Reid to become the Republican nominee, finalizing the party's 2025 statewide ticket alongside Winsome Earl-Sears and Jason Miyares. Herrity emphasized that his priority was helping Republicans win in November and highlighted that his campaign was 'less about me and the lieutenant governor position and more about doing well in Northern Virginia so we could elect Winsome Sears as our Governor and reelect Attorney General Jason Miyares.' Reid said the GOP now has 'an early opportunity to unify behind a historic, solidly conservative, reasonable, and responsible GOP ticket' alongside Sears and Miyares.

**Herrity Drops Out Of GOP Race For VA Lt. Governor Citing Health Concerns**
Herrity has announced the end of his 2025 campaign for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia due to health concerns. After heart surgery on March 13th, Herrity has been working to regain his strength, but has come to the realization that he cannot give 150% to the campaign and still recover from his health issues. Herrity's doctors predict a full recovery, but it will be slower than anticipated. Herrity remains committed to supporting Winsome Sears' gubernatorial campaign and Jason Miyares' re-election as Attorney General, citing the importance of continuing Governor Youngkin's legacy and avoiding one-party rule in Virginia. Herrity has expressed gratitude for the support he received on the campaign trail and remains committed to serving the residents of Fairfax County as a voice of balance and common sense on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors.

**With Pat Herrity Dropping Out of the Lt. Gov. Primary, the 2025 VA GOP Ticket Is Now Set, and It’s Quite Possibly the Most Far-Right/Extreme Ever**
With Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity dropping out of the VA GOP's 2025 Lt. Governor primary for health reasons, the Republican ticket is now set with Winsome Earle-Sears for governor, John Reid for Lt. Governor, and Jason Miyares for reelection as Attorney General. This ticket is considered far-right and extreme, with Winsome Earle-Sears making several controversial comments, including comparing Brown v. Board to the quest for taxpayer-funded segregated academies, and stating that the mother is not having a lizard, she's having a human being. Democrats are calling on Republicans to disavow Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears' comments on the Richmond shooting, and EMILY's List has criticized her for spewing misinformation about reproductive rights. Former VA Lt. Governor Bill Bolling has also stated that none of the prospective Republican candidates will be able to compete with Spanberger. 'It's the guns Ms. Sears…IT'S THE GUNS! !'; 'Enough is enough. Do your damn job.'

**Big Bucks, big stakes: Virginia candidates raise over $20 Million as 2025 election season heats up - WTOP News**
Virginia candidates have raised over $20.4 million in the first quarter of 2025, with Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger leading the governor's race with $6.7 million, nearly three times more than her Republican opponent Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears' $3.1 million. In the lieutenant governor's race, 12 contenders reported a combined $2.4 million, with Republican Pat Herrity leading at $540,000. Democrats Levar Stoney and Aaron Rouse are virtually tied at just under $400,000. Fundraising is a key indicator of campaign strength and viability, and the flow of early money offers a roadmap for where parties and donors see the biggest opportunities or threats. Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, noted that Stoney's strong showing is likely helped by a familiar fundraising machine - former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who endorsed Stoney's bid early on. 'McAuliffe's greatest skill as a politician has always been fundraising. And that pipeline will be very useful to the former mayor,' he said. The race for attorney general has also attracted big money early, with incumbent Jason Miyares raising $1.5 million and former Del. Jay Jones following with $931,000. Democrat Shannon Taylor pulled in $534,000.
