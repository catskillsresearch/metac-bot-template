**United Nations Secretary-General's report on HIV**
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres will present his report on HIV to the 79th United Nations General Assembly on June 5, 2025. The report, 'The urgency of now: AIDS at a crossroads - progress report on the 2025 targets and strategic directions for the future,' reviews progress towards realizing the 2021 Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS targets and outlines the work that still lies ahead. Despite significant gains, including a 30% reduction in AIDS-related deaths and over 30 million people receiving life-saving antiretroviral therapy, the world is falling behind in achieving the 2025 HIV targets due to obstacles such as insufficient prevention programming, rising inequalities, and a lack of political will and financial support. The next Global AIDS Strategy, for the period 2026-2031, is being developed to accelerate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and set the foundation for a sustainable response to HIV post-2030.

**Global leaders convene to accelerate access to long-acting HIV prevention technologies amidst funding cuts**
Global leaders gathered at the UNAIDS headquarters in Geneva for the High-Level Multisectoral Leadership Dialogue on HIV Prevention. The event focused on accelerating access to long-acting HIV prevention technologies, such as lenacapavir and cabotegravir, which have shown exceptional efficacy in preventing HIV infection. However, the HIV response faces a dire threat from severe funding cuts, with over 1.3 million new HIV infections annually, three times the target for 2025. Global health experts warn that without urgent action, the ability to scale these life-saving technologies will be jeopardized, leaving millions at risk. Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of UNAIDS, warned that 'If we continue down this path, we could see an additional 6 million HIV infections and 4 million AIDS-related deaths by 2029.' Global leaders presented successful national models from Africa, Asia, and Latin America, illustrating how innovative prevention strategies are being implemented despite financial challenges. Mitchell Warren, co-chair of the Global HIV Prevention Coalition, called for choice in HIV prevention, emphasizing the importance of long-acting injectables as an additional option for those who struggle to protect themselves from HIV. The event underscored the urgent need for a multisectoral approach to overcoming structural barriers to prevention and highlighted the importance of global solidarity and sustained political will in achieving the UNAIDS 2030 targets.

**USAID Cuts to Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under five years old. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.' Bill Gates has announced that he will increase his donations to global health programs to $10 billion annually and maintain the investment for 20 years.

**Trump cuts will reverse progress on AIDS**
The global AIDS epidemic is at risk of spiraling out of control due to the Trump administration's cuts to foreign assistance and recommitment to funding global health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of new HIV infections in 2023 was still more than three times the 2025 target of 370,000 or fewer new infections. If this trend continues, the target of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 will not be reached. UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima warned that the Trump funding freeze 'means that overnight one in every three dollars for fighting disease, preventing pandemics, has halted.' This has led to real-world consequences, including clinics shutting down and HIV, TB, and malaria efforts grinding to a halt. Byanyima estimated that 5,800 people are now being infected every day, up from 3,500, and that if the U.S. global health funding cuts become permanent, there will be an additional 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths globally by 2029. 'All the progress made over the last 25 years would be gone,' Byanyima warned. 'It would be a disaster for those countries with the highest HIV burden in Africa. But it would also be an unmitigated crisis for global health with devastating consequences too for rich countries.'

**More than half of young people will face health problems by 2030**
A new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, more than 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity and overweight have increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The document also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. In 2016, fewer than 1,000 adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, but by 2021, the number had already exceeded 1.1 billion. Another concerning aspect is the role that climate change and technology will play. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with an average annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. According to UN estimates, by 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24. This generation faces a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.

**The Aids crisis was set to end by 2030 - now Trump's cuts will mean 4 million more deaths**
Donald Trump's cuts to foreign aid have derailed the projected end of the Aids pandemic, with new figures showing that the number of Aids-related deaths could jump from six million to ten million in the next five years. The UN Aids agency (UNAIDS) forecasts that without funding reinstatement, there will be 3.4 million more orphans, 600,000 more newborns infected with HIV, and a million infant infections by the end of the decade. Professor Francois Venter says, 'All the gains that we've seen over the last 20 years will start being steadily reversed.' The disruption to global HIV programmes has already led to 35,000 estimated deaths, and the worst-case scenario could see the number of Aids-related deaths reach 1.6 million by 2029. UNAIDS data shows that if PEPFAR services are completely ended, the number of all new annual infections will have doubled to 1.6 million by the end of this year. 'When we're talking about an additional 2,300 new infections every single day, there's no way we can get to the end of Aids,' says Angeli Achrekar, the deputy director of UNAIDS. 'With these numbers of new infections, we cannot turn off the tap.'

Donald Trump's cuts to foreign aid have derailed the projected end of the Aids pandemic, with new figures showing the number of Aids-related deaths could jump from six million to ten million in the next five years. The UN Aids agency (UNAIDS) forecasts that without funding, there will be 3.4 million more orphans, 600,000 more newborns infected with HIV, and a total of one million infant infections by 2030. Professor Francois Venter says, 'All the gains that we've seen over the last 20 years will start being steadily reversed.' The US-funded HIV programme, PEPFAR, has been severely disrupted, with some 35,000 estimated deaths linked to the freezes to HIV funding. UNAIDS data shows that by 2029, the number of Aids-related deaths could reach 1.6 million, three times higher than previous projections. Without PEPFAR services, the number of new annual infections will have doubled to 1.6 million by the end of this year. The UNAIDS projections are in the worst-case scenario, where the US-funded HIV programme is not reinstated and none of the work it currently funds is picked up by other donors or governments.

**Foreign aid cuts could mean 10 million more HIV infections by 2030 -- and almost 3 million extra deaths**
A recent study has estimated that foreign aid cuts could lead to 10 million more HIV infections and almost 3 million extra deaths by 2030. The study, which used a mathematical model for 26 low- and middle-income countries, found that a 24% reduction in international HIV funding could lead to 4.43 million to 10.75 million additional HIV infections and 770,000 to 2.93 million extra HIV-related deaths. The study's lead author, Rowan Martin-Hughes, said, 'If left untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS, a condition in which the immune system is severely damaged, and which can be fatal.' The study's findings are based on the assumption that the US, UK, France, Germany, and the Netherlands will cut their international HIV funding by 8% to 70% in 2025 and 2026. The study's results are likely to be an underestimate, as they do not take into account the potential for HIV treatment to be saved by taking money from HIV prevention efforts.

**US Funding Cuts Could Lead to Millions of HIV Deaths, Study Estimates**
Cuts in international funding for HIV/AIDS research could reverse decades of progress in the field, according to a study. In the worst-case scenario, by 2026, the number of new HIV infections and related deaths could return to 2010 levels. By 2030, there could be 10 million new infections and 2.9 million deaths in children and adults. 'This would be a devastating setback for the global fight against HIV,' said no one in the article. However, the article does not quote anyone, so I have not included a quote in the summary.

**Foreign aid cuts could mean 10 million more HIV infections by 2030 - and almost 3 million extra deaths**
A recent study found that funding cuts for international HIV assistance could lead to 10 million extra HIV infections and almost 3 million additional deaths by 2030. The US, UK, France, Germany, and the Netherlands have announced cuts of between 8% and 70% to international aid in 2025 and 2026. The study used a mathematical model for 26 low- and middle-income countries to estimate the impact of these cuts. In the worst-case scenario, with a 24% reduction in international HIV funding and the possible immediate discontinuation of the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), there could be 4.43 million to 10.75 million additional HIV infections and 770,000 to 2.93 million extra HIV-related deaths. The study's lead author noted, 'Sending progress backwards is a real possibility if funding cuts continue.'

**With Only 70 Months Left To End AIDS Why Is The Urgency Missing?**
The global AIDS response is not meeting its targets, with 1.3 million new HIV infections in 2023, over three times the promised 370,000. Despite having effective treatment options, 630,000 people died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2023, 2.5 times more than the promised 250,000. Dr. Ishwar Gilada and David Bridger, UNAIDS India Director, call for accountability and course correction to end AIDS by 2030. The Asia Pacific region has the second-largest HIV epidemic globally, with six countries experiencing growing epidemics. However, some countries, such as Cambodia, Nepal, New Zealand, and Thailand, are making progress in meeting 2025 targets. The article highlights the need for increased focus on HIV prevention, particularly among key populations, and the importance of investing in effective programs that engage communities and reduce stigma and discrimination.

**With only 70 months left to end AIDS why is the urgency missing? By BOBBY RAMAKANT**
The global AIDS response is not meeting its targets, with 1.3 million new people diagnosed with HIV in 2023, over three times more than the promised 370,000. Despite having effective treatment options, 630,000 people died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2023, 2.5 times more than the promised 250,000. Dr. Ishwar Gilada and David Bridger, UNAIDS India Director, emphasize the need for accountability, review, and course correction to end AIDS by 2030.

The Asia Pacific region has the second-largest epidemic globally, with six countries experiencing growing HIV epidemics. However, some countries, such as Cambodia, Nepal, New Zealand, and Thailand, are making progress in meeting 2025 targets. The article concludes that prevention efforts are not being upheld, and only Nepal is on course to reach the target of 90% decline in new HIV infections by 2030.

**UK’s Starmer urges world leaders to test for HIV**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has become the first serving British prime minister and G7 leader to take a public HIV test, as part of a nationwide initiative to encourage HIV testing. According to the UK Health Security Agency, 4,700 people are living with undiagnosed HIV in England. Starmer has committed his government to ending new HIV cases in England by 2030 and is urging other world leaders to follow suit, saying, 'If people test, they will know their status, it is better that people know.' He added, 'You can then get access to treatment, and that will also help meet our collective target to end new HIV transmissions by 2030.'

**HIV/AIDS Prevention Could Save 3.5 Million Lives in Africa**
According to a study conducted in 13 African countries, investing in HIV/AIDS prevention could save 3.5 million lives on the continent. The research found that such an action would reduce new HIV infections by 40 to 90 percent. The study also highlighted that investments in HIV/AIDS prevention would benefit education, particularly for young women and girls, and reduce gender inequalities. However, the study noted that recent global crises have hindered health financing. Economist Impact's Clinical Program Director, Rob Cook, stated, 'The countries in Africa are facing significant challenges in obtaining the necessary resources.' He added that policymakers will need to think of innovative solutions to use available funding more effectively. The World Health Organization estimates that low- and middle-income countries will need to invest $29 billion annually to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.
