**Peruvian Government Approves Plan to Modernize National Police Equipment**
The Peruvian government has approved the Strategic Plan for Modernization, Repotenciación, Renovation, Replacement, and Repair of the Equipment of the National Police of Peru (PEME 2025-2030), which aims to strengthen the logistical and operational capabilities of the PNP over the next five years. The plan includes the renovation of armament and logistics, and has been classified as a reserved document due to the sensitive information it contains regarding the acquisition of strategic equipment. According to the resolution, the plan was previously presented to the Council of Security and Defense National, which approved it on April 23, 2025. The plan is based on various legal frameworks, including the Organic Law of the Executive Power (Law 29158) and the law that creates the Fund for the Armed Forces and National Police (Law 28455).

**The Justice Department shouldn't abandon police oversight | Patricia Lopez**
The Justice Department is withdrawing from a consent decree in Minneapolis, which was established to reform the police department after the murder of George Floyd. This move is part of a broader retreat from federal involvement in police oversight, with the department also pulling out of similar decrees in Louisville, Kentucky, and closing investigations into police abuses in several other cities. President Donald Trump has labeled the consent decrees a 'war on police,' and his Justice Department is now following through on this rhetoric. However, experts argue that the decrees are necessary to address patterns of police misconduct and rebuild community trust. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey says that the city will continue to implement reforms, despite the Justice Department's withdrawal.

**6 In 10 Americans Fear Social Security Will Vanish Before They Retire, As 2033 Insolvency Clock Ticks Louder - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)**
A recent survey by DepositAccounts found that 59% of working-age Americans fear that Social Security will not exist by the time they retire, with 70% of Generation X sharing this concern. The anxiety is driven by the program's main trust fund's depletion in 2033, which would leave incoming payroll taxes covering only 79% of promised checks. Jaime Eckels, a certified-financial-planner, warned that the countdown has moved from abstract to immediate for many savers, saying, 'It's not that far away. We're creeping up on it.' However, not all gauges are as bleak, with the 2025 Retirement Confidence Survey finding that about half of workers remain at least 'somewhat confident' that the government will pay benefits of equal value to today's. Despite this, 60% of workers worry about cuts to Social Security benefits. Analysts stress that insolvency does not equal disappearance, with LendingTree's Matt Schulz saying, 'The truth is that it's highly, highly unlikely Social Security 'won't be available.'

**Round One of I-35 “Caps” Fight Ends in a Draw**
The first round in the City Hall fight over the future of I-35 has ended in a draw. The city council voted 8-2-1 to approve a $104 million package for structural support columns along the highway through Central Austin. Council members Paige Ellis said, 'It appears both subquorums have been able to wiggle a little bit. It's clear that everybody wants to see the beautification of our community and wants to be able to include really important generational investments over I-35. We're just trying to balance competing needs [and] make sure that every dollar stretches as far as possible.' The city has six years to pay the Texas Department of Transportation for the full $104 million cost of the roadway elements. The first payment of $15.6 million is due at the end of 2026, with more chunks each year until 2033. Council will study all available financing options to pay the balance of their $104 million commitment, aiming to avoid dipping into too much of the city's debt capacity. Private philanthropy is hoped to account for a significant amount of these costs, but so far, no group or individual has stepped up to provide it.

**NYC homicides and shootings drop to record lows so far in 2025, officials say**
New York City has recorded its fewest homicides and shootings in decades, with 112 killings and 264 shootings through May, according to Mayor Eric Adams and NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The numbers represent a significant decrease from previous years, with a 30% drop in homicides and a 20% drop in shootings compared to the same timeframe in 2024. Adams attributed the improvement to the police's focus on removing guns from the streets and using data to improve officer deployments. Tisch credited aggressive enforcement against illegal firearms and a data-driven policing strategy for the reduction in shootings and homicides. Adams said, 'These numbers represent thousands of New Yorkers who are alive today and safer today, families who can sleep more soundly at night, and communities that are thriving because they know their city isn't just coming back from the throes of the pandemic -- it is back.' Tisch added, 'Results like this never happen by accident, and certainly not at a time when the state's criminal justice laws have made a revolving door out of our criminal justice system. We will not let up.'

**COP30: A New Era for Climate Diplomacy?**
The COP30 climate conference will take place in Belém, Brazil, from November 10 to 21, 2025. Ten years after the Paris Agreement, countries will present their national contributions and adaptation plans for the period 2025-2035. The conference will be led by diplomat Andréa Corrêa do Lago, who aims to give a new breath to multilateralism through climate cooperation. The Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva also sees the COP as an opportunity to position Brazil as a 'climate leader' globally and in the South. Eve-Anne Bühler, a geography professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, notes that the COP30 is a 'green showcase' for Brazil, allowing it to highlight its environmental protection efforts. The country has made progress in reducing deforestation, but the fight against climate change is hindered by the resistance of agro-business actors. 'The COP 30 is a 'vitrine verte' for the Brazilian state, allowing it to value its efforts in environmental protection,' said Eve-Anne Bühler. 'And the progress is palpable: in 2024, deforestation slowed down in all ecosystems of the country, a first since 2019.'

**Russian Railways Plans to Abandon Foreign Software by 2030**

**Tournefeuille to Arm Municipal Police as Burglaries Decrease**
The town of Tournefeuille, near Toulouse, has seen a decrease in crime, particularly burglaries, which were at an average of one per day in 2022. The town was ranked as the most burglarized town in France that year. Despite this decrease, the mayor, Frédéric Parre, wants to train 11 municipal police officers to carry firearms by 2026, primarily for deterrent purposes. The measure is well-received by the residents, who are concerned about home invasions. 'It's a good initiative. I feel safer here than in Colomiers, there are fewer people loitering in the streets,' said Josselyne, a retiree. However, some residents are skeptical about the effectiveness of the measure, with one resident stating, 'We're making a big speech about insecurity, it's just to justify a right-wing list for the 2026 municipal elections.' Others, like Pauline, do not see the need for armed police, saying, 'I don't think it's necessary. We don't see patrols. If burglaries decrease, it's because people are better equipped.'

'We will continue to work tirelessly to address this issue and prevent further attacks on our officers.'

**Kelowna to study potential switch from RCMP to municipal policing - Okanagan | Globalnews.ca**
The City of Kelowna, B.C., is hiring a consultant to review the pros and cons of transitioning from the RCMP to a municipal police force. The review, which will cost $250,000, is a response to the RCMP policing contract set to expire in 2032 and the city's growing policing costs, which have more than doubled to $57 million for 2025. Kelowna Mayor Tom Dyas said, 'As Kelowna continues to grow rapidly, and with the RCMP policing contract for municipalities set to expire in 2032, this review is a responsible step to ensure we are delivering the best value to taxpayers and planning effectively for the future needs of our city.' Residents seem open to exploring the idea, but local businesses have mixed views on the potential switch. According to the RCMP report, property crime went down by two per cent in 2024, but organizations representing local businesses report a different story, with vandalism, shoplifting, and break-ins remaining a concern. The study is expected to be completed early 2026.

San Diego's City Council voted to advance an ordinance banning AI software used for setting rental prices, which could save renters over $2,000 annually. In Greater Boston, home prices rose 3.3% in March, but the number of homes on the market surged, suggesting a potential recovery from a three-year housing slump. Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker announced that over 75% of the proposed $800 million Housing Opportunities Made Easy (HOME) Initiative bond would fund seven key housing programs. Seattle and King County officials are urging the state to allocate funds to continue supporting the Encampment Resolution Program, a highly regarded initiative to address homelessness. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the Washington Commanders announced a $3.7 billion deal to redevelop the dilapidated RFK Stadium site into a new stadium.

Nine candidates have filed to run for Detroit mayor, with candidates ranging from current and former City Council members to a former police chief, an attorney, and a local faith leader. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams gained support from three major unions and State Attorney General Letitia James, challenging former Governor Andrew Cuomo's dominance in the Democratic race. A new zoning amendment would ban new tobacco and hemp shops within 1,000 feet of schools, residences, and other sensitive areas in Richmond to safeguard public health. Mayor Scott announced a strategy to deter violence by engaging youth with summer programs, curfews, and extended recreation center hours, resulting in significant drops in violent crime since its launch in 2023. Chicago Alderman Brian Hopkins introduced a proposal that would give the Chicago Police Department the power to declare temporary curfews for unaccompanied minors. Richmond Mayor Danny Avula announced the establishment of an Office of Gun Violence Prevention to build community relationships and reduce gun violence.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson is considering layoffs and service cuts to address the anticipated $1.12 billion budget shortfall and loss of $3 billion in federal funding. The Detroit City Council recently commissioned a study that would determine whether or not tax options, such as an amusement tax, would be viable for the City. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass' proposed budget includes 1,600 layoffs to address a nearly $1 billion deficit in the upcoming fiscal year. Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell is proposing a $1.3 billion property tax increase over six years to fund preschool, daycare, community college tuition, and K-12 programs. Mayor Bowser plans to increase funding for childcare cost reduction and preschool teacher salaries, with a total of $175.5 million allocated to early education programs, pending approval from the D.C. Council and Congress. The Trump administration threatened to withhold federal funding for New York City highway projects if the MTA does not comply with U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Secretary Sean Duffy's order to shut down Manhattan's congestion pricing tolls, or justify their legality under federal law, by May 21. The New York City Council passed bills restricting helicopter use, particularly for tourist flights. One bill bans 'non-essential' flights from City-owned heliports unless they meet strict federal noise standards, exempting law enforcement, medical, and other specific uses. The Philadelphia City Council will consider legislation proposing setting aside 0.5% of the City's general fund to permanently finance the Zero Fare program, which offers free SEPTA passes to low-income residents. If approved, the matter will be decided by voters in November.

The policy focuses on making roads safer for pedestrians, bicyclists, and automobiles. According to Pensacola Police Department Chief Eric Randall, 'Vision Zero is working to make roads a lot safer in all aspects, where you got multi-modes of travel, you got pedestrians, bicyclists and automobiles, as well as motorcycles.' The initiative includes infrastructure upgrades, such as reducing lane sizes, and increased enforcement, including red light cameras and traffic enforcement. Randall notes that areas with recent upgrades, such as Palafox, Main, and Cervantes streets, have seen a decrease in fatal traffic accidents.

**Bipartisan federal bill seeks to boost support for smaller police forces**
A bipartisan Congressional bill, the Invest to Protect Act of 2025 (H.R. 2177), aims to provide support for small and medium-sized police departments with fewer than 175 officers. The bill would create a dedicated fund for these departments to use for recruiting, training, and retaining police officers, as well as investing in officers' mental health. According to Rep. Eric Sorensen (D-Ill.), 'It is an investment by the federal government to protect our law enforcement.' The bill has a proposed cap of $50 million per fiscal year from 2017 to 2031. Sorensen believes the bill is non-partisan and can help bring people together, saying, 'I really don't think that's a partisan issue. I don't think that's a left or a right issue.'

**Solar Panel Owners Feel Betrayed by Government's Decision to Abolish Net Metering System**
Homeowners with solar panels feel betrayed by the government, as the 'salderingsregeling' (net metering system) will be abolished from January 1, 2027. This means that homeowners can no longer offset their energy production against their consumption. According to Amber Kortzorg, presenter of the program 'Kassa', '3 million households have solar panels, it has been very hard'. The government wants to encourage households to consume less energy and produce more, but this decision has left many feeling frustrated. A survey by RTL Nieuws found that 69% of solar panel owners feel betrayed by the government, while 61% are concerned about whether they will ever be able to recoup their investment. Kortzorg said, 'The promise was that it would be phased out, but the previous cabinet spoke of 2031, and from 2025, it would be phased out. However, no one could have seen this coming.' Gerard Joling, a guest on the talk show, concluded, 'In five years, this will all be abolished, and we'll have something new to talk about.'

**Alabama city divided over whether to abolish police department...**
The city of Hanceville, Alabama is divided over whether to abolish its police department, which has been accused of having a 'rampant culture of corruption.' A grand jury indicted four officers and the police chief on various charges, including mishandling evidence, and recommended that the department be 'immediately abolished.' Residents are split on how to balance public safety with the need to address misconduct. Some expressed concerns about how the city would be protected without a local police department, while others said that misconduct predates the recent scandal. 'The actions of a few has shaken the very trust between law enforcement and the people they were meant to protect,' said Robert Powell, a lifelong resident and civics teacher. The grand jury also found that departmental negligence played a role in the April 2024 death of a dispatcher who died from a suspected drug overdose. City clerk Tania Wilcox said that she complained about corruption allegations in the police department five months before the dispatcher's death, but nothing was done until after the death. 'I have had my life threatened over what went on at this police department,' Wilcox said. Many residents testified to the city council about ways that some officers had undermined trust through excessive force and harassment before the indictments.

**Grand jury recommends abolishing Alabama police department because of 'corruption'**
A grand jury in Alabama has recommended abolishing the Hanceville Police Department due to a 'rampant culture of corruption'. Five officers, including Police Chief Jason Marlin, have been indicted on various charges, including mishandling evidence and drug-related crimes. The grand jury found that the department's evidence room was not secure, and a dispatcher's death in 2024 was linked to departmental negligence. Cullman County District Attorney Champ Crocker said, 'This is a sad day for law enforcement, but at the same time it is a good day for the rule of law.' Hanceville Mayor Jimmy Sawyer stated that the City Council will consider the grand jury's recommendations and will 'act swiftly and decisively to address the problems within the police department.' The city has a population of 3,200 people. According to the grand jury, the department has operated as a 'criminal enterprise' rather than a law enforcement agency. Three of the officers were charged with drug-related crimes, and one officer was charged with providing hydrocodone and steroids to others. The grand jury found that the department's negligence played a role in the dispatcher's death. 'Nothing was secure about the evidence room,' Crocker said. The grand jury also found that there was 'unfettered access' to the evidence room, with a hole in the wall and a green broomstick used to 'jimmy open' the door. The charges include accusations of mishandling or removing evidence from the department's evidence room.

**Malaga to Abolish Horse-Drawn Carriages by 2025**
The city of Malaga has decided to abolish the practice of using horses to pull tourist carriages, citing the welfare of the animals and the lack of space for the carriages to circulate. The decision comes after years of criticism from animal rights activists and a growing public opinion against the practice. 'It's very hot and stressful for the horses,' said Concordia Marquez, founder of the animal shelter Tutti i cavalli del mondo. 'They have to make huge journeys and then return to work.' The city had initially planned to phase out the practice by 2035, but has accelerated the process. The remaining 25 licenses will be revoked, but some carriages may continue to operate during special events and festivals. 'We want to prioritize the welfare of the animals and make Malaga a more sustainable and tourist-friendly city,' said María Trinidad Hernandez, the city's mobility advisor.
