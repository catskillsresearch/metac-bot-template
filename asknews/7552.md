**Greenpeace removes wax statue of Macron over French trade with Russia**
Greenpeace activists removed a wax statue of French President Emmanuel Macron from the Grevin Museum in Paris and placed it in front of the Russian embassy to protest against French business ties with Russia and lack of stronger climate action. Greenpeace stated that Macron 'does not deserve to be exhibited in this world-renowned cultural institution until he has terminated French contracts with Russia and driven an ambitious and sustainable ecological transition across Europe.' The activists entered the museum as regular visitors and took the statue without confrontation, citing careful planning. Greenpeace France director Jean-Francois Julliard said, 'We do not deny the political, diplomatic, and financial support of France and Europe for Ukraine, but we cannot continue to import massive amounts of gas, chemical fertilisers, and uranium from Russia.' The European Union is working to reduce its dependence on Russian gas, but some imports are tied to long-term contracts lasting up to 2041.

**Man Found Dead with Severe Burns in Stone Mountain Park Identified as Suicide**
The body of a man found with severe burns in a mountainous area outside Atlanta, USA, was determined to be a suicide. Initially, investigators thought the person had been murdered, but further information from the victim's parents revealed the truth. The body was found in Stone Mountain Park, a popular tourist destination located about 24 kilometers from Atlanta's city center. The park features giant sculptures of three Confederate leaders: Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and Stonewall Jackson. According to John Bankhead, the park's spokesperson, 'It's the first time I've seen something like this.' He added that the agents who responded to the scene found the body 'severely burned.' The body was taken to the DeKalb County Medical Examiner's Office and is being investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

**Ufa Square to be Closed for Monument Reconstruction**
The square in front of the Congress Hall in Ufa will be closed for the reconstruction of the monument to Salavat Yulayev, a cultural heritage site of federal significance, from June 30, 2025, to October 2027, said Vice-Premier of the Government of Bashkortostan Rustom Gazizov. The reconstruction will be carried out in three stages. The first stage, which will last until September of this year, will involve preparatory work. The 40-ton monument will be disassembled, and the restoration of the bronze statue will be carried out in a specialized workshop in Ufa. The second stage, scheduled for October 2025 to April 2027, will include the restoration of the monument. The final stage will be the reconstruction of the fountain and the landscaping of the square. 'The last reconstruction of the square was 20 years ago, so it needs to be updated,' Gazizov said. The monument will be reopened in October 2027, in time for the 60th anniversary of its creation by sculptor Soslanbek Tavasiev. The entire process will be monitored by a public commission and the Russian Academy of Arts. 'The state of the monument has been analyzed by experts for two years. The age, atmospheric influence, and technological features have led to the fact that the monument urgently needs restoration,' said Bashkir President Radiy Khabirov.

Lee, President Jefferson Davis, and General Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson.

**Hiker makes grisly discovery at Georgia's Stone Mountain Park**
A hiker discovered the badly burned body of a young man in a rock crevice at Georgia's Stone Mountain State Park on Saturday morning. Authorities are investigating the death, and an autopsy will be performed on Monday. The body was found about 100 yards from the park's Summit Skyride cable car, and personal items at the scene suggest the victim's identity. Stone Mountain Park has been the site of controversy over the years, including a shooting incident earlier this year in which a gunman fatally shot himself. 'The largest high relief sculpture in the world,' the park depicts massive carvings of Confederate leaders, but has been the subject of protests both for and against it.

**Dragon Mountain Stone Monument to be Returned to Original Location**
The 'Dragon Mountain Stone Monument' in Tainan's same-heart park has been relocated to the park for over 50 years. The monument was originally set up in 1935 by the Japanese-owned 'Taiwan Sugar Corporation' to commemorate the opening of the Lungan Sugar Factory. After the factory was closed in 1968, the monument was relocated to the same-heart park in Taitung. Recently, the residents of Chaozhou have requested to return the monument to its original location. According to Chen Shizong, the general manager of the Chaozhou Dragon Mountain Development Association, the monument was originally set up on a hilltop in Lungan to commemorate the opening of the sugar factory. The factory produced high-quality white sugar until it was closed in 1968. The monument was relocated to the same-heart park in 1975. The residents of Chaozhou hope to return the monument to its original location to enrich the local sugar industry culture. After a meeting with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation and the Tainan County Government, it was decided to return the monument to its original location. Chen Shizong suggested that the monument be returned to the old Lungan Sugar Factory site, where a water pump and sugar factory ruins are located. The monument will be returned on October 18, which is the 90th anniversary of the sugar factory's opening. A replica of the monument will be set up in the same-heart park to explain the history of the sugar industry.

**Chernihiv's 'Alley of Victory' Monument Sparks Debate Over Soviet and Imperial Symbols**
A stone monument in Chernihiv's Bolodynsky Hills features a Russian-language inscription 'Alleya Pobedi' (Alley of Victory), which was installed in 1984. Despite being a prohibited symbol of Soviet and imperial policy, it remains in place. Chernihiv resident and activist Alexander Babich has called for its removal, stating, 'Ukraine and all things Ukrainian were destroyed by them, and they continue to destroy them today.' The monument is considered a 100% symbol of Soviet rule, and its removal is in line with the country's laws on decommunization. However, the issue remains unresolved, with the Chernihiv City Council and the National Architectural and Historical Reserve 'Chernihiv Ancient' unable to agree on who should be responsible for its removal. Sergiy Butko, a representative of the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory in Chernihiv Oblast, has also called for the monument's removal, stating, 'This is a symbol of Russian imperial policy, and it must be removed from public space.'

**'Whose Heritage?' report spotlights 'triumphs'**
The recent 'Whose Heritage?' report by Rivka Maizlish highlights the 'triumphs' in the fight to remove 'Lost Cause' memorials, which glorify segregationists, insurrectionists, and racists. Maizlish said, 'I think -- and that's me being optimistic -- we have our work cut out for us.' The report notes that the 'Lost Cause' narrative obscures the true heritage of the Deep South, which includes abolitionists and civil rights heroes from the South, both Black and white. The report also includes a community action guide for those who want to remove memorials in their communities. Despite the White House's efforts to have Confederate monuments returned, the orders are not laws and apply only to those monuments that have been removed from federal property. James Grossman, executive director of the American Historical Association, said, 'We've accomplished this. So that's a resource.' Grossman also noted that the success in documenting and spreading facts has caused a shift in the way opponents now stage their assaults on history. Sherman Neal II, who documented the effort to have the Calloway County Courthouse statue removed, said, 'We've had victories. Now in contrast to Stone Mountain, in Decatur, Georgia, they got rid of a Confederate statue and replaced it with one of [civil rights leader and late U.S. Rep.] John Lewis.'

**Removed Confederate Monuments in Maryland to Remain Hidden, Despite Trump Executive Order**
Despite President Donald Trump's executive order to restore Confederate monuments, the statues removed from Maryland will remain hidden. The monuments, including the Captain John O'Donnell statue, were taken down in 2017 and 2020-2021, and are now in storage or part of a museum exhibit in California. According to Maryland Gov. Wes Moore's spokesperson, Carter Elliott, the monuments will not be returning to their former locations, citing that they were removed before Trump's executive order's specified date. The order only applies to monuments taken down after January 1, 2020, and only those under federal control. The monuments were removed due to protests and vandalism, and some have been relocated to historic battlefields or storage. The statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee at the Antietam National Battlefield remains, but a bill to remove it was introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives but failed to pass. 'Whether or not the plaque qualifies under the president's executive order, it will not be returning to the State House,' Elliott wrote in an email to The Baltimore Sun.

**Israeli Army Demolishes Christian Monument in Southern Lebanon**
The Israeli army has demolished a Christian monument in the southern part of Lebanon, during the celebration of the 'Palm Sunday' which is the Sunday before Easter. The incident was reported by the former Lebanese Minister of Labor Mustafa Bayram, who shared images of Israeli soldiers using a bulldozer to demolish the monument. Bayram stated, 'The Zionist enemy is destroying a monument, one of the symbols of religious sanctity in southern Lebanon.' He added, 'Israel is filming the demolition to prove its hostility to everything that is not it.' The official Lebanese news agency NNA also reported the incident, stating, 'The enemy Israel has demolished the statue of Saint Yorgi in the city of Yaroun as part of its violations against Lebanon.' Despite the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon on November 27, 2024, Israel frequently violates the agreement. The Israeli army maintains its presence in five areas, including the hills of Hamamis, Aziyya, Uveyda, the mountain of Balat, and the hill of Lebbune, despite the withdrawal clause in the ceasefire agreement. At least 100 people were killed and over 300 people were injured in the attacks organized by the Israeli army after the conclusion of the ceasefire agreement.

**A new push to change Georgia law concerning Stone Mountain's Confederate monument**
The Stone Mountain Action Coalition is pushing for a change in Georgia law to make the park more inclusive. The group wants to replace the Confederate monument with exhibits that educate visitors about the natural history of the mountain and its environment. Marcus Patton, a member of the coalition, says the current monument is a 'manmade blemish' and that the park should focus on its natural beauty. Parker Short, a Georgia native, has also called for the park to be transformed into a museum that tells the full story of Georgia's Civil War and Civil Rights history. The Stone Mountain Memorial Association has already taken steps to address the park's past, including the construction of an $11 million 'Truth Telling' center.
