**Nobel Laureates Warn of 20-Year Research Setback Under Trump Administration**
Three American Nobel laureates, Guido Imbens (Economics, 2021), Douglas Diamond (Economics, 2022), and Charles Rice (Medicine, 2020), along with Duncan Haldane (Physics, 2016), expressed their concerns that the Trump administration could cause a 20-year setback in research. They stated that the lack of government support for universities is a 'huge problem' and that the attack on the independence of institutions like Harvard is also affecting other national health institutes. Diamond said, 'The lack of support from the government is a huge problem.' Imbens expressed his 'disappointment' with the treatment of the higher education system, and Rice stated that the attack on the 'independence' of Harvard as an 'icon of research and study' also affects other institutions. They all agreed that the situation needs to be solved as soon as possible. They emphasized the importance of educating children at a young age about the value of science, as they believe that the distrust in science has been growing for 20 years and has its roots in the past.

**The Unfulfilled Happiness of Madame Curie**
Baldomero Vásquez reflects on the life of Madame Curie, who remained uncorrupted by fame. He notes that her happiness was tied to her work and recognition, including becoming the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911. Her daughter Irene, who also became a scientist, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935, a year after her mother's death. Vásquez quotes Karen Horney, saying, 'La vida hay que tomarla como viene' (Life must be taken as it comes). He laments that Madame Curie's life's work remains inaccessible due to the radioactive materials she handled, which will remain hazardous for at least 1,500 years.

**The Nobel Error: Rewarding a Placeholder**
The 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Saul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt, and Adam G. Riess for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe through observations of distant supernovae. However, this was a mistake, as the prize was awarded for supernova data, not the actual discovery of dark energy. Dark energy is an invisible, unknown force accounting for 68% of the universe's energy, but it has never been observed and is simply a placeholder term for a mathematical discrepancy. The author argues that this is not science, but rather branding, and that the field has prematurely decided the question is closed, ignoring alternative models that account for the same observational data without invoking dark energy. The accelerating expansion is an assumption based on the misapplication of static-frame models to dynamic structures, and dark energy is a signal that the model is incomplete. The author concludes that a Nobel Prize should never be awarded for naming a ghost.

**Jensen Huang: 'If I were a student today, I would learn AI'**
Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said, 'If I were a student today, the first thing I would do is learn AI.' Geoffrey Hinton, Nobel laureate in Physics 2024, stated, 'Artificial Intelligence is on track to replace computer science teachers due to its ability to teach.' Despite concerns and fears about the future of AI, understanding how it works is crucial to addressing these issues. Many experts advocate for studying AI, given its vast potential in various fields, including healthcare. In an interview with Cleo Abram, Jensen Huang emphasized the importance of learning AI, saying, 'If I were a student today, I would learn AI.' He also noted that new models and interfaces will become increasingly present in university careers in the coming decades. AI is driving changes in all sectors, providing companies with tools and algorithms to improve their work, from voice recognition and recommendations to medical diagnosis and supply chain management. As a result, many jobs are incorporating AI, making it essential to understand its functioning and complexity.

**Barry Barish: 'Dedicating one's life to science is one of the greatest privileges'**
Barry Barish, the 2017 Nobel Physics laureate, said, 'Dedicating one's life to science is one of the greatest privileges.' He emphasized the need for more investment and ethical regulation in science, particularly in the face of new challenges like artificial intelligence. Barish, who was born in Omaha, Nebraska, to Jewish immigrant parents, initially wanted to be a science fiction writer but was drawn to the scientific community in California. He studied physics at the University of California and earned his Ph.D. in 1963. Barish's work on the LIGO observatory led to the detection of gravitational waves predicted by Einstein in 2015. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics two years later, along with Kip Thorne and Rainer Weiss. Barish believes that the detection of gravitational waves was like 'putting on new glasses to look at the universe.' He said, 'We only see 4% of the universe with traditional telescopes. Gravitational waves allow us to observe what doesn't emit light.' Barish dedicated 20 years to developing the technology that made the detection possible, saying, 'It wasn't my life's goal, but it became my priority.' The LIGO project cost over $1 billion and took years to produce results, but Barish believes that making science every day is a privilege and a challenge. He emphasized the importance of international collaboration in science, saying, 'Science has no borders. We use the same equations, share bibliography. We maintain our identities, but work in community.' Barish also highlighted the need for clear ethical regulation in the face of technological advancements like artificial intelligence, saying, 'We share the same pleasures, the same culture. If we did it in society, it would work much better.' He concluded by saying, 'I don't know if gravitational waves will have practical applications, but basic science curiosity has led to advances like antibiotics and magnetic resonance imaging.'

**George E. Smith, Nobel laureate who envisioned digital imagery, dies at 95**
George E. Smith, a Nobel laureate and researcher at Bell Labs, passed away on May 28 at the age of 95. Smith, along with Willard S. Boyle, envisioned the concept of digital photography and the charge-coupled device (CCD), which was honored with a Nobel Prize in physics in 2009. Their work, based on Albert Einstein's photoelectric effect, allowed for the transformation of light into electronic signals. The CCD technology, initially developed for a proposed video phone, later led to the creation of digital cameras, and has since been used in various fields such as astronomy, undersea exploration, and image-guided surgeries. 'Masters of light,' said the Nobel statement, their work helped build 'the foundation to our modern information society.' Dr. Smith retired from Bell Labs in 1986 and spent 17 years traveling the world in a sailboat with his partner, Janet Murphy. He was awarded $250,000 as part of the Nobel Prize, but said his sailboat, Apogee, could use some sprucing up.

**Maurice Allais: The French Physicist Who Found a Way to Combat Global Crises and Won the Nobel Prize in Economics**
Maurice Allais, a French physicist, found a way to combat global crises and received the Nobel Prize in Economics. Allais' paradox, also known as the 'Allais paradox,' is a thought experiment that challenges the idea of rational decision-making in economics. Allais' work laid the foundation for the work of post-war French economists, but his tendency to work in isolation and publish primarily in French led to many of his original ideas being independently rediscovered and popularized by English-speaking economists. As Allais himself said, 'The golden rule is to be careful not to be too careful.' Allais' work continues to influence economic thought, particularly in the areas of globalization and monetary policy.

**Nobel Laureate Criticizes Climate Research, Claims Clouds are Key to Climate Stability**
Nobel laureate John F. Clauser, a quantum physicist, has criticized the current state of climate research, stating that the scientific exchange has been lost. Clauser, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2022, claims that there is no climate crisis and that rising CO2 concentrations would actually benefit the world. He argues that the 'dramatic temperature-stabilizing feedback through clouds' is not considered in current climate models, which would reflect the radiation effect of CO2 50 times stronger. Clauser explains that clouds are formed through the evaporation of seawater due to sunlight and cover a third to two-thirds of the Earth's surface, reflecting a significant portion of the incoming solar energy back into space before it can warm the surface. He also cites the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the US National Academy of Sciences, which have acknowledged that the effects of clouds on the climate are the 'greatest uncertainty' for their predictions. Clauser warns that the 'corruption of science' in the climate debate is a 'dangerous narrative' that threatens the world economy and the well-being of billions of people. He believes that the misguided climate science has become a 'massive pseudoscience' that has become a scapegoat for various unrelated problems, and that the real problem is the provision of an adequate standard of living for the growing world population, particularly due to the energy crisis caused by the false climate science.

**Geoffrey Hinton, the "Godfather of AI," said that hitting on good ideas is easier if you're a contrarian.**
Geoffrey Hinton, known as the 'Godfather of AI,' advises young AI researchers to be contrarian and challenge existing methods. 'You have to have a deep belief that everybody else could be doing things wrong, and you could figure out how to do them right,' Hinton said. He suggests searching for inefficiencies and pursuing them until you understand why you're wrong. Hinton, who was awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, has previously warned of the possible existential risks of AI and estimates that it could be between five and 20 years before AI becomes a real threat. 'It is still possible that the threat will not materialize,' he said.

**The Smartest People in the World Are Now AI's Students**
The brightest minds in the world are now learning from artificial intelligence (AI). Nobel Prize winners, Silicon Valley CEOs, world-class doctors, and elite mathematicians are using AI tools like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini to simulate scenarios, debate ideas, and test hypotheses. Dr. Stephen Wolfram, physicist and founder of Wolfram Alpha, says AI is like 'thinking out loud with a second brain.' AI is helping solve previously unsolvable problems, such as the protein folding problem, and teaching in a way that the human brain responds to. Many high performers are using AI tools to deepen their mastery, and AI doesn't get tired, flustered, or frustrated, making it an ideal learning companion.

**Hiroshi Amano Receives Honorary Degree for Pioneering Work on Blue LEDs**
Hiroshi Amano, a Nobel laureate in Physics, received an honorary degree in Science and Nanotechnology for Sustainability from the Bicocca University. Amano's work on new semiconductor materials has played a crucial role in creating a smart and carbon-neutral society. He recalls his early days as a student in a poor Japanese university, where he and his colleagues would build reactors by hand using beer bottles to wrap the coils. Amano's breakthrough came when he realized that substituting zinc with magnesium as a doping agent could achieve p-type conduction. 'I read a passage in an old textbook on semiconductor physics and understood my mistake. It was like seeing the light,' he said. Amano's work on blue LEDs has been instrumental in reducing energy consumption. 'The contribution of blue LEDs to energy saving is enormous,' he said. 'LED lighting lasts 40 times longer than incandescent bulbs. In the US alone, between 2017 and 2035, it is estimated that there will be a saving of 22.8 petawattora, equivalent to $890 billion' (US Department of Energy data).

**Elon Musk Faces Expulsion from Royal Society Over Conspiracy Theories**
More than 3,400 scientists, including Nobel laureates, have signed a petition calling for the expulsion of Elon Musk from the Royal Society, a prestigious British academy, due to his promotion of unfounded conspiracy theories. According to the open letter, published in February, Musk has breached the Royal Society's code of conduct by spreading 'unfounded conspiracy theories'. The Royal Society has responded that their meeting is taking place on Monday evening and that questions about their members are treated 'in a strictly confidential manner'. No further information has been provided on the possible outcome. The Royal Society, founded in 1660, has around 1,800 esteemed members, including 85 Nobel laureates, such as Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Stephen Hawking. Elon Musk was elected to the Royal Society in 2018 for his work in space and electric vehicles. Stephen Curry, a professor emeritus of structural biology at Imperial College London, who authored the open letter, said, 'I hope today the members will have the wisdom and courage to show that the Royal Society can publicly defend its values.' Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel laureate in physics in 2024 and a key figure in artificial intelligence, believes Musk should be excluded 'due to the enormous harm he causes to scientific institutions in the United States.' Musk responded on his X account, saying, 'Only cowardly and unsure people are interested in rewards and affiliations.' He also called Hinton's comments 'ignorant, cruel, and false.'

**Stephen Hawking's Nobel Prize: A Misstep by Colombian President Gustavo Petro**
Colombian President Gustavo Petro made a statement at an international event that left many perplexed, claiming that renowned physicist Stephen Hawking won the Nobel Prize in Physics. However, this is not true. Hawking's most famous theory, Hawking radiation, is brilliant but has never been experimentally proven, and the Nobel Prize is not awarded for unverified hypotheses. Petro had previously made the same error in January, and many have pointed out the importance of accurate information, especially when speaking at international forums. A researcher at the Colombian Institute of Theoretical Physics said, 'It's not about being picky, but if we're going to quote a genius in science, at least let the facts be correct.' The Colombian government has not issued a correction or clarification on the statement. Meanwhile, Hawking's legacy remains intact, without a Nobel Prize but with an invaluable contribution to science. Petro's mistake has sparked memes and reactions on social media, with some joking that he should give Einstein a Grammy in his next speech.

**AI to Revolutionize Fundamental Physics: CERN's Future Director Sees Huge Potential**
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in fundamental physics research could revolutionize the field, according to Mark Thomson, the future director of CERN. AI will be particularly useful in observing the Higgs boson. 'It's not about progressive improvements, it's about very, very, very big improvements,' says Thomson. AI is currently used to select and process large amounts of data, such as those collected at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where the behavior of the Higgs boson is studied. In 2024, three researchers were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing an AI capable of predicting protein structures, Alphafold. Thomson believes that AI can help identify anomalies in data, which could reveal the presence of unknown elements such as dark matter. By 2030, when AI models are coupled with the upgraded LHC, CERN will be able to make major new discoveries, including the simultaneous production of two Higgs bosons, an extremely rare event.

**Nobel Winner Donates Half of Prize Money to Water First - Rossland Telegraph**
Dr. Geoffrey Hinton, a recent co-recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics, has donated $350,000 to Water First Education & Training Inc., an organization that supports safe water in Indigenous communities. Dr. Hinton expressed his concern for the conditions in many Indigenous communities and his connection to safe water, saying, 'We lived in Peru for a couple of months where we adopted a child. The water was not safe to drink, and seeing the extra work and health care that goes into protecting a child from poisonous water cemented the belief that we must have clean water.' Water First works with Indigenous communities to deliver training and education programs to help build local capacity and support highly-skilled people in the fields of water operation and environmental resource management. Dr. Hinton praised the Water First model, saying, 'When you provide education, you’ve now got somebody who can keep the water safe for forty years.' The organization provides programming to elementary and high school students as an introduction to water science and stewardship, and also offers internships to provide participants with training and support to obtain entry-level certification as water operators and in fish and water resource management.
