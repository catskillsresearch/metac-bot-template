**10 Trends That Will Shape the Future of Food by 2050**
By 2050, the world's food system will be under pressure due to the need to reach net-zero emissions and a projected global population of over 10 billion people. To reduce food waste, companies will need to rethink the food chain. According to food futurists Morgaine Gaye and Joseph Poore, there will be 10 key trends in food production, consumption, and preparation. These include: 1) 'community meals' where food is shared and valued for its emotional and relational aspects; 2) the end of weekly grocery shopping, replaced by AI-powered meal planning and home delivery; 3) clothing that can grow food, such as shirts with built-in gardens; 4) urban agriculture, with shared gardens, vertical farming, and local food systems; 5) food that absorbs CO2, such as seaweed and shellfish; 6) AI-powered food planning to reduce waste and use 'imperfect' fruits and vegetables; 7) climate-resilient crops, such as quinoa and soy in northern Europe; 8) a return to ancient crops, such as sorrel and dandelion; 9) 'niche' crops, such as teff and fonio, becoming mainstream; 10) personalized nutrition, with AI-powered meal planning to prevent disease. According to Poore, 'it's likely that our diet in 2050 will be significantly different from what we have today, although not necessarily in the ways we expect.' Gaye added, 'in the future, we will see significant changes in our daily habits and food models.'

**US Corn Exports at Risk of 'Boomerang Effect' Amid Record Production**
The US tariffs imposed on other countries are risking becoming a 'boomerang effect' for the US agricultural sector. According to the International Grains Council (IGC), the US export of corn is expected to decline, while corn stockpiles are expected to reach a record high of 31% in the 2025-26 campaign. The US is on track to produce a record 397.4 million tons of corn, a 5.2% increase from the previous year. However, this record production is accompanied by a commercial crisis that is likely to burden American farmers' warehouses. The paradox is evident: while global demand for corn remains solid, many importing countries are avoiding US origin in retaliation for Washington's protectionist measures. As a result, trade flows are being diverted to alternative suppliers, primarily Brazil and Ukraine, which are gaining ground in the global competition. The US is expected to lose around 6 percentage points of market share globally, with exports falling to 65.2 million tons, exacerbating the difficulty for American operators in placing their surplus production abroad. Despite the high demand for corn for animal feed - with a forecast of 749.3 million tons for 'feed use' in 2025-26, up 2.4% - US silos remain full, and the possibilities of alleviating stockpiles through exports are increasingly limited. Meanwhile, the main international competitors are strengthening their presence on the market. Brazil, favored by an expansion of cultivated areas and increasingly high yields, is consolidating a double-digit growth in the 2024-25 campaign. For the 2025-26 campaign, a further 2.7% increase is forecast, with production reaching 131 million tons.

**ILO revises downward job creation estimates in 2025**
The International Labor Organization (ILO) has revised its estimates of job creation in 2025 downward, reflecting a decrease in global economic prospects. The ILO estimates that nearly 84 million jobs in 71 countries are directly or indirectly linked to American consumer demand, with the Asia-Pacific region accounting for the majority (56 million). However, Canada and Mexico have the highest proportion of exposed jobs (17.1%). ILO Director-General Gilbert Houngbo stated, 'We know that the global economy is growing at a slower pace than expected. Our report now tells us that if geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions continue, and if we do not address the fundamental issues reshaping the world of work, they will certainly have negative repercussions on labor markets worldwide.' The report highlights concerning trends in income distribution, with the share of labor income decreasing globally from 53.0% in 2014 to 52.4% in 2024. Africa and the Americas have experienced the largest declines. If this share had remained unchanged, global labor income would have been $1,000 billion higher in 2024, equivalent to $290 more per worker in terms of constant purchasing power. The erosion of the global share of labor income is putting pressure on inequalities and highlighting a disconnect between economic growth and worker remuneration. The report notes a shift towards high-skilled jobs, with women leading this trend. Between 2013 and 2023, the proportion of women in high-skilled jobs increased from 21.2% to 23.2%, while the proportion of men in high-skilled jobs was around 18% in 2023. As education levels continue to rise globally, the labor market remains characterized by significant mismatches between education levels. In 2022, only 47.7% of workers had qualifications matching their job requirements. The proportion of under-educated workers decreased from 37.9% to 33.4% over the past decade, while the proportion of over-educated workers increased from 15.5% to 18.9%. The report also addresses the effects of new technologies on the world of work, finding that nearly one in four workers could see their job transformed by generative AI. A greater proportion of jobs in moderately skilled professions are moderately exposed, but a greater percentage of jobs in highly skilled professions are highly exposed, with existing tasks potentially being automated by AI.

**The Inevitable Decline of the European Economy: A Warning from Marc Vidal**
According to Marc Vidal, by 2050, there will be no European economy among the top 10 in the world, and neither will Spain. This is reflected in the report 'El Mundo en 2050' by Price, which collects prospective analyses from the IMF and the study 'Potencias mundiales 2050-2075' by Goldman Sachs. The report highlights economic stagnation, political fragility, and clear geopolitical changes that show a significant decline. The European Union's growth is expected to be only 0.7% in 2024 and 0.9% in 2025, losing competitiveness to powers like India, China, and even the US. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated this trend, accelerating the decline of Western hegemony. Additionally, the intermittent commercial war with the US, driven by Donald Trump, has further contributed to this decline. Vidal states that the European model of well-being, although admirable in many ways, is becoming unsustainable without deep reforms in defense, energy, and industry. He concludes that it is 'irremediable' unless significant changes are made, citing the study's findings that an empire in decline reveals its downfall when its laws become arbitrary, complex, and disconnected from social consensus. Vidal also criticizes the official discourse, which promotes an artificial morality where poverty is sold as virtue and the destruction of tradition is presented as inevitable progress.

**Copper Demand to Grow by Over 40% by 2040, Report Says**
The Center for Information and Decision Support at the Council of Ministers has released a report on the future of copper, highlighting the growth in global production and consumption, as well as the increasing demand for the metal due to the growing need for renewable energy and digital technologies. The report notes that the global copper production is divided into two main categories: primary production from mines and secondary production from recycling. Primary production has increased significantly over the past few decades, with a growth rate of 142% between 1990 and 2023. Secondary production has also increased, with a growth rate of 145% between 1990 and 2023. The report highlights the importance of recycling in meeting the growing demand for copper, with the International Copper Study Group estimating that around 30% of global copper consumption in 2023 came from recycled sources. The report also notes that the top five countries with the largest copper reserves are Chile, Australia, Peru, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Russia, which together account for around 50% of the world's copper reserves. The report concludes that the growing demand for copper will require significant investments in new mining projects, with an estimated 80 new mines needed to meet the demand by 2030, at a cost of around $250 billion. Additionally, the report highlights the importance of recycling in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainability, with the recycling of copper being a key factor in the transition to a circular economy.

**Kazakhstan's Vision for Climate Change: An Exclusive Interview with Zulfiya Suleimenova**
Kazakhstan is actively working on climate change and environmental protection, according to Zulfiya Suleimenova, a special representative of the President of Kazakhstan on international cooperation in the field of environmental protection. The country aims to achieve a just and inclusive energy transition, with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the share of renewable energy sources. Kazakhstan has set a goal to reduce its carbon footprint by 15% by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The country is also working on developing its nuclear energy sector, with plans to build up to three nuclear power plants. Suleimenova emphasized the importance of international cooperation, particularly with the European Union, in addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development. Kazakhstan is also taking steps to improve its food security, with plans to create a regional center for food security in Almaty. 'By 2040, food production may decline, affecting global food prices and security,' Suleimenova warned. The country is also promoting the idea of a regional center for food security in Almaty, which would serve as a hub for storing food reserves in case of emergencies. Kazakhstan is a major producer of grain, accounting for 7% of global production, and has a vast territory of agricultural land, making it a key player in regional food security. 'We are promoting the issue of food security not only in this small region, but also beyond it,' Suleimenova said. The International Forum in Astana is a suitable platform for Kazakhstan to bring together ideas and develop solutions, she concluded. 'Because, while we, Kazakhs, promote various solutions, this requires partnership and cooperation.'

**Algeria Leads Africa in LNG Production, but Exports Decline**
Africa is strengthening its position in the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, with several countries accelerating their investments in export projects. Algeria stands out as one of the continent's major producers, according to a recent report. The country has a liquefaction capacity of 25.3 million tons per year, thanks to four major facilities managed by Sonatrach in Skikda and Arzew. However, Algeria's LNG exports have slightly decreased in 2024, from 9.93 million tons in the first quarter of 2023 to 8.88 million tons in the same period in 2025, due to operational constraints. Nigeria ranks second with a capacity of 22.2 million tons per year, spread across six units of the Nigeria LNG (NLNG) complex on Bonny Island. Egypt comes in third with 12.2 million tons, produced mainly by the Damiette and Idku plants. However, the country had to import 4 million tons between June 2024 and April 2025 due to a decline in local production, its first in nine years. According to energy research unit projections, Africa could account for 19% of global LNG capacities by 2050, with an estimated production of 1.004 billion tons per year. This growth will be driven by new projects in Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, and Mauritania, including the Tortue Ahmeyim field, which entered production in early 2025 and added 2.3 million tons to the continent's capacity.

**Italy's Demographic Minefield: A 11% GDP Risk by 2040**
According to Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta, the number of people in the workforce is expected to decrease by around five million by 2040, which could cost the country 11% of its GDP. Panetta also noted that the productivity issue remains a problem, with Italy's productivity growth being one of the lowest in the EU. The low level of salaries is also a concern, with real wages having fallen below those of 2000, despite a recent recovery. To ensure a sustainable increase in wages, it is essential to boost productivity and growth through innovation, capital accumulation, and public action. Panetta stated that the Italian industry is still solid, but the value added in the manufacturing sector has remained stagnant, reflecting the expansion in the energy sector and the new decline in the manufacturing area. However, Panetta emphasized that 'despite the current difficulties, the Italian industry is not destined to decline. In all sectors, there are dynamic and competitive companies that invest in technology and research and position themselves in high-end segments.' The main issue is the low level of innovation, with the expenditure on research and development being significantly lower than the EU average. Panetta warned that 'with tariffs at risk, we risk losing 1% of global GDP in two years.'

**Global Agricultural Production Could Decrease by Up to 35% by 2050**
According to a report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in collaboration with Quantis, the global agricultural production could decrease by up to 35% by 2050 for key crops. The main causes of this decline are extreme weather events, geopolitical conflicts, and an agriculture too dependent on a limited number of crops grown in a few producing countries. For example, the global production of rice, which accounts for 22% of the global caloric intake, is expected to decrease by 9% by 2050, with the first five producers experiencing a decline of 18%. The impact will be greatest in the three countries responsible for 40% of the world's total rice production: India (decline of 18%), Bangladesh (decline of 15%), and Indonesia (decline of 12%). The decline in production due to climate change will also have direct consequences on the GDP of these countries: Bangladesh and Vietnam risk losing up to $4 billion, while large economies like India and China could lose $9 and $6 billion, respectively. The study analyzes 15 key crops, responsible for 65% of global agricultural production and 70% of the world's caloric intake, identifying four main models that make our food system vulnerable. The dependence on a few crops and strategic areas puts global food security at risk: in India, for example, a hypothetical blockage of production could reduce the global rice supply by 54% by 2050. According to Antonio Faraldi, managing director and partner BCG, 'the data show that unfortunately food security is not a futuristic dystopian theme. We need to take it into account without alarmism.' To make food chains more resilient, the report proposes a roadmap, suggesting greater investments in high-yielding seed innovation, alternative crops, and post-harvest technologies to reduce waste; more regenerative agriculture, with practices that improve soil health and protect water and biodiversity; more predictive technology and greater diversification of sources and crops.

**Global Food Production at Risk: BCG Report Warns of 35% Decline by 2050**
A report by BCG warns that global food production could decrease by up to 35% by 2050 due to a perfect storm of extreme climate events, geopolitical conflicts, and an agriculture that is still too dependent on a limited number of crops grown in a few producing countries. According to the study 'Building Resilience in Agrifood Supply Chains', 65% of global food production and 70% of the world's caloric intake depend on just 15 crops, making it vulnerable to extreme climate events and geopolitical crises. For example, rice production, which accounts for 22% of the world's caloric intake, is expected to decrease by 9% by 2050, with the top five producers experiencing a decline of 18%. The impact will be greatest in the three countries responsible for 40% of global production, India (-18%), Bangladesh (-15%), and Indonesia (-12%). The decline, caused by climate change, will also have direct consequences on their GDP, with margins for millions of small farmers at risk of collapsing by 30-40%. However, this crisis can be prevented with a change in direction. The study proposes a roadmap to make agri-food supply chains more resilient to shocks without breaking. Among the solutions proposed are: incentivizing genetic innovation to develop crops more resistant to climate; increasing crop diversification; accelerating regenerative agriculture with practices that improve soil health and protect water and biodiversity; and reducing post-harvest waste through technology. It is also essential to unlock new funding sources to allow farmers to innovate without risking collapse, and to activate long-term partnerships between companies and suppliers to ensure stability, traceability, and sustainability throughout the supply chain.

**US Energy Dominance Under Threat, Warns Wood Mackenzie Report**
The United States' dominance in the energy sector is under threat, according to a new report by Wood Mackenzie. Although the US currently leads global production of oil and gas, accounting for 20% of the world's crude and 25% of its gas, the report warns that this position is set to decline by 2035. The US's production of hydrocarbons is expected to decrease between 2035 and 2040, and the rise of clean technologies, particularly in China, could further erode its energy hegemony. 'The US energy dominance has been impressive, but its continuation requires addressing key challenges such as the maturation of resources and the global rise of low-carbon energies,' says Robert Clarke, vice president of upstream research at the consultancy. Clarke notes that if oil prices fall to $50 per barrel before expected, this decline could be accelerated and more severe. China is already dominant in markets such as electric vehicles, batteries, and solar energy, and the US industry may begin to reflect its own vulnerabilities. However, Wood Mackenzie also identifies ways for the US to maintain its leadership, including investing in innovation applied to shale, revitalizing the exploration of new basins, and applying more agile regulatory policies to accelerate energy infrastructure. Clarke suggests that digital tools such as artificial intelligence could reduce extraction costs in shale to $5 per barrel, making new projects in the Permian Basin competitive. However, he warns that the sector has already drilled half of its cheapest unconventional oil locations, and a lack of exploration could limit the country's future as an energy superpower. 'The future of the US energy sector is not entirely defined. The enthusiasm for recent growth should not obscure the fact that the world is changing, and maintaining leadership will require balance between traditional production and investments in clean technologies,' Clarke concludes.

**The World's Population: Peak and Decline - A Demographic Outlook**
The world's population, estimated to be 8.1 billion in 2023, is expected to reach its peak of 10.4 billion by 2080 and then decline gradually. This trajectory, based on the United Nations' medium-variant models and other demographic research, reflects a slowdown in growth rates - from 0.8% per year today to nearly zero by 2080 - as birth rates fall below replacement levels, aging populations change the ratio of dependents, and social and economic factors such as urbanization and education further reduce birth rates. Continental differences will persist: Asia's population, currently 4.7 billion, will peak around 5.3 billion by the 2050s and then decline to 4.9 billion by 2100, driven by rapid declines in birth rates in China, India, and Southeast Asia. Africa will experience sustained growth, reaching 3.0 billion by 2100, while Europe's population will continue to decline due to low birth rates and aging populations. North America and Oceania will grow moderately due to immigration, while Latin America will peak in the middle of the century and then decline. By 2080, food demand will peak alongside population growth, although innovations such as lab-grown meat, vertical farming, and drought-resistant crops may mitigate the deficit. However, climate change threatens tropical regions with reduced crop yields, exacerbating hunger in countries south of the Sahara and South Asia. Fair distribution of food and reducing waste, crucial as 30% of food is currently lost, will determine whether the era will be one of scarcity or abundance. Post-peak aging populations in Asia and Europe may negatively impact agriculture, dependent on labor, and complicate food systems, even as demographic pressure eases. The dynamics of energy development will change dramatically. Oil and gas consumption, already in structural decline due to renewable energy sources, will remain mainly for non-energy uses, such as plastic production and fertilizers. Economies dependent on fossil fuels, such as those in the Middle East and Russia, may face instability as global demand declines. Renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, advanced nuclear, and clean hydrogen, may account for 50-70% of the energy balance by 2080, reducing fossil fuel use to 20-30%, concentrated in outdated sectors. In the geopolitical sphere, demographic growth in Africa may make it a key economic and political bloc, while aging giants like China and India will struggle to maintain their influence. Climate migration - from sinking islands or drought-stricken areas - will test international institutions. Competition for water resources, rare earth minerals, and arable land may heighten tensions, although cooperation mechanisms, such as updated climate agreements, may promote stability. The prospects for peace will depend on overcoming the inequality between aging regions (Europe, East Asia) and young, growing regions (Africa, South Asia), as well as addressing threats related to artificial intelligence, such as autonomous weapons and cyberattacks. Conversely, global interdependence, demographic fatigue among the elderly, and diplomatic innovations may stimulate cooperation. By 2080, artificial intelligence will penetrate all aspects of life, automating 40-60% of jobs and requiring new social contracts, such as universal basic income. AI may optimize resource distribution and healthcare through personalized medicine, but raises ethical concerns about oversight and bias. In the geopolitical sphere, AI dominance may lead to a redefinition of power, an arms race for autonomous systems, and disinformation campaigns. International rules on lethal autonomous weapons and ethical AI governance will become crucial diplomatic challenges. Uncertainty is increasing. Climate tipping points - unpredictable changes, such as thawing permafrost or disrupting ocean currents - may overturn predictions. Breakthroughs in nuclear energy, carbon capture, or space resource extraction may alter scenarios, while cultural changes in family size, consumption, and management will influence final outcomes. The world of 2080 will balance between scarcity and abundance, conflict and cooperation. While AI and renewable energy offer tools for solving problems, their benefits depend on fair governance and global solidarity. The world will require targeted efforts to overcome inequality, adapt to climate change, and create ethical AI, demonstrating that human choice, not just demographics, will determine the era. The future is not necessarily bleak, but it will require foresight, innovation, and commitment to common prosperity. /// nCa, March 17, 2025 (Infographics - nCa)

**World Population - Peak and Decline - News Central Asia (nCa)**
The global population is projected to peak at 10.4 billion by 2080 before declining, according to the United Nations and demographic studies. This trajectory is driven by slowing growth rates, falling fertility rates, and aging populations. Continental disparities will persist, with Asia's population peaking in the 2050s and declining by 2100, while Africa's population will continue to grow. Climate change and resource competition will pose significant challenges, but innovations like lab-grown meat and renewable energy could mitigate shortages. By 2080, energy dynamics will shift dramatically, with renewables constituting 50-70% of the energy mix. Geopolitically, Africa's demographic rise may position it as a pivotal economic and political bloc, while aging giants like China and India grapple with declining influence. The world of 2080 will balance scarcity and abundance, conflict and cooperation, and will require deliberate efforts to address inequality, climate adaptation, and ethical AI.

**Tensiones comerciales plantean un horizonte prometedor para la ganadería**
According to the USDA report, in the first quarter of 2025, beef production is expected to fall 2% below last year's results, and second-quarter volumes are expected to fall another 3% year-over-year. These numbers show a tighter first half of the year than previously expected by the USDA, which projects an annual contraction of 1%. The Dutch bank highlights the role of South America and its growing participation in the global beef markets. The analysis shows that the growing international demand, led by China, has not been accompanied by an increase in cattle herds, leading countries in the region to prioritize exports over their domestic markets, which has exacerbated the levels of extraction. Since the end of 2018, but particularly from 2019 and 2020, China's entry into the beef market has led major producers to force their exportable surpluses over the growth of their production. This behavior is observed in a very marked way in South America, particularly in Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, countries that, together, in 2024 supplied 76% of China's total beef imports, representing 38% of global trade, 10 points more than at the beginning of this period. However, in the last two years, international demand has not been driven exclusively by China. The United States has positioned itself as a key player in the global scene. The uninterrupted decline in its cattle stocks over the last 3 to 4 years, due to drought, has led it to increase its imports above its own exportable surpluses. According to the USDA's latest report on Long-Term Projections until 2034, beef purchases abroad would reach over 2 million tons this year, only to decline to 1.36 million tons in 2029, as a result of the reconstruction of the cattle herd and the consequent recovery of production. The USDA also projects that exports will fall 12% this year, to less than 1.2 million tons, continuing this trend until 2027, when they will reach a floor of less than 1 million tons, only to recover to over 1.4 million tons by 2030. In summary, for the current year, the agency projects a trade deficit of around 830,000 tons, which will put pressure on a global production that will be almost 500,000 tons lower. Added to this, the increase in tariffs imposed by the new US administration on China and its immediate response by the Chinese government have introduced a high degree of uncertainty in the commercial sphere. The USDA projects that the countries that make up MERCOSUR will represent around 42% of global beef trade this year. In the case of Brazil, if we take the latest updates made by its local delegation in Brasilia, the agency projects another record year with exports that would reach around 3.88 million tons, surpassing the 3.6 million previously forecast in its global projection for October. If confirmed, this data would imply surpassing the 3.63 million of 2024 by 7%, leading the block to a global participation of 44%. For 2025, while the US agency projects a new growth in exports of around 5%, locally it is recognized that the country still has significant internal conditions that limit this potential. Argentina has also registered its second consecutive year with record exports. Despite some competitiveness problems in the Argentine case, a good year is expected for the sector. The data recently published by the FAO on the evolution of international beef prices show a significant recovery of values in the last few months, following the decline observed last year.

**Britons advised to cut meat, air travel to reach net zero targets**
The UK's Climate Change Committee (CCC) has advised the government to set a carbon budget of 535 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent for the period 2038-2042 to meet net zero targets by 2050. This would require UK emissions to fall to 87% below their 1990 levels. The CCC recommends electrification and low-carbon electricity supply as the largest share of emissions reductions, with offshore wind growing six-fold and onshore wind capacity doubling by 2040. The report also suggests that nearly three-quarters of cars and vans and nearly two-thirds of heavy goods vehicles on the road will be electric by 2040. To achieve this, the cost of batteries will need to fall, and infrastructure will need to be improved to encourage people to choose alternatives to driving. The report also advises that shoppers should eat less meat and dairy, with average meat consumption envisaged to decline by 25% by 2040, which would equate to consumers eating two fewer meat mains per week. 'This would be an ambitious target, reflecting the importance of the task. But it is deliverable, provided action is taken rapidly,' said the report.

**A World Without Meat: Exploring Alternatives to a Sustainable Future**
The world's population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, leading to an increase in meat consumption. This has significant consequences for the climate and environment. To ensure sustainable eating in the future, we need to make changes today. The documentary 'A World Without Meat' explores alternatives to meat consumption. According to Carine Barbier, a research engineer, 'It is unrealistic that we will consume the same amount of animal products in 2050 as we do today.' The production of meat requires the slaughter of 70 billion animals worldwide each year, causing significant environmental damage, including 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Mass animal husbandry also affects water sources and air quality. Researchers are seeking ways to provide essential nutrients, such as vitamin B12, without relying on animal products. Insect-based protein, legumes, camel milk, and synthetic lab-grown meat are potential solutions. 'It is unrealistic that we will consume the same amount of animal products in 2050 as we do today,' says animal rights activist Brigitte Gothière. The future of our diet may require adjustments and changes in our eating habits.

**Meat Consumption in Spain Continues to Decline**
The consumption of meat in Spain has been decreasing over the past 30 years, from 90 to 65 kilograms per capita, and from 62 to 45 kilograms per capita in domestic consumption in 2024. Projections for 2035 indicate a further decline to 50 and 32 kilograms, respectively, which are still higher than the 21 kilograms per year recommended by the WHO. Carlos Buxadé, a university professor, emphasized that the future of the meat sector is determined by the economic model in which it is inserted, which in turn influences demand through market niches subject to changes in social realities and geo-socio-political decisions, such as the agreement with Mercosur. The Aecoc Congress of Meat and Processed Products, which has the collaboration of the Federation of Meat and Meat Industries (FECIC) as a global partner for the third consecutive year, was officially inaugurated by José María Bonmatí, general director of Aecoc, and Òscar Ordeig, counselor of Agriculture, Livestock, Fishing and Food of the Generalitat of Catalonia. José María Bonmatí highlighted the importance of reducing bureaucracy in the agricultural sector, which is one of the main demands of the collective, and emphasized the need for a sustainable development model. Òscar Ordeig emphasized the importance of collaboration between the private sector and public institutions, and the need for a coordinated effort to ensure the future of the sector. Ana Rodríguez Castaño, secretary general of Agricultural Resources and Food Security of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, highlighted the impact of geopolitical uncertainty on the future of Spanish companies, and emphasized the importance of providing clear information to consumers, especially regarding the denomination of origin. The agreement between the EU and Mercosur is the issue that most concerns the Spanish meat sector (with 48% of the mentions), followed by the return of Donald Trump to the presidency of the USA (23%), the implementation of tariffs by China (14%), and the war between Russia and Ukraine (9%).
