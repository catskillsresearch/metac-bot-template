**Space X's Starship Flight 9: A Successful Reusable Rocket Test**
Space X has launched a new rocket called Starship Flight 9 for an orbital test to prove the technologies inserted inside the rocket. The launch was carried out on May 27 on the east coast of the United States from the experimental base Starbase, in southern Texas. Space X has decided to use the same engine as the one used in the January flight as the booster for this rocket, which is a novelty because it is the first time that an engine already used in previous launches has been reused. This makes the rocket more eco-friendly and opens the way to new technologies related to recycling. The rocket, which is 122 meters tall, is designed to be reusable. NASA has also selected Starship as the future means for the Artemis lunar landing program scheduled for 2027. The launch was successful, as the reused engine responded well to the commands despite having already faced a similar task. Data were also acquired to improve future exercises and regulate the performance of future vehicles. The company had planned to simulate the launch of eight Starlink cargo, copies of satellites that Space X intends to use for communications. In addition to this, the re-ignition of one of the Raptor engines was planned to test the maneuvering capacity. However, the first experiment failed because the container containing the satellites did not open, preventing the release of the devices. The second also failed due to an attitude error that caused the bypass of the Raptor system and prevented Starship from reaching the intended position for re-entry. These tests are intended to verify the capabilities of the vehicles in order to use them for real missions. It seems that the next flights will be carried out by rockets composed of material already used for other means, in order to continue this path of recycling and opening the way to a new type of exploration.
