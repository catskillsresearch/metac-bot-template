**US Debt Hits $36.2 Trillion: Will New Budget Law Make It Worse?**
The US federal debt has reached $36.2 trillion, with a new budget law expected to increase it further. According to Elon Musk, the new law will 'massively increase the budget deficit' to $2.5 trillion, while the debt is already 'colossal'. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the Republican bill to reduce taxes and eliminate certain federal programs will increase the debt by $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years. The debt has doubled in the past decade, reaching a level that is 'impossible to compare' to other countries. In 2023, it represented more than double the combined debt of all EU countries. The US Debt Clock shows the debt growing by $60,000 every second, at a rate of $1 trillion every 180 days. Christopher Dembick, an analyst at Pictet Asset Management, says that the debt has increased mainly due to the government's massive subsidies for business relocation and job creation in 2019, as well as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The debt is also driven by structural factors such as the aging population and the rapid increase in healthcare costs, which are now the highest in the world. Several economic actors are concerned about the level of interest payments on the debt, with Ray Dalio warning that the US has 'three years, give or take a year' to avoid an 'economic heart attack'.

** The Hidden Math of Extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: Revealing the Numbers - CEOWORLD magazine**
The extension of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 is alarming due to the US's historic debt-to-GDP ratio of 120%. The US spends over $1 trillion on interest payments annually, and the treasury will collect $5.7 trillion in 2028, while expenditures will be about $6.9 trillion. This means that under the extension of the TCJA, the national debt will grow by at least $1.2 trillion annually, adding another $4.8 trillion to the debt by 2028. The current tax system is unfair, with individuals contributing 90% of tax revenue and corporations only 10%. A technology-driven alternative, the Automated Banking Transaction (ABT) Tax, could balance the budget and address the deficits. The ABT Tax would collect $7.5 trillion annually, covering expenses and making debt payments, and would be the most proportionate, efficient, and equitable tax system possible.

**What is the U.S. National Debt, and How Is It Paid?**
The U.S. national debt has reached a record $36.2 trillion, exceeding the combined annual output of China, Japan, Germany, the U.K., and India. The government will pay approximately $684 billion in interest this fiscal year, which is roughly 16% of every federal dollar spent. Moody's stripped Washington of its last triple-A rating in May 2025, warning that successive administrations have failed to rein in spiraling deficits. The government takes on debt to cover the gap between spending and tax revenues, and it can roll debt indefinitely by raising taxes and creating more dollars. The Treasury acts like a giant bond-fund manager, paying out interest from current tax receipts and issuing fresh bonds to replace those that mature. Foreign investors hold about $9 trillion of the debt, led by Japan, the U.K., and China. Annual net-interest outlays are expected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, and President Trump's budget proposal is projected to add $3+ trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

**Rand Paul: If We Pass Big Beautiful Bill the Debt Will 'Be Owned by the Republicans'**
Senator Rand Paul stated on Fox Business Network that Republicans will be responsible for the national debt if they pass President Donald Trump's spending bill. Paul said, 'We know most Republicans, not me, voted to continue the Biden spending levels in March. So we're going to go through September of this year and the deficit for this year is going to be over $2 trillion. If you're borrowing $5 trillion, that makes me think you're going to add over $2 trillion, maybe $2.8 trillion next year.' Paul emphasized that this would be the largest increase in the debt ceiling in history and that Republicans would 'own' the debt, rather than being able to blame Democrats for excessive spending. He vowed to continue speaking out against the bill, saying, 'I'm not going to be one of the Republicans who's going to be responsible for this, that I'm going to continue to be a voice saying, we need to cut spending.'

**Elon Musk Expresses Concerns Over Rapid Growth of US National Debt**
Elon Musk expressed concerns about the growing US national debt, stating 'It's scary' in response to a post highlighting the rapid growth of the debt. The post, which included a graph showing the debt's sharp increase, was captioned 'This is not Apple, Tesla, or even Nvidia. This is the US national debt.' Musk has previously warned that the US is at risk of bankruptcy if the federal budget deficit is not addressed. In 2024, the US national debt exceeded $36 trillion, setting a new historical record. By January 2025, the debt had reached $36.216 trillion, prompting the government to raise the debt ceiling.

**Balancing the national budget will require discipline, sacrifice | Letter**
The national budget will require discipline and sacrifice to balance, as the US debt has reached $37 trillion, with a deficit of $952 billion. The author believes that this is a positive development, as it will force Congress to make tough decisions and work together to reduce spending and increase taxes. This will involve major cuts to military spending, a reinvention of the healthcare system, and increased taxes on everyone. The author says, 'Can they do it? If they can’t, we need to fire them.' The author also notes that the inability to borrow more money will make the US a 'risky investment' for the world, requiring higher interest rates to borrow.

**How Trump's big bill will affect taxes, deficit and health care, according to the budget office**
President Donald Trump's big bill, which aims to cut taxes by $3.7 trillion but also increase deficits by $2.4 trillion over the next decade, has been analyzed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO estimates that 10.9 million people will lose health insurance under the bill, including 1.4 million who are in the country without legal status in state-funded programs. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has criticized the CBO, saying it has been 'historically wrong' and that its employees are biased. However, the CBO has previously shown to be accurate in its predictions, with receipts being $1.5 trillion or 5.6% greater than predicted in 2021 due to the 'burst of inflation' during the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill also includes a massive buildup of $350 billion for border security, deportations and national security, and would provide a $4 trillion increase to the nation's debt limit. The CBO seeks to provide objective, impartial information about budgetary and economic issues, and its current director, Phillip Swagel, has been reappointed to a four-year term in 2023.

**National debt: Why Congress no longer cares**
The US national debt is at a critical point, with the federal government facing a 'genuine crisis' due to rising interest rates and a bloated budget bill. According to Rogé Karma, 'now would be a very good time for Washington to bring back its debt obsession.' The federal deficit has soared to $881 billion in 2024, more than the US spent on national defense last year. Experts warn that if Congress doesn't act, 'very bad things can happen,' including stagflation, a flight from US Treasuries, and a global financial meltdown. Despite some concern from bond markets, lawmakers are unlikely to act responsibly, said Clive Crook, as they would need to make 'huge spending cuts and major tax increases,' which are unpopular. Instead, Republicans are trying to hide the bill's 'unfathomable cost' from voters, but it's the voters who will suffer as a result, said Jessica Riedl. The rapidly growing debt and massive interest payments create 'economic drag,' diverting wealth away from investments that would create jobs and raise incomes.

**The US National Debt: A Growing Concern**
The US national debt is growing rapidly, with the country's state debt exceeding 122% of its GDP. The rating agency Moody's recently downgraded the US credit rating, but politicians are not taking action to address the growing debt. The debt is expected to reach a record high in four years, with the government's payment obligations exceeding the country's economic output. The Peterson Foundation has identified three main causes of the extreme imbalance in the country's finances: an aging population, the rising cost of healthcare, and the impact of high interest rates on debt servicing. The foundation estimates that the healthcare costs will consume 20% of the country's GDP by 2030. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts that the interest payments on the national debt will exceed $1 trillion for the first time, equivalent to 3.2% of the GDP. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) recommends that Congress passes laws to ensure that expenditure programs are balanced with measures to offset them, in order to stabilize the national debt and reduce its burden on the economy. This could be achieved through a range of options, including mandatory cuts to Medicaid, restrictions on the President's authority to extend subsidies, and improved tax collection by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Without a package of spending cuts, tax reforms, and better tax collection, experts warn of devastating consequences, including the displacement of productive investments in the economy by debt servicing, a loss of confidence in US government bonds, and a decline in the value of the dollar that could fuel inflation.

**Big, beautiful tax-cut bill will hasten America’s decline**
The author fears that the United States is heading into a period of decline, citing the recent passage of a tax-cut bill that benefits the wealthy while denying social safety-net programs to those on the lower income scale. The bill, which would increase income inequality and necessitate a $500 billion cut in Medicare spending, is a symptom of the decline. The author also expresses concern about the national debt consequences of the bill, which would add an additional $3.8 trillion to the debt, raising it from $36.2 trillion to $40 trillion. The author argues that the U.S. has been living beyond its means by borrowing against the future and that the national debt has ballooned from $5.6 trillion in 2000 to $36.2 trillion at the end of 2024. The author also criticizes Donald Trump's erratic behavior, including his tariff actions, which have made America an unreliable partner and driven away its steadiest trading partners and military allies. The author concludes that America's worldwide popularity has suffered a collapse since January, with China now regarded more favorably than the United States.

**Opinion: America's financial house is out of order**
Moody's Investors Service downgraded the United States' credit rating to Aa1, citing soaring debt, chronic deficits, and rising interest rates. The national debt stood at $36.8 trillion as of May 18, 2025, with $3.2 trillion in state and local government debt. Federal spending continues to surge, with a projected $2 trillion deficit and interest payments exceeding $1 trillion annually. The author argues that a return to pre-pandemic spending levels, annual public comparisons of budget categories, and a long-term plan to reduce debt as a percent of GDP are necessary to restore public trust and fiscal discipline. This is not a call for austerity, but for accountability and long-term survival.

**Debunking the $6.5 Trillion Debt Crisis: Experts Say It's a 'False Alarm'**
A recent report claimed that the US will face a $6.5 trillion debt crisis in June 2025. However, experts argue that this is an exaggerated claim. The US will indeed face a significant refinancing challenge in 2025, with approximately 70% of the $9.2 trillion in debt maturing in the first half of the year. However, this does not mean that the US will have to pay off $6.5 trillion in June. The US government will continue to refinance its debt through new bond issuances, which is a normal and legal process. The real concern is not the debt itself, but rather the potential for a liquidity crisis or a credit crunch, which could make it difficult for the US to refinance its debt. The article also notes that the US has a history of refinancing its debt and that the current debt-to-GDP ratio is not a concern. The article concludes that the US is unlikely to default on its debt and that the market's expectations of a default are low. The article also provides a detailed breakdown of the US debt schedule for 2025 and notes that the June debt maturity is approximately $1.07 trillion, not $6.5 trillion.

**When Our $37 Trillion Time Bomb Will Explode**
The US national debt is nearing $37 trillion, growing at over $1 trillion every 100 days. The debt-to-GDP ratio is 123%, unsustainable in the long term. Interest payments will exceed $952 billion in fiscal year 2025, surpassing the amount spent on Medicare. President Trump's tax plan would add $7.75 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The 'Bond Vigilantes', a group of institutional investors, are driving up Treasury yields by selling off Treasurys in response to perceived economic bad behavior. China and Japan, the two largest foreign holders of US debt, may be behind the selloff. Billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio warns that at some point, the US will have to 'sell a quantity of debt that the world is not going to want to buy.' This could lead to restructurings of debt, pressure from Washington on countries to buy the debt, and even monetization of debt, which risks hyperinflation.

**US budget deficit hits $1.3 trn in six months, second highest on record**
The US budget deficit has reached $1.307 trillion in the first six months of the 2025 fiscal year, the second highest on record. The deficit is attributed to increased spending, including cost of living increases to Social Security payouts, higher Medicare and Medicaid costs, and increased disaster assistance. The Treasury Department data also shows that spending is $139 billion more in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period last year, with borrowing over that period $41 billion higher. Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has recommended plans to reduce waste and spending, but Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, says that lawmakers are 'hellbent on adding to that sum with trillions of unpaid-for tax cuts and spending increases.' Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the nation will creep closer to hitting the statutory debt ceiling by early summer. 'We are going to go onto the warning track sometime in May or June,' Bessent said.

**US May Run Out of Funds and Default on Debt by Mid-July 2025**
According to the New York Times, citing the Bipartisan Policy Center, the US government may run out of funds to pay its bills as early as mid-July 2025. This would lead to a default, unless Congress passes a bill to raise the debt ceiling. The Bipartisan Policy Center predicts that the 'X-day', when the US Treasury Department cannot fulfill its obligations in full and on time, will occur between mid-July and early October. However, there is a possibility that it could happen as early as June, depending on the tax revenue collected in April. The uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling is causing significant economic instability, as noted by the center. The US national debt has reached a record high of $36.22 trillion as of March 24, 2025.

**US Government Debt Default Predicted for Mid-July to Early October**
Analysts from the Bipartisan Policy Center predict that the US government debt default may occur between mid-July and early October. The US national debt has reached $36.22 trillion as of March 24, according to the US Treasury Department's website. 'The Bipartisan Policy Center forecasts that the X-Day, the period when the US Department of the Treasury will not be able to fulfill its obligations fully and on time, will occur between mid-July and early October,' the center's statement reads. The analysts note that the date of the X-Day will be influenced by the income received by the state after collecting taxes in April. According to the center, despite the fact that tax revenues are unlikely to differ significantly from expectations, there is a possibility that the risk of X-Day may appear as early as June. The center's statement also highlights that the uncertainty surrounding the actions of US lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling will lead to greater economic instability in the US. 'Lawmakers cannot afford to delay action on the debt ceiling. The Congress has a lot of work in 2025, but the main priority at the moment should be to resolve the debt issue before X-Day,' said Shai Akabas, the director of economic policy at the center. 'History has shown that even the approach of X-Day can lead to market volatility, increased borrowing costs, and decreased confidence in the US's tax and budget stability.'

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has notified Congress that she will extend the special funding arrangement to avoid breaching the federal government's debt ceiling until June 27. The debt ceiling is currently at a record high of approximately $36 trillion and continues to rise. The move comes as Congress is working to pass a bill to raise the debt ceiling, but negotiations with conservative hardliners who are concerned about the country's deteriorating finances are proving difficult. According to CNN, Yellen stated that the government's debt is 'a pressing issue that requires immediate attention'.

**US Debt Crisis Looms in 2025: $9.2 Trillion of Debt Matures, Putting Pressure on Financial Markets**
The United States' national debt of $36.2 trillion will reach a critical point in 2025, with $9.2 trillion of debt maturing, representing 25.4% of the country's total debt. This has raised concerns about its implications on financial markets, interest rates, and economic stability. The rapid accumulation of debt has been driven by historically high levels of deficit spending, with a $13 trillion increase since 2020, averaging $2.6 trillion annually over the past five years. The federal deficit for 2024 is $1.8 trillion, equivalent to 6.4% of GDP, and interest payments on the debt have increased to over $1 trillion annually. The situation is alarming, with 70% of the maturing debt, or $6.5 trillion, due between January and June 2025, putting significant pressure on bond markets. The government will be forced to issue a large amount of new bonds to meet these maturities, increasing the supply of Treasury bonds and potentially driving up yields. The market has already shown signs of tension, with real yields increasing steadily since 2022. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen 115 basis points since the start of rate cuts, reflecting investors' growing concern about the government's increasing debt. As The Kobeissi Letter noted on February 4, 'the problem of US debt is not new, but the magnitude of the refinancing challenge in 2025 makes it a topic that investors cannot ignore.'
