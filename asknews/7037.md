**North Korea Defends Military Cooperation with Russia, Citing Peace and Stability**
North Korea has defended its military cooperation with Russia, saying it aims to 'ensure peace and stability' in Europe and Asia. The two countries have strengthened their military ties in recent years, with Pyongyang providing Moscow with weapons and troops to support its war against Ukraine. According to South Korean intelligence, around 600 North Korean soldiers were killed and thousands injured while fighting alongside Russia. A group of international monitors, including South Korea, the US, Japan, and eight other countries, have condemned the cooperation as 'illegal'. The US and 10 allies have accused Russia and North Korea of violating UN sanctions by cooperating on military matters, which has helped Moscow increase its missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. In response, North Korea said its cooperation with Russia aims to 'protect the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security interests' of its country, as well as 'ensure peace and stability in the Eurasian region'. A North Korean foreign ministry official described the relationship as 'the pinnacle of inter-state relations'. The official added that Pyongyang and Moscow can 'establish a multi-polar world based on genuine respect for sovereignty, equality, and justice'. A monitoring group, established in October 2024, is tracking and reporting any violations of sanctions on North Korea to the UN Security Council. According to the group, Russian ships have transported up to 9 million rounds of mixed artillery ammunition and multiple rocket launchers from North Korea to Russia in 2024. The group also believes that Russia has provided North Korea with air defense equipment and anti-aircraft missiles.

**The Transformation of South Korean Progressive Foreign Policy**
South Korea's progressive foreign policy is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by changing international and domestic circumstances. The Democratic Party of Korea (DP) is shifting from an engagement-centered idealism to a more pragmatic, security-conscious approach. This recalibration is influenced by intensifying U.S.-China competition, North Korea's nuclear maturity, China's economic coercion, and Japan's security normalization. Internally, generational shifts toward civic nationalism, growing concerns over economic inequality, and the rise of digital polarization are reshaping the domestic foundations of foreign policy preferences. The DP's foreign policy is now more interest-based and less doctrinaire, with a focus on economic security and institutional pragmatism. Policymakers should anticipate a more pragmatic progressive foreign policy posture, even under leaders with roots in engagement-era traditions. The DP's approach to North Korea policy has shifted from unconditional unification to a more pragmatic, security-conscious strategy centered on peaceful coexistence. The party's stance toward the United States is no longer defined by simple binaries of loyalty or resistance, but rather by a pragmatic adaptation to structural realignment, domestic generational transition, and rising demands for economic equity. The DP's relations with Japan are also being recalibrated, with some progressives moving toward a 'two-track' approach: defending historical justice issues while selectively expanding cooperation with Japan on economic security, supply chain resilience, and regional stability. The 2025 presidential election will be a critical test for the DP, as it attempts to articulate a foreign policy agenda that reconciles competing pressures and resonates with an electorate increasingly focused on economic security, national autonomy, and cautious regional engagement.

**Lee Myung-bak's Message to the Nation on the Eve of the 2025 Presidential Election**
Former President Lee Myung-bak said, 'A leader who can manage the country's affairs honestly and bring our people together to overcome difficulties would be great.' He made this statement on the eve of the 2025 presidential election, visiting the Cheonggyecheon Stream in Seoul and meeting with journalists. Lee emphasized that 'now is a difficult time for the country' and that 'at times like this, politicians must be stable and really manage the country's affairs.' He also mentioned that 'the economy is difficult due to Trump's tariff policy and North Korea's involvement in the Ukraine war, making the East Asian and Asian regions insecure.' Lee suggested that 'the government should differentiate between small business owners, medium-sized businesses, and large corporations and tailor policies accordingly.' When asked about his hopes for the outcome of the presidential election, Lee replied, 'I hope a candidate who truly understands the difficulties of the common people, laborers, and small business owners, especially street vendors, will emerge.' Regarding Lee Jae-myung's promise to restore the 4 major rivers, Lee said, 'I'm sure he won't do it when he becomes president.' He also praised Kim Moon-su, the candidate of the People's Power Party, saying that 'during my presidency, Kim Moon-su, the governor of Gyeonggi Province, worked hard to implement government policies, such as building the KTX and electronic complexes.' Lee also commented on the recent 'L-box school' scandal, saying 'during election season, many people try to discredit others' and 'I also experienced this when I first ran for office. It's all about getting votes, and as politics improves, such incidents will decrease.' He added, 'South Korea has become a world-class country, and our president is recognized as a world-class leader abroad, but our politics is still below the national level.'

**North Korea Condemns MSMT Report on Cooperation with Russia**
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of North Korea has condemned the report by the Multilateral Monitoring Group on Sanctions (MSMT) on the country's cooperation with Russia, calling it a violation of sovereignty and warning of consequences. The report, published on May 29, was criticized by the North Korean government, which stated that the MSMT's actions are a 'gross violation of the principles of international law, based on sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs.' The Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized that North Korea has the right to take 'strong countermeasures' to protect its rights and interests from such 'severe violations of sovereignty and interference.' The report was created by 11 countries, including the US, Japan, South Korea, the UK, France, and Germany, after Russia vetoed the extension of the mandate of the previous UN group of experts on sanctions against North Korea. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated that the MSMT is a 'political tool, consistently acting in favor of the geopolitical interests of the West, and has no grounds for investigating the application of sovereign rights of other countries.' The government emphasized that the military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow, aimed at protecting sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security interests, as well as ensuring peace and stability in the Eurasian region, is an exercise of legitimate sovereign rights under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which gives the right to 'individual or collective self-defense.' Additionally, Article 4 of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement between North Korea and Russia states that military and other assistance will be provided in the event of an armed attack on one of the parties. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs concluded that 'our efforts to protect the dignity, rights, and interests of the state will not depend on anyone's biased view and malicious accusations.'

**North Korea Denounces MSMT Report as 'Political Provocation'**
North Korea has called the report by the 'Multilateral Monitoring Group on Sanctions' (MSMT) a 'political provocation' and 'fabrication'. The report claims that North Korea and Russia are violating UN Security Council resolutions. The MSMT was created in October 2024 by the US to monitor the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions regarding North Korea. The group consists of 11 countries, including the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, and the UK. North Korea's Foreign Ministry stated that MSMT is a 'political tool' and a 'phantom group' consisting of countries 'hostile to North Korea and the Russian Federation'. The actions of the group in North Korea were seen as an attempt to undermine the country's sovereignty. The Foreign Ministry emphasized that the military cooperation between North Korea and Russia is aimed at defending the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security interests of the state, as well as ensuring peace and stability in the Eurasian region. The cooperation is in line with Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that each state has the right to individual or collective self-defense. In June 2024, Russia and North Korea signed the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which came into force in December. According to Article 4 of the treaty, if one of the parties is attacked by one or several states, the other party will provide it with military assistance using all available means in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter and the laws of North Korea and Russia.

**Lee Jae-myung's Campaign for a 'United Government' and 'People's Sovereignty'**
Lee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party of Korea, said, 'The most important thing for the next government is to implement people's sovereignty and integrate the people.' He emphasized the need for a 'united future' and called for a 'united government' that would be a 'servant of the people, a proxy, and a worker.' He also mentioned that the name of the next government could be 'People's Sovereignty Government' and that he would strive to achieve a 'united government' that would resolve the extreme political polarization that occurred during the 12·3 internal conflict. Lee Jae-myung's campaign has been focused on unity, and his approval rating has increased to 50% in a recent survey, while his disapproval rating has decreased to 46%. The Democratic Party is concerned that the high approval rating may lead to complacency among voters in the Honam region, and is therefore striving to achieve a high voter turnout of 85% and a high vote share of 90% in the region.

**Kim Jong-un Warns US of North Korea's Military Power**
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un stated that it is 'legitimate' for his country to send troops to Russia and warned that North Korea will not hesitate to use its military power if the US launches a new attack on Russia. Kim made the comments during a speech at the Russian Embassy in Pyongyang on the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. He emphasized that North Korea's participation in the war is legitimate and within its sovereign rights. Kim also accused the US of being a 'puppet state' and Ukraine of being a 'puppet state' of a nuclear power, and warned that the US and its allies will become 'more reckless' in their actions in South Korea. According to the South Korean National Intelligence Service, North Korea has sent over 150,000 troops to Ukraine to fight on behalf of Russia, with over 600 casualties and 4,000 wounded. The comprehensive strategic partnership agreement between Russia and North Korea, signed in June 2024, is set to come into effect in December 2024 and provides for mutual military assistance in the event of an attack on either side.

He also praised the bravery of soldiers who participated in the Battle of Kursk, calling them 'heroes and the highest representatives of national honor'. Kim Jong-un warned that Pyongyang will allow the use of military force if the US continues to engage in 'military provocations' against Russia.

North Korea confirmed its involvement on April 27, 2025, stating that it was done on the orders of Kim Jong-un. Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked North Korean troops for their participation on April 28, 2025, and again on May 9, 2025.

**2025 Unification White Paper: Government Pursues Principle-Based Unification and North Korea Policy**
The Ministry of Unification released the '2025 Unification White Paper' on May 9, which summarizes the progress of unification and North Korea policies and the current state of inter-Korean relations. According to the white paper, the government has consistently pursued a principle-based unification and North Korea policy to normalize inter-Korean relations. The white paper highlights the government's decision to suspend the 9/19 military agreement in full, citing North Korea's continued non-compliance and its de facto cancellation of the agreement in November 2023. This move has allowed for military training in the Demilitarized Zone and enabled the government to take swift and decisive action against North Korea's provocations. The white paper notes that the government has made efforts to reinitiate dialogue with North Korea, including the establishment of a dialogue committee proposed by former President Yoon Suk-yeol on Liberation Day and North Korea's efforts to normalize the inter-Korean communication channel. However, North Korea has consistently shown a lack of response and hostile attitude towards these efforts. Statistics also confirm the state of inter-Korean relations, with no inter-Korean exchanges for four consecutive years and no inter-Korean trade for two consecutive years. The white paper also notes that the government's humanitarian aid to North Korea has been completely cut off after 19 years, and the inter-Korean communication channel has not been restored since North Korea unilaterally severed it in April 2023. Only one case of a private reunion between separated family members was reported in the past five years, in which a South Korean citizen visited North Korea to meet their family. The white paper will be distributed to government agencies, private organizations, research institutions, and public libraries, and will also be available in electronic format on the Ministry of Unification's website.

**A free and unified Korea: advancing U.S. national security interests**
The pursuit of a free and unified Korea is a strategic imperative that aligns with the United States' core national security interests. Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined the criteria for this policy direction, which includes enhancing American safety, strengthening American power, and promoting American prosperity. A unified Korea under a democratic regime would eliminate the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions, bolster U.S. national security, and lead to a more stable Northeast Asia. The U.S. can address the root cause of the nuclear threat by supporting the Korean people's pursuit of a free and unified Korea. This would also lead to a more stable region, diminish the chances of military confrontations, and provide a counterbalance to adversarial powers such as China and Russia. Furthermore, a unified Korea would open new avenues for trade and investment, create opportunities for American businesses, and contribute to global economic growth.

**North Korea Criticizes US, Japan, and South Korea Over Nuclear Disarmament Calls**
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un criticized the statements made by the US, Japan, and South Korea calling for North Korea's nuclear disarmament. Kim described these statements as 'the most hostile action to deny North Korea's sovereignty'. Kim said, 'We don't care about anyone's denial or recognition, and we will never change our choice. This is our firm and irreversible decision that cannot be changed by any physical force or cunning trick.' Kim argued that North Korea's nuclear capabilities play an important role in deterring external 'attacks and threats' and defending the state's sovereignty and security. The reaction came after a meeting in Brussels last week between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Japanese Foreign Minister İvaya Takeşi, and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul.

**The 2025 System: A New Era for Korea**
2025 is a historic year, marking 120 years since Korea lost its sovereignty to Japan through the Eulsa Treaty and 80 years since Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. The author is filled with excitement at the possibility that this year could be a turning point in modern Korean history. The current era is one of great change, with the return of Donald Trump to the international stage bringing a storm of change to the existing order. The international order that has persisted since the end of World War II is crumbling daily. The era of US dominance is coming to an end, and Trumpism is a symbol of this. The collapse of US dominance and the subsequent collapse of the existing political and economic systems is a reality. Politically, the Cold War system is crumbling, and economically, the free trade system is under threat. The end of US hegemony means the collapse of the international order, particularly the final collapse of the Cold War system. This change will have the greatest impact on the Korean Peninsula, which is the only region where the Cold War has not yet disappeared. The author believes that Trump's actions will have an unexpected impact on the Korean Peninsula, where the Cold War is still alive and well. Trump's actions will lead to a significant change in the Korean Peninsula, with the possibility of a peace treaty and the establishment of diplomatic relations between North and South Korea. The author concludes that the Trump administration will seek to improve relations with North Korea, citing the strategic benefits for the US. The author proposes the '2025 system' as a response to the impending changes, which will involve the dismantling of the outdated Cold War system and the establishment of a new system for a peaceful and reunified Korea. The 2025 system will involve the removal of the remnants of the Cold War era, including the National Security Act, and the establishment of a new framework for relations between North and South Korea. The author believes that the 2025 system will be a turning point in Korean history, marking the beginning of a new era of peace and cooperation on the Korean Peninsula.

**N. Korea likely to ramp up military activities this year: unification ministry**
South Korea's unification ministry believes that North Korea will increase its military activities this year, citing the country's designation of 2025 as 'a year of training.' According to Unification Minister Kim Yung-ho, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un called for war preparations as required by modern warfare, marking the 77th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army. The ministry stated, 'As Kim Jong-un designated this year as a year of training, there's a possibility that the North Korean military will ramp up military activities in the future.' Despite the economic benefits from North Korea's alignment with Russia, the general North Korean people are facing economic difficulties, including limited market activities, grain supplies, and rising living costs due to the regime's heightened economic controls.

**North Korea's 2025 Agenda: Strengthening the Party and Revolutionary Momentum**
North Korea has set its 2025 agenda as 'a year of strengthening the party and a year of revolutionary momentum'. The country is expected to focus on strengthening its nuclear and missile capabilities, increasing its war-fighting capabilities, and promoting a revolutionary spirit. The government will also prioritize the development of the youth and the spread of socialist ideology. In the external arena, North Korea is likely to continue its efforts to strengthen its relations with Russia and China, while also engaging in a 'big momentum' campaign to promote its economy and national defense. However, the author notes that the most pressing issue for Kim Jong-un is the internal problem of 'the North Korean version of the MZ generation', or the spread of individualism and external information among the population. This could potentially lead to a decline in the importance of the nuclear program, as the people begin to see South Korea as a desirable alternative. The author concludes that the South Korean government and people should continue to promote the idea that South Korea and North Korea are one people, and that unification is not a distant dream, but a reality that can be achieved through the spread of information and human rights.
