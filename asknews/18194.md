**Google DeepMind CEO Predicts AI Will Cure Diseases and Bring Radical Abundance**
Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, believes that artificial intelligence (AI) could potentially cure diseases, 'even all of them... if everything goes well'. He made this statement at the SXSW London festival, where he discussed the advancements of AI and its enormous potential for humanity. Hassabis predicts that in the next decade, general artificial intelligence (AGI) will be able to dominate all areas and be used 'to solve fundamental problems of science'. He also mentioned that resolving these fundamental problems would 'open up new branches of discovery or applications that did not exist before'. Hassabis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024 for creating the AlphaFold model, which can predict the structure of proteins. He believes that more of this kind of innovation is needed, for example in fields like energy and materials science. 'I think we need more of this, for example in fields like energy, in materials science... This would allow great advances in many other areas', he said. 'I think, if everything goes well, we will reach a kind of radical abundance', he predicted. 'If we solve problems like energy -- it can be in many ways, optimal batteries, better solar materials, room-temperature superconductors --, then we will have a world where we can perhaps cure many diseases, even all of them, and have unlimited clean energy'. 'The only thing that is certain is that there will be a lot of change', he said. 'With luck, there will be a kind of maximum flourishing of humanity'. Hassabis compared the arrival of AI to other historical processes where technology caused a leap in humanity, such as the Industrial Revolution or the Internet. However, he believes that 'this will be bigger, perhaps like electricity, because it will be able to transform everything'. Despite his optimism, he reiterated that it is necessary to regulate the use of AI, and soon, AGI, with an ethical approach that benefits everyone.

**Ibaraki Prefecture Seeks to Host Next-Generation Nuclear Power Plant**
Ibaraki Prefecture has submitted a request to the Japanese government to establish a 'demonstration reactor' for the next-generation nuclear power plant, 'high-temperature gas reactor'. The high-temperature gas reactor is expected to be more efficient and safer than conventional nuclear power plants, and the government aims to start operating the demonstration reactor in the late 2030s. This is the first time a local government has expressed interest in hosting the reactor. According to Ibaraki Prefecture Governor Kazuhiko Ōi, 'We are requesting that a demonstration reactor be established in the prefecture, as well as accelerating discussions on the early selection of the implementation entity and installation location.' The high-temperature gas reactor uses helium gas instead of water to cool the reactor, allowing for a much higher temperature than conventional nuclear power plants. This makes it suitable not only for electricity generation but also for the production of hydrogen, which is expected to be a next-generation fuel. Ibaraki Prefecture already has a test reactor, the 'High-Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR)', which is operational in the town of Oarai. In March of this year, the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, which operates the HTTR, submitted an application to the Nuclear Regulation Authority to begin manufacturing hydrogen. The demonstration reactor is expected to be built on a larger scale than a commercial reactor, in order to test its economic viability.

**What Is Superconductivity?**
Superconductivity is a phenomenon where materials exhibit zero electrical resistance when cooled to extremely low temperatures. Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes discovered superconductivity in 1911 while observing electrical resistivity in mercury. The Meissner effect, discovered in the 1930s, states that magnetic fields are expelled when materials enter the superconducting state. Superconductors require extremely low temperatures to maintain their unique, lossless current flow. Theoretical frameworks, such as the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) Theory, explain how superconductivity is a microscopic effect created out of condensed Cooper pairings of electrons. There are two main types of superconductors: Type I, which are 'soft' superconductors that can expel magnetism completely, and Type II, which are 'hard' superconductors that can sustain superconductivity. High-temperature superconductors (HTS) remain superconducting at temperatures above 77 K. Superconductivity has various applications, including medical imaging devices, maglev trains, and quantum computing. Researchers are utilizing superconductors to adapt to magnetic repels for train movement and high-speed frequencies. With advances in power transmissions, high-speed technology, and energy efficiency, superconductors will continue to play a crucial role in everyday life.

**France 2030: CEA and CNRS Launch Ambitious Research Program on High-Temperature Superconductors and Fusion**
The French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) have launched a new research program called SupraFusion, aiming to accelerate the development of high-temperature superconductors and fusion energy. The program, funded by France 2030, a national investment plan, will receive 50 million euros over seven years. The goal is to strengthen, structure, and federate the French scientific community to support the construction and positioning of a national industry in the emerging and highly competitive global market of high-temperature superconductors, particularly for magnetic fusion. More than 200 scientists from 20 research organizations and industries will be involved in this project. Supraconductors are materials with unique electrical and magnetic properties, making them essential for applications such as MRI, particle accelerators, and nuclear fusion. However, their use requires extremely low temperatures, around 4 Kelvin (-269°C), limiting their deployment. The development of high-temperature superconductors, up to 80 Kelvin (-193°C), could be crucial for scaling up current uses, particularly in fusion research. These materials also have great potential in new applications such as wind power, electricity transmission, and low-carbon mobility. The research, led by the CEA and CNRS, will focus on three main axes: developing the technological bricks of high-temperature superconductors, demonstrating their technological reliability at large scale, and exploring breakthrough applications, particularly compact fusion power plants. SupraFusion will rely on a network of technological platforms, existing and improved or newly implemented, with support throughout the development chain, from proof-of-concept tests to industry. The program will also launch two calls for projects to the entire French scientific community, one on technology and infrastructure development and the other on social applications of high-temperature superconductors. Several actions to animate the scientific community will be planned to structure it, foster synergies between laboratories, and form the next generation of young researchers and engineers in these future technologies.

**Proxima Fusion Unveils Commercial Thermonuclear Power Plant Concept Stellaris**
Proxima Fusion, a German startup, has unveiled the concept of a commercial thermonuclear power plant called Stellaris, which the company claims is 'the most viable project in the world' for practical application of controlled nuclear synthesis. The Stellaris concept is based on a stellarator, a toroidal chamber with magnetic coils to hold plasma, where the synthesis reaction occurs. Unlike more common tokamaks, stellarators provide increased plasma stability, although they require complex magnetic system geometry. Proxima Fusion uses high-temperature superconducting magnets, which allows for a radical reduction in the size of the installation compared to previous projects. According to the company, this will provide higher power density, accelerated construction, and reduced costs. The company claims that their approach may outweigh the current trend. A demonstration reactor, Alpha, planned for launch by 2031, should first achieve a positive energy balance in continuous operation. The development is based on data from the Wendelstein 7-X experiment by the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, in which Germany and the EU invested over €1.3 billion. Proxima Fusion is the first spin-off of the IPP, combining scientists from the institute with engineers from Google, Tesla, McLaren Formula-1, and SpaceX. The key breakthrough is the application of high-temperature superconductors, creating magnetic fields of record strength. This has allowed the reactor size to be reduced without losing efficiency. As the company notes, reducing the scale not only accelerates construction but also increases energy efficiency, making the technology more economically attractive than alternatives.

**'Unconventional' nickel superconductor excites physicists**
Physicists at the Southern University of Science and Technology (Sustech) in Shenzhen, China, have discovered a new family of superconductors that can carry electricity without resistance at a relatively high temperature of 45 kelvin (-228 °C) and at room pressure. This new data point could help explain how high-temperature superconductors work and ultimately design materials that operate under ambient conditions. The ability to precisely engineer the material's properties is a huge boon in trying to use nickelates to unravel the theory behind unconventional superconductivity. Dafeng Li, a physicist at the City University of Hong Kong, says, 'There's a huge hope that we could eventually raise the critical temperature and make [such materials] more useful for applications.' Zhuoyu Chen, a physicist at Sustech and study co-author, says, 'Getting the nickelate to superconduct at room pressure means samples can be better probed, to understand behaviour of their electrons, using methods that would be challenging under high pressure.'
