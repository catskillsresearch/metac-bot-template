**Gazprom Abandons Turkish Gas Distribution Center Plan**
According to Bloomberg, Russian gas company Gazprom has quietly abandoned its plan to build a gas distribution center in Turkey, which was intended to help the company regain its foothold in the European energy market, which it largely lost since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The company 'effectively froze' its efforts on the project, after months of studying the feasibility of using Turkish territory as an alternative entry point to Europe, especially with the expected shutdown of the Nord Stream pipelines and the halt of gas transit through Ukraine by the end of 2024. Despite the public political support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, the project faced technical and political challenges that hindered its implementation. Some Gazprom managers were skeptical of the project's viability from the start, even before the details of the project's organizational and infrastructure requirements became clear. According to sources, Turkey did not have sufficient export capacity to the southern European market, and Ankara refused to grant Gazprom the right to market gas jointly, which limited the potential Russian influence in the proposed center. Additionally, Turkey was planning to market gas itself, while Gazprom would only be a supplier, which the Russian company considered a loss of control. Meanwhile, the European Union is moving forward with a plan to ban Russian gas imports entirely by 2027, reducing Moscow's chances of regaining its energy influence in the continent. The idea of the Turkish center was first proposed by Putin in October 2022, after the Nord Stream explosions, when he expressed his desire to establish an alternative route to deliver up to 55 billion cubic meters per year to Europe through the Black Sea and Turkey. However, the project was not originally Gazprom's idea, but rather born in circles close to the Kremlin, according to a well-informed source. Some export department employees were surprised by Putin's public promotion of the initiative, despite it not being economically studied in depth. Despite some Turkish officials' interest in the project and their ambition to make their country a regional hub for gas trade at competitive local prices, the plan has seen little progress. Gazprom and the office of Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, responsible for the energy sector, did not respond to Bloomberg's requests for comment. The Turkish Ministry of Energy and the state-owned pipeline operator Botas also declined to comment officially, while a Turkish official, who wished to remain anonymous, said that Turkey remains open to cooperation with Russia on the project, but acknowledged that the process 'has been delayed for a long time'. Bloomberg reported that the freeze on the project does not affect the current contracts between Gazprom and Turkey, which remains one of the company's major gas consumers. However, this development shows the extent to which Moscow's options for regaining its influence in the European gas market have narrowed in the current political climate. After being the largest gas supplier to Europe through several land and sea routes, Russia now finds itself confined to limited corners of the global market, seeking geostrategic alliances rather than commercial solutions.

**Gazprom Abandons Major Investment Project in Turkey**
According to unnamed sources speaking to Bloomberg, Gazprom has decided to abandon its major investment project in Turkey after months of feasibility studies. The project's inability to be sustainable was due to the insufficient capacity of the pipelines connecting Turkey to Bulgaria and Greece. Some company officials have stated that the project's chances of success were low from the start. The article suggests that the idea of building a natural gas center in Turkey was more closely associated with Kremlin's inner circles rather than Gazprom. The sudden announcement of the project by Russian President Vladimir Putin in October 2024 caught Gazprom off guard, and the project lacked internal support. The cancellation of the project is a significant blow to Gazprom, which relies heavily on natural gas exports to Europe, generating approximately $8 billion per month. The project was crucial for Gazprom's strategic plan to offset losses, but its cancellation has effectively ended this plan.

For the first 6 months, we are proposing a 30% increase, and for the second 6 months, starting from July 1st, we are proposing a 19% increase, plus 2 points above the inflation rate. We are also protecting other benefits, excluding work continuation and report continuation premiums.' Tugay expressed his frustration, saying, 'We have gone beyond the numbers I previously mentioned. I am tired of the negotiations. I have been explaining the economic situation of İzmir Büyükşehir Belediyesi and Turkey for days, but no one seems to listen. The people of İzmir are also saying, 'Don't make an agreement that will put the municipality in a difficult situation.' DİSK Ege Bölge Temsilcisi and other union leaders are making political statements, which I find uncomfortable. I am not here to make politics, I am here to manage the municipality and serve the people of İzmir. I need to balance the budget and prioritize the city's needs.'

**Gazprom Shelves Plans for Turkish Gas Hub Amid EU Sanctions and Turkish Reluctance**
Gazprom has put on hold plans to create a gas hub in Turkey, which was previously praised by Russian President Vladimir Putin, closing the door on potential opportunities to regain lost market share in Europe, according to Bloomberg. The plan, which was first proposed by Putin in October 2022, aimed to create a gas hub in Turkey that would have rivaled the capacity of the damaged Nord Stream pipeline, with a capacity of around 55 billion cubic meters per year. However, after several months of consideration, Gazprom has decided that the project is 'not feasible and largely stalled', according to sources. The decision closes the door on Gazprom's ability to regain, at least some, of its lost gas supply to Europe, which previously brought in around $8 billion per month. However, some in the company remain skeptical about the feasibility of the Turkish plan, citing concerns about the lack of free export pipelines in Turkey and Ankara's reluctance to allow Gazprom to sell gas jointly, limiting Russia's influence in the region. The European Union has also imposed a proposal to ban Russian gas imports by the end of 2027. 'Despite Putin's public praise for the idea in October, it has always faced serious problems', writes the newspaper. 'Turkey does not have free export pipelines to Southern Europe, and Ankara did not want to allow Gazprom to sell gas jointly, limiting Russia's influence in the region', say sources. 'The European Union has also imposed a proposal to ban Russian gas imports by the end of 2027', adds the newspaper. 'Gazprom has studied the details of the proposal, but has lost interest in the project', according to sources. 'As the company explored the details of the proposal, it became increasingly clear that the project was not feasible', said one source. 'The ability of Turkish pipelines to Greece and Bulgaria, which are EU members, was too limited to handle significant additional supplies', added the source. 'Such limited potential for cross-flows undermines the prospect of a full-scale Turkish hub with its own price index', said the source. 'Bulgaria is in talks with US investors to expand the Turkish stream', writes the newspaper. 'Last year, at a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Putin repeated that the Turkish idea is still on the agenda and will help create 'balanced pricing mechanisms' for Russian gas', writes the newspaper. However, there were already signs that ambitions were being scaled back, as previously they had excluded storing large volumes of Russian gas in Turkey, which is a prerequisite for a large hub, writes the newspaper. 'Gazprom's leaders have long stopped discussing the Turkish hub both within the country and at meetings with state officials', say sources. 'Turkey's position on gas plans has not changed, and it is still willing to cooperate with Russia within a joint venture for this initiative', said a Turkish official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as the discussion is private. However, as acknowledged by the official, the process has been delayed for some time. 'The shelving of the project does not affect Gazprom's current business with Turkey, which remains one of its largest gas buyers', notes Bloomberg. However, it shows that in Russia, once the largest supplier of pipeline gas to Europe, there was an opportunity to regain its influence in the region in the current political climate, according to Bloomberg.

**Turkey Excluded from NATO Exercise, Raising Questions about Alliance's Stance**
The NATO exercise 'Immediate Response 25' began on May 26, led by the US, with the participation of Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro, and North Macedonia. The exercise, which involves over 12,000 troops, includes scenarios such as airborne operations, river crossing, and cyber defense. However, Turkey was not invited to participate. Some experts suggest that NATO is trying to shift its eastern border to Greece and systematically exclude Turkey. The exercise includes scenarios such as cross-border operations and defense of occupied areas. A report in the media suggested that the enemy country in the exercise was implied to be Turkey. However, NATO's official documents do not directly mention Turkey. This is not the first time Turkey has been excluded from a NATO exercise, as seen in the Iniochos 2025 air exercise in Greece in April. The exclusion of Turkey from the exercise has raised questions about NATO's stance towards Turkey. The Anatolian Phoenix 2025 exercise held in Konya, Turkey from May 12-23, was seen as a move by Turkey to establish its own position and create its own game. This development has put Turkey's new position under scrutiny.

**Sirens Will Sound on June 2 in Bulgaria to Honor Hristo Botev and Fallen Heroes - Novinite.com - Sofia News Agency**
On June 2, Bulgaria will honor Hristo Botev and fallen heroes with a nationwide siren signal at 12 noon, followed by two minutes of silence. This tradition is in compliance with Article 34 of the Regulation outlining the operation of the National System for Early Warning and Notification of Executive Authorities and the Population in cases of disasters and air danger. As PR expert Diana Damyanova said, 'Simple Message, No Action': the messaging around Bulgaria's planned euro adoption should be straightforward and reassuring. Meanwhile, Bulgarians are preparing to celebrate Spasovden, the 40th day after Easter, and pay tribute to Hristo Botev and all those who gave their lives for the country's freedom and independence.

**Gazprom Pauses Work on Turkish Gas Hub Project**
Gazprom has reportedly paused work on the Turkish Gas Hub project, according to Bloomberg sources. The project, which aimed to create a new gas distribution node in Turkey, was not initiated by Gazprom, but rather by political circles close to the Kremlin. However, Gazprom's export division was actively working on the plan, which also received support from Turkey, which seeks to become a regional hub for gas trade with its own price index. Despite this, the project faced significant challenges, including limited pipeline capacity from Turkey to Greece and Bulgaria, which hindered significant additional supplies. Initially, Turkey planned to sell the gas supplied to the hub itself, while Gazprom would only act as a supplier. However, Russia did not want to provide Turkey with such significant control, while Turkey did not want Gazprom to sell gas jointly with other companies, limiting Russia's influence on the hub. After several months of consideration, Gazprom concluded that the Turkish Gas Hub project is not feasible and has largely suspended work. The project has been largely out of the public eye since October 2024, when Turkish Energy Minister A. Bayraktar announced that he expected significant progress on the gas hub in the coming months. The project's fate remains uncertain, with both sides showing interest. Turkey aims to become a regional energy hub, developing its infrastructure, including pipelines, and concluding agreements with various gas suppliers. Russia is interested in de-identifying its gas through the Turkish Gas Hub, which would allow it to bypass the EU's REPowerEU plan, which aims to phase out Russian gas by the end of 2027. The main obstacle to the project is the lack of receiving gas transportation capacities in the EU, which the EU categorically does not support, as it plans to abandon fossil fuels by 2050.

**Bulgaria's Gas Woes: A Contract with BOTAŞ Spells Trouble**
A recent audit of the contract between Bulgarian gas company Bulgargaz and Turkish company BOTAŞ has revealed that the deal has been unprofitable for Bulgaria. The contract, signed in 2023, guaranteed Bulgaria access to Turkish liquefied natural gas (LNG) and reserved a gas pipeline for transit until 2035. However, Bulgargaz has stopped paying for the service due to financial difficulties, despite being obligated to pay 1 million levs (approximately $580,000) per day. Experts say that the contract is overly restrictive, with no provision for revising the terms. Bulgargaz has reserved 1 billion cubic meters of gas per year from the Alexandroupolis terminal, which is more than Bulgaria can currently use. The transit fee through Turkey is also nearly three times higher than through Greece. Bulgargaz owes BOTAŞ 4 billion levs, and experts wonder what motivated Bulgaria to sign such a disadvantageous contract.

**Borissov to Erdogan: Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal - Novinite.com - Sofia News Agency**
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has stated that Bulgaria needs to get out of the Botas gas deal, calling it 'extremely unfavorable' for the country. Borissov made the comments during a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, where they discussed key issues including boosting trade and deepening ties between the two nations. The contract between Bulgaria and Turkish gas company Botas has come under scrutiny in parliament, with Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov criticizing the deal as 'unfavorable' for Bulgaria. Borissov's comments come as the Bulgarian government faces financial struggles, with Bulgargaz reportedly struggling to pay for the gas deal. 'This contract is extremely unfavorable for Bulgaria,' Borissov said, without elaborating on the specifics of the deal. The Bulgarian government has secured funding to meet the demands of Sofia's transport workers, effectively ending the strike that has disrupted public transport in the Bulgarian capital. However, the country still faces challenges, including a looming waste crisis and ongoing transport issues.

**Gazprom's Miller Invites Botas to SPIEF 2025**
Alexei Miller, the chairman of the board of directors of Gazprom, has invited the chairman of the board of directors and managing director of Botas, Abdulvahit Fidan, to the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) in June 2025. The invitation was made during a meeting between Miller and Fidan on April 16 in St. Petersburg. According to a statement from Botas, the meeting highlighted the importance of the strategic partnership between the two companies, which has been in place for almost 40 years. The companies discussed current cooperation issues and evaluated specific steps to be taken to achieve short-term and long-term goals based on mutual benefit. The partnership between Gazprom and Botas has been successful in implementing projects such as the Blue Stream and the TurkStream. In particular, the two companies have jointly built a transit gas pipeline in Turkey, from the Black Sea coast to the border with Bulgaria. The current contracts between Gazprom and Botas for the supply of 16 billion cubic meters of gas per year through the Blue Stream and 5.75 billion cubic meters per year through the TurkStream are set to expire in 2025. Additionally, the existing agreements with some private importers are also set to expire in late 2025 or early 2026. In 2024, Turkey imported 52 billion cubic meters of natural gas, including 21 billion cubic meters from Russia.

**Bulgaria Faces Massive Debt to Turkey for Natural Gas**
Bulgaria is facing a massive debt to Turkey for natural gas, with a 'take or pay' clause in the contract between Bulgargaz and Botaş at the root of the problem. According to this clause, Bulgaria is required to pay the agreed-upon fees regardless of whether it uses Turkish infrastructure to import gas. Bulgarian Energy Minister Stankov has criticized the contract, saying that if he were in office at the time, he would not have approved it. He also noted that the contract obliges Bulgaria to pay the fees regardless of whether it uses Turkish terminals and gas infrastructure, which has further exacerbated Bulgargaz's already difficult financial situation, as he stated, 'Bu durum Bulgargaz'ın zaten zor olan mali durumunu daha da ağırlaştırdı.' ('This situation has further worsened Bulgargaz's already difficult financial situation.')

**Bulgargaz on Brink of Bankruptcy Due to Debt to Botaş**
Bulgargaz, the largest natural gas supplier in Bulgaria, is on the brink of bankruptcy due to its large debts to Turkey's Botaş. Bulgarian Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov stated that the 2023 natural gas cooperation agreement has negatively affected the country's financial balance and that the company may face severe economic difficulties if it cannot cope with these debts. Bulgargaz expects to incur a loss of 280 million leva (approximately 5.6 billion TL) in 2024. The company notes that its debt to Botaş is increasing. Stankov stated that the current debt amount is 220 million leva and is expected to reach 250 million leva in the coming period. He also emphasized that the non-payment of debts over the past nine months has increased the debt and will create significant instability in Bulgaria's energy sector. Stankov criticized the 'take or pay' clause in the contract between Bulgargaz and Botaş, stating that it obliges Bulgaria to pay even if it does not use its gas infrastructure. He noted that this has further exacerbated the company's financial situation. While Bulgargaz continues to struggle with payment issues, the Bulgarian government plans to hold talks with Turkish officials to resolve the problem. Stankov is expected to meet with Turkish officials in April and has stated that the agreement may need to be revised, and if necessary, a lawsuit may be filed. The impact of these developments on energy cooperation between the two countries and Bulgaria's natural gas supply remains unclear.

**Bulgaria's Bulgargaz Halts Payments to Turkey's Botaş, Leaving 4 Billion Lira Debt**
Bulgaria's energy company Bulgargaz has halted payments to Turkey's Botaş since July 2024, leaving a debt of 220 million leva (approximately 4 billion Turkish Lira) and expected to rise to 250 million leva after the latest invoice. Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov stated that the financial pressure on the company is largely due to Turkey's debt to Botaş. A meeting between the two countries is planned for April to discuss the issue. The contract between Bulgargaz and Botaş includes a 'take or pay' clause, which requires Bulgaria to pay the agreed-upon amount regardless of whether they receive gas from Turkey. Stankov criticized the contract, saying that if he were in office at the time, he would not have approved it. He also stated that the contract's requirement for Bulgaria to pay regardless of gas usage has worsened the company's already difficult financial situation. Bulgaria is currently working to terminate the 13-year contract signed in January 2023, which required Turkey to transfer 1.5 billion cubic meters of gas to Bulgaria annually.

**Bulgaria Reaches Agreement with Shell and NewMed to Pay Off Natural Gas Debt to Turkey**
Bulgaria, which has not paid its natural gas debt to Turkey, has reached an agreement with British-Dutch company Shell and Israeli company NewMed. The Bulgarian state-owned energy company Bulgargaz has not made payments to Turkish energy company BOTAŞ since July, citing the need to review the contract. Bulgarian Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov stated that the country does not have the financial capacity to pay this debt. According to Stankov, Bulgaria will sign a contract with Shell within the next two to three weeks, which will allow Shell to begin exploration and drilling operations in the Khan Tervel block. Stankov also announced that NewMed has partnered with OMV Petrom in the Khan Asparuh block, with both companies having equal rights to exploration and drilling. Bulgargaz owes BOTAŞ a total of 76.7 billion Turkish lira under a contract that will last until 2035. Stankov expressed hope that the energy agreements with Turkey will be renegotiated, and that he plans to meet with the Turkish Energy Minister in April. When asked if Bulgargaz might go bankrupt, Stankov stated that the government will always support energy companies, and that he believes that the contracts can be renegotiated.
