**Harvard University Banned from Recruiting International Students: A Blow to Academic Freedom?**
The US Department of Homeland Security has suspended Harvard University's eligibility to recruit international students, revoking its 'Student and Exchange Visitor Program' (SEVP) certification. This means that Harvard will not be able to recruit international students holding F or J visas in the 2025-2026 academic year and beyond. Existing international students are also required to transfer to other US universities certified by SEVP within a limited time, or they will lose their legal residence status in the United States. This decision has sparked controversy about political interference in academic freedom. Harvard University rejected a number of rectification requests from the government, including reforming its management structure and adjusting admissions policies, which led to the government freezing Harvard's federal grants and threatening to cancel its tax-exempt status. According to Harvard University, it currently has about 6,800 international students, accounting for 27% of the total number of students.

**The Administrations Attack on American Universities and Human Progress**
Harvard University obtained a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration on May 23, 2025, halting the revocation of its certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). This move would have had significant implications for thousands of international students and the universities that host them. The lawsuit argues that the administration's actions are unconstitutional retaliation for the university's refusal to comply with demands to control its governance, curriculum, and faculty ideology, violating the First Amendment, Due Process Clause, and Administrative Procedure Act. This is part of a larger wave of legal challenges from prestigious universities across the nation, defending academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and the nation's ability to attract global talent. The administration's actions appear to be a strategic use of federal power to reshape university policies and academic environments according to a specific political agenda.

**The Trump administration's move to ban international students at Harvard escalates attacks on universities**
The Trump administration's move to ban international students at Harvard University has escalated attacks on universities, with concerning implications for migration and human rights, academic freedom, and research. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which would have prohibited the university from sponsoring F- and J- visas for the 2025-26 academic year. This move is part of a broader attack on academic freedom, scientific research, and teaching and learning, and has sparked concerns about the futures of thousands of scholars and students. As one academic noted, 'Visa revocations are becoming an increasingly weaponized part of the U.S. immigration system, a new social sorting coupled with innovations like the surveillance of social media to make determinations about who is allowed to stay.' Harvard has vowed to continue fighting to protect its student body and academic freedom in this latest onslaught. The university's international students and faculty are vital to the richness and rigour of university life and research, bringing diverse perspectives, experiences, and methodologies that deepen scholarly inquiry and expand the boundaries of knowledge.

**Japanese university mulling to accept Harvard foreign students after Trump ban**
The University of Tokyo is considering accepting Harvard University students who may be affected by the US administration's decision to revoke Harvard's certification of its Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which would bar foreign students from enrolling or force existing students to transfer or lose their legal status. A US judge has temporarily blocked the move, and the legality of the decision is under review. The University of Tokyo has a history of supporting students affected by global conflicts, including a program launched in 2022 to support researchers and students disrupted by the Russia-Ukraine war, which provided over 30 students and researchers with access to research labs and accommodation. The university is still exploring details of its potential support for Harvard students.

**Harvard University Loses Student and Exchange Visitor Program Certification for Pro-Terrorist Conduct HS Today**
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has terminated Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification due to concerns about campus safety and compliance with federal requirements. The decision means that Harvard is no longer authorized to enroll new international students under SEVP, and current international students will need to transfer to another certified institution or risk losing their legal immigration status. According to DHS, Harvard failed to address incidents of harassment and disruption on campus and did not provide requested information related to the conduct of foreign students. Secretary Noem stated, 'This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus.' The university had previously lost $2.7 million in grant funding due to similar concerns. Harvard had the opportunity to respond to DHS's requests for information but failed to do so.

**Trump admin halts student visa interviews for social media vetting | The College Fix**
The Trump administration has ordered a halt to student visa interviews for social media vetting, which could significantly impact the Class of 2029 at Harvard University. According to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, 'Effective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consular sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor (F, M and J) visa appointment capacity until further guidance... which we anticipate in the coming days.' This move has been met with mixed reactions, with some conservative advocates celebrating the decision, while others, such as the Association of International Educators, have strongly criticized it. The Harvard Crimson notes that the pause on student visa applicant interviews could impact international students admitted to the school's Class of 2029, who were likely still arranging their appointment schedules when the pause was implemented. This move comes after the Trump administration withdrew Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which would have prevented the school from admitting international students, but was later blocked by a federal judge.

**US Department of Homeland Security Revokes Harvard's Certification for Student Exchange Program**
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has accused Harvard University of being 'antisemitic and pro-Chinese' and has revoked its certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). This means that Harvard is no longer authorized to admit new international students under the SEVP, and current students must transfer to another certified institution or risk losing their legal migratory status. According to the DHS, the decision was based on concerns about campus safety and compliance with federal requirements. The university was accused of not addressing incidents of harassment and disturbance on campus and not providing requested information about the conduct of foreign students. 'This administration holds Harvard accountable for promoting violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,' said Secretary Kristi Noem. 'It's a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to increase their multimillion-dollar endowments. Harvard had many opportunities to do the right thing. They refused. They have lost their SEVP certification for not complying with the law. Let this be a warning to all universities and academic institutions in the country.'

**'I'll say the quiet part out loud': Donald Trump dumps hallucinated mush as reason for blocking the 'best and brightest' from America**
The Trump administration, led by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, revoked Harvard University's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), effectively preventing new international students from enrolling. Harvard filed a lawsuit, citing First Amendment rights violations and political retaliation. A temporary restraining order was issued, allowing current international students to remain enrolled. Donald Trump justified the decision by implying that international students are academically weak, stating that they 'can't add' and need remedial math. However, this is a misrepresentation, as Harvard is extremely selective and students are held to high standards. Trump's true reason is that he views students who protest and hold opposing ideologies as 'underqualified'. A hearing is scheduled for May 29, 2025, to determine the fate of the restraining order.

**Federal Judge Blocks Trump's Measure Against Harvard**
A federal judge has blocked a measure by Trump to restrict international students at Harvard University. Trump's administration had planned to revoke the certification of the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS) and suspend the enrollment of foreign students at Harvard. However, the university has argued that this would cause 'immediate and irreparable harm' and has been granted two new hearings to contest the decision. Harvard has condemned Trump's decision, stating that it would eliminate the permits for international students. The judge has scheduled another hearing for May 29. 'Harvard has demonstrated that, unless its request to temporarily restrict (Trump's order) is accepted, it will suffer immediate and irreparable harm,' the judge said.

**Uncertainty for Indian students as Harvard loses right to enrol foreign students, sues US government**
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has revoked Harvard University's certification to admit foreign students for the 2025-26 academic year, affecting over 788 Indian students. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated, 'Harvard had plenty of opportunities to do the right thing. It refused. They have lost their Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification as a result of their failure to adhere to the law.' Harvard has sued the US administration in the district court of Massachusetts, and a judge has temporarily blocked the order. However, the university's spokesperson stated, 'Effective immediately, most of Harvard's thousands of enrolled F-1 and J-1 visa students (and their more than 300 dependents) will have little choice but to secure transfer to another school or risk being rendered without lawful status in the United States.' The university's international students have been thrown into disarray, and many Indian students are worried about their future. Dhruva Bhat, director of Lumiere Education, stated, 'The biggest effect of this is that it creates uncertainty for students. The courts will rule on these issues soon, and there are midterm elections coming up in 2025, so these changes may not stay.'

**Trump Administration Threatens To Strip Harvard Law's Ability To Enroll And Teach International Students - Above the Law**
The Trump Administration has threatened to strip Harvard Law School of its ability to enroll and teach international students. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered the university to terminate its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification, citing the university's failure to adhere to the law. This decision could potentially affect hundreds of students, including 15.5% of the 2027 class, who would have to transfer or lose their legal status. Noem stated, 'It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments.' Harvard Law will admit wait-listed students to take the seats earned by international students, sparking controversy among some students who feel that their acceptance is now tainted by the administration's actions.

**Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program Certification Revoked**
US Interior Secretary Kristi Noem announced that Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification has been revoked, effective immediately. Noem made the announcement on her X account, stating, 'I am announcing that the SEVP certification of Harvard University is being revoked, effective immediately.' Noem claimed that the Trump administration holds Harvard responsible for 'inciting violence and antisemitism on campus and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party.' Noem argued that universities accepting foreign students is a privilege, not a right, and that Harvard had the opportunity to do the right thing but chose not to. The university had been threatened with the suspension of federal funding due to its support for campus protests and diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. Harvard had also been sued by the federal government over the suspension of funding, which was valued at $2.2 billion and included a $60 million contract. Harvard is currently ranked as the third-best university in the world according to the 2025 Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings.

**Trump Administration Revokes Harvard's Certification Over 'Pro-Terrorist Behavior'**
The Trump Administration announced on May 22, 2025, that it is revoking the certification of Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) due to 'pro-terrorist behavior' on campus. According to Kristi Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security, Harvard has 'perpetuated an unsafe environment' that is 'hostile to Jewish students, promotes support for Hamas, and applies racist diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.' The measure, which affects international students, was taken in response to protests on campus against the Israeli offensive in Gaza. Noem stated that Harvard failed to provide information on its activities over the past few years. The university has 72 hours to provide the required information to recover its certification. If not, it will not be able to enroll international students for the 2025-2026 academic year. Noem warned that providing false information could result in penalties or civil sanctions. She also accused Harvard of 'fostering violence and antisemitism' on campus and of coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. 'Admitting international students is a privilege, not a right,' Noem said, highlighting that universities benefit from increased international enrollment. The decision is part of the tensions between the Trump Administration and universities over pro-Palestinian protests. Noem emphasized that the measure is a warning to all academic institutions in the country to comply with federal requirements.

**Trump admin blocks Harvard from enrolling int'l students**
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), effectively barring the institution from enrolling new international students. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated, 'Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country, enrolling international students is a privilege -- not a right -- and that privilege has been revoked due to Harvard's repeated failure to comply with federal law.' Harvard responded by calling the administration's action 'unlawful and harmful,' and stated, 'We are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community.' As of the fall 2023 semester, international students made up over 27 percent of Harvard's student body. The administration had previously frozen 2.2 billion U.S. dollars in federal grants to Harvard after the university rejected demands to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and evaluate international students for ideological concerns.

**Trump Administration Revokes Harvard's Student Exchange Program Certification**
The US Department of Homeland Security, led by Secretary Kristi Noem, revoked the certification of Harvard University's student exchange program on May 22, 2025, effectively blocking the university from enrolling international students. According to The New York Times, this decision impacts the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), which allows American universities to register and secure study visas for foreign students. Without this certification, Harvard cannot issue the necessary documents for student visa applications, affecting thousands of students worldwide. This move comes after the government froze $2.2 billion in federal scholarships for Harvard in April, following the university's refusal to comply with Trump's demands to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and evaluate international students based on ideological concerns. Harvard has not officially commented on the revocation, but the university was notified that the decision takes immediate effect.

**Harvard University Faces Threats Over Palestinian Solidarity Protests**
US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has threatened to revoke Harvard University's ability to accept international students if they do not comply with a request to provide detailed records of international students' involvement in 'unlawful and violent activities'. The university has been given 30 April 2025 to comply with the request, or risk having its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification revoked. This certification allows universities to issue visa application documents to international students. Harvard University has a total of 6,793 international students, making up 27.2% of the total student body. The university has stated that it will not compromise its independence and will not abandon its constitutional rights. Noem's threat comes after the university refused to comply with Trump administration's demands to implement certain policies, including a ban on Palestinian solidarity protests. The Trump administration has also revoked the visas of hundreds of students, academics, and researchers at dozens of US universities and colleges, citing allegations of supporting terrorism and other serious offenses.
