**Balochistan Engages Religious Scholars To Promote ‘Family Planning’ Efforts - Daily Parliament Times**
The Balochistan government has launched a new initiative to promote family planning efforts by engaging 150 religious scholars across 31 districts. These scholars, designated as Family Planning Assistants, receive honorariums and Islamic literature emphasizing the Islamic legitimacy of responsible family planning, reproductive health, parental responsibility, and child welfare. Maulana Mula Dad, one of the scholars, says, 'We deliver our message through the lens of Islamic values – that every individual is entitled to a healthy life, proper education, and financial stability.' The initiative aims to promote healthier families and create a sustainable balance between population growth and available resources. The province's population has grown from 1.2 million in the early 1950s to 14.8 million in 2023, with an annual growth rate of 3.2%. If this trajectory persists, the population could double by 2045, placing unsustainable pressure on employment, housing, education, and healthcare services. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns that if growth remains above 2%, the province will require 6.5 million new employment opportunities, one million homes, and over 7,000 educational institutions by 2040.

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak predicts a dystopian future for humanity, with the global population shrinking to 100 million by 2300 due to AI replacing jobs and causing a collapse in birth rates. According to Prof. Kak, 'Computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will be doing literally all that we do because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He warns that major cities like New York and London will become ghost towns, and that the world will be devastated. Prof. Kak, author of 'The Age of Artificial Intelligence', says that people are unaware of the consequences of AI and that it's likely that the world population will collapse. He also mentions that billionaire Elon Musk has expressed similar concerns, suggesting that humans should consider colonizing space to avoid extinction. Prof. Kak states, 'It's likely. I have all the data in the book. This is not just my personal opinion.'

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**FonARCom Brings AI Debate to Festival del Lavoro**
The 16th edition of the Festival del Lavoro in Genoa hosted a debate on the ethics of artificial intelligence, organized by FonARCom. The panel, moderated by Michele Damiani, included experts such as Andrea Cafà, Fabrizio Di Modica, and Roberto Marseglia. The discussion centered on the risks and opportunities of AI in the workplace, particularly the AI Act, a European regulation that introduces obligations, sanctions, and training for workers using or developing AI systems. The panel emphasized the need for employee training, developing new skills, and safely managing the digital transition. According to the European Commission, by 2030, over 50% of professions will require advanced digital skills. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will create around 170 million new jobs by the end of the decade, but also eliminate around 92 million. A Gallup survey found a 7% increase in workers concerned about technological obsolescence over four years.

**AI to Create 78 Million New Jobs, but Risks Leaving Millions Behind**
According to the 'Future of Jobs Report 2025' by the World Economic Forum, artificial intelligence (AI) will create 170 million new jobs and eliminate 92 million by 2030, resulting in a net gain of 78 million jobs. However, there is a problem. The AI revolution is different from previous historical transitions, as it will eliminate jobs much faster. The risk is that professionals may not have enough time to retrain, which could lead to waves of unemployment before the labor market stabilizes. The article highlights that AI has been presented as a great assistant for repetitive tasks, but it is not transforming the organizational model. New professional figures will emerge when companies decide to adapt their processes in a radical way, but this change requires time and must overcome obstacles such as organizational inertia or delays in training. The transition may weigh on millions of workers. The article also notes that the AI revolution will not only impact manual labor but also intellectual professions, with Goldman Sachs estimating that AI could automate 300 million full-time jobs worldwide. Even professionals with technical training are at risk of obsolescence, with some IT skills having a 'useful life' of less than three years, according to IBM and Boston Consulting Group. The article concludes that a strategy is needed, made up of active policies, investments in training and professional retraining, to address the challenge of the transition without leaving behind generations of workers.

**If you think AI will only replace mundane jobs, you'd better think again - Businessday NG**
The widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is not only replacing mundane jobs, but also high-level and specialized positions. According to the World Economic Forum, AI will render 92 million jobs obsolete by 2030. McKinsey's think tank projected that automation and AI will erode 12 million jobs in the US alone, while worldwide, 375 million workers or 14% of the global workforce will have to change careers in the same period. AI is increasingly being used in various industries, including coding, writing, teaching, graphic designing, and even religion. For instance, AI-assisted coding tools like GitHub, Copilot, and Windsurf are making it possible for anyone to write advanced code, while ChatGPT and other generative AI bots can generate human-like text and edit articles. Emily Hanley, a freelance writer and copywriter, shared her experience of struggling to find work due to the increasing popularity of ChatGPT. The article concludes that while millions of jobs will be lost to AI, hundreds of millions more will be created, but only for those who have mastered the AI skill. 'We all need to reskill before AI turns us into obsolete relics,' the article warns.
