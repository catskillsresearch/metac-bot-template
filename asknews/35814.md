**Fremtidens eldreomsorg: Bytter ut helsefagarbeidere med ufaglærte i hjemmesykepleien**
A pilot project in Norway is testing the use of untrained individuals to assist with home care for the elderly. The project, led by Nyby and Nordre Follo municipality, aims to reduce the workload of healthcare professionals and provide more personalized care for patients. According to Fredrik Gulowsen, 'we are spooling forward ten years to 2035, when we will have double the number of healthcare tasks without having double the number of healthcare professionals.' The project involves training individuals from outside the workforce and education system to perform tasks such as bathing and administering medication. Turid Tilley, a 88-year-old patient, expressed her support for the project, saying, 'I think it's right. You don't need a healthcare background to put on socks.' The project is being followed by around 30 municipalities across the country, and is seen as a potential solution to the growing demand for healthcare services in the future.

**Harde fronter i fregatt-debatten**
The debate over which fregatt to choose for Norway's largest procurement has intensified. The cost of five or six new fregatters will exceed 100 billion kroner. Defense Minister Tore O. Sandvik has stated that the decision on which country to choose will be made by the Ap-regjeringen before the fall's stortingsvalg. Two researchers at the Sjøkrigsskolen in Bergen, Tor Ivar Strømmen and Ståle Ulriksen, are critical of the US Navy's new fregattklasse Constellation, saying that the three alternatives are better on all parameters. They are particularly critical of the anti-ubåt-egenskaper, størrelse, pris, and tid for ferdigstillelse. Strømmen believes that if Norway chooses American, it will be based on the idea of 'buying security' from President Donald Trump. The researchers' statements have sparked anger and harsh characterizations from members of the Sjømilitære Samfund, who have expressed concerns about the Norwegian fregatters being built in Tomrefjord. The Maritim strategigruppe has engaged in a number of military studies and has provided significant contributions to the Forsvarskommisjonens rapport. They have also expressed concerns about the Norwegian fregatters being built in Tomrefjord. Paulsen has argued that the Constellation is the best choice due to its anti-ubåt-egenskaper and luftvernet, and that the Norwegian mannskap will gain valuable experience through good cooperation with the British. 'It would be a catastrophe to choose American now,' said Forsvarets Forum. 'The decision should be based on the best choice for Norway, not on who we can 'buy security' from,' said Strømmen.

**Israel Accuses Europe of Anti-Semitic Hate**
Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar stated that the recent attacks on Israeli diplomats are a direct result of 'poisonous, anti-Semitic hate' against Israel and Jews worldwide since the 7 October massacre. Sa'ar emphasized that the global atmosphere against Israel has worsened significantly since Hamas' attack on 7 October, which killed 1,200 people and took 251 as hostages. Since then, Israel's ground and air attacks have killed over 53,000 Palestinians and destroyed large parts of Gaza. Sa'ar claimed that the attacks on the Israeli diplomats are 'directly linked to anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic hate.' Norway condemned the attack, with Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide expressing his condolences to the victims. However, Norway's Foreign Ministry emphasized that there is a difference between anti-Semitism and criticism of Israel's actions in the Gaza war. France also condemned Sa'ar's statements, calling them 'outrageous and unjustified.' Experts, such as Iver B. Neumann, director of the Fridtjof Nansens Institute, believe that Sa'ar's statements should be understood in the context of Israel's diplomatic stance since 7 October, which they see as a pretext for unjustified power and violence against the Palestinian population.

**Fincantieri Marine Group Opens Office in Oslo to Prepare for Norwegian Frigate Decision**
Fincantieri Marine Group, the owner of VARD, has opened an office in Oslo to strengthen communication with authorities and industry partners. The move is aimed at preparing the company for Norway's decision on who will build the new frigates. As Norway is set to build new frigates to replace the aging Fridtjof Nansen-class, the government is evaluating several frigate types from NATO allies, including the US. Fincantieri Marine Group's Dave Forster, responsible for the frigate project in Norway, stated, 'When Norway now sees the opportunity to strengthen its international strategic partnerships and renew its most important marine vessels with a modern and powerful frigate class, we believe that the Constellation-class, built in Norway, by and for the Norwegians, gives the Kingdom a unique opportunity to secure the best solution.' The Constellation-class is being built by Fincantieri Marinette Marine, a US-based subsidiary of Fincantieri Marine Group, for the US Navy. Fincantieri Marine Group has a strong desire to build the new Norwegian frigates, which will be done in collaboration with VARD.

**Norway to Implement EU's ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation**
The Norwegian government plans to implement the EU's ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which sets a 2% requirement for the use of alternative fuels in aviation. This is in line with the EU's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. The regulation, which came into effect in the EU on January 1, 2025, aims to increase the use of alternative fuels such as biodiesel, which can replace fossil fuels and reduce emissions. 'We want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, and that's why we established our own requirement for aviation in 2020,' said Transport Minister Jon-Ivar Nygård. 'Now we want to implement the EU's regulation as soon as possible.' The regulation will be implemented in Norway as soon as possible, and at the latest by 2027. 'This will ensure that Norwegian aviation companies have the same competitive conditions as their European counterparts,' said Nygård. Climate and Environment Minister Andreas Bjelland Eriksen added, 'The use of alternative fuels like biodiesel can be a good solution to replace fossil fuels and reduce emissions.'

**New Transfer Boat Set for Hornsea 2 Offshore Wind Service**
ESVAGT, OSK Design, and Hvide Sande Shipyard have collaborated to develop a next-generation transfer boat, the STB B15, designed to carry more technicians and cargo. The boat, which is being built by Hvide Sande Shipyard, features a stabilizer and interceptor system to reduce motion and improve comfort for technicians. According to ESVAGT, technicians were 'very satisfied' after testing in March 2025. The STB15 is designed for use at the Hornsea offshore wind farms and will be able to transfer cargo and technicians in rougher seas than before. It offers increased capacity for both personnel and cargo compared to the STB12. 'Our SOV concept together with transfer boats has proven its potential and created a demand for handling even more tasks with STBs,' said Søren Westphal, Senior Project Manager at ESVAGT. 'We're pleased to build on our strong and trusted relationship with ESVAGT in developing the next generation of STBs for the wind industry,' added Carl Erik Kristensen, CEO of Hvide Sande Shipyard.

**Norwegian Police Employee Faces Firing After Whistleblowing**
Alexander Karlsen, a 42-year-old employee of the Norwegian police, may be fired after being accused of making too many complaints and whistleblowing. A leaked audio recording reveals that the police will not seek a new security clearance for Karlsen, citing the cumulative effect of his complaints as a reason. Karlsen believes this is an unlawful form of retaliation and a breach of the Security Act. The police's directorate has a slogan 'Takk for at du sier ifra!' (Thank you for speaking up!), but Karlsen's experience suggests otherwise. Karlsen has made 12 complaints over the past seven years, which he believes are all justified and lawful. The police, however, claim that these complaints demonstrate a breach of Karlsen's duties and loyalty. The case is currently being handled by the Central Appointments Committee of the police. Karlsen's lawyer, Frode Aarum, has stated that the police's decision not to seek a new security clearance for Karlsen is not a punishment, but rather a consequence of the police's own actions. However, Karlsen believes that this is a clear case of retaliation and a breach of the law. The Security Act prohibits any form of negative reaction to whistleblowing, and Karlsen's lawyer, Jan Fritjof Bernt, argues that the police's actions are in clear contravention of this law. Ingvild Wetrhus Thorsvik, a member of the Justice Committee in the Norwegian Parliament, has expressed her support for Karlsen's right to whistleblow without fear of reprisal. 'It is extremely important that people in the police can speak up without fear of their security clearance being affected,' she said.

**Norway's Social Security Adjustment: A Call for Increased Pensions and Reduced Poverty**
The Norwegian government's trygdeoppgjør (social security adjustment) is set to take place from May 19 to May 22, 2025. The adjustment will affect over 1 million pensioners, 370,000 people receiving disability benefits, and others receiving benefits from the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV). The adjustment will increase the basic pension (G) from 124,028 kroner to a new amount. The pensionistforbundet (pensioners' union) is calling for a 4.4% increase in pensions, with a focus on increasing the minimum pension to above the EU's poverty threshold. The union is also demanding a guaranteed minimum pension, a higher pension for low-income pensioners, and a pension supplement for those who have been widowed. According to Jan Davidsen, leader of the pensioners' union, 'It is necessary to raise the minimum pension levels above the EU's poverty threshold to reduce income inequality among pensioners and increase their quality of life.' The trygdeoppgjør will be discussed in the Norwegian parliament (Stortinget) in mid-June, and the final decision will be made on June 20, 2025.

**Kenya-Norway pact to boost blue economy**
A Norwegian fish stocks research ship, Dr Friddtjof Nansen, has completed its Kenyan leg of a research cruise, assessing fish biomass, oceanographic conditions, and ecosystem health in the coastal and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Kenya. The expedition's primary mission was to recommend critical elements for the sustainable management of marine resources and fisheries. Blue Economy Cabinet Secretary Hassan Joho noted that the monumental survey symbolises Kenya's commitment to charting new frontiers in pursuit of a science-driven sustainable blue economy. He commended the partnership between Kenya and Norway that has enabled Kenyan scientists and resource managers to be trained on data-driven and ecosystem-based marine management. The preliminary results of the 2025 survey will help plan for sustainable management strategies and bolster Kenya's resilience to climate change and marine biodiversity loss. The event was attended by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Kenya representative Dr Tipo Tito, Royal Norwegian ambassador to Kenya, Gunnar Holm and Nansen Programme coordinator, Ms Merete Tandstad among others. 'The programme has fostered cooperation across borders, creating strong networks for shared learning and coordinated action,' Joho stated. 'The preliminary results of the 2025 survey will help plan for sustainable management strategies and bolster Kenya's resilience to climate change and marine biodiversity loss,' Joho stated. 'The programme has built the capacity of the Mombasa-based Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI) and strengthened ecosystem monitoring and policy formulation,' Joho noted. 'The survey is expected to provide extensive data on the country's continental shelf and slope, revealing a rich biodiversity among pelagic fish species,' Joho stated. 'As we look to the future, the EAF-Nansen programme offers a model for science-based decision-making. Its contributions support Kenya's leadership in ocean sustainability including President William Ruto's participation in the high-level panel for sustainable ocean economy,' Tito stated. 'The 50 years of the EAF-Nansen programme testify to the strong common interests between Kenya and Norway in oceans and sustainable blue economy,' Holm stated. 'This knowledge continues to shape fisheries policies, support sustainable practices and strengthen regional collaborations,' Tandstad said.

**Arven etter Nansen er viktigere enn noensinne**
The legacy of Fridtjof and Odd Nansen is more important than ever in today's world. Their efforts to promote humanity and human values have left a lasting impact internationally and in Norway. In a time of disinformation, war in Europe, and regression of democracies, it is crucial to educate young people to think critically and stand up for fundamental values. Visiting sites where some of the most brutal atrocities in history took place makes the past tangible and personal. Young people learn the value of our hard-won freedom. Through the years, the White Buses and Active Peace Tours have continued the legacy of Fridtjof and Odd Nansen. Fridtjof Nansen was not only a polar explorer, scientist, and Nobel Peace Prize winner, but also helped hundreds of thousands of people escape persecution and war as the High Commissioner for Refugees of the League of Nations. Odd Nansen continued his father's engagement through the Nansen Help, an organization that saved Jewish refugees before and during the war. He himself was arrested for his resistance against Nazism and deported to the concentration camp Sachsenhausen. After the war, Odd Nansen dedicated much of his time to educating young people about the dangers of dictatorship and extremism. He believed that knowledge of the past's atrocities was the best protection against new generations being deceived by 'strong men'. Since 1992, Norwegian youth have traveled with the White Buses and Active Peace Tours to former concentration camps. As the last witnesses are disappearing, it is more important than ever that young people continue to gain this insight - not just through screens or textbooks, but through their own experiences. To forget the past is to open the door for it to repeat itself. The spirit of Nansen remains relevant today.

**Norway Sues Navantia for Over €1 Billion Over Sinking of Frigate**
The Norwegian government is seeking over €1 billion from Navantia, the Spanish state-owned shipbuilder, for the sinking of one of its frigates, the Helge Ingstad, which collided with a tanker in 2018. According to Teknisk Ukeblad, the claim is based on the price of a new frigate, the cost of raising the ship, its salvage, and various deductions. The Norwegian government does not blame Navantia for the collision, but rather the crew's failure to properly navigate the ship. As Ole Kristian Rigland, a lawyer from the Norwegian government, stated, 'Our goal is to reach an agreement through mediation, and if not, the trial will begin on September 23.' The Helge Ingstad was one of five frigates of the Fridtjof Nansen class built at Navantia's Ferrol shipyard, similar to the F-100 class of the Spanish Navy. The ship was eventually scrapped after being damaged in the collision.

**Norway to Acquire New Frigates: Thyssenkrupp and Ulstein Verft Collaborate on Project**
Norway has a key plan for its Navy, which involves replacing old warships. German company Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) is strengthening its position to supply Norway's next frigates through a strategic collaboration with local firm Ulstein Verft. According to InfoDefensa, the two companies signed a letter of intent at the UDT defense technology fair in Oslo, outlining their cooperation on the project. Norway's 2024 Fleet Plan calls for the acquisition of five or six frigates to replace the Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates built by Spanish company Navantia in the early 2000s. The pre-selected candidates for this program include Germany, the US, France, and the UK, with models such as the German F127, the British Type 26, the US Constellation class, and the French IED. The letter of intent highlights that a significant portion of the value generated by the development and construction of the new frigates would be realized in Norway. This collaboration combines Thyssenkrupp's advanced marine systems technology with Ulstein Verft's local expertise in shipbuilding, a family-owned company with a long tradition in the sector. The F127 frigate, proposed by Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, is based on the Meko A-400 design, which has proven its effectiveness over 20 years in various frigate classes worldwide. This model offers a combination of advanced capabilities and operational flexibility, making it an attractive option for the Norwegian Navy, as said by InfoDefensa, 'This collaboration will bring significant benefits to the Norwegian Navy and the local industry.'

**Luxury Cruise Ships to Return to Pasaia in 2025**
Nine luxury cruise ships will make stops in Pasaia this year, triple the number that visited in 2024. The season will open on April 27 with the arrival of the 'Fridtjof Nansen' ship, which has visited the port before. The ship is part of the Hurtigruten Expeditions fleet and is known for its modern design, minimalistic and elegant style, and sustainable features. It has three restaurants, jacuzzis, a gym, and luxurious cabins. Two other ships, the 'Seadream II' and the 'Silver Wind', are expected to arrive in May. In June, Pasaia will welcome two more cruise ships, the 'Azamara Quest' and the 'Scenic Eclipse'. The 'Seadream II' will return to the port in August, and the 'World Traveller' will make a stop in September. The last two ships, the 'Sirena' and the 'Le Bellot', will arrive in October. 'Fridtjof Nansen' is a hybrid ship that can navigate in electric mode and has modern technologies to minimize its environmental impact, according to the ship's description. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our port and the dedication of our visitors,' said an official from the Port Authority of Pasaia.

**The EAF-Nansen Programme marks 50 years of advanced sustainable fisheries**
The EAF-Nansen Programme, a partnership between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and Norway, is celebrating 50 years of advancing sustainable fisheries. Launched in 1975, the programme has partnered with 58 countries, providing them with data, tools, and technical expertise to manage their fisheries sustainably. The Dr Fridtjof Nansen, a cutting-edge research vessel, has conducted scientific surveys across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, gathering crucial data on fish stocks, ocean health, and climate change impacts. Norway's Minister of International Development Åsmund Aukrust said, 'The EAF-Nansen Programme has always been at the forefront of advancing the scientific knowledge needed to sustainably manage marine ecosystems.' The programme has played an important role in enhancing food and nutrition security by strengthening national and institutional capacity.

**Norway should significantly raise its aid to Ukraine, PM says**
Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere has called for a significant increase in the country's financial aid to Ukraine. Stoere proposed to parliament that they meet to discuss and agree on a substantial boost to the Nansen programme, which is Norway's cross-party, bilateral aid programme for Ukraine. The programme currently has a framework of 155 billion Norwegian crowns from 2023 to 2030. Stoere stated, 'I want to propose to the other parties in parliament that we meet this afternoon to discuss and agree on a significant increase in the Nansen programme for Ukraine this year.' The government plans to organize the expanded support to provide the greatest possible fighting power as quickly as possible, while also further boosting Norway's own military. 'We will organise our expanded support so that it provides the greatest possible fighting power as quickly as possible,' Stoere said. The Nansen programme is named after Nobel Peace Prize laureate Fridtjof Nansen.

**How a Norwegian Scientist Used Unconventional Means to Reach the North Pole**
Fridtjof Nansen, a Norwegian scientist and oceanographer, was determined to be the first person to reach the North Pole. Conventional means were unlikely to succeed, so Nansen designed a ship, the Fram, to drift north with the current and then sledge to the pole. The Fram drifted thousands of miles, and Nansen and a companion sledged the remaining way to the pole, getting farther north than had yet been recorded. Although Nansen did not attain his goal, his voyage resulted in a six-volume treatise on the polar north, revealing that polar exploration is itself a science. The Fram's team also made significant discoveries, including finding tiny fish scales in rocks that were later found to be from an extinct fish species. The shattered crates we saw on the fiord that July day in 2000 were a vivid symbol of scientific discovery in polar regions. Nansen's voyage catalyzed decades of discovery in the Arctic and Antarctic, and he later won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts rescuing refugees, including Armenian victims of genocide. 'What if the transport of the Jeanette wreckage reflected a steady current that ran from Siberia all the way to Greenland?' Nansen asked, and his idea led to a groundbreaking expedition that changed the course of polar exploration. 'I was to use a modern version of the Nansen sledge when I later ventured to Antarctica on my own expeditions on the polar plateau,' said the author, highlighting the lasting impact of Nansen's innovative design. 'The shattered crates we saw on the fiord that July day in 2000 were a vivid symbol of scientific discovery in polar regions. Venturing the farthest north, farthest south, and then north again, the Fram catalyzed decades of discovery in the Arctic and Antarctic.'
