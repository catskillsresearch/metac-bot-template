**Trump's Budget and the Tax on Remittances: A Burden for Migrants**
US President Donald Trump's massive budget for 2026 has been approved by the House of Representatives, but it still needs to pass through the Senate. The budget includes a 3.5% tax on remittances received in Mexico and the rest of the world. However, the tax may be annulled in the Senate. The budget also includes massive cuts to services for poor Americans, which will lead to increased costs for them in the future. The tax on remittances is seen as a way to pay for the increased costs of border security, which will be implemented through the Department of Homeland Security. The budget includes $160 billion for new surveillance equipment and 10,000 new border agents. The tax on remittances will be used to pay for these costs, which will be a significant burden for Mexican and international migrants. The Senate will use the 'Reconciliation' process to pass the budget, which requires a simple majority of 51 votes. However, the process will be long and difficult, and the budget may not be approved before the end of August or September.

**Abinader Expresses Concern Over Proposed 3.5% Tax on Remittances**
Dominican President Luis Abinader expressed concern over a proposed 3.5% tax on remittances sent from the US to countries of origin, including the Dominican Republic. The tax was recently approved by the US House of Representatives. Abinader stated, 'We are in permanent contact with the Trump administration, both for the tariff issue and now for this new topic that has been around for just three weeks. We still need to understand its scope, because in one part it says it's for undocumented immigrants.' He questioned the tax's practicality, saying, 'We need to see how it will be collected. I think it's difficult to collect.' Abinader also mentioned that other Central American countries are following the situation closely due to its regional implications. The Dominican Republic received over $10 billion in remittances in 2023, making it a significant source of foreign exchange for the country. More than 1 million Dominican households rely on these transfers to cover basic needs like food, housing, education, and healthcare.

**Trump Urges Senate to Approve Tax and Immigration Reform Bill 'As Soon As Possible'**
President Donald Trump has urged the Senate to approve his comprehensive tax and immigration reform bill 'as soon as possible'. The legislation, already passed by the House of Representatives, faces an uncertain path in the Senate due to internal divisions among Republicans. The bill aims to extend the 2017 tax cuts, implement new tax exemptions, and allocate significant funds for immigration and defense policies. However, concerns about the federal deficit and cuts to social programs have generated debate among lawmakers. Trump has emphasized the importance of a quick approval to advance his political agenda, but differences within his party may delay the legislative process. Despite Trump's support, several Republican senators have expressed reservations about aspects of the bill, particularly regarding potential Medicaid cuts and the increase in the federal deficit. Some propose modifications before final approval.

**Trump Accepts EU Request to Extend Commercial Truce**
US President Donald Trump has announced that he has accepted the request of European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen to extend the 90-day commercial truce to July 9 and reach a 'good tariff agreement'. Trump had threatened to impose a 50% tariff on European products starting in June after claiming that negotiations with the EU were 'going nowhere'. However, Von der Leyen asked if the deadline for the agreement could be moved from June 1 to July 9, and Trump accepted, stating that they will hold 'quick meetings' to try to reach a solution. According to Antonio Garc√≠a Ferreras, Trump's announcement is 'little more than saying we have to recognize him as 'Trump, the magnanimous''.

**US Postpones 50% Tariff on EU Imports Until July 9, 2025**
US President Donald Trump confirmed the extension of the 50% tariff on imported products from the European Union. The new deadline will be July 9, 2025, after a request made by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump announced the decision through his Truth Social platform, explaining that he received a call from Von der Leyen on Sunday. During the conversation, the European official requested to extend the original deadline set for June 1. According to Trump, both parties agreed to start trade negotiations immediately. Later, in a press conference at Morristown Airport in New Jersey, Trump reiterated that the extension aims to 'give space for a formal negotiation'. He also stated that it was Von der Leyen who proposed the new deadline of July 9, which he accepted with the intention of advancing a possible agreement. 'This extension is part of a hardening of US commercial policy, announced in April by Trump,' said Trump. 'Although tariffs were adjusted to 10% for most countries, specific measures were maintained towards the European Union.' The US government recently applied and then suspended reciprocal tariffs of 20%, in order to open space for dialogue, as occurred in the case of the agreement reached with the UK in early May.

**Trump Recommends 50% Tariff on EU Starting June 1, 2025**
US President Donald Trump has recommended imposing a 50% tariff on the EU starting from June 1, 2025, citing 'unproductive' trade negotiations. Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, 'The European Union, created to take advantage of the US in trade, has been very difficult to manage. (...) Our conversations with them are not yielding results! Therefore, I recommend a 50% tariff for the European Union starting from June 1, 2025. No tariff will be applied if the product is manufactured in the United States.' Trump also mentioned the 'powerful trade barriers' of the EU, including VAT, corporate sanctions, non-monetary trade barriers, monetary manipulations, and unjustified demands against US companies, which have generated an 'unacceptable' trade deficit. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that 'with the exception of the EU', most countries are 'negotiating in good faith' and hopes that Trump's warning will motivate the EU to act in favor of a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Trump Visits Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day, Pledges to Repair America**
On Memorial Day, former US President Donald Trump visited Arlington National Cemetery to pay tribute to fallen soldiers. Trump joked that he was glad he didn't win the 2020 presidential election, so he could celebrate the country's 250th anniversary of independence with the public. Vice President JD Vance emphasized the need for caution when sending troops to war, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the US must prepare for war because of its commitment to peace. Trump said that the US' debt to fallen soldiers is eternal and will only grow each year. He also noted that this year's Memorial Day is special because it marks the 250th anniversary of the first American patriot's death in battle. Trump signed an executive order to hold a grand celebration for the 250th anniversary of US independence, which will be held on July 4, 2026. He expressed his excitement for the event, saying that he has 'everything' now, despite missing the 2024 World Cup and 2028 Olympics. Trump also criticized the previous government on his social media platform, calling them 'scum' for allowing 21 million illegal immigrants into the country, many of whom are criminals or mentally ill. In his speech, Trump said that he is working to repair the US, questioning who allowed immigrants to cross the border unchecked. Vance emphasized the importance of treating the military as the country's most valuable resource, and that the US should only ask the next generation to make the ultimate sacrifice when necessary. Hegseth stated that the fallen soldiers sacrificed for freedom, security, and the union, and that the US owes them peace, which must be obtained through strength.

**Evelyn Farkas: Trump Would Not Receive Overwhelming Majority in Today's Election**
Evelyn Farkas, a former Pentagon employee and current director of a Washington think tank, believes that if the US presidential election were held today, Donald Trump would not receive the overwhelming majority he received in December 2024. 'I don't think that if the election were held today, President Trump would have received the overwhelming majority he received in December 2024,' Farkas said in an interview with NV. She noted that Arab Americans in Michigan voted for Trump because they hoped he would help Palestinians in Gaza. However, Farkas pointed out that there is no reason to believe Trump would help the Palestinian people, given his foreign policy during his first term and his statements. Farkas also suggested that a similar dynamic may be at play with some US citizens of Latin American descent who voted for Trump because they believed his presidency would be good for the economy and did not want more immigrants to come in. However, Trump's administration has implemented a strict immigration policy, detaining people who are even lawful permanent residents, Farkas added. Farkas concluded that these examples suggest that Trump has likely lost his superpopularity. According to a CNN report in late April, Trump's approval rating after 100 days in office was the lowest of any US president in the last 70 years, with only 41% of respondents approving of his actions. However, a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on May 14 showed that Trump's approval rating had risen to 44% after he softened his trade policy. At the start of his second term, Trump's approval rating was 47%, according to Reuters.

**Donald Trump's Zoll-R√ºckzieher: A Peep into the Clown Show**
US President Donald Trump has pulled back from his threatened 50% import tariffs on the EU, instead extending the deadline to July 9. Trump had previously stated that he was not looking for a deal and that the EU should accept a 50% tariff. However, after a phone call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he would extend the deadline. The move has sparked ridicule and criticism from the public, with many calling Trump a 'clown' and questioning his mental state. Trump's statement read, 'I received a call from Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, asking for an extension of the deadline from June 1 for the 50% tariff on trade and the European Union. I agreed to the extension - July 9, 2025 - and it was an honor to do so. The Commission President said that the talks will begin quickly.'

**Polls: Trump Job Approval Stabilizing, But Still Underwater**
Donald Trump's job-approval ratings have stabilized in May after a decline in April, but he remains more unpopular than popular. According to the Silver Bulletin polling averages, Trump's net job approval improved from minus 9 percent on April 30 to minus 6.2 percent on May 15. However, some of the improvement is attributed to Trump-friendly polls, while other polls, such as Economist-YouGov and Reuters-Ipsos, show little change in their trend lines. Silver Bulletin's averages on the intensity of approval and disapproval are also stable, with 27-28% strongly approving and 41-42% strongly disapproving. Trump's job-approval ratings on handling particular issues, such as the economy and trade, have also shown little change. The generic congressional ballot also shows recent stability, with Democrats leading by a two-point margin (45.5% to 43.5%). As the 2026 midterm elections approach, this metric will become increasingly important.

**US Supreme Court to Hear Arguments on Birthright Citizenship**
The US Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on May 15, 2025, regarding the implementation of President Donald Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship for the children of some immigrants. The order was challenged in court, but the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority of 6-3. The main issue before the court is whether lower court judges can issue universal injunctions to block a national policy. According to NBC News, 'The Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, including three Trump appointees, is focusing solely on the question of whether lower court judges had the authority to block the policy nationwide, as three did in different cases.' Scotus Blog notes that 'there is no definitive answer' to when a decision will be made, but the court is likely to act on the government's request before its summer recess, which typically begins in late June or early July. The Center for American Progress states that since executive orders have limited scope and cannot change the Constitution or overturn a Supreme Court decision, federal district court judges in Massachusetts, Maryland, and Washington issued nationwide injunctions to block the president's measure. The Trump administration appealed these cases to the Supreme Court, requesting the suspension of nationwide preliminary injunctions and that the executive order only be suspended for the plaintiffs. 'The administration and its allies have been harshly criticizing judges for issuing 'universal injunctions' that have hindered the aggressive use of executive power by Trump,' NBC News reports. A Justice Department official commented, 'Universal injunctions issued by district court judges continue to fundamentally obstruct the president's ability to implement his agenda.'

**'Souring': Analysts warn Trump moves risk alienating key new GOP voting bloc**
Analysts Lakshya Jain and Max McCall warn that President Donald Trump's mass deportation program risks alienating a key new voting bloc for the GOP - naturalized immigrant voters. Trump made significant gains with these voters in the 2020 election, but his current policies could erase those gains. According to the analysts, 'Voters so far appear to be souring on his handling of immigration in response -- and there is reason to believe it might pose a unique threat to his party's current coalition.' A Washington Post op-ed by Jain and McCall notes that immigrant-heavy areas in New Jersey and New York, which swung heavily towards Trump in 2024, have continued to move to the right. The analysts also point out that immigrants who became citizens abandoned the Democratic Party at an even higher rate than natural-born citizens, citing issues such as the economy and crime as key factors in their voting decisions. Polling now shows that Trump's approval on immigration is rapidly declining, with a 50-45 disapproval rating. 'If immigrant voters turn on Trump, it could rapidly unravel a key new addition to the Republican coalition,' Jain and McCall wrote.

**At 100 Days, Trump Approval Rating Is As Low As First Term**
Donald Trump's approval rating has dropped to its lowest point in his second term, mirroring his first term's performance at the 100-day mark. According to the Silver Bulletin, Trump's net approval rating has fallen to -9.1%, with 53.2% of Americans disapproving of him. The trend lines are concerning, with Trump's approval rating dropping into the 30s in the latest AP-NORC poll. Trump has been attacking pollsters, claiming they are 'Negative Criminals' suffering from 'Trump Derangement Syndrome.' However, the reality is that polling outlets like Times-Siena and Fox News accurately predicted the 2024 results. Trump's approval rating is deteriorating across issue areas, including immigration, the economy, and tariffs. Independents are souring on Trump, with 56% disapproving of his job performance on immigration and 70% on tariffs. Trump's unraveling of his party's coalition could be a significant challenge for his second term.

**Poll Shows Trump's Approval Is Actually Going Up on This Key Move From His Administration**
A recent poll by CBS News shows that President Donald Trump's approval rating on immigration is his best issue, with 64% of Americans believing that his policies have reduced border crossings and 56% approving of his deportation efforts. This is a significant improvement from his overall approval rating, which is -1.4 according to RealClearPolling. Trump's deportation efforts have been particularly successful, with a +12 net approval rating, and he is doing better on this issue than he was at the start of the month. The poll also shows that Trump's base, including MAGA Republicans, are still behind him and approve of his immigration policies. This is in contrast to his successor, President Joe Biden, who had a net -31.3 approval rating on immigration during his term, making it one of his worst issues. 'Immigration was a huge issue during the campaign,' said Anthony Salvanto, the CBS News director of elections and surveys. 'The president has put it at the centerpiece of his administration policy effort. Is it bolstering him?' Salvanto replied, 'in some ways, very much so.'

**Big setback to Donald Trump: 53% Americans voted against him**
A recent survey conducted by the Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos has revealed that 53% of Americans disagree with President Donald Trump's immigration policy, while 46% agree. This decline in approval rating is a significant setback for Trump, according to the survey. The survey was conducted from April 18 to 22, 2025, and the results indicate a clear divide among Americans on the issue of immigration. As one might expect, the survey results have sparked a lot of discussion and debate, with many people weighing in on the issue. 'The American people have spoken, and they are not in favor of Trump's immigration policy,' said a spokesperson for the survey. 'This is a clear indication that the President's approach is not resonating with the majority of Americans.'

**'ONE OF HIS STRONGEST ISSUES': CNN Breaks Down How Americans Are With Trump on Immigration [WATCH]**
CNN senior data analyst Harry Enten has revealed that Americans support President Donald Trump's immigration agenda. According to Enten, Trump's net approval rating on immigration has improved significantly, from minus 12 points in his first term to plus one points now. Enten noted that the net approval for Trump on this issue has stayed steady in the positive, indicating that the American people, at least the bare majority of them, seem to like what he's doing. In contrast, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows that Americans' views of Joe Biden's handling of immigration have changed significantly, with 45% now saying the country is on the right track compared to 42% who say it's on the wrong track. Enten stated, 'So in a big switcharoo from where we were back in January, the plurality of Americans say that the country is on the right track when it comes to immigration policy.'

**Voters 'soured quickly' on Trump as his 'poor start only gets worse': analysis**
MSNBC Opinion Editor James Downie has observed a 'vibe shift' in Americans' feelings toward Donald Trump's policies, with a decline in his approval ratings on issues such as immigration and deportations. According to Downie, Trump's net approval on immigration issues is minus 5%, and on deportations specifically, it's minus 10%. Downie notes that Trump's second-term approval ratings are 'eerily similar to his first: a poor start that only gets worse.' He attributes the decline to Trump's handling of the economy, writing, 'voters soured quickly on Trump's economic policies.' Downie also criticizes politicians and some members of the media for caving to Trump's demands or portraying his agenda as popular, saying it does a disservice to their readers.

United States President Donald Trump's approval rating has dropped from 47 percent to 43 percent, according to Gallup, as Americans react to his administration's early moves, including the controversial Project 2025 agenda, proposed market-disrupting tariffs, and unusual policy interests. Trump's swift embrace of Project 2025's policies has raised concerns, potentially alienating voters and dampening initial support for his presidency. A Harvard-HarrisX poll suggested that billionaire Elon Musk's favourability rating has also dropped by 10 points from February to March amid ongoing Tesla protests. Public dissatisfaction with Trump's leadership is evident across multiple key issues, with only 38% of Americans approving of his handling of trade negotiations, 40% supporting his economic policies, and 41 percent backing his approach to the Russia-Ukraine war and Social Security. However, immigration remains his strongest-polling issue, with 49 percent approval.

**Donald Trump says 25% tariffs on Canada, Mexico 'on time' for March 4 deadline**
US President Donald Trump has confirmed that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico will go ahead as planned on March 4. Trump stated, 'We're on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that's moving along very rapidly.' He added that the tariffs are 'going forward on time and on schedule.' The tariffs could potentially worsen inflation and hurt the economy of North America. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo expressed hope that her country could strike a deal with the US government before the deadline, saying, 'We would need to be reaching important agreements this Friday...On all of the issues there is communication and what we need is to complete this agreement.' Trump plans to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada to address issues such as illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling. He also plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on India, which he has called a 'high-tariff nation.'
