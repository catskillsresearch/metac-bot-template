**Vietnam drafts first population law to tackle demographic challenges**
Vietnam is preparing to introduce its first-ever Population Law to address demographic challenges. The draft law aims to maintain replacement-level fertility, improve population quality, and adapt to a rapidly ageing population. It prioritizes universal access to pre-marital counselling, prenatal and newborn screening, and stronger efforts to prevent genetic disorders and birth defects. The law also proposes state-purchased health insurance for the elderly and introduces stronger administrative penalties for violations in the population sector. Deputy Minister of Health, Associate Professor Dr Nguyen Thi Lien Huong, said the goal is to ensure that, by 2045, Vietnam becomes a country with high-quality human resources, a strong labour force, and is a high-income economy. The draft law is built around three key pillars: maintaining replacement-level fertility, improving population quality, and adapting to a rapidly ageing population. Dr Pham Vu Hoang, Deputy Director General of the General Office for Population and Family Planning, said that Vietnam's population policy now faces a host of challenges, including falling fertility rates, regional disparities, persistent gender imbalance at birth, rapid ageing, slow improvement in population quality and ineffective migration management. The draft law is a strategic and legislative upgrade from the 2003 Population Ordinance, which remains the existing legal framework. It reflects the Party's strategic directions on population and lays the groundwork for addressing population ageing while making the most of Vietnam's golden population structure. 'Population is no longer just a figure -- it is a strategic asset central to Vietnam's global competitiveness,' said the draft law. 'This law is not merely a policy tool, but a roadmap for unlocking the nation's demographic potential and building a high-income, digitally-driven economy by 2045.'

**Europe's Aging Population: A Growing Concern**
The median age in Europe has reached 44.7 years, with some countries, such as Italy, already exceeding 48.7 years. According to Eurostat, the population of the EU will begin to decline in 2026, with a projected decrease of 50 million people by 2100. The main cause of this demographic shift is the decline in fertility rates, which have fallen below the replacement level. In 2023, the global fertility rate in the EU was 1.38 children per woman, down from 1.44 in 2003 and below the replacement level of 2.1. Eurostat estimates that the proportion of people aged 65 or older will increase from 21.6% in 2024 to 32.5% in 2100, while the proportion of people aged 80 or older will multiply by 2.5, from 6% to 15%. The tasa de dependencia, which measures the relationship between the number of young people and those of older age, will tend to worsen, with a projected ratio of two people in work for every one dependent in 2024. As stated by Eurostat, 'the process of aging is so accelerated, linked to the increases in longevity, that Eurostat predicts that the proportion of people aged 80 or more in the population of the EU will multiply by 2.5 between 2024 and 2100, passing from 6% to 15%.'

**Korea's birth crisis far from over**
South Korea's total fertility rate reached 0.82 in the first quarter of 2025, a 7.4% year-on-year increase, the highest since records began in 1981. Experts are cautiously optimistic, but warn that even if the government's target of a 1.0 fertility rate by 2030 is met, Korea would still be at the bottom globally in terms of fertility. The prolonged low birthrate has eroded the population of people capable of having children, and an increase in fertility rates may not translate into more births due to a smaller base population of parents. According to Statistics Korea, even under the agency's high-fertility projection scenario, the national population will fall to the 30-million range within 45 years. Complacency is not an option, and a fertility rate must rise to two or three children per woman to avoid a shrinking society. 'We must remember that we have merely bought a little more time to prepare for the demographic shock ahead,' said a warning from the article.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**Basque Country Faces Labor Shortage of 17% by 2036**
According to a study by Laboral Kutxa, the Basque Country (Euskadi) will face a labor shortage of 17% by 2036, with 171,000 job openings that cannot be filled. The study, 'Empleo y Transición Demográfica en la CAPV y Navarra: Horizonte 2036', projects that the region will not have enough workers to meet the demand, even in the most optimistic scenarios. The director of the Department of Studies at Laboral Kutxa, Joseba Madariaga, explained that the region's population is aging and the birth rate is low, with an average of 1.3 children per woman. Madariaga stated that 'although migrations contribute to maintaining the population, the combination of low fertility and high longevity is driving a significant demographic aging.' To address this issue, Laboral Kutxa recommends prolonging the working life, attracting and retaining migration, and accelerating professional requalification programs. The study also highlights the importance of adopting proactive policies and collaboration between the public and private sectors to ensure the sustainability of the labor market and the competitiveness of the regional economy.

**Egypt's Progress in Reducing Maternal Mortality Rates and the Need for Increased Investment in Maternal Care Services**
Egypt has made significant progress in reducing maternal mortality rates from 69 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2001 to 41 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2023, according to Dr. Hala Abou Ali, a consultant to the National Planning Institute and head of the research team that prepared the study 'Investment in Maternal Health and Family Planning'. The study found that family planning services have played a crucial role in this decline, reducing unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions, and improving women's health and reducing the risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth. Despite the progress made, Abou Ali emphasized the need for increased investment in high-impact maternal care services, in addition to family planning services, to achieve the country's national and regional goals. The study's investment case focuses on three main objectives: estimating the cost of expanding maternal and family planning services, evaluating the economic and social returns on this expansion, and providing a clear guide for policymakers to allocate resources based on data-driven and evidence-based information. The study presents four different scenarios for the future coverage of maternal and family planning services, including a scenario that aims to achieve universal coverage of 100%. The study found that implementing the third scenario, which aims to increase coverage by 50%, would require an additional 20.5% investment compared to the first scenario, equivalent to approximately 21.1 billion Egyptian pounds during the period from 2023 to 2030. The study's results show that implementing the third scenario would prevent around 1.5 million unwanted pregnancies, prevent over 733,000 unsafe abortions, and save thousands of lives from maternal and infant mortality, reflecting positively on human development indicators. In terms of economic and social returns, Abou Ali stated that every pound invested in this field can generate a return of 170 pounds or approximately 3.3 dollars per two years, with a total return of 8.3 billion dollars during the period from 2023 to 2050. This highlights that investing in maternal health and family planning is not a recurring expense, but a real investment in human capital and sustainable development. The study emphasizes the importance of diversifying funding tools and leveraging innovation in designing financing mechanisms that can accommodate increasing needs. Abou Ali also stressed the importance of supporting healthcare cadres, particularly midwives and obstetric teams, in providing healthcare services to women at various stages of their lives. She also emphasized the importance of integrating family planning services into the comprehensive health insurance system to ensure their sustainability, as well as using targeted tools such as health vouchers to facilitate access to services for the most vulnerable groups. Finally, Abou Ali called for adopting a life-cycle approach to women's health, starting from adolescence to post-reproductive age, to provide comprehensive and continuous care.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Russia Celebrates International Children's Day with Progress in Child Protection and Support for Families**
Russia celebrates International Children's Day on June 1st. The country has made significant progress in protecting children's rights, with the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 and the establishment of the institution of the Ombudsman for Children's Rights in 2009. The government has also implemented various measures to support families with children, including the introduction of the Maternity Capital program in 2007 and the extension of the program until 2030. In 2024, President Vladimir Putin signed an order establishing the status of multi-child families and defining measures to support them. The number of children in Russia has been declining, with a total of 25.5 million children under the age of 15 as of January 2023. The birth rate in Russia has also decreased, with 1.222 million births in 2024, a 3.4% decrease from 2023. The government aims to increase the total fertility rate to 1.6 by 2030 and to 1.8 by 2036. The country has also seen a significant decrease in child mortality, with a rate of 4.0 per 1,000 live births as of December 2024. The number of children in foster care has also decreased, with 340,055 children as of 2024. The government has also launched a unique program for screening reproductive health for women and men aged 18-45 in the framework of dispensary examination. Russia has declared 2024 as the Year of the Family, with key objectives including creating conditions for the birth of the first children in young families, strengthening reproductive health, supporting multi-child and multi-generational families, and forming a healthy trend towards multi-child families.

**Turkey's Fertility Rate Declines to 1.48 Children per Woman**
According to the latest report by the United Nations, the world is experiencing a 'baby crisis', with a decline in global fertility rates. The report states that the global fertility rate has decreased from 5 children per woman in the 1960s to 2.2 children per woman in 2024, and is expected to continue declining to 2.1 children per woman by 2050 and 1.8 children per woman by 2100. In Turkey, the total fertility rate has decreased from 2.38 children per woman in 2001 to 1.48 children per woman in 2024. The report also highlights that the highest total fertility rate in Turkey is in Şanlıurfa, with 3.28 children per woman, while the lowest is in Bartın and Eskişehir, with 1.12 children per woman. The report also notes that the total fertility rate in Europe has decreased to 1.38 children per woman in 2023, with the highest rate in Bulgaria, 1.81 children per woman, and the lowest in Malta, 1.06 children per woman. Turkey's total fertility rate of 1.48 children per woman in 2024 ranks 9th among European countries. The report also states that education level is a significant factor in determining fertility rates, with women with higher education levels having lower fertility rates. Additionally, the report notes that the average age of mothers has increased, with mothers having their first child at an average age of 27.3 in 2024, up from 26.7 in 2001. The report also highlights that the average interval between births has increased, with the average interval between the first and second births being 4.7 years in 2024, up from 4.6 years in 2019.

**The Fertility of Immigrants and Natives in the United States, 2023**
According to a report by the Center for Immigration Studies, the overall total fertility rate (TFR) in the United States in 2023 was 1.8 children, with immigrants having a TFR of 2.19 and U.S.-born having a TFR of 1.73. The presence of immigrants raised the nation's overall TFR by about 0.08 children or 4.5 percent. However, the report also found that immigration's ability to increase fertility is limited by the relatively low fertility of every major racial group among the U.S.-born. The report also notes that immigration does increase births per thousand for the entire U.S. population, but the impact is still quite small, with a 6.6 percent increase from 11.2 births per thousand without immigrants to 11.9 births per thousand with immigrants. Additionally, the report found a negative correlation between the immigrant share of the population and the fertility rate of U.S.-born women in the nation's largest metropolitan areas, suggesting that immigration may reduce the fertility of the U.S.-born. The report also discusses the possible reasons why immigration may lower the fertility of the U.S.-born, including driving up housing costs, lowering wages, and straining public services. 'The long-term decline in fertility has been more pronounced for the foreign-born than the U.S.-born since 2008,' said the report. 'Though there was a modest post-Covid uptick in birth rates in 2021 and 2022, this increase had largely abated by 2023.'

**Türkiye's Position in OECD Social Policy: A Look at Aging Population and Birth Rates**
According to the OECD, in Turkey, 15 out of 100 working-age individuals are expected to be elderly by 2054, up from 41 in 2023. The OECD's Refah, Kapsayıcılık, Sürdürülebilirlik ve Eşit Fırsat Merkezi and Social Policy Department published a bulletin evaluating the social policies and positions of countries. The bulletin analyzed data on social protection, population aging, labor market conditions, technological advancements, and public expenditures. The report highlighted the importance of birth rates, longevity, and aging in the population. The total fertility rate, which measures the average number of children per woman aged 15-49, was 1.46 in OECD member countries in 2023, with Turkey ranking 14th at 1.51. The total fertility rate in Turkey has been declining, from 2.19 in 2014 to 1.51 in 2023. The report also noted that the aging population reduces the number of individuals who can support elderly people, with 33 out of 100 working-age individuals expected to be elderly in OECD countries by 2024-2064. This number is projected to increase to 55 by 2054 and 69 by 2094.

**BOK Governor Warns Korea's Growth Will Reverse from 2050 If Birth Rate Remains at 0.75**
Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong has warned that if South Korea's low birth rate continues, the country will face negative growth after 2050. He stated, 'If the current total fertility rate of 0.75 continues, the Korean population will plummet from the current 51 million to 30 million in 50 years.' Rhee projected that Korea's potential growth rate will fall from 2% to 0% in the late 2040s, and that a total fertility rate of 1.4 is needed to maintain positive growth in the 2050s. He also expressed concern that neglecting the low birth rate issue will worsen national finances, predicting that the national debt-to-GDP ratio will soar from 46.9% in 2023 to 182% in 50 years. Rhee proposed the introduction of a 'regional proportional selection system' to alleviate excessive concentration in the capital region and entrance exam competition, which he believes could boost marriage and birth rates.

**Korea may log negative growth from 2050 if low birthrate continues: BOK chief**
Bank of Korea (BOK) Governor Rhee Chang-yong warned that Korea's ultra-low birthrate will cause negative economic growth after 2050 if left unchecked. He called for measures to ease intense competition and burdens regarding employment, housing, and child care. According to Rhee, the current fertility rate of 0.75 is a 'national emergency' and will lead to an 'irreversible population crisis' if it continues. He also highlighted the need to address climate change, citing the potential for 'severe localized climate damage' and significant financial losses. Rhee proposed the development of regional hub cities and a regional proportional college admission system to address the demographic crisis. He also emphasized the importance of making carbon pricing more realistic and improving the country's emission trading system to create more market incentives for emission trading.

**Korea's Low Fertility Rate: A Warning of Negative Growth in the 2050s**
Bank of Korea Governor Lee Chang-yong warned that if the country's total fertility rate of 0.75 continues, it will be difficult to avoid negative growth in the 2050s. He stated, 'If the total fertility rate of 0.75 continues, Korea's potential growth rate will decline to around 0% in the late 2040s, and it may be difficult to avoid negative growth in the 2050s.' He also added that if the current fertility rate continues, the country's debt-to-GDP ratio will increase from 46.9% in 2023 to 182% by 2073. The Governor attributed the low fertility rate to the high competition and employment, housing, and childcare anxieties faced by young Koreans. He suggested that the government should focus on developing hub cities and implementing a proportional representation system for university admissions to address the issue of excessive urban concentration. He emphasized that the proportional representation system can be implemented immediately if the major universities agree, but the negative public opinion towards it remains due to the perception that only the top-ranked students can be admitted through this system. Additionally, the Governor stressed the need to revise the green taxonomy to international standards and provide a clear definition of 'environmentally friendly' to guide the country's carbon reduction efforts.

**Global Birth Rates Decline, But Africa Experiences Population Boom**
The world's population is not disappearing, but the number of births is declining in many developed countries. According to the European Union's statistics agency, Eurostat, the EU had a record low number of births in 2023, with 3.67 million births, a 5.4% decrease from 2022. The total fertility rate in the EU was 1.38 children per woman, with Bulgaria having the highest rate at 1.81, followed by France and Hungary. Spain had one of the lowest fertility rates, with 1.12 children per woman. The population of many countries, including Japan, Italy, and Russia, is aging and declining due to low fertility rates. However, Africa is experiencing a population boom, with a high fertility rate of 4-5 children per woman. The United Nations estimates that by 2050, Africa will be home to nearly 40% of the world's population, and by 2100, one in two children born will be African. Experts say that the decline in fertility rates is a result of socio-economic development, with women having more education, equality, and better living standards leading to smaller families. Governments are facing challenges in financing social security and maintaining productivity with a shortage of young workers. Some experts argue that a gradual decline in population could be manageable and even beneficial, while others see it as a crisis that needs to be addressed urgently.

**Global Population Growth Slows Down: What's Behind the Decline?**
The world's population growth has slowed down significantly over the past few decades, according to IFLScience. The population has reached 8 billion people in 2024, but the UN predicts that the growth rate will slow down significantly in the next 60 years, adding only 2 billion people. By the 2080s, the population is expected to reach 10.3 billion, and by the end of the century, it will decrease to 10.2 billion. The probability of the population reaching its peak by 2100 is estimated to be 80%. This is largely due to a sharp decline in fertility rates. In most countries, the fertility rate is below the critical threshold of 2.1 children per woman. In fact, over 20% of countries have a 'below-replacement fertility rate', where a woman has fewer than 1.4 children. China, which was once the most populous country, is also experiencing a decline in population. According to forecasts, the population of these countries will decrease by approximately 14% from now until 2054. The decline in fertility rates can be attributed to the demographic transition phenomenon, where women have fewer children as societies become more industrialized. This is due to increased opportunities for women's career growth, leading to delayed family formation. Additionally, lower child mortality rates and reduced need for large families for agricultural work contribute to lower fertility rates. In combination with increasing life expectancy, this decline in fertility can significantly alter the demographic composition of the population, with people over 60 years old making up an increasingly large proportion. By 2070, people over 60 are expected to outnumber those under 18.

**Mexico's Demographic Winter: A Challenge for the Future**
Mexico is aging, and the country's population pyramid is inverting. The total fertility rate has fallen from 2.21 children per woman in 2018 to 1.60 in 2023, according to the 2023 National Demographic Dynamics Survey (ENADID). This trend will put a strong pressure on the federal budget, especially to maintain non-contributory pensions for the elderly. The government will face challenges in financing these benefits in the future. Reversing this demographic trend is difficult, as seen in countries like Germany, Japan, and China. The alternatives are to increase productivity or compensate for the population decline through migration. The author, Héctor Zagal, suggests that the government should focus on improving tax collection to address the issue. The current pension system is unsustainable, and the country needs to take action to address the demographic challenge. According to the Center for Economic and Budgetary Research (CIEP), by 2040, the population under 15 years old will decrease to 18%, while the population of adults over 60 will increase to 23%. This will lead to a significant increase in the number of pensioners and a decrease in the number of workers generating wealth. The author concludes that it is essential to discuss this issue in the political arena and take action to address the demographic challenge before it's too late.

**Declino demografico: l'impatto sul mercato del lavoro, Pil e welfare**
A McKinsey report identifies four key directions to rebalance the economic and social system in the face of demographic decline. The world is experiencing a demographic implosion, with two-thirds of the global population living in countries with fertility rates below the replacement rate (2.1 children per woman). By 2100, some of the largest economies will experience a demographic collapse of 20-50%. The impact on the workforce is significant, with the proportion of people in working age expected to decline from 67% to 59% in advanced countries and China by 2050. This will lead to a decrease in the workforce and an increase in the number of pensioners, putting pressure on the welfare system. The report suggests four strategies to address this issue: increasing productivity, prolonging working life, increasing working hours, and selective immigration. However, no single solution can solve the problem, and a mix of solutions tailored to each country's specificities will be necessary. Italy is a prime example of the challenges facing advanced economies, with a low fertility rate (1.24 children per woman in 2023), an aging population, and a negative natural balance (more deaths than births every year since 2015).

**Pakistan to become world's third-most populous nation, overtaking US, Russia by 2050 despite fertility drop**
According to the United Nations World Fertility Report 2024, Pakistan's fertility rate has declined significantly over the past three decades, dropping from 6 live births per woman in 1994 to 3.6 in 2024. Despite this decline, Pakistan is still on track to become the third-most populous nation by 2050, surpassing the United States, Indonesia, Brazil, and Russia. The UN projects that Pakistan's population will exceed 380 million by 2050, with a fertility rate expected to decline further to 2.5 by 2054. The report highlights the need for measures such as ending child marriages, improving access to sexual and reproductive healthcare, and enhancing maternal care for young mothers. 'Reducing growth in the numbers of live births in the future would allow governments and families to allocate resources more efficiently to invest in children and adolescent health and well-being,' the report said.
