**India's Economic Growth: A Mixed Picture**
India needs to accelerate its growth to become a developed economy. The latest economic performance data for 2024-25 shows a mixed picture. Optimists are happy with the 7.4% growth rate in the fourth quarter, while pessimists are disappointed with the four-year low annual growth rate. However, realists point out that there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic and reasons to be disappointed. The 7.4% growth rate is significantly higher than the expected growth rate for the quarter and is the highest growth rate in the otherwise disappointing financial year. The main drivers of this growth were the construction sector's double-digit growth and the strong performance of the agriculture sector. Both of these sectors are major drivers of employment. Services also saw stable and strong growth. On the other hand, the manufacturing sector's growth rate was only 4.8%, down from 11.3% in the same quarter last year. The overall data also reveals a truth. The 7.4% GDP growth rate is largely due to a 12.7% increase in tax collections. Without this increase, the real economic activity growth would have been around 6.8%. The much-hyped 'Kumbh effect' on consumption expenditure did not materialize. In the fourth quarter, which coincided with the Kumbh, private final consumption expenditure grew by only 6%, the slowest in five quarters. However, capital formation saw a strong 9.4% growth as the government finally accelerated its sluggish capital investment. Government officials and central ministers have expressed satisfaction with the 6.5% growth rate for 2024-25, the lowest since the pandemic, saying it is still among the fastest in major economies and 'not bad' in the context of the global environment. These statements are correct. However, saying 'it's not bad' is not enough. This is not a race with the rest of the world, but a struggle to keep pace with the country's growing needs. The Modi government, which aims to become a 'developed India' by 2047, needs to set higher standards in line with its aspirations. If, as the Economic Survey says, 'at least a decade of continuous annual economic growth of around 8%' is needed to achieve this goal, then India is certainly moving at a slow pace. Even if its direction is correct. The Chief Economic Adviser, V. Anantha Nageswaran, said in his press conference that India is entering a phase of low inflation and stable growth. Stability is a good thing, as it means the likelihood of slow growth is low. However, it also means that there is little chance of significant growth. The government should consider whether this is a satisfactory situation for a changing economy.

**India's Economic Growth: A Bright Spot in a Turbulent World**
India's GDP growth rate for the fiscal year 2024-25 has been recorded at 6.5%, which is lower than the 8.2% growth rate of the previous year, but still impressive compared to other major economies. The country's GDP growth rate has been steadily increasing, with the fourth quarter of 2024-25 recording a growth rate of 7.4%. This has reaffirmed India's economic resilience and sustained growth. The government has highlighted India's position as one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. Experts have analyzed India's economic performance, compared it to the global economy, and discussed its future prospects. While the government's efforts to increase per capita income have been commendable, and the Modi government has been made aware of the need for sustained growth, it is essential to consider India's economic growth and the factors behind it. The 6.5% GDP growth rate in India is particularly noteworthy in the context of global economic uncertainty. This is a significant achievement. Regardless of who is in power, it is essential to consider the positive aspects of India's economic growth. International institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have credited India's economic policies and structural reforms for this achievement. According to the latest data from the National Statistical Office, India's nominal GDP is expected to reach Rs 324.11 lakh crore (approximately $3.8 trillion) in 2024-25, a growth of 9.7%. This includes a 9.9% growth in the production sector and a similar growth in the construction sector. The main reasons behind this growth include a strong domestic demand, the government's increased spending on infrastructure, and the expansion of the digital economy. Private final consumption expenditure grew by 7.3%, and government final consumption expenditure grew by 4.1%, giving the economy a boost. Additionally, India's favorable demographic structure and young workforce have increased productivity, which sets it apart from the global level. This is a testament to the Modi government's policies. Therefore, a positive but cautious approach is taken by experts. The 6.5% GDP growth rate in 2024-25 is a slowdown compared to the 8.2% growth rate in 2023-24, which is due to a decline in industrial production and a shortage of global demand. Although the growth in the agricultural sector has increased to 3.8% from 1.4%, there is a risk of a negative impact on agriculture due to the irregularity of the monsoon. Furthermore, a decline in the Purchasing Managers' Index has also indicated a slowdown in some sectors. However, optimistic experts believe that India's long-term prospects are bright. NITI Aayog CEO BVRS Subrahmanyam has stated that India has surpassed Japan to become the fourth-largest economy in the world. According to SP Global Market Intelligence, India could become the third-largest economy by 2030 with a GDP of $7.3 trillion. India's economic performance is extremely impressive compared to the global economy. While China's GDP growth rate is 4.6%, Japan's is only 0.9%, and major European economies such as Germany and France have recorded growth rates of 0.2% and 1.1%, respectively, India's GDP growth rate is 6.5%. The United States' economy is growing at 2.5%, but this is lower than India's growth rate. India has achieved its target of surpassing Japan to become the fourth-largest economy by 2025, or will achieve it by the end of the year. India's influence has increased on international platforms such as the G20 and the IMF. Additionally, despite a decline in the export-GDP ratio, India's digital services exports and improvements in the production sector have strengthened its position in global trade. However, India's economy faces some challenges. Global demand shortages, increasing geopolitical tensions, and domestic inflation could put pressure on the economy. Additionally, India's per capita income is still low, which is a true measure of the general citizen's prosperity. In 2023, India's per capita income was $2,610, which is much lower than Japan and the United States. However, India has many opportunities. The government's 'Make in India' and 'Digital India' initiatives have boosted production and service sectors. Additionally, foreign direct investment in India is increasing, creating new job opportunities. In the fiscal year 2024-25, India has achieved a 6.5% GDP growth rate, reaffirming its economic resilience and global leadership.

**Is 6.5% GDP growth new normal for India?**
India's economy grew at 6.5% in FY25, the slowest pace in four years, and estimates for the next couple of years remain muted, ranging between 6.3% and 6.5%. Economists fear that growth may plateau around 6-6.5%, and that the ingredients for a return to 7%-plus growth are missing. According to Namrata Mittal, economist at SBI Mutual Fund, 'Post-Covid, there was a real push to boost exports and ramp up infrastructure spending, which lifted economic growth. But all of that is now built into the base.' The IMF projects GDP growth at 6.2% for FY26 and 6.3% for FY27, while the government's Chief Economic Advisor (CEA), V. Anantha Nageswaran, puts FY26 growth in the 6.3-6.8% range. Private sector investment continues to lag, and although consumption growth rebounded to 7.2% in real terms, it still lacks underlying strength. According to the CEA, private consumption accounted for 61.4% of GDP at current prices in FY25 -- the highest since FY2004. Arun Kumar, former professor of economics at JNU, points to weak demand over the past three years, which has kept formal sector capacity utilization at around 75%. 'Private investment remains subdued,' he notes. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) slowed to 7.1% in FY25 from 8.8% the previous year. Kumar says that for India to consistently grow above 7%, both the services and industrial sectors need to accelerate.

**India's economic growth hits four-year low of 6.5%**
India's economy grew by 6.5 percent in the fiscal year that ended in March, its slowest pace in four years. The country's GDP growth came in below the 9.2 percent recorded in the previous financial year, due to a weaker manufacturing sector, tight monetary policy, and muted urban consumer sentiment. Despite a rebound in the past two quarters, driven by strong agricultural output, US President Donald Trump's tariff policies pose risks to a sustained recovery. According to Sam Jochim, an economist at EFG Asset Management, 'Although India is expected to see its GDP grow 6.5 percent again in fiscal year 2025-26, there remains a great deal of uncertainty due to Trump's tariff policies.' Analysts believe that the annual growth figures, along with cooling inflation data, will convince India's central bank to continue its interest rate easing cycle. 'The ability of the Modi government to strike a deal with Trump could prove paramount for India's economic outlook,' Jochim added.

**India needs 7.8% growth to become a developed nation by 2047: World Bank**
According to the World Bank, India needs to grow at an average of 7.8 per cent over the next 22 years to become a high-income nation by 2047. The report, titled 'Becoming a High-Income Economy in a Generation', notes that this target is possible if the country undertakes 'accelerated reforms'. The World Bank recommends four critical areas for policy action, including raising investment to 40 per cent of GDP by 2035 and increasing women's participation in the workforce to 55 per cent by 2050. Auguste Tano Kouame, the World Bank country director, said, 'India can chart its own path by stepping up the pace of reforms and building on its past achievements.' The report also outlines a 'business as usual' scenario, which assumes that investment will only reach 37 per cent of GDP by 2035 and growth will average 6.6 per cent per year, still insufficient to achieve high-income status by 2047.

**Only Global Growth Will Reflect True Value of AI: Microsoft CEO**
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has emphasized the importance of global growth generated by artificial intelligence (AI) over the hype surrounding the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Speaking to podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Nadella said that the real value of AI will be reflected in a boost to GDP, citing the need for growth rates of 10%, 7%, or 5% in the developed world. He compared this to the Industrial Revolution, saying that AI needs to bring about a similar level of growth to be truly valuable. Nadella's views contrast with those of OpenAI, which has been racing to develop AGI. Nadella also addressed concerns about AI replacing human jobs, saying that it should act as a facilitator for productivity rather than replacing 'cognitive labour'. His comments come at a time when thousands of people have been laid off in favor of AI, and experts have warned about the potential for AI to cause economic harm.

**True AGI Means 10% Economic Growth, Says Satya Nadella**
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has challenged conventional definitions of artificial general intelligence (AGI), arguing that true AGI should be measured by economic growth rather than AI advancements alone. According to Nadella, the real benchmark for AGI's success should be global economic growth reaching 10%. He said, 'If you're going to have this explosion or abundance...of intelligence available, the first thing we have to observe is GDP growth.' Nadella emphasized that the primary beneficiaries of AI advancements will not be tech companies but industries using AI to drive productivity, saying, 'The big winners here are not going to be tech companies. The winners are going to be the broader industry that uses this commodity.' He drew a comparison to past technological revolutions, saying, 'When we say this is like the Industrial Revolution, let's have that Industrial Revolution type of growth,' which he defined as 10%, 7%, or 5% inflation-adjusted economic growth in the developed world.
