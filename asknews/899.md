**37% Of The World's Millionaires Call The US Home, Up 78% Over The Last Decade**
According to a report from Henley & Partners and New World Wealth, the US is home to 37% of the world's millionaires, with over 6 million high net worth individuals residing in the country at the end of 2024. This represents a 78% increase in the US millionaire population over the last decade. However, Tim Klatte, partner at Grant Thornton China, warns that despite this growth, high net worth individuals should be cautious due to the risk of escalating US-China trade tensions and international conflict. In fact, many ultra-wealthy Americans are exploring options to move their wealth outside the US, with US citizens accounting for over 30% of all investment migration applications submitted through Henley & Partners.

According to a report by McKinsey & Company and BoF, India's ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) are expected to surge by 50% between 2023 and 2028, the fastest growth globally.

**Top 10 richest people in the world as Musk reclaims top spot**
Elon Musk has reclaimed the top spot on the list of the world's richest people, with an estimated net worth of $423 billion, after adding $36 billion to his fortune in May. Mark Zuckerberg surged to second place, dethroning Jeff Bezos, after adding $34 billion to his net worth. Eight of the top ten richest people saw their wealth increase in May, with the Nasdaq jumping 10% and the S&P 500 climbing 6% due to strong corporate earnings and easing trade tensions. However, not all billionaires benefited from the market rally, with Warren Buffett losing $9 billion and Bernard Arnault losing $3 billion. The combined net worth of the top ten richest individuals rose by $140 billion in May, reaching a collective $1.9 trillion at the start of June.

According to a report by McKinsey & Company and BoF, India's ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) are expected to surge by 50% between 2023 and 2028, the fastest growth globally. The Indian luxury market is expected to grow between 15 and 20% in 2025, driven by demographic and structural shifts. The report notes that new luxury malls and department stores are increasing luxury real estate in tier-one cities, and that domestic spending is expected to increase due to higher taxes on imported goods. In contrast, the Japanese luxury market is expected to grow between 6 and 10% in 2025, driven by solid domestic demand and tourism spending. The report also notes that India has overtaken Japan to become the world's fourth-largest economy, with a nominal GDP of USD 4 trillion. The luxury industry has experienced a slowdown in 2025, with luxury value creation declining for the first time since 2016.

**US's Richest 10 People Increase Fortunes by $365 Billion in 2024, Says Oxfam**
According to a new analysis by Oxfam, the 10 richest people in the US increased their fortunes by $365 billion in 2024, equivalent to a daily gain of around $1 billion. In contrast, the median worker in the US earned around $50,000 in 2023. It would take 726,000 years for 10 workers with median income to reach the same value. 'We are seeing a wealth increase that is astronomical while many ordinary people struggle to survive,' said Rebecca Riddell, senior leader of economic and racial justice policy at Oxfam America. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, accumulated $186 billion in this period, making him the richest person in the world. A recent study suggests that Musk is on track to become the first trillionaire on the planet. Other billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg and Rob Walton saw their wealth grow by $38.7 billion each, while Warren Buffett and Jim Walton accumulated $34.8 billion and $36.5 billion, respectively. However, the cofounders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, saw a reduction in their wealth: $27.2 billion and $25.4 billion, respectively. Oxfam warns that the proposed tax cuts will benefit the rich and cut almost $1 trillion from essential social programs. 'We are seeing a tax code being developed that will result in the first trillionaire in the world,' said Rebecca Riddell. To combat inequality, some progressive politicians advocate for a wealth tax on ultra-millionaires and billionaires. Oxfam estimates that a 3% tax on wealth above $1 billion would raise $50 billion from the 10 richest Americans, enough to provide food assistance for 22.5 million people for a year.

**US Wealth Gap Widens as Top 0.00001% Add $1 Trillion to Net Worth**
The top 0.00001% of households in the US added over $1 trillion to their net worth in 2024, surpassing the economic size of Switzerland. This surge in wealth has also led to a record high in income inequality. According to economist Gabriel Zucman, the share of the top 0.00001% of households in the total wealth of the US has increased from 1.2% in 2023 to 1.8% in 2024, reaching approximately $2.6 trillion. This represents the largest annual increase in wealth ever recorded. Zucman notes that the wealth of the truly wealthy has grown slowly at first, but has recently accelerated dramatically. 'The middle class is still playing defense,' said Zucman. American businessman and author Grant Cardone added, 'They're playing offense, the middle class is still playing defense. The game has changed.' The top 0.00001% of households, which includes individuals such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and Stephen Schwarzman, each have a minimum of $45 billion in wealth. The number of billionaires in the US has also increased to approximately 2,000 in 2024, up from 1,400 in 2021. According to the World Inequality Database, the top 1% of households in the US own 35% of the country's wealth, compared to 21% in the UK, 27.2% in France, and 27.6% in Germany.

**19 Richest American Households, Including Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, Have Made $1 Trillion Since Last Year**
According to an analysis by economist Gabriel Zucman, 19 American households, including Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk, accumulated $1 trillion of wealth in 2024, a one-year increase of $2.6 trillion. This growth is the largest to date, with the group's household wealth increasing from 1.2 percent in 2023 to 1.8 percent in 2024. The total amount of household wealth in the United States was about $148 trillion in 2024. Musk currently holds the title for the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $381.9 billion, surpassing Bezos and Gates. However, his worth has since declined.

**Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, And 16 US Households Gained $1 Trillion In 2024 -- An Amount Larger Than Switzerland's Entire Economy**
According to economist Gabriel Zucman, 19 US households, including those of Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, and Jeff Bezos, accumulated $1 trillion in net worth in 2024, exceeding Switzerland's entire economy. This amount represents a one-year jump of $1 trillion, with the top 0.00001% of American households increasing their collective share of household wealth from 1.2% in 2023 to 1.8% by the end of 2024. Zucman notes that overall, U.S. household wealth is estimated to be at least $148 trillion, with wealth creation at this level rising faster than at any point in time since 1913. This wealth concentration has led to a widening gap between the richest citizens and the rest, with a household in the top 0.1% adding an average of $3.4 million every year since 1990, compared to $450,000 for the rest of the top 1%.

**US Richest Accumulate More Wealth in 2024, Widening Inequality**
According to an analysis by Gabriel Zucman, economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Paris School of Economics, cited by The Wall Street Journal, the 0.00001% of the richest 19 households in the US have accumulated even more wealth in 2024, with their participation in the total wealth increasing to 1.8% or approximately $2.6 trillion. This is the largest increase recorded in a year. The total wealth of US households stood at around $148 trillion at the end of 2024, according to a measure used by Zucman that subtracts the value of high-value items, such as appliances and unfunded pensions, from the Federal Reserve's estimate of household wealth. 'The net worth of all groups has increased since the third quarter of 1990 as the US economy has grown. The growth of wealth among the richest Americans has far exceeded that of all other groups in the US,' writes the author. Zucman's analysis examines the distribution of wealth from 1913, part of a period known as the Golden Age of the US, to 2024. The work of Zucman and his colleague Emmanuel Saez was cited by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in their 2020 arguments for increasing taxes on the rich. Wealth managers say that the stock market boom in 2024 drove the creation of wealth in the highest strata, following already significant gains in the previous year. Together, those two years were the best consecutive years for the S&P 500 in a quarter century. The research by Zucman includes Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and private equity investor Stephen Schwarzman. Other researchers have referred to those with similar wealth as 'superrich'. In 2023, the analysis says, the top 1% of the US possessed 34.8% of the total household wealth, according to the World Inequality Database. In comparison, the top 1% in the UK possessed 21.3%, in France 27.2%, and in Germany 27.6%.

**US Leads in Creating Wealth in 2024, Despite Global Uncertainty**
Despite economic and political uncertainty, the United States has maintained its lead in creating wealth in 2024, according to a report by 'Douglas Elliman and Knight Frank'. The number of high-net-worth individuals, those with a net worth of over $10 million, increased by 4.4% in 2024, with a 5.2% growth in North America alone. The US has the highest number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, with 905,413, more than double the number in China, which ranks second. According to the report, around 40% of the world's richest individuals live in the US. Liam Bailey, global research head at 'Knight Frank', said, 'While the global economy slowed down in 2024, the US's flexibility helped to support investor confidence... and the trends supporting wealth creation, including growth in financial markets, led by stock markets and the decline of (bitcoin), continued in 2024. Despite geopolitical tensions, the flexible global trade contributed to greater growth.' Analysts at 'Douglas Elliman and Knight Frank' expect the US to maintain its dominance in wealth creation over the next four years, but also predict significant growth in other regions. Africa, with its young population and rich natural resources, is expected to see a 17.8% increase in the number of high-net-worth individuals. In Asia, the number of high-net-worth individuals is expected to increase from 854,465 in 2024 to 928,722 in 2028. James Pomeroy, global economic expert at HSBC, said in the 'Douglas Elliman and Knight Frank' report that the means of creating wealth in Asia are also shifting from manufacturing to high-tech projects. This shift is partly due to increased access to smartphones, which enables 'entrepreneurial populations to develop international businesses', as he said. 'This has led to a culture of entrepreneurship that was a major part of the growth story in places like India and the Philippines.' The report also notes that other regions saw significant growth in the number of high-net-worth individuals, including: * Europe: a 1.4% increase in 2024. * Middle East: a 2.7% increase in 2024. * Australia: a 3.9% increase in 2024. * Latin America: a 1.5% increase in 2024. * Africa: a 4.7% increase in 2024. * Asia: a 5% increase in 2024.

**America had the most new multimillionaires in 2024. Here's how other countries fared**
The United States led the world in wealth creation in 2024, with a 4.4% increase in high net worth individuals and a 5.2% growth in North America. The U.S. has the most ultra-high net worth individuals, with 905,413, more than twice the population of second-place China. According to Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank, 'the resilience of the U.S. helped prop up investor confidence' despite global economic uncertainty. Analysts anticipate the U.S. maintaining its dominance in wealth creation for the next four years, with other regions, such as Africa and Asia, experiencing significant growth. Asia's population of high net worth individuals is expected to increase from 854,465 in 2024 to 928,722 in 2028, driven by a shift from manufacturing to high-tech enterprise and increased smartphone access.

**America is still the world's superrich capital**
The United States remains the world's capital of superrich individuals, with 39% of the world's individuals with net worths of $10 million or higher residing in the US, according to the 2025 Wealth Report by Knight Frank. This is almost twice the number in China, with 471,634 individuals, and more than the number in Japan, India, and other countries. The US also dominates in terms of billionaires, with 30% of global billionaires and 40% of overall billionaire wealth. The report attributes the US's resilience in wealth creation to factors such as growth in financial markets, the bitcoin run, and President Donald Trump's pledge to loosen regulatory standards. 'Despite our forecast that Asia will outpace North America in wealth creation over the next four years, there is no realistic challenge to US dominance,' authors of the paper said. 'While the global economy slowed through 2024, the resilience of the US helped prop up investor confidence,' Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank, said.
