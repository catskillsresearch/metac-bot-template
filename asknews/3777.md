**Factory Farming Fuels a Triple Crisis: Animal Suffering, Human Harm, and Environmental Collapse**
Factory farming is a driving force behind three interconnected global crises: animal cruelty, human exploitation, and environmental degradation. Billions of animals suffer in extreme confinement, while farm workers and surrounding communities face dangerous conditions and public health risks. Industrial animal agriculture contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, water pollution, and biodiversity loss. A. Roghani, Director of the Humane Foundation, said, 'This is not just about animal rights. It's about human dignity, environmental survival, and the values we choose to live by.' The Humane Foundation advocates for a comprehensive transformation of our food system, including phasing out industrial-scale animal farming, redirecting subsidies, and promoting public health policies that reduce meat consumption.

**The Dark Side of Animalism: A Critique of the Movement's Extremism**
Animalism is a political movement that advocates for the rights of animals, including their right to life, well-being, and freedom. However, some critics argue that the movement has become too extreme, using tactics such as projecting images on the Pope's residence to condemn bullfighting. They also claim that animalists are hypocritical, as some of them may own pets that are kept in small spaces or used for entertainment. The author argues that empathy towards animals should not be confused with humanizing them, and that the movement's focus on veganism and animal rights has become too idealistic. The author also criticizes the tendency to rescue animals from shelters, rather than adopting them or allowing them to be euthanized. The author concludes that the movement's emphasis on animal rights has become a form of 'proyección humana' (human projection), and that the focus should be on addressing real animal suffering rather than idealistic goals.

**Way of the Hunter Wild America: A Realistic Hunting Experience**
Way of the Hunter Wild America is a mobile game that offers a realistic hunting experience. The game has a large open world, where players can hunt various animals, including deer, bears, and birds. The game features a variety of weapons, including rifles, bows, and traps, and allows players to customize their equipment and playstyle. The game also includes a day-night cycle and a dynamic weather system, which affects the behavior of the animals. The game's graphics are impressive, with detailed textures and realistic animations. However, the game's performance can be slow at times, and the controls can be unresponsive. The game's sound design is also noteworthy, with realistic sound effects and a immersive soundtrack. The game's storyline is simple, but the game's atmosphere and immersion are well-done. The game's realism is also impressive, with realistic animal behavior and a dynamic ecosystem. However, the game's moral implications are questionable, as players are encouraged to hunt and kill animals for sport. The game's developers could have explored more nuanced and complex themes, such as conservation and wildlife management. Overall, Way of the Hunter Wild America is a solid game that offers a realistic and immersive hunting experience, but it falls short in its moral implications and storytelling.

**Letters | Dolphin's death another wake-up call to phase out animal captivity**
Taison Chang Kai-tai, chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, has exposed the suffering of dolphins in Ocean Park, citing constant noise, limited food, and cramped enclosures. Dolphins in captivity often exhibit abnormal behaviors due to lack of stimulation or autonomy, leading to deteriorating health and shortened lifespans. Despite the harm, dolphins remain in captivity for their high profitability. Ocean Park claimed that Rita helped convey conservation messages, but naturalist Jacques Cousteau said that studying dolphins in captivity is equivalent to studying humans in solitary confinement. Cultural critic John Berger noted that viewing animals in zoos is like looking at an out-of-focus image. Educating the public through captivity reinforces human superiority and undermines true environmental education, which should cultivate care and respect for the natural world.

**Desextinción: El lobo terrible y el dilema ético**
Colossal Biosciences has announced the birth of three genetically modified wolf-like dogs, known as the 'terrible wolf' (Canis dirus), a species that went extinct in North America at the end of the Pleistocene era. The company used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to introduce 20 mutations into the DNA of domestic dogs, making them resemble the ancient species. The three dogs, Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi, were born in a controlled environment and have been living in a 800-hectare reserve in the United States. Experts have raised concerns about the ethics of bringing back an extinct species, citing the potential impact on ecosystems and the difficulty of reintroducing the animals into the wild. 'It's not a revival of the species, but rather the creation of individuals that combine modern and ancient genetic information,' said Dr. José de Jesús Vásquez Chabolla, a geneticist. 'These animals will not be able to survive in the wild without human intervention.'

**In tiger territory, LPG and toilet emerge as big lifesavers**
In India, the government's Ujjwala scheme, which provides free LPG connections, and the Swachh Bharat Mission, which builds toilets, have been credited with reducing human-wildlife conflicts in forest areas. Villagers in Karnataka's Chamarajanagar district, Maharashtra's Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve, and Uttar Pradesh's Pilibhit Tiger Reserve have reported a decrease in encounters with wild animals since receiving LPG connections and toilets. According to conservationists, toilets and LPG connections have helped reduce the movement of locals into tiger habitats, thereby reducing conflicts. However, experts note that there is no magic bullet for the issue of human-animal conflict and that site-specific actions are necessary to effectively address such situations. 'Tigers have adapted to living with human beings and now, it is high time that humans too learn to live with tigers,' says Corbett-based Imran Khan.

**Slovenian Agricultural and Animal Welfare Issues**
Tatjana Pihlar has been reporting on various agricultural and animal welfare issues in Slovenia. Recent articles include concerns about unregistered pesticides being sold online, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the agricultural sector, and the need for better animal welfare laws. The Slovenian government has been working on new laws to improve animal welfare, including a proposal to ban the use of wild animals in circuses. However, some critics argue that the proposed laws do not go far enough to protect animal welfare. Additionally, there have been concerns about the treatment of animals in Slovenian zoos and the need for better veterinary care. The Slovenian government has also been working on a new law to improve the treatment of animals in slaughterhouses. Meanwhile, some Slovenian farmers have been expressing concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their businesses and the need for government support. 'Prosimo nebo, boga in ne vem koga vse še, da bi šla slinavka in parkljevka mimo nas,' said one farmer, expressing his concerns about the spread of the disease. 'If it stays, I'll even go to Brezje on my knees, just to get rid of it.'

**Loose Dog Hunting: A Cultural Heritage with a High Price**
The number of dog injuries caused by wild animals increased by 40% in 2024, according to Agria, which has 40% of the market. According to Jakt & Jägare, it is mainly hunting dogs that are affected. The Jägareförbundet and dog owners should raise an alarm about this tragedy. The main reason is that people do not hunt with leashed dogs. Loose dog hunting has become the norm - but at what cost? Have dog owners lost empathy? Is the community and hunting more important than the welfare of the dogs? The Swedish Kennel Club should be against this, but has together with the Jägareförbundet classified loose dog hunting as a cultural heritage. Our ancestors hunted for survival - today it is often about pleasure, trophies, or money. According to the hunting law, the hunter has a duty to check if an animal is injured. But in loose dog hunting, the dog is released. The dog may have GPS and a protective vest, but no one knows what happens in a confrontation with wildlife. The wild animal can be seriously injured - without anyone being responsible. In 2024, 304 dogs were killed or injured by wild animals, 146 in traffic, 22 drowned, 7 were hit by trains, and 7 were shot. If they had been leashed, many sufferings could have been avoided - and insurance premiums would have been lower. Hunting costs money. Foreign hunters and companies pay to shoot - often and much. Loose dog hunting is a cheap way to satisfy this. But why do people put their own dogs at risk? 22 dogs froze to death in the kennel. This is unacceptable. Loose dog hunting may be justified in search and rescue operations, but otherwise it should be banned - for the sake of wildlife, dogs, and livestock. Hunting is important for many, but to say that it cannot be done with leashed dogs shows a lack of empathy and responsibility. 'As the author of this article, I believe that loose dog hunting is a tragedy that should be addressed by the Jägareförbundet and dog owners.'

**Letter to the Editor: Protect wildlife**
The editor emphasizes the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats, which are crucial for the health and well-being of all life.

The author urges people to teach compassion to children and find the passion in the wild, highlighting that without nature, humans cannot exist. As the author poignantly puts it, 'Wild and free, can't you see, without Nature we can't be.'

**The Vrøvlet in the Nature Debate: A Long-Standing Issue**
The debate about rewilding, a conservation strategy used by the government to establish 'nature national parks', has been ongoing for a long time. The strategy, which involves allowing animals to roam freely in the wild, is not scientifically proven to be an effective means of nature protection. Despite this, its supporters often use religious language to emphasize its supposed benefits. Rasmus Ejrnæs, a researcher in biodiversity and the government's advisor on the topic, frequently expresses his belief that animals prefer a short life of suffering, hunger, and starvation over the conditions they are subjected to in human service. Bengt Holst, the chairman of the Animal Welfare Council, has stated that animals can tolerate some hunger, but this does not change the fundamental mantra of rewilding enthusiasts - that animals should suffer and eat toxic plants in the name of biodiversity. The author argues that rewilding enthusiasts lack scientific arguments and instead resort to the familiar tactic of labeling critics as 'nature enemies' and 'animal abusers.' The article concludes that the real issue is not just the use of animals, but also the democratic debate about how to achieve results.

**David Horowitz's voice still echoes in the fight to protect wild horses**
David Horowitz, a conservative voice who passed away this month, was a strong advocate for protecting America's wild horses. In 2017, he warned that lifting the ban on horse slaughter would be 'political suicide' and issued a public call for Republican leaders to stop the bill. He argued that defending wild horses was not only morally right but also aligned with President Trump's promise to protect America's greatness and heritage. Horowitz's efforts worked, and the Senate blocked the legislation. His legacy is now relevant as the policy blueprint known as Project 2025 proposes giving the Bureau of Land Management sweeping new authority to 'humanely dispose of' wild horses, a euphemism that signals mass slaughter. Horowitz proved that wild horse protection is not a partisan issue, but a matter of principle, and that conservative values of stewardship, compassion, and fiscal responsibility can and should include protecting the West's most iconic animals.

**Stop Xenotransplantation: For Ethical Medicine Without Animal Suffering**
The practice of breeding and genetically modifying animals to serve as organ donors for humans is considered a moral low point of modern science. Pigs and other animals are raised and manipulated in laboratories, only to be used as spare part repositories for human organs. This cannot be the future of medicine. We demand: - An end to research on xenotransplantation - Promotion of animal-friendly alternatives - An ethical approach to all living beings. Medical progress should not be based on the suffering of innocent animals. We are responsible for protecting life - every life.

**Beyond Human Suffering: The Devastating Impact of the South Korean Wildfire on Animals**
The recent massive wildfire in South Korea's southern region has left a trail of destruction and despair. The fire, which started in the mountains of Gyeongsangnam-do, spread rapidly and engulfed nearby villages, leaving many animals injured or dead. The animal welfare organization, 'Animal Liberation League', has been working tirelessly to rescue and care for the affected animals. Despite their efforts, many animals were left behind, either injured or abandoned, and are still struggling to survive. The organization is calling for a change in the way animals are treated and cared for, particularly in emergency situations. They argue that the current system is inadequate and that more needs to be done to protect animals from harm. The government has promised to create a manual for animal rescue and care in emergency situations, but the organization believes that this is only a first step and that more fundamental changes are needed. They point out that many animals are kept in isolated and inhumane conditions, and that the current system prioritizes human safety over animal welfare. The organization is advocating for a more compassionate and humane approach to animal care, and is calling for an end to the practice of keeping animals in small, isolated spaces. As the country begins to rebuild and recover from the wildfire, the organization is urging people to remember the animals who were affected and to work towards creating a more animal-friendly society.

**One day, our morals will be sensitive to animals**
Jeremy Bentham's utilitarian views, which emphasize minimizing suffering and maximizing pleasure, have implications for the treatment of non-human animals. Bentham argued that animals, like his cat 'The Reverend Sir John Langbourne,' deserve substantial ethical consideration because they can suffer, even if they can't reason. Research has shown that many animal species are highly intelligent, capable of learning, complex social and emotional lives, and solving problems. For example, chickens can tailor their communications to specific contexts, pigs use tools and demonstrate self-awareness, and cows show signs of excitement and pleasure when they learn and succeed. Despite this knowledge, many people continue to eat animal products and treat animals inhumanely. The author suggests that this is a moral issue that will eventually be addressed, just like the slow progress of human rights. He argues that animal rights are the next big step in moral progress and that future humans will look back at us with the same horror that we now look back at past slave owners.

**Priorities and Hypocrisy: A Critique of Modern Values**
We live in a world where humans have lost compassion for each other, yet are overly concerned with animal welfare, says José Alfredo Jiménez. The author notes that people are more likely to defend an animal that is attacking them than a human being. This disparity in values is largely due to the different ways of living between urban and rural populations. In cities, people tend to forget that the meat they consume comes from animals that have suffered in the process. Animal rights activists demand an end to animal cruelty, but then go on to eat meat, says the author. The author also expresses concern about the potential extinction of the bullfighting tradition in Mexico due to prohibitionist policies. As a lifelong fan of bullfighting, the author believes that it is a manifestation of art and culture that should be protected. The author questions whether politicians who claim to support a 'bloodless' bullfight are truly committed to reducing human suffering, which is a much greater problem in Mexico.

**'Minimum sentence under wildlife act can't be reduced'**
The Delhi High Court has reaffirmed that courts cannot impose a punishment lower than the minimum sentence prescribed under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. According to Justice Chandra Dhari Singh, any reduction in the minimum sentence would 'defeat the purpose of the law', as the Act was enacted to curb wildlife-related crimes and protect ecological balance and biodiversity. The court noted that the exclusion of probationary relief in such cases reflects the legislature's intent to create a robust deterrent against illegal trade and exploitation of endangered species.

**The Brutal Killing of Wild Donkeys: A Call to Action Against Animal Cruelty**
A recent incident in which 14 wild donkeys were brutally killed, including pregnant ones and those with young, has sparked outrage and highlighted the need for stronger laws and greater public awareness to prevent animal cruelty. The act of tying a dog's legs and throwing it away is not only a heinous crime against the animal, but also an attack on human dignity. The perpetrator's lack of empathy and compassion is evident in such actions. Research has shown that individuals who commit animal cruelty are more likely to commit violence against humans. The lack of punishment for such crimes is also a contributing factor. To address this issue, stricter laws and increased public awareness are necessary. Citizens should report such incidents and authorities should take action. Education and rehabilitation programs for individuals who commit animal cruelty are also essential. The creation of effective reporting mechanisms and the strengthening of law enforcement are also crucial. As a society, we must take responsibility for protecting the most vulnerable members of our community, including animals. Animal cruelty is a sign of a society's moral decay, and it is our duty to prevent it. Empathy and compassion are not just words, but actions that we must take to protect all living beings.

**The Gilded Age of animal advocacy: A transformative era for America’s moral compass**
The 19th century saw a transformative era for America's moral compass, particularly in regards to animal advocacy. The period, known as the Gilded Age, was marked by significant cultural and economic changes that influenced attitudes towards nonhuman animals. Activists like George Thorndike Angell, Henry Bergh, and Caroline Earle White propelled the anti-cruelty cause forward, while others, such as Alexandre Liautard and George Bird Grinnell, contributed to the rise of veterinary medicine and conservation. The era also saw the emergence of scientific medicine, which posed questions about research on animals, and the rise of the mass entertainment industry, which captivated audiences with the individuality of animals. However, it also led to the reconception of animals as industrial inputs, a disposable source of meat, milk, eggs, hides, and more. George Angell, a key figure in the animal welfare movement, led a crusade for kindness and moral responsibility, enlisting the nation's children as his foot soldiers and creating a new literature of animal appreciation. He also believed in the interconnection of human obligations, including resistance to war, racism, plutocracy, and animal cruelty. The story of the crusade to ease animal suffering in the Gilded Age is ultimately about the attempt to bridge the unbridgeable divide between humans and animals, and to reckon with our moral obligations to all creatures around us.
