**Republicans just killed California's E.V. mandate. Will they regret it?**
The Senate has voted 51-44 to overturn the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) waivers granted to California, which required 100% of car sales in the state to come from zero-emission vehicles by 2035. Senate Republicans used the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to pass the resolution, despite the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruling that the CRA could not be used to overturn the waivers. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said that Republicans 'violated the plain text of the Congressional Review Act, changed the Clean Air Act, and broke the filibuster.' Darren Baskt, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, disagrees, saying that the CRA is exempt from the filibuster and the parliamentarian was never authorized to interpret these resolutions in the first place. Philip Rossetti, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, warns that if the CRA can't be used on a waiver, Congress' role in overseeing regulations would be substantially lessened, and Democrats may attach unrelated policies to large spending bills in the future.

**Tribunal de Cundinamarca Admits Demand to Remove Jaime Dussán from Colpensiones Presidency**
The Administrative Court of Cundinamarca has accepted a compliance demand against the Board of Directors of Colpensiones to remove the current president, Jaime Dussán, from his position. This is due to not having presented the postgraduate degree validated within the time required by law. According to Paloma Valencia, senator of the Centro Democrático and presidential candidate, Dussán did not present the documents to certify the experience that supports his appointment. She explained that while the official presented in his resume that he took a master's degree abroad, the title is not validated by the Ministry of Education, making it invalid and not meeting the requirements to lead the entity. The court has also requested that Colpensiones present the following documents within three days: the agreement No. 012 of 2022, the act of the Board of Directors session where Dussán was appointed, and the act of his possession as president on December 2, 2022. The decision on this demand will be made within twenty days of the demand's admission.

**Senate GOP repeals Biden-era CA emissions waiver as controversy brews over purported rule-bending**
The Senate voted to repeal California's waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency, which would have allowed the state to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than the federal government. Republicans argued that the waiver would have effectively allowed other states to adopt stricter emissions standards as well. Senate Republican Leader John Thune said, 'I expect Democrats to scream bloody murder about undermining the filibuster, but this is a very narrow, novel case.' Sen. John Barrasso expressed concern about the economic impact of California's decision on the rest of the country, saying, 'This is not just a California problem. It is a nationwide assault on gas-powered cars in America.' The Senate's nonpartisan procedural referee, Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, disagreed with the Republicans' interpretation of the Congressional Review Act. The vote passed along party lines, with Democrats opposing the repeal of the waiver.

From the very start, she has been saying, 'I am ready for the impeachment.'

**Polémica en Bolivia por la postulación al Senado del presidente Luis Arce**
Bolivian President Luis Arce has been nominated as a candidate for the Senate by the ruling party, the Movement for Socialism (MAS), for the upcoming general elections on August 17. This move has been criticized by opposition parliamentarians and some MAS officials who are loyal to former President Evo Morales. Morales' loyalists, such as Senator Leonardo Loza, consider Arce's nomination as 'cowardly' and an attempt to 'save himself and protect himself from the bad management and corruption that he has generated' during his presidency. Loza also stated that Arce is 'looking for his impunity as a senator candidate'. Other critics, such as Deputy Carlos Alarcón, believe that Arce is seeking to avoid accountability and is 'looking for a seat in the Senate to avoid a responsibility trial'. However, Deputy José Luis Flores, who is loyal to Arce, argues that there is no intention to seek impunity, citing the current Constitution which has removed some privileges that parliamentarians had in the previous Constitution.

**Republicans are about to overrule parliamentarian on California EV law. Dems say it's a warning sign**
Senate Republicans are planning to override the parliamentarian's decision on a California electric vehicle law using the Congressional Review Act. The parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, has ruled that the law cannot be overturned using the CRA. However, Republicans argue that they should ignore her opinion because it is based on a Government Accountability Office decision. Democrats say that this would set a precedent for future Senate decisions and could lead to the 'nuclear option' of overruling the parliamentarian on reconciliation bills. Republicans claim that this situation is different and that they will not set a precedent for future procedural changes. The outcome of the vote is uncertain, with some Republicans undecided and Democrats strongly opposed to the effort.

**Senate parliamentarian: Who is the unelected official getting say on Trump's 'big, beautiful bill?'**
The Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, has the final say on what measures can be included in President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' via the budget reconciliation process. The parliamentarian's role is to advise the Senate on the chamber's rules and precedent, and they have the power to strip out measures not relevant to the contours of reconciliation. MacDonough has garnered bipartisan respect for her handling of the role, and has been described as having a 'small-c' conservative approach to what is allowable. Senate Republicans have signaled they believe they have the legal basis for moving forward with certain provisions, but the parliamentarian's say is still crucial. 'At the end of the day, it really is a judgment call,' said a former senior Senate aide. 'We think the law is very clear, and ultimately the budget committee chairman makes that determination,' said Senate Majority Leader John Thune. 'They've actually been pretty conservative in how they've approached the language,' said Paul Winfree, president of the Economic Policy Innovation Center.

**Senators weigh next move on California clean car rules**
Senate Republicans are considering defying Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough's ruling that Biden administration waivers for vehicle pollution standards are not rules and cannot be repealed under the Congressional Review Act. Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) is weighing whether to ignore the parliamentarian's decision, despite her ruling being nonbinding. Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said, 'We're looking at our options right now.' Republicans have introduced three CRA resolutions against the Biden waivers and must decide by May whether to proceed. Some lawmakers see defying the parliamentarian's ruling as an attack on the filibuster, while others, like Capito, are not concerned about setting a precedent. The Clean Air Act allows California to set more stringent emissions rules, with EPA's blessing, and other states can follow suit.

**Reporter's Notebook: Power player on Capitol Hill**
Elizabeth MacDonough, the Senate parliamentarian, is a crucial figure in the passage of President Trump's tax and spending cuts. As a referee of sorts, she decides what's allowed in the bill based on special Senate budget rules. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham forged ahead on the Senate's latest framework for the tax cut package, but the next step in passing the bill could be trickier. MacDonough's rulings could alter the trajectory of the president's 'big, beautiful bill.' Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, 'We are in conversations, as you know, with the parliamentarian about the best way to get budget reconciliation we're trying to help across the finish line.' House conservatives are aiming to implement steep spending cuts, but those special Senate budget rules make it hard for GOP senators to go as deep as the House would like. Rep. Eric Burlison said, 'It is an unusual thing that one unelected official has so much authority.' The parliamentarian plays a key role in the budget reconciliation process, and her rulings could have sway in the passage of the bill.

**Republicans May Override Senate's Nonpartisan Referee To Pass Trump's Agenda: What To Know**
Republicans are planning to potentially override the Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, as they move ahead with President Donald Trump's policy proposals. The parliamentarian's role is to decide what provisions make it into the final bill and how long those provisions can last. Republicans are seeking to pass Trump's entire agenda, including tax cuts, energy policy, border policy, defense, and other areas, using the reconciliation process. However, this process is heavily restricted, and the parliamentarian's rulings are not binding. Republicans have given some indications that they won't necessarily rely on the parliamentarian's ruling about how to calculate the total financial impact of the bill. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, 'We think the law is very clear, and ultimately the budget committee chairman makes that determination.' Senator Ted Cruz expressed confidence that the current policy baseline would be chosen, citing President Barack Obama's use of the current policy baseline to extend Bush-era tax cuts in 2013. Senator Tommy Tuberville was skeptical that the parliamentarian's decision would be overridden, saying, 'Republicans have no choice but to respect the ruling.'

MacDonough has described her view of her role as above partisanship, saying, 'While serving its 100 members on a day-to-day basis, I still represent the Senate.... I represent the Senate with its traditions of unfettered debate, protection of minority rights, and equal power among the states.' The outcome of this situation is unclear, and it's uncertain whether Republicans would go ahead with their plans if the parliamentarian's ruling goes against them.

**Senate Parliamentarian Could Derail Trump's Entire Agenda**
Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough is set to decide whether Congress can treat $4.6 trillion in proposed tax cuts as 'free' from the point of view of the budget process. Senate Republicans want to use a different scoring method called the 'current policy' baseline, which would assume that extending tax cuts costs $0 because they're already law. However, this approach is seen as a 'lie' by critics, as it creates a 'perpetual-motion machine' where costs are defined out of existence. MacDonough's decision could have significant implications for Donald Trump's legislative agenda, with major policy stakes at play. As the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget explains, this approach is 'nihilistic, ahistorical, and inaccurate.'

**GOP counts on obscure Senate referee to pass Trump's tax agenda - Washington Examiner**
The fate of President Donald Trump's tax agenda may rest in the hands of Elizabeth MacDonough, the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian. Senate Republicans are pursuing a novel way to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent by treating the price tag as cost-free using a 'current policy baseline.' This approach would loosen the tight restrictions that govern reconciliation, a budget process that allows Republicans to sidestep the filibuster. However, Democrats have expressed concerns over the tactic, and MacDonough's ruling will be crucial in determining the fate of the bill. Senate Republicans are projecting confidence that MacDonough will rule in their favor, but there is genuine apprehension over the Senate's strategy. Rep. Jason Smith (R-MO) expressed 'huge concern' over the bill possibly hinging on the parliamentarian's ruling, while Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) is reluctant to support the current policy baseline approach due to its effect on the debt.
