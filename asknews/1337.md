**James Webb Space Telescope Discovers Ancient Galaxy MoM-z14**
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has broken its own record by detecting a new, ancient galaxy called MoM-z14, which existed just 280 million years after the Big Bang. This discovery, led by a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under the direction of astronomer Rohan Naidu, represents a significant milestone in observational astronomy and raises new questions for cosmology. MoM-z14 has a redshift of 14.44, making it the most distant galaxy confirmed by spectroscopy, surpassing the previous record held by JADES-GS-z14-0 with a z=14.32. The discovery was made through the Mirage program, a spectroscopic survey designed to identify galaxies with high redshifts, indicating great distance and age. MoM-z14 was detected through a 10-hour observation with the NIRSpec instrument on the Webb telescope, capturing its stretched infrared light due to the universe's expansion. The spectroscopic signal showed clear emissions of hydrogen and oxygen, indicating the presence of multiple generations of stars. Charlotte Mason, an astrophysicist from the University of Copenhagen, said, 'It's very exciting because it confirms that these bright galaxies really exist in the universe.' MoM-z14 is not only notable for its age but also for its structure and composition. The galaxy has a diameter of just 1600 light-years, placing it in the range of dwarf galaxies. However, it shines with an intensity that surprised researchers, with a luminosity 100 times greater than expected for objects of that age, challenging current models of the universe's early structure evolution. The chemical composition of MoM-z14 caught the attention of astrophysicists, revealing an elevated nitrogen-to-carbon ratio, an unusual feature in such primitive objects. This characteristic recalls the chemistry of ancient globular clusters in the Milky Way, dense star formations that exist since the early stages of our galaxy. This parallel led scientists to propose that MoM-z14 could represent an early example of star formation in environments similar to those clusters. 'It's like finding a cosmic fossil that connects the past and present of the cosmos,' explained the researchers in the work published on the arXiv preprint server last week. Additionally, the data revealed details about its immediate surroundings, showing that the space around MoM-z14 appears partially ionized, contrary to predictions from simulation models. This feature implies that the galaxy's ultraviolet radiation could have altered the state of the surrounding gas, suggesting an earlier start to the reionization process. Until now, it was believed that this phenomenon occurred in a context dominated by neutral gas. However, the observation of MoM-z14 indicates that certain sectors of the universe were already ionized 280 million years after the Big Bang.

**Historic Discovery of Star Formation in the Andalusian Region: A Study Confirms How Stars are Born in the Milky Way**
A team of international scientists has captured the process of star formation in a region of the universe with extreme conditions, using the James Webb Space Telescope and joint research between universities and centers. The area, known as Sagittarius C, is located 200 light-years from Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole at the galactic center. The region has a dense molecular gas cloud that has been collapsing slowly for millions of years, generating the formation of thousands of young stars. The study, led by the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia (IAA-CSIC), has detected intense magnetic fields that traverse Sagittarius C, configuring hot hydrogen gas into long, bright filaments. According to Samuel Crowe, researcher at the University of Virginia, 'these magnetic fields give Sagittarius C a different appearance than any other star-forming region in the galaxy outside the galactic center.' The scientists believe that these magnetic fields may slow down or even prevent the gravitational collapse necessary for star formation, explaining why regions like the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) produce fewer stars than expected. The team has also identified over a hundred jets of material, linked to low-mass proto-stars, and even recorded, for the first time in the infrared, jets associated with two massive stars with 20 times the mass of the Sun. Rubén Fedriani, researcher at the IAA and supervisor of the project, notes that 'the main objective of these observations was the study of star formation processes, particularly of massive stars, that is, those with more than eight times the mass of the Sun.' This discovery suggests that star formation in this area follows similar processes to the rest of the galaxy, demonstrating that even in extreme environments like the galactic center, new stars can be born. Despite its intense current activity, experts warn that the life of Sagittarius C as a star nursery may be coming to an end.

**Cosmic Collision Observed, Galaxy's Star-Forming Ability Reduced**
Astronomers observed a cosmic collision between two galaxies using the VLT and ALMA telescopes, operated by the OES in Chile. The galaxies are moving towards each other at 500 kilometers per second and will collide. One galaxy uses a quasar to 'pierce' the other galaxy with radiation. According to the OES, the light from the collision took over 11 billion years to reach Earth, allowing astronomers to observe it as it was when the Universe was 18% of its current age. The quasar's radiation 'breaks' the gas and dust clouds of the impacted galaxy, leaving behind only small and dense regions. The OES states that these regions are 'probably too small' to form new stars, leaving the galaxy with 'fewer star-forming nurseries'. 'This is a unique opportunity to study the effects of a cosmic collision on galaxy evolution,' said the OES in a statement.

**Historic Observation: Cosmic Duel Discovered Between Galaxies**
An international team led by scientists from France and Chile has successfully observed the collision process of two galaxies 11 billion light-years away. In this rare event, one galaxy is attacking the other with strong radiation beams, weakening its star-forming capacity. Scientists have described this interaction as a 'cosmic duel', similar to medieval jousting tournaments. The observation was made using data from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope over a period of four years. Researchers observed that the attacking galaxy is sending radiation beams from a supermassive black hole at its center, known as a quasar, to the opposing galaxy. According to NASA, quasars are bright structures formed when matter falling into a black hole heats up to millions of degrees. The strong beams of light from these structures are dispersing the gas clouds in the opposing galaxy, preventing the formation of new stars. Normally, stars form when a large amount of gas and dust collapses under its own gravity. However, in this observed event, the quasar's beam is breaking up and dispersing the gas, making it impossible for new stars to form. The research suggests that the material from the attacked galaxy is feeding the black hole, increasing its power and further weakening the galaxy's star-forming mechanism. Sergei Balashev, a co-author from the Ioffe Institute in Russia, says, 'This is the first direct observation of a quasar's effect on the molecular gas of a nearby galaxy.' This type of effect has only been theoretically discussed before. When scientists tried to study this quasar in more detail using low-resolution telescope data, they discovered that it was actually two separate galaxies interacting. The high-resolution power of the ALMA telescope revealed that the galaxies are separated by thousands of light-years. Since the light from these galaxies has been traveling to us for 11 billion years, scientists believe that they may have merged by now, but it is impossible to confirm. Dong-Woo Kim from the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics notes that galaxy mergers were more common in the early universe when the universe was denser. During this period, galaxies frequently merged to form larger systems. Kim believes that galaxy mergers are still happening today, and even the Milky Way is expected to merge with the Andromeda Galaxy in a few billion years.

**Astronomers Observe Destruction of Star Clusters in Galaxy Collision**
Astronomers have observed the destruction of star clusters in a galaxy colliding with another for the first time. This was made possible by data from the VLT and ALMA telescopes, which observed a pair of galaxies 11 billion light-years away. The observations showed how the powerful radiation of a quasar, the active core of one of the galaxies, affects its neighbor, destroying gas clouds and stopping the process of star formation. The collision of galaxies is a natural phenomenon that is considered a catalyst for the activation of quasars. A quasar is a region around a supermassive black hole that emits a huge amount of energy, absorbing material from the surrounding environment. The ultraviolet and X-ray radiation of the quasar can ionize gas and dust in the neighboring galaxy, changing its structure. Such processes have not been well studied, as most similar events occurred in the first billion years after the Big Bang. The VLT telescope instruments recorded the spectrum of radiation in a wide range, from ultraviolet to infrared, allowing the identification of individual atoms and molecules, as well as their concentration in the region where the active quasar is located. The ALMA radio telescope complemented these data with information about molecular carbon dioxide, important for the formation of new stars. Together, these results allowed for a complete picture of the destructive impact of the quasar. Modeling shows that the quasar's radiation destroys carbon dioxide molecules, leaving only dense but small gas clumps in the galaxy. These are insufficient to maintain active star formation. This leads to the decline of new star formation over hundreds of millions of years and explains why many massive galaxies in our universe have stopped being 'star factories.' The importance of these results lies in their ability to recreate the early stages of galaxy development and reveal the reasons why some of them stopped their development. Astronomers note that stopping star formation is not always final: there are known cases where such galaxies 'wake up' to a new stage of star formation after millions of years. Such observations allow for a better understanding of the past and possible future of the universe.

**Groundbreaking Discovery Reveals 'Monstrous Red' Galaxies in the Universe**
An international team of scientists has discovered three ancient galaxies in the universe that are forming stars at nearly twice the efficiency of the rest, a finding that raises new questions about the theories of star formation. The research, led by the University of Geneva, reveals that these galaxies already existed in the first billion years after the Big Bang and have grown at 'unexpected' rates, reaching a size almost as massive as the Milky Way. The 'monstrous red' galaxies, as the researchers call them, have grown much faster than previously thought. The researchers analyzed a complete sample of galaxies formed within the first billion years of cosmic history using the James Webb Space Telescope, located 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. The findings, although not contradicting the standard cosmological model, raise questions about the theories of galaxy formation, especially those that developed in the early universe. 'As we delve deeper into their study, these galaxies will offer new perspectives on the conditions that shaped the first ages of the universe,' said Mengyuan Xiao, researcher at the University of Geneva and author of the study.

**Galactic Time Machine: NASA's Webb Reveals 12 Billion Years of Galaxy Evolution**
The James Webb Space Telescope has revealed 12 billion years of galaxy evolution, providing a window into the chaotic youth of the universe. An international team of astronomers has detected the largest sample of galaxy groups ever, with 1,678 galaxy groups or proto-clusters. According to Ghassem Gozaliasl, 'We're able to actually observe some of the first galaxies formed in the universe.' The study shows how galaxies evolved from irregular, star-forming structures to majestic spirals and ellipticals, influenced by dark matter and colossal black holes. 'Like humans, galaxies come together and make families,' explains Gozaliasl. 'Groups and clusters are really important, because within them galaxies can interact and merge together, resulting in the transformation of galaxy structure and morphology.'

**How magnetar flares give birth to gold and platinum – Physics World**
A new study suggests that powerful flares on highly-magnetic neutron stars called magnetars could produce up to 10% of the universe's gold, silver, and platinum. Researchers believe that these flares create unstable isotopes that quickly decay into stable heavy elements, including gold and platinum. According to Anirudh Patel, 'This estimate accounts for the fact that these giant flares are rare, but it's also important to note that magnetars have lifetimes of 1000 to 10,000 years, so while there may only be a couple of dozen magnetars known to us today, there have been many more magnetars that have lived and died over the course of the 13 billion-year history of our galaxy.' Patel's research suggests that giant flares on magnetars contribute between 1-10% of all the r-process elements in the universe, which are produced by the rapid capture of neutrons by lighter nuclei.

**What Are The Odds Of Alien Life?**
The Drake Equation is a mathematical framework for estimating the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. While it doesn't provide a definitive answer, it sets parameters for scientists to study and refine as our understanding of the universe expands. Dr. Frank Drake, then president of the SETI Institute, convened a historic meeting at the Green Bank Observatory in November 1961 to discuss the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, attended by luminaries such as Carl Sagan and Philip Morrison. The equation serves as a 'Rosetta Stone' for guiding discussions and scientific inquiries into the appearance of life and its development into something capable of sending messages across the light-years. 'It was a privilege to be in the company of so many famous and cerebral individuals,' said Dr. Drake, highlighting the significance of the meeting. 'The equation isn't a formula that spits out a number, but rather a tool for guiding our understanding of the universe and the possibility of life beyond Earth.'

**SETI, Civilizational Longevity, and the Drake Equation: Why AI Risks Matter | HackerNoon**
A scenario suggests that almost all technical civilizations collapse due to AI-induced calamities on timescales set by their widespread adoption of AI. The Drake Equation estimates the longevity (L) of a communicating civilization to be around 100-200 years. The equation considers the number (N) of radiocommunicating technical civilizations in the galaxy, with the first three astronomical terms relatively well established. However, the next three terms (fl · fi · fc) are not, with astronomers assuming optimistic values and biologists suggesting much smaller values. Even with optimistic values, the derived value for N is low, consistent with the null results from current SETI surveys. The window for detectable interstellar radio transmissions is extremely limited, and the detection of other civilizations will be challenging even for those located within our local stellar neighbourhood. The authors suggest that SETI researchers may need to consider the types of instruments required to conduct meaningful surveys, including an 'all-sky' capability. They also note that a post-biological technical civilization would be well-adapted to space exploration and could potentially spread its presence throughout the Galaxy. The absence of detectable signs of Kardashev Type II and Type III civilizations implies that such entities are either exceedingly rare or non-existent, reinforcing the notion of a 'Great Filter' that halts the progress of a technical civilization within a few centuries of its emergence. As Fagner Brack said, 'it's conceivable that the first successful attempts to propel light-weight electronic systems toward the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, might be realised before the century's close, and AI components could form an integral part of these miniature payloads.'

**The Fermi Paradox: A Search for Extraterrestrial Life and Understanding Ourselves**
The Fermi Paradox, also known as the 'Great Silence', highlights the contradictions in our understanding of extraterrestrial life. Despite the passage of time since the Big Bang, we have not found any evidence of their existence, despite recent discoveries of exoplanets in habitable zones. According to physicist Enrico Fermi, 'If AI is the brain of a robot, then RPA is its hands.' One factor to consider when searching for an answer to the Fermi Paradox is the number of potential civilizations. This value allows us to determine the Drake equation, a mathematical formula that outputs the number of active, communication-capable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. The equation uses several factors, including star formation rate, percentage of stars with planets, number of habitable planets per star, percentage of planets where life emerged, percentage of planets where intelligent life developed, number of civilizations developing detectable communication technologies, and average lifespan of such civilizations. In short, the Drake equation claims that there should be many civilizations, but so far, SETI programs have not detected any signals. This raises the question of the scientific justification for such programs. Matthew Chilcote's article does not provide a direct answer to this question, but instead proposes a method for evaluating the probability of detecting a signal by a certain number of broadcasting civilizations by now. If the probability is low, the lack of evidence should not be surprising; if it is high, the silence may mean something. Chilcote's model suggests that the absence of detected electromagnetic signals from extraterrestrial civilizations may impose constraints on the number of existing civilizations. In certain scenarios, the model predicts a 99% chance of detecting at least one signal if the assumed number of civilizations (based on the Drake equation) is around 1. We have a zero result so far. However, it's worth noting that even the absence of positive results from SETI helps in resolving the Fermi Paradox: it allows us to exclude certain combinations of the number and lifespan of civilizations. Ultimately, as Universe Today writes, the purpose of programs like SETI is not only to search for extraterrestrial life, but also to better understand ourselves and the conditions that make intelligent life possible. A team of scientists from Germany studied the feasibility of a new method of searching for extraterrestrial life - using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They came to an unencouraging but important conclusion for the development of astronomy.

**Why the Cosmos is Silent? Scientists Link the Fermi Paradox to the Absence of SETI Signals**
A new study reevaluates the 'cosmic silence' by proposing a model that turns the lack of SETI signals into a tool for assessing the chances of finding extraterrestrial intelligence. The work focuses on the Fermi paradox, questioning why, despite billions of stars in the Milky Way, we have not yet detected signs of other civilizations. The authors consider the Galaxy as a flat disk, with a diameter of approximately 100,000 light-years, 100 times greater than its thickness. The signal from a hypothetical civilization is modeled as two expanding rings: the first corresponds to the beginning of transmission, and the second to its completion. Earth must be in the space between them, like in a temporal corridor. The probability of such an event for one source is calculated using the formula ≈0.6????/????, where???? is the distance between the rings (transmission duration multiplied by the speed of light), and???? is the radius of the Galaxy. This model is integrated with the Drake equation, which estimates the number of communicative civilizations (????) as the product of seven factors, from star formation rates to the probability of technological development. The key finding is that if???? approaches 1 (an optimistic scenario), and the duration of signal transmission is approximately 630 years (???? ≈ 102.8 light-years), the probability of detecting at least one signal exceeds 99%. This makes the lack of SETI results statistically significant - either such civilizations are extremely rare, or their 'window' of activity is shorter. Calculations also show that if???? ≥ 1, there cannot be more than a thousand civilizations in the Galaxy simultaneously transmitting signals. If the number of civilizations is higher, it means that one of the parameters of the Drake equation, such as the chance of the emergence of consciousness or technologies, is significantly underestimated. The model has limitations, including the Galaxy's three-dimensionality, signal attenuation with distance, and non-uniform distribution of civilizations or impulsive data transmission. However, even the simplified version demonstrates how the 'zero result' of SETI allows narrowing the parameters of the Drake equation. The next step will be to complicate the model, transitioning to a three-dimensional structure of the Milky Way, accounting for historical changes (emergence and extinction of civilizations), and realistic patterns of communication.

**The 40-Year Quest for Extraterrestrial Intelligence**
The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project has been searching for life beyond Earth for 40 years, since its inception in 1985. The project's founders, including Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi, were inspired by the idea of using gamma-ray signals to communicate with other civilizations. They proposed using the spectral line of neutral hydrogen as a means of communication, as it is the most abundant element in the universe. The project's early results were promising, but the search for extraterrestrial signals has been ongoing for decades with no conclusive evidence. In the 1960s, Frank Drake, a young astronomer, independently developed a similar project, called 'Ozma', which aimed to listen for signals from nearby stars. The project was supported by notable scientists, including Otto Struve, who predicted the existence of exoplanets. The SETI project has undergone several iterations, including the development of the Drake equation, which attempts to estimate the number of advanced civilizations in the galaxy. The equation takes into account factors such as the rate of star formation, the number of planets per star, and the number of planets capable of supporting life. Despite the lack of conclusive evidence, the SETI project continues to inspire scientists and the public alike, and its legacy has led to a greater understanding of the universe and our place within it.

**Scientists Create Equation to Search for Life on Venus**
Scientists have created an equation to search for life on Venus. The equation, called VLE, is similar to the Drake equation and can estimate the probability of life on Venus. 'The fundamental goal of VLE is to provide a basis for assessing the probability of life,' said Diana Gentri, director of the NASA Astrobiology Laboratory. The equation is L=OxRxC, where L is the probability of life, and O, R, and C are three parameters: origin, strength, and continuity. Each parameter has a value from 0 to 1. The origin of life can occur through abiogenesis or panspermia, and this factor does not change over time. The strength of life depends on the availability of nutrients CHNOPS, access to energy, and functional diversity of life. Earth has a high value of R, which explains the stability of life on our planet. The continuity of life depends on the stability of the star and the planet's orbit, as well as geological stability and the absence of destructive events. 'Although we are limited by the problem of n=1, we can use our understanding of the genesis of life on Earth to study unknown aspects of life in other worlds,' explain the authors of the study. This approach can help us in the search for life on exoplanets. Understanding Venus gives us a key to solving the natural puzzle of the Solar System.

**New Forms of Estimating Alien Life in the Universe: Revisiting the Drake Equation**
Frank Drake, an American astronomer and radio astronomer, developed the Drake Equation in 1961 to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in the galaxy that might be able to communicate with Earth. The equation is expressed as: N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L, where each term carries significant uncertainties, making it more of a conceptual tool than a precise calculation. Some variables, such as R*, can be estimated with some accuracy, while others, like fi and fc, remain uncertain. Advances in astronomy and astrobiology have refined some of these factors over the years. The discovery of exoplanets has improved our understanding of fp and ne. However, the fraction of planets where life emerges (fl) and evolves into intelligence (fi) remains unknown. 'Intelligence and technological capability seem to be more uncommon phenomena, considering that billions of species existed before one developed the ability to send radio signals into space,' said an expert. The time of life of technological civilizations (L) is another crucial factor. If civilizations are common but have short lifetimes due to self-destruction or natural disasters, the chance of detecting them would be low. This point raises philosophical and scientific implications about the future of humanity. Modern versions of the equation have been developed, incorporating new concepts and refining the original parameters. Some scientists have added variables related to bio-signatures and technosignatures, while others have suggested including terms that address the impact of catastrophic events.

**The Drake Equation and Alien Typologies Catalogued by Ufologists Based on Case Studies**
The Drake Equation, a mathematical formula to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way, has been updated to 2025. Using values such as the rate of star formation, the fraction of stars with planetary systems, and the average lifespan of a technological civilization, the equation yields an optimistic N = 0.08, implying we might be alone or nearly so. In contrast, ufology has compiled an array of alleged alien races, drawing from a wealth of testimonies that have repeatedly and consistently confirmed the sighting of certain extraterrestrial typologies. When merging the Drake Equation with ufologists' alien typologies, two approaches emerge: either the lifespan of civilizations would need to rise significantly, or intelligence or communicative capacity would need to be far more prevalent than assumed. Alternatively, each civilization estimated by Drake might give rise to multiple races, yielding a figure modest compared to ufological accounts. Challenges and reflections arise from the lack of definitive data for many parameters in the Drake Equation and the need for objective scientific validation of ufological cataloguing.

**The Great Silence: Why Aliens Haven't Contacted Us -- Or Have They?**
The possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life and Earth visitation remains a topic of debate. Modern astrobiology has revealed that planets are abundant in our galaxy, with over 5,000 exoplanets confirmed as of 2023, and one-fifth of stars estimated to have planets in the 'habitable zone' where temperatures could allow liquid water. The building blocks of life have been found in interstellar clouds and meteorites, suggesting the chemistry for life might be common. However, the emergence of intelligent, technological civilizations is far more uncertain, and the famous Drake Equation provides a framework to estimate the number of advanced civilizations by considering factors like the rate of star formation and the likelihood of life and intelligence. As of now, there is no conclusive evidence to prove or disprove the existence of intelligent alien life or their visitation to Earth.

**NASA Hopes to Reestablish Contact with Extraterrestrials**
The NASA is hoping to reestablish contact with extraterrestrials using a new method. The famous Drake equation calculates the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy, and it is not zero. It is now established that space is teeming with exoplanets located in the habitable zone of their star. Therefore, it is logical that scientists wonder what method would be the most effective for communicating with another form of life. 'The space is full of exoplanets, and it's only a matter of time before we find one that is capable of supporting life,' said a scientist. The NASA is currently exploring different options for communication, including the use of radio signals and laser pulses.
