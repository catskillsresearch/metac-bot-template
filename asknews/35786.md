**GOP Representative Bill Huizenga Says He's Being 'Encouraged to Run' for Michigan Senate Seat in 2026 | National Review**
Representative Bill Huizenga (R., Mich.) has confirmed that he will attend a regional GOP fundraising dinner in June, sparking speculation that he may run for the Michigan Senate seat in 2026. Huizenga stated, 'I continue to be encouraged to run and am flattered,' but has not made a final decision. If he runs, he will face a tough primary against declared candidate Mike Rogers, who has secured endorsements from Tim Scott and John Thune. Flipping the seat back to Republican control in 2026 will be challenging, as Michigan's midterm elections typically favor the opposing party.

**US Midterm Elections: A New and Challenging Landscape**
The United States is heading towards a midterm election in the fall of 2026, which will be the second for President Donald Trump and the third for the billionaire Republican. Despite his declining popularity and 'achievements' that have not pleased voters, President Joe Biden is still considered a strong contender. Biden managed to prevent a 'tsunami' of Republican votes in the 2022 midterm elections, and limited the Democratic Party's losses. Trump, who lost the 2020 presidential election, has become a key player in the subsequent midterm elections. This time, the election will include the contest for all 453 seats in the House of Representatives and one-third of the 100 seats in the Senate. Observers believe that Trump, with his return to the presidency this year, has created a new and challenging electoral landscape. Trump's supporters are optimistic about his chances, citing his ability to expand the Republican Party's base and attract new voters, including minorities and moderate-income individuals. However, the Democratic Party is also making gains, particularly among young voters and those who are dissatisfied with the current administration. The election is expected to be highly competitive, with both parties facing significant challenges. The Republican Party is trying to maintain its control of the House of Representatives, while the Democratic Party is seeking to regain its majority. The election will also be influenced by the ongoing controversy surrounding Trump's presidency, including his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and his relationship with foreign leaders. The outcome of the election will have significant implications for the country's politics and policies.

**How Both Parties are Messaging on Medicaid as 2026 Midterms Heat Up | National Review**
As the 2026 midterms heat up, both parties are messaging on Medicaid. Democrats are attacking Republicans for cutting Medicaid to fund tax cuts for billionaires, while Republicans are countering that they are 'protecting Medicaid' with common-sense reforms. According to a National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) strategy memo, Republicans should focus on immigration and entitlements, and argue that Democrats 'want Medicaid for illegal immigrants and no work requirements.' Democrats, on the other hand, believe that Republicans are starting off with a disadvantage on the Medicaid issue, given their traditional stance on gutting entitlements. They plan to humanize the entitlement attack line by attaching names and faces of GOP lawmakers' constituents who will lose Medicaid coverage. As Senate Republicans make their own tweaks to the bill, Democrats also plan to tie the uncertainty surrounding tariffs to Republicans. 'The one thing about the Republicans' reconciliation bill is that Democrats are united like never before,' said ranking House Rules Committee Democrat Jim McGovern. 'From the left to the right within our party, everybody understands that this is a crappy bill.'

**Senate Republican campaign committee 'grills' Chuck Schumer on National Hamburger Day**
The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) is using National Hamburger Day to mock Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer's 2024 Father's Day post, where he appeared to put cheese on an uncooked burger patty. The NRSC released a video titled 'We Grill Right,' which highlights Schumer's cooking skills, or lack thereof. NRSC chair Sen. Tim Scott told Fox News Digital that his goal is to win 55 seats in the Senate in the 2026 midterm elections. The NRSC is also criticizing Democrats for spending millions of dollars to better communicate with male and working-class voters, saying it's 'figuring out how to be a normal American' that takes at least $20 million. 'Shouldn't take much to know how to grill a burger or correctly call a pick six, but apparently for Democrats, figuring out how to be a normal American takes at least $20 million -- and even that won't be enough,' said NRSC regional press secretary Nick Puglia. Republicans currently control the Senate with a 53-47 majority and aim to expand their majority in the 2026 elections.

**Murphy: If GOP Passes Trump's Big Beautiful Bill They'll 'Get Smoked' in Midterms**
Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) warned that if Republicans pass President Donald Trump's spending bill with Medicaid cuts, they will 'get smoked' in the 2026 midterm elections. Murphy stated that the Republican Party still operates like a cult, with Trump having significant power to dictate votes. He added that if Trump forces senators to vote for $15 billion in Medicaid cuts, the party will face consequences in the midterms, as Trump does not need to stand for reelection. Murphy questioned whether the Senate will exercise independence, as it did in the past.

**Both sides launch ad campaigns over budget vote as bill moves to Senate - Roll Call**
Both parties have launched ad campaigns over the budget vote as the bill moves to the Senate. The National Republican Congressional Committee announced a digital ad campaign targeting 25 vulnerable House Democrats for 'voting for the largest U.S. tax hike in generations.' On the Democratic side, House Majority Forward is planning paid campaigns to hold Republicans accountable for their votes to cut Medicaid and raise prices. A recent poll found that the measure's tax provisions were popular, with 63% in favor of 'ending the federal income tax on tips' and 61% in favor of extending the 2017 tax cuts. The bill now moves to the Senate, where several Republican senators facing competitive reelection battles in 2026 will come under intense pressure to support the measure. As one Republican senator put it, 'It will be a fistfight next week, starting Monday, with all the Republicans looking at this bill, combining it with the House.'

**Rep. Bill Huizenga considering launching U.S. Senate campaign this summer**
U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga, a Republican from Holland, is considering running for the U.S. Senate in 2026 and could announce his campaign as soon as this summer. Huizenga said, 'I want to make sure we win,' and believes he has a good chance of winning the Senate seat. He is currently in a potential GOP primary race with former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who has received the backing of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. However, Huizenga is confident that he can win the primary and the general election, saying, 'Are we going to run the same play and expect a different result?' The U.S. Senate seat is open in 2026 after U.S. Sen. Gary Peters decided not to seek another term. Democrats are also vying for the seat, with U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens being one of four candidates seeking their party's nomination.

**21 Democrats who may try to succeed Trump in the 2028 presidential election**
The 2028 presidential election is already generating buzz, with several Democrats considering a run. Former Vice President Kamala Harris is weighing a 2026 gubernatorial campaign in California and a potential 2028 presidential bid. Other potential contenders include Pete Buttigieg, who has been active in the party and has made a high-profile stop in Iowa; Andy Beshear, the 47-year-old governor of Kentucky, who has expressed interest in running if he can unite the country; and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has co-headlined rallies with Sen. Bernie Sanders and has been floated as a potential primary challenger to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Other notable Democrats mentioned as potential contenders include Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, and Gina Raimondo, the former governor of Rhode Island. The field is wide open, and it won't be long before we see clear maneuvering from a litany of candidates.

**Sen. Tuberville says goodbye to Senate as he runs for Alabama governor**
Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., has announced his decision to forgo a second term in the Senate to run for Alabama's governor. Tuberville, a retired football coach, launched his gubernatorial run on Tuesday, centering his campaign around 'conservative Alabama values.' He stated, 'I'm doing this to help this country and the great state of Alabama. I'm a football coach. I'm a leader. I'm a builder. I'm a recruiter, and we're going to grow Alabama.' Tuberville's priorities include bringing manufacturing to the state, stopping illegal immigration, improving education, and keeping kids in the state to work. He has Trump's support and is likely to receive a highly coveted endorsement from the president. The race is expected to favor the Republican nominee, and Tuberville's exit from the Senate opens up his seat in the 2026 midterm elections.

**US Vice President J.D. Vance to Headline Trump Fundraiser in Las Vegas**
US Vice President J.D. Vance is the headliner for a fundraising event for Donald Trump in Las Vegas, where attendees will be required to pay $1 million. Vance has been developing as a strong force for Trump's political operations, and has recently appeared at private dinners and fundraising events for the Republican National Committee (RNC). Vance was appointed as the RNC's finance chairman in the spring, ahead of the party's efforts to maintain control of the House and Senate in the 2026 midterm elections. It is unclear who will attend the event, with a spokesperson for MAGA Inc. and a representative for the Vice President declining to comment. Donald Trump Jr. has also been involved in fundraising efforts, having spoken at a campaign event with then-Senator J.D. Vance in North Carolina in November. 'Irgendetwas Schlimmes ist passiert' (Something terrible has happened), said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, revealing a 'brutal' move by Putin, as Russia mobilizes a massive number of soldiers. 'Russland hat sie geklaut' (Russia has stolen them), Trump said, referring to US hypersonic missiles. '60 ist einfach das alte 60!' (60 is simply the old 60!), said Markus Lanz, criticizing the youth obsession with digital currencies and the establishment of a 'Valley' for them.

**Fact Check Team: Parties gear up for 2026 midterms as control of Congress up for grabs**
Both parties are gearing up for the 2026 midterm elections, with control of Congress up for grabs. According to the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, Republicans hold 220 of the 435 House seats, and Democrats need to win just three seats to reclaim the majority. In the Senate, Republicans have a 53-47 edge, but 35 seats are up for grabs, including two special elections in Florida and Ohio. Democrats need a net gain of four seats to flip the Senate. Key races are shaping up in districts like New York's 17th, Maine's 2nd, and Colorado's 8th, which are considered swing seats. Strategists are eyeing these districts as crucial to determining the balance of power in Washington. As one analyst noted, 'every seat counts' in the 2026 midterms, and the groundwork being laid today could decide who governs after November 2026.

**2026 midterm elections begin to take shape as Democrats look to break up GOP trifecta**
The 2026 midterm elections are taking shape, with candidates emerging for both the House and Senate. Democrats are on defense in the House, with 39 seats rated competitive, while Republicans hold a razor-thin majority in the Senate. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) is considering retirement, which could lead to a competitive primary. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) has raised $3 million in the first quarter of the year, fueling speculation about a possible Senate run. In the House, Rep. Chris Pappas (D-NH) is running for the Senate, and Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Angie Craig (D-MN) are weighing bids for the open Senate seat in Minnesota. Republicans are eyeing the open seat in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District, which could shift from 'likely Democrat' to a Republican target. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has removed himself from consideration for the Michigan Senate seat, leaving the door open for a presidential run in 2028. Young progressive Democrats are launching bids against incumbents, while Republicans are preparing for tough primary challenges, including a potential challenge to Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.

**Democrats want to punish Trump in the 2026 midterms. Here are the five Senate seats most likely to flip**
Democrats are eyeing five Senate seats that they believe are most likely to flip in the 2026 midterm election. The seats are held by Republicans Thom Tillis (North Carolina), Jon Ossoff (Georgia), Susan Collins (Maine), and are open in New Hampshire and Michigan. Democrats need to win five seats to take back the House of Representatives, and four Senate seats to gain back the majority. While it's mathematically possible for Democrats to flip the Senate, it seems unlikely. The five seats are: Thom Tillis, who faces pushback from conservatives and a strong challenge from former Democratic governor Roy Cooper; Jon Ossoff, who will face major challenges in Georgia, including a potential run from former governor Brian Kemp; Susan Collins, who is chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and has mostly voted to confirm Trump's cabinet nominees; and open seats in New Hampshire and Michigan, where Democrats such as Chris Pappas and Gretchen Whitmer are potential candidates.

**Elon Musk reveals 2026 prediction after Trump's joint session speech**
Elon Musk believes that after President Donald Trump's joint session address, Republicans can win a larger majority in the Senate in the 2026 midterms, potentially reaching 60 Senators. Musk posted on X, 'After tonight, I am increasingly convinced that we can get to 60 Senators.' Democrats are not pleased with Musk's prominent role in government and his efforts to cut federal spending, which has led to thousands of job losses and billions in spending cuts. To fulfill Musk's prediction, the GOP would need to gain seven seats in the 2026 midterm elections. With 13 Democrats up for reelection in swing states, and 20 Republicans needing to hold onto their seats, the outcome is uncertain. Musk's prediction is based on his belief that Republican momentum will carry the party through the midterms and avoid allowing the upper chamber to flip back to Democrats.

**There will be another open Democratic Senate seat in 2026 midterms**
Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota announced she won't seek re-election in 2026, forcing the Democratic Party to defend another open seat in next year's midterm and making their goal of regaining the Senate majority more difficult. Smith said, 'I've decided not to run for re-election to the Senate in 2026... This job has been the honor of a lifetime.' Senate Republicans vowed to try and flip Smith's seat in blue-leaning Minnesota, while the Senate Democrats' campaign arm pledged to keep the seat in party hands. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer praised Smith as 'a remarkable senator -- smart, compassionate, and tireless in her commitment to Minnesota and the country.' Democrats plan to go on offense in blue-leaning Maine and battleground North Carolina, while Republicans will target first-term Sen. Jon Ossoff in battleground Georgia and longtime Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in swing state New Hampshire.

**First on Fox: Senate GOP campaign committee looks to streamline operations to hold majority in 2026**
The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) has unveiled its new vice chair program to streamline operations and defend the Senate majority in the 2026 midterm elections. The five vice chairs, including Sens. Jim Banks, Marsha Blackburn, Katie Britt, Bernie Moreno, and Pete Ricketts, will operate as an informal board of directors, providing ideas, oversight, and accountability. NRSC Chair Sen. Tim Scott said, 'We're one team. President Donald J. Trump and Senate Republicans are united to deliver for the American people and protect our Senate majority.' The vice chairs have pledged to raise $5 million for the committee, help with candidate recruitment, and take part in a new incumbent protection program. They emphasized the importance of holding the majority in 2026 to ensure President Trump has allies for four full years in the Senate. Senate Republicans will target open Democrat-held seats in battleground states, including Michigan, Georgia, and New Hampshire, while Democrats plan to go on offense in blue-leaning Maine and battleground North Carolina.
