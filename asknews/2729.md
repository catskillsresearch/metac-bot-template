**New 'green' RUPTL risks sidelining, rather than empowering renewables - Regulations - The Jakarta Post**
The 2025-2034 electricity business plan (RUPTL) may sideline renewable energy despite containing a large amount of planned green power. Experts suggest that the new power procurement plan is leaning towards repeating past mistakes and undermining energy transition commitments. According to Dody Setiawan, senior analyst for climate and energy at think tank Ember, 72% of the planned 42.6 GW of new and renewable energy projects are backloaded to the second half of the ten-year procurement period. In contrast, the government and state-utility company PLN have frontloaded 12.7 GW of coal and gas plants in the first half of the period. BMI Research has dubbed the plan a 'step back' from Indonesia's energy transition and climate commitment, citing a 'persistent reliance on coal' as a baseload power source despite a 2040 coal phase-target announced by President Prabowo Subianto.

**Lee backs nuclear power - for now**
Presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being' but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables like offshore wind to supply industrial hubs and aims to phase out coal by 2040. He supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' In contrast, Lee's main rival Kim Moon-soo supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60% of the mix. South Korea's latest energy blueprint aims for nuclear to make up 35% of the power mix by 2038, with renewables at 29%. If elected, Lee is expected to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30% of the power mix by 2030.

**$100 billion & counting high speed rail: Sacred cow of Sacramento Liars’ Club**
The California High Speed Rail project, initially estimated to cost $33.6 billion and complete by 2020, has ballooned to $100 billion and is now expected to be finished by 2040. The project's first segment, a 177-mile link between Merced and Bakersfield, is not expected to be completed until 2033, with a one-way ticket price estimated to be over $100. The article criticizes the project's focus on the San Francisco to Los Angeles corridor, which is not the most congested area, and suggests that the funds could be better spent on frequent rail trips between job-rich coastal cities and their respective affordable housing solutions. The author argues that the project's delays and cost overruns are due to the decision to make the venture 'kill-proof' by revving up pork barrel project mentality and re-marketing it as a way to battle climate change impacts. The article concludes that the project may become the default backbone for rail passenger movement between the north and south in California, but at a significant cost.

**California's High-Speed Rail Project Faces Financial Crisis**
California's High-Speed Rail project, led by Governor Gavin Newsom to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco in under three hours, is facing severe financial difficulties. According to Newsweek, the project has a $7 billion deficit, putting its continuation at risk if this issue is not resolved by next month. The project, initially proposed in 2008, has suffered several delays and cost overruns, with the current cost exceeding $100 billion and a planned completion date that could extend to 2040. Despite these challenges, Governor Newsom remains a strong supporter of the project, arguing that it will be crucial in reducing traffic congestion and combating climate change in the state. However, the financial crisis has led some California lawmakers to question the project's viability. Helen Kerstein, a representative of the California Legislative Office, warned that the High-Speed Rail will need an additional $7 billion to continue, and if this is not secured by June 2025, the project could be halted entirely. The project has also faced criticism from the federal government, with President Donald Trump labeling it a 'green disaster' and a 'waste'. The US Department of Transportation is conducting a thorough audit to evaluate whether federal funds were managed efficiently by California. If irregularities or poor budget management are found, there could be severe consequences, including the loss of funds or their reassignment to other federal infrastructure projects. Mark Tollefson, head of cabinet of the High-Speed Rail Authority, said that the new executive director of the project 'works diligently to obtain the best information regarding scope, schedule, and passenger numbers'. The future of the project remains uncertain, with some lawmakers expressing frustration over the lack of a clear plan to meet its deadlines and budgets. Despite the challenges, Governor Newsom remains committed to the project, saying in his podcast 'The Gavin Newsom Podcast' that 'we have begun to lay the tracks. This is starting to become very real'. However, he also acknowledged that there are financial restrictions that must be managed to ensure the project continues on the right path.

**The Line Construction Delayed, Estimated Completion Date Now 2080**
The construction of The Line, a city in Saudi Arabia, is significantly behind schedule. Initially, it was expected to be completed by 2030, but now it is estimated to be finished by 2080. The project, part of the Neom complex, was announced six years ago and construction began in 2022. However, the initial goal of 170 kilometers of The Line has been reduced to 2.4 kilometers, with the same completion date. The project's budget has also increased from 1.92 trillion dollars to 8.8 trillion dollars. Saudi officials say that the delay is normal for a project of this scale and that they are confident in its completion. The Line is designed to be a sustainable and luxurious city, powered by renewable energy, and is expected to be a model for other cities. However, experts and international media are predicting a possible failure of the project. As one official said, 'it is completely normal in constructions of this magnitude.'
