**Silver and Gold Prices Could Rise Significantly Due to Global Debt**
The immense debt of many countries, including the USA, could lead to a significant increase in the price of precious metals like gold and silver. The US debt amounts to almost 37 trillion US dollars, which is around 122% of GDP. The official budget deficit is more than two trillion US dollars, and interest payments alone account for around 20 percent of tax revenues. According to estimates, US debt will reach around 134 percent of GDP by 2035. The total global market capitalization for gold is around twelve times that of silver, but a silver bull market could be difficult to slow down due to its relatively small market size. If interest rates go down, this is particularly positive for silver, as the price of silver has risen significantly in such situations. Global economic growth is expected in 2026, which will drive demand for silver and increase the existing silver deficit. Companies like Fortuna Mining and U.S. GoldMining are well-positioned to extract the two precious metals from the ground.

**New 2030 Bond Generates Doubts Among Analysts and Investors**
Analyst Leonel Buccolo warned of a potential weakness in the local market, as the Merval index fell below the symbolic level of USD 2,000. 'We hadn't confirmed the zone of 2,000 dollars sincerely. It was a critical point', Buccolo said. The index dropped to USD 1,974, marking another negative day for Argentine stocks. Buccolo expressed concerns about the new 2030 bond, which includes a put option exercisable in 2027. 'We don't have it clear because it's not trading yet. We received many questions but it's not operational in the local market or abroad', he explained. He also warned that the bond may not have secondary market trading in pesos or dollars, limiting its liquidity and access for retail investors. Buccolo linked the poor market performance to the financial results of companies. 'Banco Galicia, Macro, and Supervielle showed weak balances, that's why the market responded negatively', he commented. He noted that there was an initial speculative rebound, but then the declines deepened, especially in bank stocks, with high volumes increasing uncertainty. In the international context, Buccolo highlighted the rise of gold, which is approaching historical highs. 'Gold is rising because many investors consider it a refuge from so much instability', he said. He also warned that the rise in the official exchange rate complicates those who subscribed to dollar-denominated instruments. 'If this continues, there's no number that will suffice', he warned. Finally, Buccolo linked the volatility of Bitcoin to the uncertainty in US politics and potential tax changes, noting that 'the policies of the new US government are not being well received by the market'.

**Wealthy Individuals Flock to Singapore for Gold Storage Amid Global Risks**
The world's richest people are increasingly storing their gold in Singapore due to growing global risks and volatility caused by Trump's policy. According to CNBC, the number of gold storage requests in Singapore has increased by 88% since the beginning of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The sales of gold bars have increased by 200% in the past year. Gregor Gregersen, the founder of the storage facility, said, 'Many high-income clients are monitoring tariffs, changes in the world, and potential geopolitical instability. The idea of placing physical metal in a safe jurisdiction, such as Singapore, with trusted parties is now a major trend.' 90% of new orders come from outside Singapore. Singapore is known for its reputation as a safe jurisdiction with relative political and economic stability. The price of gold has risen sharply in recent months, and prices have reached record highs. This is partly due to its appeal as a safe investment in the face of volatility caused by trade tensions between the US and China. Some market experts believe that gold prices may reach $5,000 per ounce in 2026. The current spot price of gold is around $3,300 per ounce. Wealthy people are increasingly choosing gold bars over paper assets because they want to avoid counterparty and geopolitical risks, said Gregersen. While storing and owning gold is not completely free from price influence, it limits exposure to certain risks. 'Some owners of physical precious metals are afraid to store gold in the banking system, even in a distributed form, so they prefer to store gold in organizations that are not banks,' said John Reade, the chief market strategist of the World Gold Council, noting that this is particularly relevant for those concerned about the state of the global financial system.

**'Orange is the new gold': Bitcoin Predictions Soar to New Heights**
The Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas has become the epicenter of an unprecedented wave of optimism in the crypto world. Major figures in the sector have made vertiginous predictions for the cryptocurrency, with scenarios of $200,000 and even $1 million becoming increasingly consensual. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, said, 'The bitcoin is no longer an alternative, it's the new standard. Orange is the new gold.' He believes that the bitcoin, associated with the color orange in its logo, will surpass gold as a global reserve value, as younger generations prefer digital assets to precious metals. Robert Kiyosaki, author of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad,' also predicts a bitcoin price of $1 million by 2035, citing the potential 'implosion of the dollar' due to the US's massive public debt. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), former CEO of Binance, believes that the bitcoin could reach between $500,000 and $1 million in the current or next cycle, driven by the combined effects of spot ETFs, institutional demand, and inflationary monetary policies. Matt Hougan, director of investments at Bitwise, predicts a bitcoin price of $200,000 by the end of 2025, citing the inevitable rise of the cryptocurrency due to its fixed supply and massive buying pressure generated by recently approved bitcoin ETFs in the US.

**Bitcoin to Reach $1 Million by 2030: Prominent Analysts Predict Strong Price Increase**
Several prominent financial commentators and investment analysts are predicting a long-term price increase for Bitcoin that could take the asset's price above $1 million before the end of the decade, driven by growing inflation and expanding global debt. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, predicts that Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030 in her company's 'Bull Case' scenario, requiring a 58% annual compound growth rate over the next five years, primarily driven by increasing institutional adoption. Robert Kiyosaki, a popular financial educator and author of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', predicts a more modest price of $1 million for Bitcoin by 2035. Kiyosaki believes that until 2035, a Bitcoin will be worth more than $1 million, gold will be at $30,000, and silver will be at $3,000 per coin, citing record-high federal and credit card debt in the United States in 2025 as the main factor for the search for protection assets like precious metals and Bitcoin. Other analysts, including Raoul Pal, point to the devaluation of fiat currencies as a key reason for Bitcoin's appeal as a protection asset. Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, also predicts that Bitcoin will reach $1 million, highlighting its potential to 'transform the global economy in incredible ways'. Markus Thielen, CEO and head of research at 10x Research, notes that Bitcoin's price historically moves in increments of $16,000, indicating that the next significant resistance for Bitcoin is near $122,000. André Dragosch, European research head at Bitwise, predicts that Bitcoin could extend its rally to a top above $200,000 by the end of 2025, citing a model proposed by Canadian Bitcoin investor Greg Foss that evaluates Bitcoin based on a basket of G20 sovereign bonds.

**The surging gold price is boosting Central Asia's economies**
The surge in gold prices has boosted Central Asia's economies, with the region's largest gold producers, including Uzbekistan's Muruntau mine, benefiting significantly. The price of gold has more than doubled since 2019, reaching $3,000 per troy ounce in March. This has made life easier for the region's central bankers, with the Kazakh government selling some of its gold reserves to prop up the currency. The region's leaders are eager to mine more gold, with Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev aiming for 50% more production by 2030. Foreign investors, including China, are also investing in Central Asian gold-mining, with the region's largest gold producer, the Uzbek Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Company (NMMC), reportedly planning an initial public offering. 'Uzbekistan 2030' strategy aims to reduce the government's role in the economy and entice foreign capital, with the state-owned NMMC planning to list in London with a rumoured valuation of more than £4bn, or $5.2bn.

**Japan to Extend Exclusive Production Rights for Brand Varieties and Enhance Competitiveness**
The Japanese government has revised its export expansion strategy for agricultural and food products. The new plan aims to extend the period during which developers of Japanese brand varieties can have exclusive production rights, and to make the unauthorized storage of seeds for export a criminal offense. This is intended to prevent the leakage of domestic brand varieties abroad and to enhance the competitiveness of Japanese agricultural products in the global market. The government plans to revise the Plant Variety Protection Act in 2026 to extend the period of exclusive rights for breeders from 25 years (30 years for fruit trees) to around 50 years. Unauthorized storage of seeds for export will also become a criminal offense. In the past, only unauthorized sales and exports were subject to punishment. The leakage of Japanese brand varieties has been a concern, with the case of the high-quality Japanese grape 'Shine Muscat' being cited as an example. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries estimates that the loss due to leakage is at least ¥100 billion per year. The new strategy also adds nashi (Japanese pear) and kaki (Japanese oyster) and its processed products as key export items, with targets of ¥100 billion for nashi in 2030 and ¥54 billion for kaki and its processed products in 2030, which is about five times the current level.

**3 Different Ways to Add Gold to Your Portfolio**
Gold prices have surged in 2025, reaching $3,500 per troy ounce before falling back. Central banks are driving the demand for gold as a hedge against inflation and a devalued US dollar. However, many investors may be hesitant to buy physical gold due to logistics and storage issues. Fortunately, there are three ways to capture some upside in gold without owning physical gold: investing in gold mining stocks, such as Newmont Corporation (NEM), which has seen significant earnings growth and a 46.7% year-to-date increase in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX); using a gold ETF, such as the iShares Gold Trust (IAU), which owns gold and allows investors to access their 'gold' easily; and investing in a gold-hedged bond ETF, such as the Strategy Shares Gold-Hedged Bond ETF (GOLY), which tracks an index of investment-grade corporate bonds and uses near-term gold futures to hedge inflation risk. Fund manager David Miller explains, 'The idea behind this is we think we could make gold better by adding a yield, or we think we can make bonds better by making them inflation protected.'

**Canada's Resource Sector Could Drive GDP Growth**
Accelerating resource projects in Canada could lead to a GDP growth of 1.1 trillion Canadian dollars by 2035, with a possible increase of 4.5% in GDP over the next ten years. This is according to the 'Build Big Things' report, which suggests that the country can improve its weak productivity and strengthen the critical minerals and energy sectors. The report also highlights the importance of indigenous community involvement and improved access to capital. Simplified approval procedures and accelerated project approvals would be beneficial for mining companies, as there is potential for growth, particularly in mining. Canada is one of the leading countries in gold, cobalt, nickel, platinum group metals, uranium, and aluminum. The country also has the largest potassium salt deposits on Earth. According to the report, Canada has the potential to provide essential resources such as copper and zinc for modern technologies. 'By accelerating investment decisions, we can improve our productivity and strengthen our critical minerals and energy sectors,' said a spokesperson for the report. 'This would have a positive impact on our economy and create new opportunities for Canadians.'

**Gold Price To Hit $8,900 By 2030? 'In Gold We Trust Report 2025' Predicts Bullish Future**
The 'Gold We Trust Report 2025' by Incrementum predicts a bullish future for gold, with price targets of USD 4,000-5,000 in the medium term and potential highs of USD 8,900 by 2030. The report states that the forecast corridor of USD 4,800 to USD 8,900 depends mainly on inflationary trends over the next five years. The report also notes that the ongoing bull market for gold is not a short-term phenomenon, but rather the beginning of a secular trend. However, it also cautions investors to expect corrections due to the volatile nature of gold. The report highlights that gold is currently underallocated in global markets, with family offices allocating just one per cent of their portfolios to gold and precious metals. This is in contrast to more favored categories such as private equity, real estate, and cash. Additionally, JP Morgan predicts that gold prices will soar to USD 6,000 per ounce by 2029, a significant 80 per cent jump.

**Moody's Just Downgraded America. Here's Why Gold Could Go Parabolic**
Moody's has downgraded the US federal debt, citing unsustainable debt levels, ballooning interest costs, and political uncertainties in Washington. According to Moody's projections, the US federal debt burden will swell to 134% of GDP by 2035, with interest payments on debt consuming 30% of government revenues and deficits widening to 9% of GDP. GSC Commodity Intelligence notes that the US is now $36 trillion in debt and in an 'accelerating debt spiral with no way out.' This downgrade may have serious implications for risk assets, but could deliver a massive tailwind to safe-haven Gold, which rallied in previous instances of US creditworthiness scrutiny.

**Paying Your Groceries With Gold? Some States Seek to Shake Up Reliance on Dollar**
Several US states are considering or have already passed legislation to allow the use of gold and silver as a form of currency. The bills, known as 'transactional gold bills,' would create state-backed systems to facilitate commerce in precious metals. The goal is to give citizens and businesses the option to pay or be paid in gold or Federal Reserve Notes. Proponents argue that this would help protect against inflation and provide a hedge against the decline of the US dollar. The movement is gaining momentum, with over 60 gold-related bills introduced in state legislatures last year and more expected in 2025. Some states, such as Arkansas and Utah, have already passed transactional gold bills, while others, like Florida and Oklahoma, are working on similar legislation. The movement has also gained support from private sector companies, such as Glint and United Precious Metals Association, which offer gold-backed payment systems. Experts argue that the use of gold and silver as currency would provide a more stable and secure form of money, and would help to protect against the risks associated with the current fiat currency system.

**Uzbekistan's President Signs Decree on Privatization Program for 2025**
Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has signed a decree on the privatization program for 2025. The program aims to reduce the state's share in the economy and accelerate the transfer of assets to private business. According to the decree, by 2030, the share of the non-state sector in the economy should reach 85%, and the number of state-owned enterprises should decrease sixfold. The decree also provides for the transformation of large state-owned enterprises and banks, the exclusion of non-core assets, and the acceleration of privatization. In 2025, it is planned to privatize state assets and land plots worth 30 trillion sum, with at least 10 trillion sum to be allocated to the budget. The shares of 115 enterprises, 659 real estate objects, and 6100 hectares of land will be put up for auction. The decree also provides for the sale of rights to use at least 30 land plots and mineral deposits (mainly gold, as well as silver, iron ore, lead, copper, and others). The creation of new state-owned enterprises is banned until January 1, 2030, with the exception of defense and security-related enterprises and cases specified in the President's decisions. Republican bodies and hokimiyats are prohibited from initiating the purchase of real estate or creating enterprises that do not correspond to state functions. The owners and members of the boards of state-owned enterprises are personally responsible for fulfilling these requirements. The decree also provides for the sale of state-owned assets to manufacturers of high-tech products, the sale of unclaimed assets to other legal entities, and the sale of assets of the liquidated AO 'Uzpahctasanoat' with a 10-50% discount. The decree also abolishes the mandatory participation of hokimiyats in the capital of markets and trade complexes. The sale of land plots will be accelerated by allowing the privatization of leased land after the approval of development plans and full payment of the cost. The decree also provides for the sale of land plots on online auctions, with priority given to plots proposed by entrepreneurs who wish to expand their activities and have ready projects. Small adjacent plots will be combined and resold without additional approvals. The decree also provides for the simplified rental of state-owned property, with a discount for advance payment, and the sale of unclaimed objects at a 50% discount. The list of 29 large enterprises where state shares will be sold on international and domestic markets has been approved, including UzAuto Motors, Mobiuz, Uzbekistan GTL, thermal power plants and TECs, 'Technopark', Uzbekistan Metallurgical Combine, and others. The decree also approves the schedule for the public and secondary placement of shares (IPO and SPO) of 12 large state-owned companies, including Navoiy and Almalyk GOK, Uzbekistan Airways, Uzbektelecom, and the National Investment Fund. If initially planned to put up 2-5% of shares, now 10-25%. The mechanism of privatization of four large state-owned enterprises - SamAuto, Thermal Power Plants, Uzbekmetcombinat, and Sherabad Cement Plant - has been determined.

**Delhi-ghtful! India mulls 2035 ICE ban, blocks fuel sales to older vehicles**
India is considering a plan to phase out gas and diesel combustion vehicles by 2035 to combat air pollution in Delhi. The city has already implemented a ban on refueling vehicles over 15 years old and plans to deploy over 900 electric transit buses. Discussions are underway to pass laws requiring electric or 'clean fuel' bus purchases by the end of this year, with potential bans on three-wheelers, light goods vehicles, and privately owned cars and bikes in the coming years. This move follows China's successful implementation of strict emissions standards and EV adoption incentives, which led to a significant reduction in air pollution-related deaths. Delhi Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said, 'We are installing gadgets at petrol pumps which will identify vehicles older than 15 years, and no fuel will be provided to them.' The Indian government's aggressive timeline for a gas and diesel ban may leave the US behind in the global EV space.

**Radical Changes in the Gold Market: Islam Memis Warns of a New Era**
Financial analyst Islam Memis has warned of radical changes in the gold market until 2030. He predicts that retail jewelry stores will largely close and the gold market will be managed through institutional companies and chain stores. Memis advises investors to 'say goodbye to your certificates', as the regulations will fundamentally change the way people buy and sell gold. The Turkish government has implemented comprehensive regulations in the gold market, including a ban on the sale of gold bars and coins in 2025, and a 0.02% customs duty on gold purchases. These changes will lead to a new era in the gold market and may cause significant disruption to small businesses and lead to increased unemployment. Memis predicts that 80% of retail jewelry stores will close by 2030, but large jewelry store chains and luxury stores will be replaced by small gold shops. The ban on gold imports and quota system has led to the closure of many workshops and the export of gold to foreign countries, resulting in a significant increase in smuggling and a rise in gold prices, making it difficult for consumers. In the future, gold purchases and sales will be more expensive and investors may turn to alternative investments.

**50 Years of Gold Ownership in the USA: A Milestone in Market Manipulation**
In 1974, the US government lifted the ban on private gold ownership, allowing Americans to hold and trade gold again. This decision was made by President Ford, who repealed a 1930s law that restricted gold ownership to $100 or less. The ban had imposed fines of up to $10,000 and 10 years in prison for those who possessed more than the allowed amount. The lifting of the ban led to a surge in gold demand, with prices reaching a record high of over $195 in December 1974. The US government and the International Monetary Fund sold gold to try to limit the price increase. Today, gold is seen as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation, and companies like Skeena Gold & Silver and Calibre Mining offer attractive investment opportunities. Skeena is working to reopen the Snip and Eskay Creek mines in British Columbia, while Calibre is focused on gold production in North, Central, and South America. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students,' said no one in this article, but rather it highlights the importance of gold as a store of value and a safe-haven asset.
