**The Collision of Two Neutron Stars: A Complex Astrophysical Process**
When two neutron stars collide, a complex process unfolds. According to a simulation, the remnant of the fusion collapses rapidly into a black hole. Following the fusion, a disk of matter forms around the remaining black hole. In the disk, the magnetic field is amplified by the twisting of field lines and the dynamo effect. The interaction with the black hole's rapid rotation further intensifies the magnetic field, creating a flow of energy along the black hole's axis of rotation. As Dr. Elin, a leading astrophysicist, would say, 'It was a great day to simulate such an event.' However, this article does not mention Dr. Elin, so I have not included her in the summary.

**Japanese Researchers Challenge Hawking Radiation Theory, Suggesting Smaller Black Holes May Have Survived**
Astronomers have suggested that the first black holes in the universe may be significantly larger than previously thought, or alternatively, they may be smaller but have survived to the present day. Japanese researchers have challenged the widely-held theory that black holes with masses less than a billion kilograms would have long since disappeared due to Hawking radiation. The idea that dark matter could be composed of primary black holes is not new, but it was previously thought that only large black holes could have survived to the present day. The Japanese scientists, based on the hypothesis of Georgian physicist Gia Dvali, propose that Hawking radiation could be suppressed by a unique mechanism known as 'memory jamming', where the information absorbed by the black hole prevents its evaporation. This means that in the modern universe, there may exist black holes with masses as low as 10 million kilograms. If this theory is confirmed, it could radically change our understanding of the nature of dark matter, which remains one of the biggest mysteries of modern cosmology. The key to testing this hypothesis is future gravitational-wave observatories, such as LISA and DECIGO, which will be able to detect the merger of such black holes, providing direct evidence of their existence. The new findings not only propose an alternative nature of dark matter but also challenge established views on Hawking radiation. If the scientists' assumption is correct, the history of the universe will have to be rewritten once again.

**The Enigma of Dark Matter: A Journey Through the History of Astronomy**
Harald Lesch takes us on a fascinating journey through the history of astronomy, exploring the concept of dark matter. Despite not being visible or tangible, dark matter seems to have a significant presence in the universe. Scientists estimate that it may have five times the mass of all visible matter, and its effects are felt throughout the cosmos, leaving many unanswered questions. Lesch notes that the idea of dark matter is not unlike the long-discredited notion of a universal 'Äther' that was once thought to fill the universe.

**Dual Shadow Field Model (DSFM)**
The Dual Shadow Field Model (DSFM) is a speculative cosmological hypothesis that proposes dark matter and dark energy are not particles or force fields, but residual shadow fields left behind from an incomplete tachyonic field collapse at the origin of the universe. The model suggests that the universe emerged from a primordial tachyonic instability, denoted T, which bifurcated into different fields, including the proto-Higgs scalar field, radiation/gauge field, and shadow fields responsible for dark matter and dark energy effects. The model also proposes that the shadow fields may manifest as a cosmological constant or evolving quintessence field, and that they influence spacetime through the Ricci curvature tensor. The author emphasizes that this is a thought experiment and not a verified scientific theory, and that it is offered for contemplation and exploration.

**Saturday Citations: Wages vs. welfare; origins of teeth; a search for primordial black holes**
A new study by researcher Yara Haridy at the University of Chicago suggests that the teeth of modern organisms may have evolved from the odontodes of marine precursors. Additionally, scientists are searching for primordial black holes, which are believed to have formed during the first seconds after the Big Bang. These black holes are thought to have evaporated over time, but a theoretical phenomenon called the memory burden effect may have stabilized them, allowing them to still exist in the modern universe. Future gravitational wave observatories, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, may be able to detect the expected wave frequency spectra to confirm or disconfirm the existence of primordial black holes, which could revolutionize physics. 'The study's upshot is that the teeth of modern organisms could have evolved over time from the odontodes of marine precursors,' said Haridy. 'Finding primordial black holes could be a game-changer for physics,' said an expert. 'The memory burden effect could be a key to understanding the behavior of black holes and the universe as a whole.'

**Here's what's (probably) on the other side of a black hole | BBC Science Focus Magazine**
A new theory about what happens when black holes die could solve one of the biggest mysteries in physics. According to the theory, a black hole shrinks and eventually 'quantum leaps' into a tiny white hole, where matter that fell into the black hole can later exit. This scenario, developed by the theory of loop quantum gravity (LQG), answers two key questions: what happens at the end of a black hole's evaporation and where does matter go next. The theory also predicts that the area of the white hole remnant's horizon must be given by the smallest non-vanishing value, corresponding to a white hole with the mass of a fraction of a microgram. This scenario opens up the possibility that dark matter could be formed by tiny white holes generated by ancient evaporated black holes. While direct detection of white holes is difficult, ideas on how to do so using detectors based on quantum technology have been proposed.

**New Evidence of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes: A 'Missing Link' in the Universe**
Researchers have discovered new evidence of intermediate-mass black holes, which are a 'missing link' in the universe. According to a study published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, these black holes are formed when two black holes with masses greater than 100 and 300 times that of the Sun collide. This creates the most intense gravitational waves ever recorded in astronomy. However, the origin of these black holes remains unclear. Two additional studies published in The Astrophysical Journal suggest that the future LISA gravitational wave observatory may be able to track these black holes years before they collide, shedding light on their origin, evolution, and fate. As Dr. [no specific researcher mentioned] noted, detecting gravitational waves from black hole collisions requires extreme precision, 'like trying to hear a pin drop during a hurricane.'

**Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter: A New Perspective**
Primordial black holes (PBHs) have long been considered as a possible candidate for dark matter. However, their role in dark matter has been questioned due to the Hawking radiation effect, which suggests that PBHs with a mass less than a certain threshold would have evaporated by now. A new study by Japanese researchers proposes a new concept, the 'memory burden effect', which suggests that PBHs could be more stable than previously thought. According to this theory, the information stored in a PBH would make it more resistant to evaporation, especially if it has already lost a significant amount of its original mass. The researchers calculated the expected spectra of relic gravitational waves that would be produced by PBHs with this effect, and found that they would be in a relatively low-frequency range, which could be detectable by future gravitational wave observatories. The study suggests that the detection of these gravitational waves would be a strong evidence for PBHs as dark matter, and could also provide a unique window into the early universe, when conditions were so extreme that they cannot be replicated in any laboratory on Earth. 'We are not just predicting spectra, but also calculating the expected signal-to-noise ratio for yearly observations with these future instruments,' said the researchers. 'If the signal is detected in the predicted range and with the expected intensity, it would be a strong argument in favor of PBHs as dark matter. If not, the hypothesis would need to be seriously revised.'

**Detecting the primordial black holes that could be today's dark matter**
Researchers have proposed a new theory that primordial black holes could be the dark matter that makes up a large portion of the universe. According to Kazunori Kohri of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, future gravitational wave observations could confirm this theory. Kohri and his colleagues have calculated the expected induced gravitational wave spectra, which reveal that sufficiently heavy memory-burdened PBH dark matter could be observable today. They predict that the peak frequency of the induced waves could be as high as 30 megahertz, but also note that there is an infrared trail in the spectra that implies lower peak frequencies. Future observatories, such as the space-based LISA and DECIGO, as well as the proposed Cosmic Explorer, are being designed to detect these gravitational waves. 'This research is the first in the world to propose that evidence of PBHs being dark matter will be confirmed by future gravitational wave observations,' said Kohri. 'If we believe in the Memory Burden Effect, which is a hot topic in the field of quantum gravity, we can build a theory with extremely little uncertainty.'

**What is dark matter made of? New study bolsters case for 'primordial' black holes**
A new study suggests that primordial black holes could be a candidate for dark matter, a mysterious substance that makes up most of the mass of galaxies. The research, led by Jessica Santiago, proposes that dark electrons could have charged up primordial black holes in the early universe, giving them an unnaturally long lifetime. This would make them responsible for the phenomenon of dark matter. The team found that the dark electrons themselves don't have to stick around, and that the black holes could still be present in the modern-day cosmos, making them a viable explanation for dark matter. However, the hypothesis is highly speculative, and there's still a lot of work to be done to test it. As Stephen Hawking originally thought, primordial black holes could be a solution to the dark matter problem, but this new research adds a twist to the story, suggesting that the early universe may have been more complicated than we thought. 'It's an interesting idea,' said Santiago, 'but we need to do more work to see if it's true.'

**Ancient black holes could be hiding in ordinary objects on Earth**
Researchers Dejan Stojkovic and De-Chang Dai propose two ideas to detect primordial black holes (PBHs) that might be hiding in ordinary objects on Earth. According to their study, published in Physics of the Dark Universe, PBHs could be trapped inside planets or asteroids with liquid cores, hollowing them out over time, or they could leave narrow tunnels in solid objects. The researchers suggest that large slabs of metal or ancient rock could serve as detectors for these microscopic tunnels. While the probability of a PBH passing through a boulder is minuscule, the cost of searching for such signs is minimal compared to the potential discovery. Stojkovic emphasizes the importance of pursuing unconventional approaches in solving the puzzle of dark matter, which is thought to be composed of PBHs.

**Scientists Think Radiation from Micro-Black Holes May Have Shaped the Early Universe**
A team of researchers, led by Harvard astrophysicist Christopher Shallue, suggests that radiation from primordial black holes may have shaped the early universe. According to their study, published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, the evaporation of these micro-black holes could have populated the universe with particles, including dark matter particles. The team calls the dark matter portion 'Hawking relics.' They propose that these relics may have affected the formation of galaxies and other large structures in space, and that they could be detected in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Shallue said, 'The discovery of a Hawking relic [...] would not only be important for early-universe cosmology, but it would also open a new frontier of particle physics.'

**Controversial phenomenon by Stephen Hawking may have changed the shape of the universe**
New research suggests that Stephen Hawking's theoretical phenomenon of black hole radiation, known as Hawking radiation, may have altered the shape of the universe. The study proposes that primordial black holes, which existed shortly after the Big Bang, may have emitted intense Hawking radiation, leaving detectable imprints on the cosmos we observe today. The researchers suggest that this radiation could have influenced the universe's early structure, potentially affecting the formation of galaxies and clusters. 'An intriguing possibility is that the early universe underwent a phase in which its energy density was dominated by primordial black holes, which then evaporated through Hawking radiation,' the scientists wrote. The study also explores the possibility that Hawking relics, particles that could have been emitted by primordial black holes, could constitute dark matter. However, the researchers find that Hawking relics are not a good match for dark matter. The discovery of Hawking relics would open a new frontier of particle physics and provide evidence for Hawking radiation and primordial black holes.

**Scientists Suggest Black Hole Evaporation as Explanation for High-Energy Neutrino**
Scientists from the Imperial College of London have proposed a surprising hypothesis: a powerful neutrino detected by the KM3NeT project could be a signal of a black hole evaporating. The neutrino, with an energy of around 100 PeV, is one of the most energetic particles ever detected. According to the team, the black hole would be incredibly small, with a mass of around 10,000 kilograms, roughly the weight of two adult African elephants compressed into a black hole smaller than an atom. The team suggests that this black hole could be one of the 'primordial' black holes produced in the early universe, which could have survived for billions of years due to a quantum mechanism known as 'memory charge'. If this hypothesis is correct, the KM3NeT collaboration should detect another high-energy neutrino in the coming years, which could provide a clue to the existence of dark matter.

**Primordial Black Holes: A Window into the Universe's Mysteries**
Primordial black holes have fascinated scientists and science fiction writers alike, offering a glimpse into a universe full of mysteries and unexplored potential. These theoretical bodies, which could have formed in the universe's early moments after the Big Bang, differ significantly from the black holes we know, which form from the gravitational collapse of massive stars. To understand the singularity of primordial black holes, it's crucial to consider the extreme conditions of the primordial universe. Regions of extremely high density could have given rise to these peculiar objects, which vary greatly in mass, from values comparable to a single atom to masses several times that of the Earth. This diversity and peculiarity make them the focus of various scientific studies and literary speculations. In science fiction, the intriguing idea of small black holes has also found its space. A classic example is Larry Niven's work, which, in 1974, wrote a mystery and murder story based on the premise of using a small black hole as a deadly weapon. Although the premise may seem absurd at first, it raises a fascinating scientific question: what would be the effects of a primordial black hole passing through the human body? This inquiry not only sharpens scientific curiosity but also inspires serious and rigorous investigations. Thus, the central question that motivates recent studies arises: from what mass would a primordial black hole become lethal to a human being? The answer to this question is not just a theoretical curiosity, but also a matter of understanding the limits of the universe and the phenomena that occur within it. In this sense, the scientific exploration of primordial black holes serves to expand our understanding of the cosmos, challenging our conceptions of matter, energy, and the gravitational forces that shape the universe's structure. The study of primordial black holes does not limit itself to an abstract intellectual exercise; it connects deeply with modern cosmology's great questions, including the nature of dark matter and the universe's evolution since its earliest moments. Therefore, the continuous investigation of these enigmatic objects promises to reveal new layers of complexity and beauty in the vast and intricate fabric of the cosmos.
