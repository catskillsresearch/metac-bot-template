**2.8 Billion People Worldwide Lack Access to Suitable Housing, UN Report Finds**
According to the United Nations' Habitat Programme annual report for 2024, approximately 2.8 billion people worldwide lack access to suitable housing. Of these, 1.1 billion people live in poor or informal settlements, which is 'the main challenge for sustainable urban development', as stated in the report. Around 90% of the population of these poor settlements live in Africa and Asia, where there is a shortage of housing units of around 170 million. Anna Claudia Robisch, Executive Director of the United Nations' Habitat Programme, said in the report that 'climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters continue to force millions of people to leave their homes in search of safety, stability, and better living conditions.' The report estimates that 318 million people are homeless, equivalent to the population of the United States. Globally, 'one in four people lives in conditions that harm their health, safety, and well-being', according to the United Nations' Habitat Programme report. Only 14% of urban residents and 40% of rural residents have access to clean water, and two in five people do not have access to sanitation services. The report states that 'safe and managed sanitation is a fundamental element of human development and is often used as a measure of progress in reducing poverty, diseases, and premature deaths.' Anna Claudia Robisch called for 'rethinking urban policies, land use, laws, and financing to prioritize housing and basic services as key drivers of climate action and sustainable development.' By 2040, it is expected that 2 billion urban residents will be exposed to significant temperature increases. The United Nations' Habitat Programme member states adopted the programme's strategic plan for 2026-2029, which focuses on access to housing, land, and basic services, such as clean water and sanitation.

**UK to Increase Military Personnel to 76,000 by 2034**
The UK plans to increase the number of its military personnel from approximately 72,500 to 76,000 by the next parliament, according to UK Defense Minister John Healey. 'We intend to increase the British army to at least 76,000 regular soldiers by the next parliament. For the first time in a generation, it is our government that wants to increase the size of the regular army,' he said. The current government, led by the Labour Party, aims to achieve this goal by 2034. The current number of British military personnel is around 72,500, the lowest since the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century. According to The Times, the number of military personnel may drop below 70,000 in 2025 due to low recruitment rates and high rates of personnel leaving the service due to dissatisfaction with working conditions.

**Balochistan Engages Religious Scholars To Promote ‘Family Planning’ Efforts - Daily Parliament Times**
The Balochistan government has launched a new initiative to promote family planning efforts by engaging 150 religious scholars across 31 districts. These scholars, designated as Family Planning Assistants, receive honorariums and Islamic literature emphasizing the Islamic legitimacy of responsible family planning, reproductive health, parental responsibility, and child welfare. Maulana Mula Dad, one of the scholars, says, 'We deliver our message through the lens of Islamic values – that every individual is entitled to a healthy life, proper education, and financial stability.' The initiative aims to promote healthier families and create a sustainable balance between population growth and available resources. The province's population has grown from 1.2 million in the early 1950s to 14.8 million in 2023, with an annual growth rate of 3.2%. If this trajectory persists, the population could double by 2045, placing unsustainable pressure on employment, housing, education, and healthcare services. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns that if growth remains above 2%, the province will require 6.5 million new employment opportunities, one million homes, and over 7,000 educational institutions by 2040.

**Álava's Aging Population: A Need for More Care Services**
The 'baby boom' generation in Álava is aging, and many are starting to rely on social services. According to the Fundación Eguía-Careaga report, the number of people over 65 will increase by 17.2% by 2030, and those over 80 will increase by 26.8%. The report suggests that the current number of care home places is 'sufficient', but there is a need to strengthen other types of services, such as home care. The report also calculates that there will be a need for 160 more places in day centers. Additionally, the report notes that there will be a need for 1,300 family members to care for their relatives who are unable to perform daily activities without support. The study does not attempt to predict the future of disability in 2030, but notes that the number of people with recognized disabilities in Álava has increased by 80% since the COVID-19 pandemic. As Gorka Urtaran, the deputy for Social Policies, has previously stated, there will be a need for 1,000 more professionals to care for dependent people in their homes by 2030. 'We need to adapt the system to these changes,' said Urtaran. 'The people want to stay at home and live their last years there, or until they have no other choice but to go to a residence.'

**England's yellow and parched land: How soaring immigration and a 30-year failure to build reservoirs could trigger drinking water crisis | Daily Mail Online**
England is facing a drinking water crisis due to rapid population growth, crumbling assets, Nimby opposition, and a warming climate. The UK population is projected to reach 72.5 million by mid-2032, with immigration driving the growth. Water companies have committed to building new reservoirs, but they won't be ready until 2050. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said, 'Water doesn’t lie. It’s a basic test of whether a country can support the people in it, and Britain is failing that test because Labour refuses to confront reality.' He called for tackling immigration head-on, saying, 'We cannot keep adding the pressure and pretending the system will hold.' Environment Minister Emma Hardy said, 'We've been in an infrastructure crisis because we haven't built the reservoirs that we need. If we don't take action, we are going to be running out of the drinking water that we need by the mid-2030s.' The government's target of building 300,000 homes per year would only cover net migration at 170,000 per year, while Labour's housebuilding target could result in five out of seven new homes going to migrants.

**Australia 2035: migration, density and climate risk will reshape the future**
According to REA Group's General Manager of Content and Growth, Tobias Johnstone, Australia's property market will be reshaped by six data-driven trends by 2035. These trends include a shift in migration patterns, with India emerging as Australia's dominant source of new residents, and a fundamental change from suburban sprawl to urban densification. The population is expected to grow to 31 million by 2035, with two-thirds of this growth coming from international migration. Tobias warned that climate risk and insurance will become increasingly important, with one in ten properties currently uninsured. Agents will need to strategically reposition themselves to capitalise on high-volume apartment developments, while also considering the geographic spread of their clients. Tobias said, 'Australia will be more diverse than ever before, will be older than ever before, and, of course, will be bigger than ever before.' He also stated, 'We need to level up as an industry on this because consumers are increasingly going to be asking about risk, and they’re going to be asking about insurance.'

**China Aims for Over 100,000 Luxury Flying Cars by 2030**
China aims to have over 100,000 luxury flying cars by 2030, according to a government plan. The country has been pushing initiatives around the 'low-altitude economy', a global economic model led by different types of flying vehicles, primarily below 1,000 meters above sea level. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) predicts that the country will reach 1.5 trillion RMB in 2025 and 3.5 trillion in 2035. AutoFlight, a pioneer in eVTOL technology, has presented the first flight of an electric intercity taxi, 'Prosperty', which flew between Shenzhen and Zhuhai in 20 minutes, a distance that would take three hours by car. The company aims to achieve 300,000 annual flights of unmanned cargo eVTOLs. The 'Prosperty' taxi has a fully electric propulsion system, a maximum takeoff weight of 2,220 kg, and a five-seat cabin. China is at the forefront of this technology, with drones and eVTOLs growing at an annual rate of 32%. However, legislation regulating the traffic of these aircraft is still needed for the transportation of people.

**Groot-Menen Involves Citizens in Multi-Year Plan Creation**
The city of Groot-Menen is launching a large-scale participation project to involve citizens in the creation of the 2026-2031 multi-year plan. 10,000 residents will receive a letter inviting them to contribute, and in addition, there will be three participatory tables where everyone can have their say. The goal is to create a broad-based multi-year plan by the end of the year. 'In place of complaining on social media, I'd rather contribute my part,' said Tony, a 58-year-old resident of Lauwe. 'We want to make the city better with the input of its citizens,' said Kasper Vandecasteele, alderman. 'We want to avoid turning the creation of our multi-year plan into a political conclave.' The city hopes to receive a response from at least 1% of the 10,000 residents, and the input will be used to create a report that will guide the creation of the multi-year plan. 'We want to clearly explain why certain ideas were or were not included,' said Vandecasteele. 'We also want to keep the participants involved afterwards.'

**Ultra Rich Flock to Experimental City for Life-Extending Treatments**
On the island of Roatan in the Caribbean, the city of Prospera has become a haven for the ultra-rich, where experimental gene therapies banned in the US are being performed. The city has low taxes and Bitcoin as its official currency. One of the treatments offered is a gene therapy that claims to extend human lifespan. Bryan Johnson, a well-known biohacker, has undergone this treatment and is reportedly satisfied with the results. Other services include stem cell therapies and cosmetic surgeries, which are said to reverse aging. However, the local residents are concerned, stating that luxury tourism has not benefited them economically and has created an exclusionary environment. The city's population is expected to reach 38,000 by 2030, but the experimental city has also raised ethical and legal concerns.

**Future Traffic Congestion in Weesp: A Significant Increase in Cyclists Expected**
The traffic congestion in Weesp is expected to increase significantly in the coming years due to the expansion of Weespersluis and other construction projects, which will bring thousands of new residents and lead to more cyclists, pedestrians, and car traffic. According to the study 'Fietsstromen Weesp 2035', the number of cyclists on some roads will double in the coming years. The Hogeweyselaan is a good example, with approximately 1,400 cyclists per day in 2023, and a projected 2,800 cyclists per day in 2035. The Korte Muiderweg and the Leeuwenveldseweg will also handle significantly more cyclists. The busiest cycling route is expected to be the Stationsweg, with between 2,500 and 3,700 cyclists per day in 2035. Notably, current measurements already show that the number of cyclists on this route is higher than earlier models predicted, indicating that the existing infrastructure is already under pressure.

**Renta Joven 2025: the bad news given to beneficiaries by the Government**
Despite the country's fiscal complications, Gustavo Bolívar, director of Prosperidad Social, confirmed that the necessary resources will be managed to ensure payments to active beneficiaries. However, through the Renta Joven account 'X', a particular detail was communicated. 'The entity will not cease its efforts to ensure the sustainability of social programs, and will continue to work firmly to ensure the accompaniment of the more than 300,000 young people linked to the program that contributes to their support and graduation,' the message begins. However, the message also made a clarification that complicated many young people who aspired to access this aid. 'Due to the 2025 budget allocation, it will not be possible to make new registrations to the program during the current period. However, the transfer to active beneficiaries from last year will be guaranteed.' The entity warns participants in Renta Joven not to be misled by false registrations and uncertain payment dates. Once the payment schedule is established, it will be published through the official channels of Prosperidad Social,' concludes. The decision not to open new slots is part of a significant reduction in the budget allocated to subsidies, which has gone from 10.7 billion to 5.3 billion pesos. This adjustment affects several social programs and reflects the need for the government to optimize resources and reduce dependence on subsidies.

Bolívar warned young people not to fall for scams related to false registrations and payment dates, which have not been defined yet. 'Once the payment schedule is established, it will be published through the official channels of Prosperidad Social', he said. The program has the support of the Sena, Ministry of Education, Colombian Institute of Family Well-being, Armed Forces, Superior Normal Schools, Municipalities, and other allied entities. 'It has been fundamental for the development of the program. Prosperidad Social hopes to continue with this articulation to benefit the participating young population', the entity stated in a statement.
