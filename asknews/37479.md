**El Salvador's Supreme Court Rejects Venezuela's Request to Defend Deported Migrants**
The Supreme Court of El Salvador rejected a request from the Attorney General of Venezuela, Tarek William Saab, to defend 252 Venezuelan migrants detained in the country after being deported from the US. The migrants were expelled by the Trump administration on March 15, accused of being part of the Tren de Aragua crime gang without presenting evidence. They are being held in the Cecot prison, a maximum-security facility built for gang members by President Nayib Bukele, a key ally of Trump's in his tough anti-immigrant policies. According to the Supreme Court's resolution, 'It is declared that the requested intervention is without merit, as the essential requirements established in national and conventional legislation have not been met.' The court gave three days for a law firm hired by the Venezuelan government to provide additional information to support a habeas corpus petition filed in late March. The court asked the lawyers to clarify 'what specific claim they wish to present before this court, indicating which facts they allege [...], the authority or authorities to which they attribute them, and why they consider that it violates the rights protected' through the habeas corpus. Additionally, they were asked to clarify 'why they claim that the people mentioned in their request for a writ of habeas corpus are indeed deprived of their liberty' in the Cecot prison.

**Stephen Miller: The Radical Mind Behind Trump's Immigration Agenda**
Stephen Miller, a key advisor to the US President, has been propelled to the highest echelons of power by Donald Trump. Miller's radical vision has led to a war on immigration and the dismantling of policies. He is known for his brutality, described by Terry Moran as a 'world-class hater'. Miller's ideas are a far cry from his liberal upbringing in California, where he was born in 1985 to a Jewish and progressive family. He developed conservative ideas that clashed with his environment, and by the time he was in high school, he was fascinated by conservative figures like Rush Limbaugh and David Horowitz. Miller's rejection of liberal consensus began early, when he understood 'the power of hate and provocation'. During Trump's first term (2017-2021), Miller became a central figure, drafting key presidential speeches and designing policies that included the ban on entry to citizens of designated countries, the elimination of protections for young immigrants, and the separation of families at the border. He also pushed for the construction of a wall with Mexico. Under Joe Biden, Miller founded America First Legal, a conservative organization that functioned as a government-in-exile. He participated in the contentious claims that questioned the 2020 elections and prepared Trump's return. The executive orders signed by Trump in January were intellectually signed by Miller. He now holds a key position in Washington: Deputy White House Chief of Staff and National Security Adviser. Kevin McCarthy describes him as 'Trump's brain', saying that 'Trump complains about everything, but never about him'. Miller's public appearances combine inflated data with bellicose rhetoric. For example, his administration handles figures of 21 million irregular immigrants, almost double official estimates. This strategy is also reflected in strong statements, such as his declaration in Coachella in October 2024: 'This country doesn't belong to politicians, it doesn't belong to illegal foreigners, it belongs to you, American citizens'. Miller has also dusted off 18th-century laws to deport without due process and proposes suspending habeas corpus during 'invasion periods'. Muzaffar Chishti, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute, notes the contradictions of this political strategy: 'The invasion argument goes against their own narrative that the borders are under control. At the same time, they say they want to suspend habeas corpus, unless the judges act correctly. If this isn't a mafia-style threat, I don't know what is'.

**The MAGA Movement's Ideology of War and Destruction**
The article discusses the potential consequences of the US decision to support Israel against Iran, which could lead to a war. The author argues that this could have a positive effect on the anti-Trump movement, as the far-right supporters of the 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) movement might start to fracture. The article quotes Steve Bannon, a key figure in the MAGA movement, who has been warning against the 'Deep State' and its attempts to undermine the Trump administration. However, Bannon has recently toned down his rhetoric, saying that the decision to go to war is up to the 'commander-in-chief'. The author suggests that this change in tone might be due to the perception that a war could be beneficial to the 'war on the internal front', allowing for further erosion of civil liberties. The article also discusses the ideology of the MAGA movement, which sees the US as being in a state of war against globalist elites, woke culture, and 'administrative state'. The author quotes Bannon, who predicts a grave crisis in the US institutions and the suspension of the habeas corpus. The article concludes that the extreme right in the US is driven by a millenarian fever, which sees the end of the world as a necessary step towards a new beginning. This ideology is characterized by a desire to accelerate the destruction of the existing order, which is seen as necessary for the rebirth of the US. The article argues that this ideology is not just a passive waiting for the end, but an active acceleration of the process of destruction, which is fueled by violence and the erosion of civil liberties.

**MIKEY SMITH: 7 chilling Donald Trump moments as President warns: 'You are in danger' - Mikey Smith - Mirror Online**
US President Donald Trump has continued to cast doubt on the 2020 election results, claiming he won the election 'by a LANDSLIDE!' despite losing to Joe Biden by 74 electoral college votes and 7 million actual votes. Trump demanded a Special Prosecutor be appointed to investigate the election, which he claims was a 'total FRAUD!' He also warned reporters that they are 'in danger' for talking to him. Additionally, Trump ranted about not receiving a Nobel Peace Prize, claiming he should have been given it 'four or five times.' He also made a mistake in referring to Senator Alex Padilla as 'Jose Padilla.' Furthermore, Trump's Press Secretary, Tammy Bruce, urged journalists not to 'second guess' the President's approach to Iran. Meanwhile, Elon Musk has proposed re-writing history using AI, suggesting that his chatbot Grok be used to 'rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge, adding missing information and deleting errors.' Finally, Trump complained about the number of federal holidays in the US, claiming it is costing the country 'BILLIONS OF DOLLARS' and that workers don't want them.

**What Now?! – June 21, 2025**
President Trump has announced that he will decide within the next two weeks whether to launch a military strike against Iran. However, this timeline is seen as a stalling tactic, as Trump has used it in the past to delay tough decisions without appearing indecisive. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts are ongoing, with a renewed push for talks between the US and Iran. Iran has been hit by Israeli strikes, and the country's military strategy has been criticized for its failure. Some hope that the humiliation of Iran's military will trigger an uprising or a coup d'état, while others believe that the regime will survive and redouble its efforts to develop a nuclear bomb. In other news, the White House is facing pressure from businesses and some Republicans to dial back enforcement on immigration, while President Trump is demanding a special prosecutor to investigate his 2020 election loss. Additionally, the US dollar has plunged in value, driven by the Trump administration's policies, including tariff hikes and tax cuts.

**The concept of ‘habeas corpus’ deserves a closer look | Whale’s Tales | Auburn Reporter**
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem recently misdefined habeas corpus as 'the right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country.' However, the actual definition of habeas corpus is a judicial order that requires the government to bring a detained individual before a court and justify the legality of their detention. It is a constitutional right that protects against unlawful imprisonment and ensures that no person can be held without the right to challenge their detention before a judge. The Constitution states that the writ 'shall not be suspended, unless when, in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion, the public safety may require it.' Noem's error is significant, given her oversight of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has been deporting undocumented immigrants and permanent residents. There are also concerns about the administration's proposal to 'supplement' ICE's capabilities with armed and deputized citizens, which could lead to the formation of non-state armed groups such as militias. Some in the administration are now talking about suspending habeas corpus, a move that would be a significant erosion of civil liberties.

**Donald Trump News Live: Trump administration secures pledge from health insurers to reform prior authorization requirements**
The Trump administration has announced several key decisions and actions, including ending the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule, which protects nearly 58.5 million acres of national forests from road construction and logging. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins characterized the rule as 'outdated and absurd.' The administration has also secured a pledge from health insurance companies to reform prior-authorization requirements, which aims to improve patient care. Additionally, the Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to restart the swift deportation of migrants to countries other than their homelands. President Trump has also announced a 'complete and total ceasefire' between Israel and Iran, which will be phased in over 24 hours. Furthermore, Representative Jared Golden has expressed support for President Trump's decision to authorize the January 2020 drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. The Trump administration has also faced criticism from lawmakers, including Representative Jim Himes, who disputed President Trump's claims that recent U.S. military strikes against three Iranian nuclear sites were successful.

**El Salvador's Supreme Court Rejects Venezuelan Prosecutor's Request to Intervene in Migrant Case**
The Supreme Court of El Salvador dismissed a request from the Venezuelan prosecutor, Tarek William Saab, to intervene in the defense of 252 Venezuelan migrants detained in El Salvador. The migrants were deported from the US on March 15 by the Trump administration, accused of being part of the Tren de Aragua group without evidence. The court stated, 'It is declared that the requested intervention is without merit, as it does not meet the essential requirements established in national and conventional legislation.' The court gave the Venezuelan lawyers three days to complete a habeas corpus appeal filed in late March. Saab called the decision 'a shameful response' and 'a dilatory and evasive maneuver' by the court, which he claims is trying to 'disentangle itself from its constitutional responsibility to protect the freedom and personal integrity' of the migrants. Saab stated that El Salvador has chosen to 'deny all cooperation' and reiterated his willingness to collaborate with the Salvadoran justice system by providing 116 interviews with the families of the detained migrants as part of the 'search for justice.' The Salvadoran resolution requires the lawyers to specify 'what concrete claim they wish to present to this court, indicating which facts they allege [...], the authority or authorities to which they attribute them, and why they consider that it violates the rights protected' through the habeas corpus. Additionally, they are asked to clarify 'why they claim that the people mentioned in their request for leave are actually deprived of their liberty' in the CECOT prison.

**Federal Judge Suspends Trump's Plans to Restrict Harvard University**
A federal judge has indefinitely suspended plans by US President Donald Trump to prevent Harvard University from enrolling international students. Trump announced a possible 'agreement' with the prestigious university, stating, 'Many people have been asking what's happening with Harvard and its big irregularities that we've been addressing, looking for a solution. We've been working closely with Harvard, and it's very possible that an agreement will be announced next week or so.' Harvard has filed two separate lawsuits seeking to unlock around $2.5 billion in funding and prevent the administration from blocking international students from attending the university. The university's opposition to Trump's desire to control hiring, program content, and research guidance has drawn negative reactions from Trump. International students make up 27% of Harvard's student body and are a significant source of revenue and influence for the elite university.

**Trump Administration Considers Suspending Habeas Corpus for Undocumented Immigrants**
The Trump administration is considering a new measure to speed up deportations of undocumented immigrants by potentially suspending the habeas corpus procedure. According to reports, President Donald Trump may try to suspend the habeas corpus process, which allows individuals who believe they have been detained or imprisoned illegally to request their release in court. However, this principle is not easy to eliminate, as the US Constitution outlines when and who can suspend it. According to CNN, Kristi Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security, stated that habeas corpus is a 'constitutional right that the president has to expel people from this country.' However, this is not entirely accurate, as the Constitution only allows suspension of habeas corpus in cases of rebellion or invasion when public safety requires it. The president may justify suspension based on his 'invasion' rhetoric, but only Congress has the power to suspend habeas corpus, not the Executive. 'The privileges of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it,' according to the Legal Information Institute of Cornell Law School.

**Trump's Plan to Suspend Habeas Corpus: A Constitutional Crisis?**
US President Donald Trump's administration is considering suspending the constitutional right to appear before a court, in an attempt to speed up the deportation of undocumented immigrants. This move is highly controversial and faces significant legal and constitutional challenges, as the US Constitution only allows for the suspension of this right in cases of rebellion or invasion, according to the Associated Press. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said that Trump is seeking to expand his legal authority to deport undocumented immigrants, citing the administration's serious consideration of suspending the right to appear before a court, which grants individuals the right to legally challenge their detention by authorities. Miller stated, 'The Constitution is clear on this matter, it allows for the suspension of the right to appear before a court in cases of invasion, and therefore we are taking this option seriously, although it will largely depend on whether the courts make the right decision.' The right to appear before a court is a fundamental pillar of justice in the US judicial system, as it allows federal courts to summon prisoners before a neutral judge to ensure the legality of their detention. This right was derived from the English common law, where the British Parliament passed the Habeas Corpus Act in 1679 to ensure that the monarch did not detain individuals arbitrarily without a legal basis. The US Constitution, in the second paragraph of the ninth section of the first article, states that 'the right to appear before a court may not be suspended except in cases of rebellion or invasion, when public safety requires it.' Yes, the right to appear before a court has been suspended on four different occasions in US history, often under congressional authorization, which is almost impossible today, even with Trump's pressure, given the slim Republican majority in both the House and Senate. The first suspension of this right occurred during the presidency of Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War, when he detained those suspected of spying or sympathizing with the Confederacy, defying a decision by then-Chief Justice Roger Taney. Later, Congress authorized its suspension in 1863, allowing Lincoln to repeat this action. Another suspension occurred during the presidency of Ulysses Grant in 1871 in parts of South Carolina, aimed at countering violent and intimidating acts by anti-reconstruction groups in the South. The last suspension occurred in two districts in the Philippines in 1905, when it was still under American administration, and finally in Hawaii after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, before becoming a state in 1959. In theory, the US administration could attempt to move forward with suspending this right, as Miller pointed out that the US is facing an invasion of immigrants, a description used deliberately in the context of justifying the use of the constitutional exception, according to the Associated Press. However, any such step would face significant legal challenges, particularly regarding whether the current situation constitutes an invasion that justifies suspending this right, or whether it poses an unusual threat to public safety.

**Trump Administration Reportedly Weighing Suspension of Habeas Corpus Trump Administration Reportedly Weighing Suspension of Habeas Corpus**
The Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, a legal right that allows individuals to challenge unlawful detentions in court, citing the US Constitution's provision for suspension in cases of 'rebellion or invasion.' According to Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff, judicial challenges to immigration-related detentions are obstructing enforcement efforts. Miller referred to habeas corpus as a 'privilege' rather than a guaranteed right, but legal experts dispute this interpretation, noting that only Congress has the authority to suspend habeas corpus. The administration's approach has come under judicial scrutiny, with some judges ruling in favor of the administration and others ordering the release of detainees citing habeas corpus protections. Trump has hinted at using powerful legal tools to push past judicial blocks on deportation policies, and his administration has made it clear that they will explore all avenues to expedite deportations. Habeas corpus has only been suspended four times in American history, including during the Civil War and in Hawaii after the Pearl Harbor attack.

**US-Migrationspolitik: Trump-Regierung considers suspending habeas corpus**
The Trump administration is considering suspending the right to habeas corpus to make it easier to deport undocumented immigrants. According to Stephen Miller, the deputy White House policy chief, 'the Constitution is clear, and that's the highest law in the land: the Habeas Corpus Act can be suspended in the case of an invasion. [...] I would say that this is an option that we are actively considering,' he said in response to a question about whether the administration plans to suspend the right to habeas corpus. The Trump administration has repeatedly complained that judges are trying to block deportations of undocumented immigrants, citing the Habeas Corpus Act, which allows anyone to have their detention reviewed by a court. The US Constitution states that this right can only be suspended in the case of a threat to public safety, 'in the case of a rebellion or invasion.' The administration has referred to the situation at the US-Mexico border as an 'invasion' in the past. Whether the administration will actually take this option depends on whether the courts 'do the right thing or not,' according to Miller. The Habeas Corpus Act has been suspended only four times in US history, and in three of those cases, it was the US Congress that initially approved the suspension. The number of unauthorized border crossings has decreased significantly since Trump's inauguration, with only around 11,000 apprehensions in March, compared to 189,000 in March 2024. The Department of Homeland Security has announced that people without legal residency in the US can receive up to $1,000 in financial assistance if they voluntarily leave the country. 'If you're here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest, and most cost-effective way to leave the United States and avoid detention,' said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement.

**Trump administration considering suspending habeas corpus**
The Trump administration is considering suspending habeas corpus, a legal right that allows individuals to be brought before a judge to determine the legality of their detention. According to Stephen Miller, 'A lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.' However, legal experts have questioned Miller's interpretation of US law, describing habeas corpus as a 'privilege' and citing a law passed by Congress that strips judicial courts of jurisdiction over immigration cases. The Trump administration has pursued different means of expediting deportations, including invoking a centuries-old wartime law to justify deporting Venezuelans. Despite this, deportations have lagged behind detentions, with one person being deported erroneously. It is unclear if Trump will attempt to suspend habeas corpus without the approval of Congress.

**US Considers Suspending Habeas Corpus in Immigration Crackdown**
The White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Miller, stated that US President Trump is considering suspending the right to habeas corpus, which allows detainees to challenge the legality of their detention in court, as part of his large-scale crackdown on immigration. Miller said, 'As the supreme law of the land, the Constitution explicitly states that the right to habeas corpus can be suspended during an invasion.' He added, 'Therefore, we are actively considering this option. It largely depends on whether the courts make the right decision.' Trump has repeatedly referred to the presence of undocumented immigrants in the US as an 'invasion' and has made it a key part of his campaign promise to deport hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants. Since taking office in January, Trump has continued to push for a faster pace of deportations, but his efforts have been blocked by multiple federal courts, which have insisted that deportees must receive due process. As part of his efforts to combat undocumented immigration, Trump invoked a little-known wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, to quickly deport hundreds of people identified as members of Venezuelan gangs to a prison in El Salvador. Several federal courts have blocked further deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, and the Supreme Court has stated that immigrants deported under the law must be given the opportunity to challenge their deportation decisions in court. The law has been most famously used in the past to detain Japanese Americans during World War II, as well as during the War of 1812 and World War I. If the right to habeas corpus is suspended, the Trump administration may not need to go through individual deportation proceedings, allowing for a faster pace of deportations, but this move would likely face intense legal challenges and ultimately end up in the Supreme Court.

**Trump Administration Considers Suspending Habeas Corpus to Intensify Anti-Immigration Policies**
The Trump administration is considering suspending the habeas corpus, a constitutional principle that protects individuals from arbitrary detentions, to intensify its anti-immigration policies. According to Stephen Miller, a key advisor to President Trump, the Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus 'in times of invasion'. Miller stated, 'It's an option we're actively considering, and it all depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.' The administration has used the excuse of an 'invasion' of migrants to justify actions such as the militarization of the border with Mexico and the expulsion of foreigners, mostly Venezuelans, to the CECOT prison in El Salvador. Human rights organizations have filed lawsuits against the government's policies, and in multiple instances, courts have ruled in their favor, blocking Trump's plans. The habeas corpus has been suspended only four times in US history: during the Civil War and Reconstruction, in the Philippines under US control, and in Hawaii after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

**Donald Trump 'looking at' suspending legal right to challenge one's detention**
According to Stephen Miller, Donald Trump's top aide, the president is 'actively looking at' suspending habeas corpus, the legal right to challenge one's detention by the government. This move is aimed at cracking down on illegal immigrants. Since January 20, Trump's administration has taken several measures to restrict immigration, including a ban on asylum for migrants at the southern border and the termination of a humanitarian parole program, CBP One. Karoline Leavitt, a White House official, stated that attempted illegal crossings into the US at the southern border hit record lows in February and March, with just over 7,000 illegal immigrants encountered by US Border Patrol in March. The Trump administration claims to be 'working 24/7 to successfully arrest and deport' criminals living in the US illegally.

**What is habeas corpus and why does Donald Trump want to suspend it | Explained**
The Trump administration is considering suspending habeas corpus, a legal principle that protects individuals from unlawful detention, citing the influx of fentanyl into the country. According to Stephen Miller, 'The Constitution is clear, and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in time of invasion.' Miller stated that the decision depends on 'whether the courts do the right thing or not.' Habeas corpus, meaning 'you shall have the body' in Latin, is a court order that requires authorities to justify a person's custody before a court, ensuring due process and safeguarding against arbitrary imprisonment. It can only be suspended during extreme circumstances, like rebellion, as outlined in the US Constitution's Suspension Clause (Article I, Section 9).

**Trump Administration’s Foreign Aid Halt Is Worrying, Cambodian NGOs Say, As Programs Left in Limbo | CamboJA News**
The Trump administration's 90-day suspension of U.S. foreign assistance programs has left many Cambodian programs in limbo. NGOs warn that a prolonged pause could hinder Cambodia's progress in areas like human rights, education, and economic development. 'This suspension of assistance is a major impact on Adhoc's activities in contributing to the improvement of the human rights and democracy situation in Cambodia,' said Ny Sokha, president of Cambodian rights group Adhoc. 'Cambodia is a poor country that needs foreign assistance to develop the country as well as its human resources.' The suspension has already affected civil society organizations, including the Cambodian Center for Independent Media (CCIM) and the 'Connect Phum 5' project. Heng Kimhong, president of advocacy group Cambodian Youth Network (CYN), expressed concerns about the long-term impact of the aid halt, but remains hopeful that alternative funding or solutions will be found. 'As civil society, I hope the United States and other donors will continue their support to sustain international cooperation. This will ensure the ongoing promotion of democracy, social justice and human rights,' he said.
