**UN: The World Approaches a New Climate Threshold**
The United Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has released a report warning of a high probability of the global average temperature exceeding the critical threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2025 and 2029, with a 70% chance. This report highlights the world's approach to breaching the climate limit set by the Paris Agreement in 2015, which aims to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, with a goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible. The report notes that the past two years have seen record-breaking temperatures, with 2023 and 2024 being among the hottest years on record. According to the latest data, the average temperature in 2024 exceeded pre-industrial levels by 1.45 degrees Celsius, with a 80% scientific probability that one of the next five years will be warmer than 2024. The report predicts that temperatures will rise between 1.2 and 1.9 degrees Celsius between 2025 and 2029 compared to the mid-19th century, with a 1% chance of exceeding a 2-degree Celsius threshold during the same period, a scenario that was considered unlikely a decade ago but is now a looming reality. These numbers are not just statistics, but reflect an escalating reality of climate change impacts, where temperatures have risen by 40 to 50 degrees Celsius in regions such as China and the UAE, while Pakistan has suffered from drought and strong winds, and Europe and Canada have experienced devastating floods and fires. Rising temperatures also contribute to the melting of permanent ice and the reduction of sea ice coverage, as well as exacerbating droughts and increasing the risk of heavy rainfall. Climate scientists warn that continued increases in greenhouse gas emissions make achieving the ambitious goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius less likely over time. According to the Copernicus program of the European Union, the current warming has reached 1.39 degrees Celsius, and it is likely to exceed the 1.5-degree threshold before the end of the 2020s. The Arctic remains the fastest-warming region compared to the rest of the world, with a clear reduction in sea ice coverage in the Barents, Bering, and Okhotsk seas. Studies predict an increase in rainfall rates in coastal areas, Alaska, Siberia, and northern Europe, while the Amazon basin is expected to experience drier conditions in the near future.

**Unprecedented Arctic Warming: Implications for Global Climate Patterns**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned of continued global warming in the next five years, with temperatures expected to remain at record-breaking or near-record levels. This will exacerbate climate-related risks to global communities and economies, and threaten sustainable development pathways. The report highlights several key messages, including: There is an 80% chance that one of the next five years (2025-2029) will be the 'hottest year on record', surpassing the record set in 2024. There is an 86% chance that one of the next five years will see a temperature increase of 1.5°C compared to the pre-industrial average (1850-1900). The report shows that there is a 70% chance that global warming will exceed 1.5°C during the period (2025-2029). Despite these alarming forecasts, the report notes that long-term warming, measured over decades, has not yet reached the 1.5°C threshold agreed upon in the Paris Agreement. However, the continued upward trend in temperatures suggests that it may be exceeded in the near future if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. There is an 80% chance that at least one of the next five years (2025-2029) will break the record for the hottest year on record since temperature records began (set in 2024). There is an 86% chance that temperatures will rise by at least 1.5°C in one of the next five years compared to the pre-industrial average. The report does not provide global predictions for each year individually. Breaking any additional degree of warming will lead to more severe heatwaves, extreme weather events, and glacier melting, as well as rising sea levels and ocean temperatures. The Arctic region is expected to continue to experience higher rates of warming than the global average, which may lead to significant environmental changes, including sea ice melting and rising sea levels. The region is expected to experience temperatures 2.4°C above the global average during the next five winters (November to March), which is more than three and a half times the global average. The predictions for sea ice show a decrease in sea ice concentrations in the Barents, Bering, and Okhotsk seas from March 2025 to March 2029. The report notes that precipitation patterns will show a clear variation between geographical regions, with some areas expected to become wetter, while others may experience more severe droughts, directly affecting agriculture, water, and food security. South Asia has experienced above-average rainfall in recent years, except for 2023, and forecasts suggest that this trend will continue during the period 2025-2029. However, this may not apply to all seasons in each year of these five years.

**World Meteorological Organization Issues Urgent Climate Warning for Next Five Years**
The World Meteorological Organization (OMM) has released an urgent statement warning of the next five years' global climate projections. According to the report, the average annual global surface temperature is expected to be higher than the 1850-1900 average. The organization warns that for every additional fraction of a degree, 'more damaging heatwaves, extreme precipitation events, intense droughts, melting of ice caps, sea ice, and glaciers, warming of the oceans, and sea level rise' will occur. The OMM emphasizes that these consequences will be more severe with each additional degree of warming.

**WMO Warns of 70% Probability of Exceeding 1.5°C Global Temperature Increase by 2029**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned that there is a 70% probability that the average global temperature between 2025-2029 will exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The WMO's report states that high temperatures will increase climate risks and impacts on societies, economies, and sustainable development. The report predicts that the average annual global temperature near the surface for each year between 2025 and 2029 will be 'between 1.2°C and 1.9°C', surpassing the average temperature recorded between 1850 and 1900. The WMO also notes that there is an 80% chance that at least one year between 2025 and 2029 will be hotter than the current record holder, 2024. Additionally, there is an 86% probability that at least one year will be more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The WMO explains that each additional degree of warming leads to more severe heatwaves, extreme precipitation events, intense droughts, melting of glaciers, warming of oceans, and sea-level rise. The organization highlights that the warming of the Arctic in the next five years is expected to be more than three and a half times the global average, and that regions such as the Sahel, northern Europe, Alaska, and northern Siberia will be wetter, while the Amazon will be drier (from May to September 2025-2029). The scientific community has warned that a warming above 1.5°C could trigger more severe climate change impacts and extreme weather conditions, emphasizing that each fraction of a degree of warming is crucial. The COP30 conference in Brazil will analyze the updated national climate action plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are essential to achieving the Paris Agreement's goals.

**World on Fire: Unprecedented Heatwave to Hit Earth by 2029**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned in a recent climate report that the world is facing an unprecedented wave of high temperatures over the next five years (2025-2029), due to the acceleration of climate change and the increasing risk of extreme weather events. The report states that there is an 80% chance that the world will experience a new record-breaking year for the highest temperature ever recorded, surpassing 2024, which is already considered the hottest year on record since temperature records began 175 years ago. The report also predicts a 70% chance that the global average temperature will exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Director of the Jordanian Meteorological Department, Raed Rafeed Al-Khatib, confirmed that 2024 was a clear indicator of climate change, with a record-breaking annual average temperature, the hottest summer on record, the warmest winter nights, and the lowest annual rainfall, particularly in the south and east. The report warns of: more frequent and longer-lasting heatwaves, heavy and unexpected rainfall in certain areas, severe drought in others, accelerated glacial melting, and rising sea levels. The WMO emphasizes that these numbers are a global alarm bell calling for urgent action to reduce global warming in line with the Paris Agreement and to intensify local and global adaptation efforts. The Jordanian Meteorological Department, a member of the WMO since 1955, calls for increased community awareness, updating national climate adaptation plans, and regional cooperation to face the upcoming challenges, in order to preserve the future of generations, the environment, and the economy.

**Global Temperature Expected to Reach Record High Over Next Five Years**
According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the global temperature is expected to reach a record high or near-record high over the next five years. This will lead to increased climate risks and negative consequences for society, economy, and development. The WMO report states that the global annual average surface temperature for each year from 2025 to 2029 is expected to be 1.2-1.9 degrees Celsius higher than the pre-industrial era (1850-1900). There is an 80% chance that at least one of these years will be the hottest year on record, surpassing 2024. The five-year average temperature is expected to exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold set by the Paris Agreement with a 70% probability, up from 47% in the previous report. Each additional degree of warming will lead to more severe heatwaves, extreme rainfall, droughts, melting of glaciers, warming of oceans, and rising sea levels. The WMO also predicts that the next five winters (November to March) will see a 3.5 times faster warming in the Arctic than the global average. The report warns that there will be no slowdown in the warming trend in the coming years, which will have negative impacts on the economy, daily life, ecosystems, and the planet. 'We have already experienced the hottest ten years on record. Unfortunately, the WMO report suggests that there will be no slowdown in this process, and this will lead to more negative impacts on our economy, daily life, ecosystems, and the planet,' said Ko Barrett, the WMO's Deputy Secretary-General. 'Monitoring and forecasting the climate is essential for decision-makers to adapt to the changing climate, and we need to provide them with science-based tools and data,' he added.

**WMO Sounds Alarm: 1.5-Degree Target May Be Reached Sooner Than Thought**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has sounded the alarm, warning that the 1.5-degree Celsius target may be reached sooner than previously thought. The accelerated timeline is due to higher temperatures than expected in recent years, decreasing air pollution that cooled the Earth, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide despite the growth of renewable energy. This means that irreversible tipping points in the climate system, such as the melting of Arctic ice shelves or the widespread collapse of coral reefs, are closer than scientists previously thought. According to the new WMO forecast, the next five years will likely average above 1.5 degrees Celsius. Combined with the recent hot years and expected rising temperatures after 2030, 2027 is likely to be the first year in which the long-term average temperature exceeds the limit, says Zeke Hausfather. The Paris Agreement aimed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, but some scientists and experts privately feared that the more ambitious goal would be impossible due to the difficulty of transforming the energy system. Despite the growth of renewable energy, it still only makes up about a third of the global energy mix. Even if wind, solar, and batteries grow in the power grid, the world consumes more electricity than ever before. The failure of the climate goal puts politicians and negotiators who have tried to gain support for reducing climate-damaging emissions in an uncomfortable position. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres claims that the 1.5-degree target 'hangs by artificial respiration' and 'will soon be dead.' Eventually, nations will acknowledge this failure and need to develop a new goal. 'You could imagine governments saying: 'Hey, 1.5 won't be achievable, but here's what we'll do, and here we'll strengthen our efforts,' says David Victor. 'That's an approach. Another approach would be to give up.' Zeke Hausfather, a climate researcher and head of climate research at Stripe, is personally skeptical about the willingness to spend billions of dollars on dealing with 'Overshoot.' After another decade of inaction, we will talk about the 2-degree target as we now talk about the 1.5-degree target. The nations could focus their attention on the less ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, keeping temperatures below two degrees Celsius. This goal is more achievable, but currently still unlikely. The planet is currently on its way to about 2.5 degrees Celsius. 'The longer we wait, the harder it will be,' emphasizes Hausfather. 'After another decade of inaction, we will talk about the 2-degree target as we now talk about the 1.5-degree target.'

**World Is About To Get Hot -- Here's Why You Should Worry**
A recent report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned that there is a 70% chance of global temperatures exceeding the 1.5°C threshold above pre-industrial levels between 2025 and 2029. This comes as 180 countries have yet to submit their climate plans for 2031-35. The WMO report also predicts that the global average temperature will breach the 1.5°C long-term global warming threshold by September 2029 if the current warming trend continues. WMO deputy secretary general Ko Barrett said, '...this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet.' The report emphasizes the need for continued climate monitoring and prediction to provide decision-makers with science-based tools and information to help adapt to the growing effect of climate change. The predicted annual average global mean near-surface temperature for each year between 2025 and 2029 is expected to be between 1.2°C and 1.9°C higher than the average for 1850-1900. There is also an 80% chance that at least one of the next five years will surpass 2024 as the warmest on record, and a 1% chance of at least one year exceeding 2°C of warming in the next five years.

**Next Five Years Will Be the Warmest on Record, Warns World Meteorological Organization**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has released a report predicting that the next five years will be the warmest on record. According to the report, the global average temperature will rise by 1.2-1.9°C above the pre-industrial level (1850-1900) between 2025 and 2029. This will increase climate-related risks for populations, industries, and agriculture worldwide. The WMO's Deputy Secretary-General, Ko Barrett, stated, 'We have just experienced the ten warmest years on record. Unfortunately, according to our report, there will be no respite in the coming years, and this will lead to a growing negative impact on our economy, daily life, ecosystems, and the planet.' The report also predicts that the probability of exceeding the critical 1.5°C threshold (set by the Paris Agreement) is 70%, up from 47% in the previous report. Experts warn that the temporary exceedance of established levels will become more frequent, eventually becoming permanent and stable. They predict that the 20-year period (2015-2034) will see a global temperature increase of 1.44°C on average. However, the planet often surprises humanity with unexpected events that significantly alter any predictions. The UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, will discuss updated national climate action plans to achieve the Paris Agreement's goals. Despite the obvious reasons for concern, many people believe that nothing serious is happening, especially when they look out the window and see a warm spring like the one in Belarus this year. However, it's essential to distinguish between weather and climate. Climate refers to long-term weather conditions in a region, while weather is the current atmospheric conditions in a specific location. The average global temperature has already exceeded the critical 2°C threshold, reaching 2.06°C in November 2023. While this is a temporary anomaly, it's a worrying sign that the planet is becoming warmer. Experts predict that the consequences of climate change will be severe, including the loss of 70-90% of coral reefs (the foundation of many ecosystems) at a 1.5°C increase, and 99% at a 2°C increase. This will have a devastating impact on marine life and the people who depend on it for food. Therefore, it's essential to prepare for the coming five years of heatwaves.

**Climate Change to Exceed 1.5°C Threshold by 2029, UN Agency Warns**
According to the annual and decennial update from the United Nations agency based in Geneva, the planet is expected to experience temperatures 1.2°C to 1.9°C above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) over the next five years. This means there is an 80% chance that the record heat of last year will be broken again by 2029. The report also states that there is a 70% chance that the five-year average itself will exceed the 1.5°C threshold set in 2015 as part of the Paris Agreement on climate. However, the World Meteorological Organization (OMM) notes that this agreement refers to long-term averages over two decades, meaning that the threshold has not yet been exceeded. The report also predicts changes in precipitation and their regional impacts, including more humid conditions in the Sahel African region, Northern Europe, and Southern Asia, as well as persistent drought in the Amazon region. The Arctic is expected to warm by 2.4°C, and glaciers are expected to continue melting. The OMM is calling for climate action to prevent further dangerous warming in the coming decades and keep long-term warming below the 1.5°C limit.

**2024: The Third Warmest Year in Spain's Historical Series**
2024 was the third warmest year in Spain's historical series, with a temperature increase of 1.1 degrees above the normal value. According to the State Meteorological Agency (Aemet), the average annual temperature was 15.1 degrees, with a record-breaking 424.3 ppm of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Aemet's spokesperson, Rubén del Campo, stated, 'It was an extremely warm year.' The year saw 62% of days warmer than normal and 38% of days cooler than normal. There were 31 records of hot days, adding to the 209 records in the last decade and only 7 records of cold days. Del Campo noted that the summer was concentrated in July and August, unlike previous years. The sea temperature also reached a record 20 degrees for the second consecutive year. The country experienced three heatwaves, which were particularly concentrated in time, from July 18 to August 13. Del Campo warned that the persistence of heatwaves increases mortality. The trend is clear, with an increase in the duration, extension, and intensity of heatwaves. The spokesperson mentioned the 28 degrees recorded in Zaragoza on July 30, saying, 'We have gone from tropical nights (20 degrees) to torrid nights (25) and are now looking for a name for nights that do not drop below 30 degrees.' The drought also lost intensity, with 669.1 mm of rainfall, 105% above the normal period, making it the 26th wettest year in the series and the 10th in the 21st century.

**2024 was the first year to surpass 1.5 °C above pre-industrial era**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has confirmed that 2024 was likely the first year to surpass 1.5 °C above the pre-industrial era, with a global average temperature near the surface of 1.55 °C above the 1850-1900 mean (with a margin of uncertainty of ± 0.13 °C). This is the warmest year in the 175 years of observational records, while the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is at its highest levels in the last 800,000 years. The report states that the long-term global warming is estimated to be currently between 1.34 and 1.41 °C compared to the 1850-1900 baseline. According to the report, the countries must have early warning systems in place to mitigate the effects of climate change. The WMO Secretary-General, Celeste Saulo, stated that 'we are emitting more distress signals, but it is still possible to limit the long-term global temperature increase to 1.5 °C.' 'Leaders must take a step forward to achieve it, taking advantage of the benefits of cheap and clean renewable energies for their peoples and economies, with the new national climate plans expected this year,' said António Guterres. The report highlights that the continuous increase in greenhouse gas emissions, along with a change from La Niña to El Niño, contributed to the record-breaking global temperatures in 2023 and 2024. The report also notes that other factors may have contributed to these unexpected and unusual temperature jumps, such as changes in the solar cycle, a massive volcanic eruption, and a decrease in cooling aerosols. 'Our oceans continued to warm and sea levels continued to rise,' said Saulo. 'The cryosphere is melting at an alarming rate, glaciers are retreating, and the Antarctic ice sheet has reached its second-lowest extent ever recorded. Meanwhile, extreme weather conditions continue to have devastating consequences worldwide,' she added. The report emphasizes that while one year above 1.5 °C does not indicate that the long-term temperature targets of the Paris Agreement are out of reach, 'it is a wake-up call that we are increasing the risks to our lives, economies, and the planet.'

**World enters period of long-term warming above 1.5°C, scientists warn**
Scientists suggest that the world has entered a period of long-term warming above 1.5°C, according to two studies published on February 3. The studies, published in Nature Climate Change, indicate that the recent temperatures are part of a long-term trend. In 2024, the planet experienced its first year above the 1.5°C threshold, with a global average temperature of 1.55°C above the 1850-1900 average, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Celeste Saulo, WMO Secretary-General, cautioned that 'one year above 1.5°C does not mean we have failed to meet the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.' However, researchers suggest that the recent anomaly may be an 'early warning sign' that the long-term limit is being breached. According to the studies, if the anomaly continues beyond 18 months, it is 'almost certain' that the Paris Agreement threshold will be crossed, even in a moderate emissions scenario. The scientists emphasize the importance of containing the warming, as each additional fraction of a degree increases the risks of heatwaves and marine life destruction. Containing the warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C would significantly limit the most catastrophic consequences, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

**Scientists Warn of a New Era of Climate Change**
Scientists warn that the world may have entered a new era of climate change, with temperatures exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. According to two studies published on Monday, the world has seen a 1.55 degree Celsius average temperature increase since 1850, surpassing the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold set by the Paris Agreement. The studies suggest that this may be a warning sign that the long-term limit is already being exceeded. The Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, but the current rate of warming is expected to lead to catastrophic consequences, including more frequent heatwaves and the loss of marine life. The studies warn that if immediate action is not taken, the world will not remember 2024 as an anomaly, but as the beginning of a new era of climate change with increasing risks. 'If we don't take urgent action, people will not remember 2024 as an anomaly, but as the beginning of a new era of climate change with increasing risks,' said William Reilly, a professor at the University of Oregon. 'A single year exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius does not mean we have failed to achieve the long-term climate goals of the Paris Agreement,' said Sélest Saoulo, the general secretary of the World Meteorological Organization. 'But it is a warning sign that we are on the right track to exceeding the long-term limit.'

**Scientists Suggest World May Have Entered a Period of Several Decades Above 1.5°C**
According to two studies published in Nature Climate Change, the world may have entered a period of several decades with a global temperature above 1.5°C. The year 2024 was the first year to exceed this level, with a global average temperature of 1.55°C above the 1850-1900 average, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). 'A single year above 1.5°C does not mean we have failed to achieve the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement,' said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.

'If the anomaly of 1.5°C continues beyond 18 months, it is almost certain that the Paris Agreement threshold will be crossed,' said Alex Cannon, from the Canadian Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. The scientists emphasize the importance of containing the global temperature rise, as each additional fraction of a degree increases the risks of heatwaves and marine life destruction. Containing the temperature rise to 1.5°C rather than 2°C would significantly limit the most catastrophic consequences, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
