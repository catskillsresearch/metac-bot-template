**Europa, de Júpiter, pode se tornar habitável quando Sol 'morrer'; entenda**
Scientists from the University of Cornell have analyzed what might happen to the moon Europa, of Jupiter, when the Sun becomes a red giant in about five to seven billion years. According to the study, published on the arXiv server, Europa's surface ice could evaporate and form a thin atmosphere around the moon, making it potentially habitable. The researchers simulated two scenarios: in the first, Europa receives more sunlight and its surface ice begins to evaporate, forming a thin atmosphere; in the second, the entire surface ice transforms into vapor, which could remain around Europa for hundreds of thousands of years, creating conditions that might allow the emergence of some form of life. 'As cold moons represent large reservoirs of water and will undergo sublimation and melting processes when exposed to increased solar irradiation... We modeled the evolution of Europa's surface when it is initially exposed to irradiation from the habitable zone during the red giant phase of the Sun,' the scientists describe in the study. Europa is one of Jupiter's main moons, a frozen satellite that shows strong evidence of hosting liquid water beneath its icy surface. It is considered one of the most promising environments for the existence of extraterrestrial life, due to the conditions of the subterranean ocean that may exist below its frozen crust.

**Massive Spheres of 400 Tons Appear Underwater, Leaving Scientists and the Public in Awe**
A groundbreaking discovery has been made in the ocean, with massive spheres weighing 400 tons appearing beneath the surface. According to experts at Econews, 'Recent movements and observations in the California sea have caught the attention of researchers and residents. After further investigation, several 400-ton spheres were found underwater. Speculation has begun: could they be new phenomena for scientists to analyze, or evidence of extraterrestrial life that somehow ended up there? However, it's also possible that these spheres are related to renewable energy.' This unprecedented find has left scientists and the public wondering about the implications and potential uses of these massive spheres.

**Scientists Discover Signs of Life on Exoplanet K2-18b**
Scientists from Cambridge University have discovered signs of life on the exoplanet K2-18b, located 120 light-years away from Earth. According to the researchers, the presence of DMS and DADS molecules in the planet's atmosphere is a strong indication of life. These molecules are produced by small marine organisms on Earth. The team used the James Webb Space Telescope to detect the presence of these molecules. While the discovery is not conclusive proof of alien life, it is the strongest indication yet. The planet is about 2.5 times larger than Earth and has a dense hydrogen-rich atmosphere. The researchers also suggest that the planet may have a large ocean and a thick atmosphere. 'We are 99.7% confident that we have found signs of life on K2-18b,' said the scientists. 'This is the most promising sign of life we have found so far.'

**Scientists Debunk Liquid Water on Mars Hypothesis**
Scientists have debunked sensational reports of evidence of liquid water on Mars. A new study published in Nature Communications analyzed over 87,000 satellite images and found no evidence of water-related features on the Martian surface. According to Adomas Valantinas, a planetary scientist from Brown University, 'Our analysis shows that there is no indication that these stripes are related to water.' Researchers identified around half a million of these stripes, although the actual number may be up to two million. Despite their resemblance to liquid flow marks, these formations are merely dust mirages caused by wind. 'With a global map, we were able to compare it with other data: temperature, humidity, wind speed, surface shifts, and hydration,' explains Valentyn Bikkal, another author of the study. This narrows down the search for extraterrestrial life: the slopes are no longer promising areas for water or biological activity detection. The researchers were particularly disappointed by RSL - seasonal stripes that appear in summer and disappear in winter. They were long considered evidence of seasonal saltwater melting. However, according to the scientists, they also have a 'dry' origin. 'If these stripes were formed by saltwater, they would be potentially inhabited micro-niches. But at the moment, we don't see any connection with humidity, temperature, or solar orientation,' adds Valantinas. Now scientists know where not to look for water - and therefore, signs of life. 'This is a big advantage of our approach: we can disprove some hypotheses even before the launch of missions,' concludes Valantinas.

**Report suggests future-proofing crops will require urgent and consistent effort**
According to a review by Stephen Long, a professor of crop sciences and of plant biology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, crops will experience a significantly different environment by 2050-60 due to climate change. Long writes, 'By 2050-60, crops will experience a significantly different environment from today.' The projected temperature extremes and climate instability will further reduce crop yields, increasing starvation, political unrest and mass migration. However, there is hope. Researchers are evaluating the heat-, drought- and flood-tolerance of different varieties of specific crop plants, identifying those with potentially beneficial attributes. Scientists have discovered that some rice varieties can survive up to two weeks of submergence during periods of intense flooding, while other varieties are more heat-tolerant than others. Long said, 'A plant may partially close its stomata to retain moisture, but this can interfere with its ability to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a key step in photosynthesis.' Researchers have found ways to reduce the density of stomata on the leaves of rice and wheat, improving water-use efficiency by 15-20% with no decrease in yield. Long points to the remarkable progress made in research on maize, nearly 80% of which is used in ethanol production and to feed animals, not humans. 'Between 1980 and 2024, U.S. maize yields doubled while sorghum improved by just 12%,' he said. However, Long writes, 'Without similar investment, it is hard to see how the opportunities... for future-proofing our crops can be implemented at the scale that is necessary.'

**Newly Released UFO Reports by Civilian Pilots Reveal Unexplained Phenomena**
The National Archives has released a report on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) sightings by civilian pilots. The report includes 12 incidents where pilots reported seeing UAPs, including a cylindrical object, a spherical object, and a disk-shaped object. Some of the reports are difficult to explain, such as a UAP that was seen by multiple pilots in the same area, but was not detected by radar. Another report describes a UAP that was seen by a pilot in the vicinity of the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which was described as a 'large, metallic, cylindrical object' that was seen hovering in the air for several minutes. The report also includes a statement from the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) director, Jon T. Kosloski, who said that the office is working to resolve the UAP sightings and provide a explanation for the phenomena. Some experts have expressed skepticism about the reports, suggesting that they may be misidentifications of natural phenomena or man-made objects. However, others have suggested that the reports may be evidence of advanced military technology or extraterrestrial life. The report is part of a larger effort by the National Archives to release previously classified information about UAP sightings.

**Scientists Warn of a 'Scary' Possibility: Earth Could be Ejected from its Orbit**
A team of scientists has found a scientifically plausible scenario in which the Earth could be ejected from its orbit around the Sun in the distant future, potentially leading to a catastrophic end to life on its surface. The study, published on the arXiv platform, used complex computer simulations to model the fate of planets in the solar system over a period of five billion years. According to the study, the Earth has a 0.2% chance of being ejected from its orbit, while the planet Pluto has a 5% chance and Mars has a 0.3% chance. The researchers suggest that the risk of such an event is low, but it highlights the need for further research into the long-term changes in the solar system. The study takes into account the possibility of nearby stars passing close to the Sun, which could disrupt the stability of the planets' orbits. The researchers note that the results do not mean that the end of the Earth is imminent, but rather that it is a possibility that should be considered in the context of long-term cosmic changes.

**The Impossibility of Negative Mass and the Search for Advanced Extraterrestrial Technologies**
Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist from Harvard, explains why it's impossible to build motors that can distort space-time with negative mass using the physics we know. He argues that the energy density of the vacuum, also known as dark energy, is too small to be harnessed for propulsion. Loeb claims that even if we were to collect all the energy from a large volume of space, it would only be enough to power a single 100-watt light bulb for less than a minute. He also dismisses the idea that the Casimir effect could be used to manipulate the vacuum energy, stating that the energy associated with the conducting plates exceeds the energy density of the vacuum. Loeb concludes that there is no known way to create negative mass, which would be necessary for faster-than-light travel or time travel. However, he suggests that searching for evidence of advanced extraterrestrial technologies could lead to new perspectives on what is possible. He proposes that funding should be redirected from searching for microorganisms to searching for signs of advanced technologies. This could also lead to the development of new technologies, such as advanced sensors and artificial intelligence software, that could be used for national security purposes.

**The Mysterious Buga Sphere: Alien Object, Art, or Deception?**
A mysterious metallic sphere, known as the 'Buga sphere', was discovered in Colombia on March 2, 2025. The sphere, about 50 cm in diameter, was seen moving irregularly and silently over the area. Initial investigations by radiologist José Luis Velázquez revealed that the sphere has no visible seams, screws, or signs of assembly, and features symbols resembling Nordic runes on its surface. The scientific community is approaching the discovery with caution, as many information sources are from social media, tabloids, and UFO-specialized websites. Some experts, like Julia Mossbridge from the University of San Diego, suggest that the sphere could be an artistic or conceptual piece, while others propose that it might be a result of an unrecorded scientific experiment. The public and ufology enthusiasts have also come up with various theories, including the possibility that the sphere is an extraterrestrial probe. Videos and testimonies online describe the sphere's anomalous movements and silent, controlled flight, which some believe are compatible with non-terrestrial technology.

**There's growing evidence of possible life on other planets - here's why you should still be sceptical**
A team of researchers from the University of Cambridge has claimed to have discovered a gas called dimethyl sulphide (DMS) in the atmosphere of K2-18b, a planet orbiting a distant star. While the presence of DMS may be a sign of life on K2-18b, scientists are cautious and say that we can't rush to conclusions just yet. The team behind the discovery suggests that K2-18b could be an ocean world, but other possibilities include a magma ocean or a Neptune-like 'gas dwarf' planet. The detection of DMS is not conclusive evidence of life, as it can also be produced by non-biological mechanisms. As Carl Sagan said, 'extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence'. The researchers claim that the detection of DMS on K2-18b has a likelihood of greater than 99.9%, but scientists must consider alternative explanations before supporting such a profound conclusion as the presence of extraterrestrial life.

**NASA Finds Signs of Extraterrestrial Life on Mars, But Keeps it a Secret**
NASA has found signs of extraterrestrial life on Mars, but is keeping it a secret, according to Dr. Barry Di Gregorio, a scientist from Buckingham University. He believes that the agency is keeping quiet to generate interest in their plans to send humans to the Red Planet in the 2030s. Di Gregorio claims that NASA has obtained images of 'biogenic' crystals created by living organisms in two separate instances. The first was in 2018, when the Curiosity rover photographed a growth of crystals, and the second was in 2020, when the Perseverance rover captured images of 'red-like' creatures roaming its ancient oceans. 'When I saw these rocks everywhere, I thought, 'What? Oh God.' I thought NASA would make a big announcement. Instead, they went in the opposite direction. So, they didn't even analyze these rocks,' Di Gregorio said. He does not believe that the images indicate an extraterrestrial civilization, but rather marine organisms. 'I think about red-like creatures that existed in the Ediacaran period. Then the climate on Mars changed, and the atmosphere changed. Water likely seeped into the ground, and most of it went through the atmosphere through solar wind,' Di Gregorio said. When asked why NASA is hiding possible evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars, the scientist suggested that it may be due to the potential danger to astronauts: 'I think they don't want to say anything about it because they're sending people there... If they say we've found life on Mars, it may be different from Earth's and may be toxic or hazardous to human astronauts. That's what I think.' A NASA representative stated that the agency will continue to research in accordance with its capabilities: 'During the Perseverance rover's surface exploration, it discovered numerous interesting features of the Martian terrain, and the scientific team identified which rock formations warrant further study and even sampling, based on all available data. To date, NASA has not found any conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life.'

**‘Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence’ − an astronomer explains how much evidence scientists need to claim discoveries like extraterrestrial life - Stanley Republican**
According to astronomer Chris Impey, 'extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.' To determine if a scientific result is a true discovery, there are three criteria: the detection needs to be strong, the result needs to be repeatable, and the evidence should be conclusive. The claim of life on K2-18b, a planet discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, does not meet these criteria. While the detection is strong, the result is not repeatable, and the evidence is not conclusive proof of life. Impey notes that scientists, such as those at CERN who discovered the Higgs boson particle, wait until they reach a 5-sigma level of detection before claiming a discovery. In the past, some scientists have claimed to have found life on Mars, but these claims have been met with skepticism. Impey emphasizes that 'it's just a comet' when it comes to the discovery of 'Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object that some have speculated could be an alien artifact. While many scientists think we may not be alone in the universe, no detection has cleared the threshold of evidence set by Carl Sagan. Impey concludes that 'we need to be careful not to get ahead of ourselves' when it comes to claims of extraterrestrial life.

**New Evidence for Life in Space: The Discovery on K2-18b**
In April 2025, researchers announced that they had found the strongest evidence yet for life in space. Using the James Webb Telescope, they detected signs of dimethylsulfid on the planet K2-18b, which is 124 light-years away. This element is only produced on Earth by plankton. The 8 times more massive planet is believed to be a water world, orbiting a red dwarf star. This discovery reminded the author of Carl Sagan's idea of 'Kosmos', where he suggested that there could be giant balloon-like beings on the gas giant Jupiter. Today, scientists are more likely to find life under the ice crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, which has more water than all the oceans on Earth. While this scientific publication has not yet provided conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life, it highlights the exciting times we live in and the possibility of life being even more alien than we imagine.

**Scientists Deny Finding Evidence of Extraterrestrial Life on K2-18b**
Astronomers from the James Webb Space Telescope have found possible signs of life on the exoplanet K2-18b, but they are cautious not to claim that they have found evidence of extraterrestrial life. The study, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, found high concentrations of chemicals compatible with life, but this is still a remote possibility. The researchers detected the presence of dimethylsulfide (DMS) and dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) in the atmosphere of the exoplanet, which are molecules that are related to life on Earth. However, the scientists also note that these molecules can be synthesized abiotically, and therefore, they are not conclusive evidence of life. The study's lead author, Carlos Briones, emphasizes that 'the DMS can be synthesized in the laboratory through photochemical reactions without the involvement of living beings.' The researchers are cautious and emphasize that they need more data to confirm the presence of life on K2-18b. They also note that the detection of DMS and DMDS is not a clear indication of life, but rather a 'probable presence' of these molecules. The study's findings have been classified as a 3-sigma probability of biological activity outside our solar system, but the researchers stress that this is not enough to claim the presence of life. 'We need a solid detection, above 5 sigma, a clear demonstration that it is a biomarker and not another molecular species that is masquerading as a biomarker, and then a clear understanding that there is no non-biological way to produce the biomarker molecule in the observed quantity,' says David Clements, an astrobiologist from the Imperial College of London.

**Strongest Evidence Yet of Possible Extraterrestrial Life Detected in Exoplanet K2-18b**
Astronomers announced the strongest evidence yet of possible extraterrestrial life, detected in the atmosphere of the exoplanet K2-18b, located 124 light-years from Earth. The observations were made using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which identified signs of molecules that, on Earth, are produced exclusively by living organisms. However, experts warn that the data is not conclusive and requires validation from other scientific groups. The planet K2-18b was discovered in 2015 and, being in the habitable zone of its star, became a promising candidate in the search for life. Previous observations in 2019 had already identified water vapor in its atmosphere, suggesting oceans under a layer of hydrogen. In 2023, Nikku Madhusudhan and his team, from the University of Cambridge, detected water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane again, as well as a possible presence of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a substance produced only by living organisms, especially marine phytoplankton. However, the signals were weak, and the scientific community remained skeptical. New observations with another JWST instrument, the mid-infrared camera, revealed stronger signs of DMS and also dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), another biological molecule. The detection reached a statistical significance level of three sigma, equivalent to a 0.3% chance of being a coincidence. However, the scientific community only considers a discovery confirmed with five sigma (a 0.00003% chance of error). Nicholas Wogan, from NASA, considers the new data more promising than the previous ones, but reiterates that the analysis of JWST data is complex and may take weeks or months to be confirmed by other researchers. Ryan MacDonald, from the University of Michigan, is more skeptical and states that previous observations of the same planet have already proven to be misleading after deeper analysis. According to Madhusudhan, an additional 16-24 hours of observations with the JWST would be needed to try to reach the five-sigma level. However, this may not be feasible due to the difficulty of capturing signals from the planet's thin atmosphere. He compares this task to measuring the thickness of an apple's skin over the entire fruit. The scientists calculate that the concentrations of DMS and DMDS in K2-18b would be thousands of times higher than on Earth, which could indicate intense biological activity - if proven to be of organic origin. However, the researchers themselves admit that it is still not possible to assert that the molecules are the result of life, as non-biological alternatives need to be ruled out. Sara Seager, from MIT, believes that the planet may remain a viable 'bio-signature' candidate for decades, as the question may never be fully resolved with the limited data that exoplanets offer. Even so, Madhusudhan considers the moment revolutionary, highlighting humanity's achievement in investigating signs of life in distant worlds.

**Sensationell Upptäckt: Strongest Evidence Yet for Extraterrestrial Life**
Astronomers have discovered what they believe to be the strongest evidence yet for extraterrestrial life. The discovery was made using the James Webb space telescope and involves a massive planet, 124 light-years from Earth, known as K2-18 b. According to astrofysikern Nikku Madhusdhan from the University of Cambridge, 'This is the strongest evidence yet for a biological activity beyond our solar system.' The team has detected 'chemical fingerprints' of two compounds, dimetylsulfid (DMS) and dimetyldisulfid (DMDS), which are only known to be produced by living organisms on Earth. While the discovery is not conclusive proof of alien life, it brings scientists closer to answering the question of whether we are alone in the universe. Nikku Madhusdhan notes, 'Decades from now, we will look back on this time and realize that this was when life in the universe came within reach. This could be the turning point, the moment when we can answer the fundamental question of whether we are alone in the universe.' However, the team is cautious and advises against getting too excited about the results, as there are still many uncertainties and potential explanations for the discovery.

**'Strongest evidence yet' of extraterrestrial life found on exoplanet K2-18b**
Scientists have discovered a possible biosignature or indicator of biological activity on exoplanet K2-18b, which is located 124 light-years from Earth. The discovery was made using the James Webb telescope, which detected dimethylsulfide (DMS) and dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) in the atmosphere of K2-18b. The concentrations of these gases are thousands of times higher than on Earth. According to Nikka Madhusudhan, the lead author of the study, 'this is a groundbreaking moment in the search for life beyond our solar system.' Madhusudhan suggests that K2-18b could be a 'hycean' world, with an ocean of liquid water and an atmosphere rich in hydrogen, which would be conducive to life. However, other scientists are more cautious, suggesting that the discovery is not yet conclusive and that other explanations, such as intense comet impacts, could also produce the detected gases. Dr. Nora Hänni, a chemist at the University of Bern, says 'we would need to rule out all other options before claiming life.'

**NASA Scientists Search for Extraterrestrial Life**
Scientists from NASA have been searching for extraterrestrial life for decades, but so far, they have not found any conclusive evidence. Dr. Lindsey Gays, an astrobiologist at NASA, says, 'We have not found any scientifically confirmed evidence of extraterrestrial life, but we cannot rule out the possibility either.' She notes that life on Earth can be found in the most unexpected places, such as deep oceans, acidic environments, or underground thermal sources. If microorganisms can survive in these conditions, it opens up the possibility of life existing in other extreme environments in space. Currently, NASA's focus is on Mars, where five rovers and four landing craft have been deployed, but only a small part of the planet's surface has been explored. Other promising areas include the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, Europa and Enceladus, which have subsurface oceans that may have conditions similar to those that support life on Earth. The search for exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system, is also an important area of research. As the number of exoplanets discovered increases, our understanding of the possibility of life in the universe also changes. NASA scientists are cautious not to jump to conclusions, acknowledging that there is not enough data to say whether we are alone in the universe. However, as Carl Sagan said, 'If the universe is so big, and we are alone, that's a waste of space.' Therefore, the search continues.

**Are Aliens Real or Not? An Advanced Scientific and Theoretical Analysis**
The existence of extraterrestrial life is a debated topic in modern science. While no conclusive proof of intelligent alien life has been confirmed, mounting evidence from astrophysics, astrobiology, and advanced theoretical models suggests that the existence of life beyond Earth is highly probable. The observable universe contains an estimated 200 billion to 2 trillion galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars and potentially trillions of planets. The Drake Equation, developed by Dr. Frank Drake in 1961, attempts to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way. Recent breakthroughs in exoplanet discoveries and the search for biosignatures have provided strong indicators of biological activity. Scientists are analyzing exoplanet atmospheres for biosignatures, such as oxygen, methane, and phosphine. Upcoming missions like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) will allow scientists to analyze exoplanet atmospheres in unprecedented detail. The Fermi Paradox and the Great Filter Hypothesis suggest that civilizations may self-destruct before reaching interstellar capability. Theoretical physics and the possibility of advanced civilizations have led to the development of the Kardashev Scale, which measures technological civilizations. If extraterrestrials exist at Type II or III levels, their technology would be nearly indistinguishable from natural cosmic phenomena, making detection difficult. The implications of contact are vast, ranging from friendly collaboration to hostile aggression. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) and space agencies worldwide are formulating protocols for first contact, ensuring a coordinated response if extraterrestrial intelligence is discovered. The next two decades could be revolutionary in answering this question, with upcoming missions, advanced telescopes, and AI-powered space exploration poised to detect signs of alien life. 'Aliens are almost certainly real -- the question is not 'if,' but 'when' we will find undeniable proof.'
