**Steelers' Broderick Jones Speaks out on His 'Funky' 2024 Role**
Pittsburgh Steelers left tackle Broderick Jones is back to playing his natural position after a tumultuous first couple of years with the team. Jones, the 14th overall pick in the 2022 draft, was initially played out of position as a rookie and then trained to play both left and right tackle last year. However, he has now returned to left tackle, where he played in college and excelled. Jones expressed his happiness about being back at left tackle, saying, 'It was kind of funky' when he was asked to play swing tackle last year. He added that being back on the left side has given him a boost in confidence, particularly when blocking against players like Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig. The Steelers plan to start Jones at left tackle this season, with Troy Fautanu expected to start at right tackle. Jones has one year to prove himself and fulfill his first-round promise.

**US mayors are making climate action personal -- and it's working**
US mayors are taking a personal approach to climate action, with many cities setting ambitious goals to reduce emissions and adapt to a warming climate. Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb, for example, aims to put all residents within a 10-minute walk of a green space by 2045. Cities are also electrifying public transportation, forcing builders to make structures more energy efficient, and encouraging rooftop solar. Local leaders are moving faster than federal agencies and are more in-tune with their residents' priorities, said Kate Johnson, regional director for North America at C40 Cities. 'They're on the ground and they're hearing from their residents every day, so they have a really good sense of what the priorities are,' she said. Cities like Seattle and Washington, DC are scrambling to better insulate structures, especially affordable housing, by installing double-paned windows and better insulation. 'We are in a climate where energy efficiency remains the number one thing that we can do,' said Oliver Sellers-Garcia, commissioner of the environment and Green New Deal director in the Boston government. 'And there are so many other comfort and health benefits from being in an efficient, all-electric environment.'

**US Treasury Secretary Yellen: US Will Never Default on Its Debt**
US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that the US government will never default on its debt, despite the lack of a decision on raising its debt ceiling. Yellen made the statement in an interview with CBS News. Investors are concerned about the size of the US federal debt, as President Donald Trump has called on Congress to pass his 'big beautiful' bill, which is expected to increase the federal budget deficit. According to the International Monetary Fund, the US government debt will increase to 122.5% of GDP by 2025 and 128.2% by 2030. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has said that the US bond market 'will break' under the weight of the country's growing debt. Yellen responded, 'I've known Jamie for a long time, and throughout his career, he's made predictions like this. Fortunately, none of them have come true.' Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has also said that the US government debt is on an 'unsustainable trajectory,' but he believes it has not yet reached an unacceptable level, and it is unclear when it will. The Congressional Budget Office has warned that even without new budget legislation, the US government debt, expressed as a percentage of GDP, will exceed the peak of the 1940s in the coming years. Trump's bill would add around $3 trillion in debt over the next decade. Last month, Moody's rating agency downgraded the US credit rating from AAA. Elon Musk, who recently left his post in the Trump administration, said in an interview with CBS that he is 'disappointed' in the 'massive spending bill,' which he says undermines the work of his Department of Government Efficiency to reduce spending. The Trump administration insists that the bill will not increase the deficit and that the forecasts do not take into account the increase in economic growth. Yellen said that many forecasts also do not take into account the 'significant' growth in revenue from new large-scale import tariffs imposed by Trump, which could add trillions of dollars to government revenue. 'The deficit this year will be lower than last year, and in two years, it will be lower again,' Yellen said.

**Auto Dealers Want to Ban Online Sales of Cars by Manufacturers**
The Association of Russian Auto Dealers (РоАД) has proposed to the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) to establish a ban on direct online sales of cars by manufacturers and distributors. This restriction is suggested to be included in the upcoming national plan for the development of competition for 2026-2030. According to a letter signed by the president of РоАД, Alexey Podshchekoldin, addressed to the head of FAS, Maxim Shaskolsky, on May 29, the dealers are concerned that manufacturers may capture their margin by transitioning to direct online sales. As Podshchekoldin said, 'This would lead to a significant reduction in the number of jobs and a decrease in the overall economic activity in the automotive market.'

**US Faces High Risk of Financial Collapse, Warns Congressional Budget Office**
The US is facing a high risk of financial collapse, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO predicts that the federal debt will rise to 117% of the country's GDP by 2034, up from 98% last year. The interest payments on the debt are also expected to increase to 4% of the GDP, which is a significant burden on the government. Despite these alarming numbers, investors are still confident in the US economy and are willing to buy government bonds and the dollar, which are the backbone of the global financial system. However, some experts warn that the US is heading towards a financial crisis, citing the country's high debt levels and the potential for a recession. If a recession were to occur, it would have a double impact on the US finances, with a decline in tax revenues and a significant increase in welfare payments, leading to a financial collapse. The Federal Reserve may be able to mitigate some of the effects of a recession by lowering interest rates, but this would not eliminate the risk of a financial crisis. The CBO's central projections assume that the US will experience a continuous and sustained economic growth over the next decade, but this is an optimistic assumption. If the economy were to experience a recession, the US finances would be severely impacted, with a significant increase in debt and interest payments. Some experts, such as Chris Marsh from Exante Data, warn that if the yield curve does not return to its natural state, the US could face a severe financial crisis, with the federal debt rising to 125% of the GDP by 2034 and interest payments reaching 30% of the government's revenues.

**Elon Musk Pushes for Autonomous Vehicle Legislation in the US**
Despite stepping down as a presidential advisor to Donald Trump and head of the 'Department of Government Efficiency', Elon Musk is still a major player in Washington's decision-making circles. According to a report by Bloomberg, citing informed sources, Musk is directly communicating with several members of the US Congress to push for legislation related to autonomous vehicles. Musk's efforts are focused on supporting the 'Autonomous Vehicle Acceleration Act' bill, which aims to pave the way for widespread use of self-driving cars in the US by removing current legislative and regulatory barriers. Musk has bet heavily on Tesla's future through the development of artificial intelligence, robots, and autonomous vehicles. He has linked the company's market value to its ability to reach commercial maturity in this field. Tesla is expected to launch a small, local robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in July, using 'geofencing' technology that restricts the vehicle's movement within a specific area. The company also has a future plan to produce fully electric, self-driving cars called Cybercabs, which will not have a steering wheel or pedals. However, these ambitious plans are hindered by the lack of a clear federal regulatory framework in the US that allows for the widespread use of this type of vehicle. Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) shows that 80% of accidents related to autonomous vehicles have been caused by unexpected human intervention or software glitches, highlighting the need for flexible yet strict regulation. McKinsey & Company estimates that the autonomous vehicle market could reach over $300 billion by 2035, and is expected to revolutionize transportation, logistics, and urban mobility. This could put the US at a disadvantage compared to countries like China and South Korea, which have made significant strides in developing regulatory frameworks and testing these technologies. Musk believes that delaying federal legislation could put the US at a loss of global leadership and affect Tesla's chances of dominating the future competitive market.

**Trump wants to maintain nuclear predominance**
US President Donald Trump announced his goal to quadruple the country's nuclear energy capacity by 2050. This decision is consistent with his aim to maintain the US's leading position in key areas and to give a strategy to the private sector. Trump ordered the Department of Energy to accelerate the construction of ten large reactors by 2030 and to contribute to the modernization of existing reactors. The executive order includes four decrees, which insist that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a 'culture excessively averse to risk' that establishes that nuclear facilities produce the lowest number of emissions, even below natural ones. According to Michael Katsios, Director of Scientific and Technological Policy of the Presidency, the executive orders will launch a 'nuclear renaissance in the United States' and will allow 'great innovators and entrepreneurs in the United States to overcome obstacles' in nuclear technology. The four executive orders are related to two areas of government: energy and defense. They allow the construction of nuclear reactors on federal land, reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and increase uranium mining and enrichment in the United States. Trump also signed an order to reinstall 'science with gold standards' in a moment when the government has cut billions of dollars in federal subsidies for scientific research and has reduced the staff of federal agencies focused on science. 'Today we sign important decrees that will make us the true force of this industry, which is enormous,' Trump said in the presentation of the executive orders. The Nuclear Energy Office has a budget cut of $400 million, but this is compensated by the increase of other items. According to the Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, the 'excess of regulation' will be reduced and the investment of risk capital in the industry will be encouraged, allowing 'to win the war of artificial intelligence with China.'

**Ex-Obama adviser Van Jones calls Biden’s ‘massive cover-up’ a ‘crime against this republic’**
Van Jones, a former Obama adviser, has called President Joe Biden's 'massive cover-up' a 'crime against this republic.' Jones expressed his shock and outrage at the lengths Biden's allies went to conceal his decline, as described in the upcoming book 'Original Sin' by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. Jones stated, 'I was shocked to see his condition when he came out, and so was the world.' He added that the book makes it clear that there are people who knew about Biden's condition and said nothing, which he believes is a crime. Jones also emphasized the need for the Democratic Party to do deeper soul-searching and confront hard truths about their loss in 2024. He compared the current situation to the Democrats' defeat in 2004, saying, 'We need to look in the mirror, reorganize ourselves, get bad people and bad ideas out of the way, and then we will be able to come forward in the midterm.' David Axelrod, a prominent Democratic strategist, countered Jones' claims, stating that Biden's chances of winning a rematch against Trump were 'preposterous' and that he was being misled by his top political aide, Mike Donilon.

**Alex Jones Thinks Trump Has Gone Too Far**
Alex Jones, a vocal supporter of Donald Trump, has expressed concerns about the Trump administration's authoritarian tendencies. During a recent episode of The Alex Jones Show, Jones and his guest, Nick Fuentes, discussed the administration's actions, including the proposal to deport American citizens to Salvadoran prisons, which Jones called 'unconstitutional and really bad.' Fuentes agreed that the proposal was a threat, but also expressed skepticism about its legitimacy. The conversation highlights the growing unease among some Trump supporters about the administration's radical policies, including the use of federal police power, the targeting of judges, and the expansion of police departments. Jones' comments also suggest that he may be questioning his allegiance to Trump, who he has previously celebrated as a champion of populist conservatism.

**Trudeau aiming to secure extension to 2031 for signature $10-a-day child-care program**
The federal government is trying to secure extensions through to 2031 for its national $10-a-day child-care program, but is facing opposition from Alberta and Saskatchewan. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that 11 provinces and territories have agreed to extend the deals, but Alberta's Jobs, Economy and Trade Minister Matt Jones said the program is underfunded and the province will not agree to an extension. Ontario has an agreement in principle with the federal government, but wants more discussions on increasing funding and flexibility. Trudeau said, 'In the past few weeks, we've been working with our provincial and territorial partners to make sure that families can rely on this system, not just for years to come, but will allow this system to lock in, to become something that no government a year from now, five years from now, 20 years from now, could ever go back on.' Alberta's Jones said, 'As the extension proposed by the federal government does nothing to address these concerns and those of parents and providers, Alberta will instead work in good faith with the next federal government to structure a viable, fair and sustainable agreement.' Ontario's Education Minister Jill Dunlop said, 'I am willing to take the agreement extensions forward for government decision with the intention of finalizing the extensions promptly.' The extensions will see the funding increase by three per cent per year for the four years of extensions, at a cost of $36.8 billion.

**Senators Ask, Can Territory Lose Billions?**
Senators expressed concerns about the potential loss of billions of dollars in disaster relief funding due to President Trump's executive orders to slash federal spending. Adrienne Williams-Octalien, director of the Office of Disaster Recovery, stated that the territory's progress in rebuilding schools, hospitals, and utility infrastructure is crucial to avoid deobligation of funds. She also mentioned the cutting of staff at federal agencies, which could lead to delayed payments. The Virgin Islands government has already felt the effects of Trump's actions, with delayed hospital projects and a lack of workforce, rising costs, and supply chain constraints. Williams-Octalien emphasized the need to spend $2 billion each year to meet the 2035 deadline, and the Biden-Harris Administration's reduction in the local match requirement has made the task more attainable. Eugene Jones Jr., executive director of the Housing Finance Authority, testified that the authority had spent $315 million of the $1.1 billion in disaster relief community block grant allocated to it. Senators questioned the authority's decision to let a program go to the Office of Disaster Recovery, citing housing as HFA's mission.

**Federal Documents Prove Obama Ordered the Creation of COVID-19 in 2015**
Tom Renz and Alex Jones discuss the origins of COVID-19, claiming that it was created in 2015 by the US government and that the mRNA vaccines caused cancer. They reference a 2015 journal article in Nature, 'A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence', and a 2006 FDA document that warns of the risks of mRNA gene therapy. They also mention Bill Gates' threat to release a new virus if Trump continues to investigate USAID. Renz claims that the government has bioweapons ready and is planning to use them to control the population. Jones mentions that the head of Moderna, Stéphane Bancel, admitted to having the vaccine on the shelf since 2019. They also discuss the CIA's involvement in the creation of COVID-19 and the fact that the vaccines were likely sitting on a shelf since 2015. Renz offers to volunteer his services to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the pandemic, calling for a Nuremberg 2.0.

**Alberta MLA says federal child care funding unsustainable**
Alberta MLA Matt Jones has stated that child care funding in the province is unsustainable without increased funding and flexibility from the federal government. Jones estimates a $5 billion funding shortfall by fiscal 2030/31 and has called for a fully income-tested system where child care is most affordable for low-income families. The current federal proposal for a three percent increase in funding beginning in 2027/28 is deemed insufficient by Jones. In response, Geneviève Lemaire, press secretary for Minister Sudds, said the federal government is offering certainty by extending agreements and delivering more funding to keep building and growing the system. Lemaire also stated that non-profit child care spaces provide higher quality care due to reinvestment of funds, likening it to the privatization of healthcare.
