**High-Priced Rentals on the Rise in Seoul Metropolitan Area**
The Seoul metropolitan area is experiencing a rapid increase in high-priced rentals, with the proportion of rent transactions exceeding 60% of the total housing transactions. According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's 'April Housing Statistics', the proportion of rent transactions in the country reached 60.4% this year. In particular, the Seoul metropolitan area showed a high proportion of rent transactions, with 63.6% in Seoul and 59.3% in the metropolitan area. The proportion of apartment rent transactions also increased from 43.4% last year to 44.5% this year. High-priced rent transactions of over 500 million KRW are also on the rise, with 366 transactions in Seoul from January to May this year. For example, a 84㎡ apartment in the '래미안 원베일리' complex in Seocho-gu, Seoul, was rented for 600 million KRW per month with a deposit of 8 billion KRW in May. Additionally, a 84㎡ apartment in the '서울숲트리마제' complex in Jongno-gu, Seoul, was rented for 1.1 billion KRW per month with a deposit of 1 billion KRW in May. Industry insiders predict that if interest rates are lowered rapidly after the election, the trend of renting out apartments for high prices will continue to worsen. As a result, people may increasingly turn to renting out apartments as a form of investment, rather than saving in bank deposits.

**Mexico's Rental Market Faces Desacceleration Due to High Prices and Limited Offer**
The rental market in Mexico is expected to slow down in 2025 due to high prices, limited availability of new properties, and inflation. According to Juan David Vargas, general manager of Propiedades.com, the number of properties available for rent has decreased, despite increased demand. Vargas stated, 'The first quarter has shown a progressive decrease in inventory, which is associated with the pressure on the low inventory of properties for sale and the high costs, where the rental inventory is moving as a great opportunity.' However, he noted that the prices at which properties are being sold are also discouraging the relationship between supply and demand. 'While in 2024 we saw an increase of around 10 or 15 percent in the first quarter compared to 2023, in 2025 that growth is between 5 and 10 percent, even what we estimate is that by the end of the year, the growth in the available rental inventory will be the same as the previous year, and there we could be seeing how the impact of high prices consolidates on the availability of supply,' he said. Experts agree that the average rental prices in the country have increased by 5-6 percent in the first months of the year, but in CDMX, Guadalajara, and Monterrey, as well as tourist areas, they have grown up to double digits.

**Rental prices see start of 'summer surge': Goodlord**
Rental prices in England have seen a 1% increase in May, with the average rent for a new tenancy rising to £1,226, according to the Index. This is the highest average rent recorded since October 2024. The North East saw the most notable increase, with rents rising by 2.2%, followed by the East Midlands, where costs climbed by 1.8%. The South West was the only region to report a decline, with average rents falling by 0.6%. Compared to the same time last year, average rents in May were 3.7% higher. However, the annual rate of rent inflation appears to be slowing, with May's 3.7% year-on-year increase down from 4.2% in April and 4.6% in March. Goodlord's data suggests that the pace of growth may be moderating, and while rents are still expected to climb this summer, the rate of growth may be slowing down. 'This latest uptick could signal the start of the seasonal “summer surge,” with further price hikes expected in the coming months,' said Goodlord. Void periods remained steady throughout May, with an average of 21 days. Regionally, the picture was mixed, with voids shortening in some areas and lengthening in others.

**Top Workplaces 2025: 3 dynamic trends reshaping Colorado's real estate market**
Colorado real estate companies anticipate a challenging year ahead, with high interest rates, stagnant market, and agent departures. Despite the National Association of Realtors' court settlement, which aimed to lower commissions, Denver-area real estate companies report few changes. New Home Star Market Strategist Dan White suggests that real estate companies can maintain agent pay by increasing fees. The median home sale price in the Denver metro was $599,000 in March, down 3.9% from its April 2022 peak. Experienced agents, like those at Madison & Co. Properties, are well-positioned to thrive in the current market. Real estate companies need to provide support to their agents, said New Home Star market director Chris Laskowski. Colorado real estate companies anticipate more shakeups in their industry, including agency closures and mergers, due to the increasing prevalence of homebuyers using internet listing sites like Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.com.

**Rent Increases in May 2025: What You Need to Know**
Rent increases are expected in May 2025, according to the adjustment index used in contracts. The increases will vary depending on the type of contract. For those who signed contracts in May 2023 under the old law, the second and final annual adjustment will be 95.24% interannual, lower than the 116.85% applied in April. This is the first time in three years that the adjustment by this index is below 100%. For example, a rent of $400,000 will increase to $780,952, and a rent of $600,000 will increase to $1,171,440. The adjustment index is published daily, so the exact increase depends on the date of the contract within the month. Additionally, contracts signed between October and December 2023 will have a semi-annual adjustment of 56.7%, and contracts signed after the law was repealed will have a quarterly or semi-annual adjustment tied to the Consumer Price Index (IPC). For example, a rent of $500,000 will increase to $557,525, and a rent of $800,000 will increase to $892,040.

**Rent Increases in May: Experts Predict Significant Hikes**
According to experts from the Colegio Profesional Inmobiliario (CPI) and the Foro Profesional Inmobiliario (FPI), the upcoming rent increases in May will be as follows: 95% for those with annual updates, 21.7% for those with semi-annual updates, 12.1% for those with quarterly updates, and 8.3% for those with monthly updates. Despite the significant increase, 'the prices of rental housing are decreasing in real terms', as stated by the CPI. This is due to the fact that the rent increases are below the inflation rate, with an average decrease of 36.3% from January 2024 to February 2025. 'In some contracts, we can already see decreases in nominal values of locative values. We observe counter-offers from tenants, which are increasingly accepted by landlords', as stated in the March 2025 report.

**Apartments vs. eggs: Inflation rising in metro Denver this year despite falling rents**
Inflation in metro Denver rose 0.2% between November and January, pushing the annual increase to 2.3%. This is lower than the national average of 3% annual gain. Energy prices were down 1.1% in the past two months and 2.5% on the year, while housing costs, which have a heavy weighting in the Consumer Price Index, contributed to the region's below-average inflation rate. Rents are down 0.7% in the past two months and 0.2% over the past year. However, food prices, particularly eggs, are driving the increase in inflation. Nationally, egg prices rose at a 53% annual pace in January, and Colorado's stricter rules on cage-free facilities may be adding to costs. Restaurants are also struggling to keep prices in check, with inflation for dining out up 5.8% the past year in metro Denver.
