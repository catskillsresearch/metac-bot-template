**Hopkins welcomes admitted transfer students for the fall semester**
Johns Hopkins University has welcomed 92 transfer students to the Class of 2029. These students, who were offered admission on May 9, bring a range of experiences and perspectives to the university. According to Ellen Chow, dean of Undergraduate Admissions, 'Transfer students bring distinctive viewpoints to our campus, thanks to their self-motivation, communal focus, and prior college experience.' The admitted students include an intern researching youth activism, a nonprofit founder, and a veteran who developed a tool to determine potential locations for offshore wind farms. They have presented their research, worked part-time, and advocated for causes in their communities. Chow says, 'We've observed through their applications that these students share our values at Hopkins,' and 'We eagerly anticipate their arrival this fall and the many contributions they will make to our community.'

**Harvard vs. Trump: The Battle for Academic Freedom**
Harvard University has taken a stand against the Trump administration's demands, which include giving the government control over student admissions and faculty appointments. The university has filed a lawsuit against the government, citing the First Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits racial discrimination. Harvard is also engaging in lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill and has redesigned its website to showcase its achievements and innovations, including medical breakthroughs and the development of the first quantum computer. The university has also enlisted the help of Elmo from Sesame Street to promote its message. Trump has responded by calling Harvard a 'joke' and accusing it of teaching 'hate and stupidity' and supporting terrorism. The university's website now features a section highlighting its contributions to everyday life, such as the invention of the golf tee and the development of the first business school in the US. Harvard is facing a crisis of declining public trust, with only 36% of Americans trusting universities in 2024, down from 57% in 2015. The university has taken steps to address this issue, including offering free tuition to students from families earning less than $200,000 and reducing costs for students from families earning less than $100,000. However, the structural problems are deep-seated and will take time to resolve. Trump and his allies have visited elite universities, including Harvard, and have been critical of their liberal and elitist nature. Harvard's lawsuit against the Trump administration is ongoing, with the first hearing scheduled for April 28.

**The Results Are In -- Here Are Ivy League And Top College Admissions Rates For The Class Of 2029**
The admissions cycle for the Class of 2029 has revealed significant shifts in institutional priorities, including a renewed emphasis on standardized testing, interdisciplinarity, and socioeconomic diversity. According to Dr. Rachel Rubin, CEO of Spark Admissions, 'the idea of a 'safety school' has changed dramatically,' with many once-accessible institutions now having acceptance rates in the single digits. Students are flocking to 'new Ivies' like Rice University and NYU, which saw a 13% and 3% increase in applicants, respectively. MIT and Cornell are looking for students who can make unexpected connections between their interests, while standardized test scores are becoming increasingly important. Colleges are also admitting more first-gen applicants, with Amherst College announcing a record-breaking 25% of their incoming freshman class will be first-generation students. Early pathways are becoming more desirable, with around 58% of students applying early action or early decision.

**Ivy League Admit Rates Increase For Class Of 2029 While Applications Generally Fall**
Ivy League universities have seen an increase in acceptance rates for the Class of 2029, while application numbers have generally declined. Yale University accepted 4.59% of applicants, up from 3.7% for the Class of 2028, with 50,227 applicants. Columbia College accepted 4.29% of applicants, up from 3.86% for the Class of 2028, with 59,616 applicants. Brown University accepted 5.65% of students, up from 5.4% for the Class of 2028, with 42,765 applications. Dartmouth announced an admission rate of 6%, higher than the record-low 5.3% for the Class of 2028, with 28,230 applicants. These shifts highlight the evolving landscape of post-pandemic college admissions, shaped by the return of standardized testing, a projected decline in the youth population, and changing institutional priorities. As concerns over the cost of a college degree grow, students are placing greater emphasis on gaining employability skills and securing a job after graduation when selecting schools. 'These shifts highlight the evolving landscape of post-pandemic college admissions,' said Forbes contributors. 'Students are placing greater emphasis on gaining employability skills and securing a job after graduation when selecting schools.'

**Yale admits 4.59 percent of applicants, marking slight uptick in acceptance rate**
Yale College admitted 2,308 applications from a pool of 50,227 to the class of 2029, marking a slight uptick in acceptance rate to 4.59%.

The class of 2029 will also be joined by 38 students who postponed their matriculation for one year. Admitted students will be invited to visit campus for Bulldog Days in April and have until May 1 to respond to their offer of admission.

**Harvard Expands Financial Aid Eligibility to Include Low-Income Families**
Harvard University has expanded its financial aid eligibility to include families with a monthly income of less than $13,000. According to Harvard's website, the average annual tuition for undergraduate students is $57,000, with additional fees exceeding $82,000. Previously, Harvard waived tuition for students from families with an annual income of less than $85,000. Harvard President Alan Garber stated, 'By making Harvard more accessible to more people, we can provide students with a broader range of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, which will help foster their intellectual and personal growth.' The new policy will take effect in the 2025-2026 academic year. This move comes as universities face pressure to find new ways to attract students from diverse backgrounds, following President Trump's January call to end 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' admissions practices. MIT and the University of Pennsylvania have also announced similar policies, waiving tuition for students from families with an annual income of $200,000 or less.

**Harvard Offers Free Tuition To Students Despite Claiming To Be Cash-Strapped**
Harvard University has announced that it will offer free tuition to all undergraduate students whose families make less than $200,000 per year, despite previously claiming to be financially strapped. The move will take effect in the 2025-26 academic year and also includes free food, housing, health insurance, and travel costs for students from families making less than $100,000 per year. According to Harvard president Alan Garber, 'Putting Harvard within financial reach for more individuals widens the array of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives that all of our students encounter, fostering their intellectual and personal growth.' Harvard has an endowment of over $53 billion and rakes in approximately $1.4 billion annually from student costs. The decision may be related to a nearly 5% decrease in applicants in 2024, as well as the Department of Education's crackdown on schools using race as a factor in admission decisions.

**Harvard is going tuition-free for families making up to $200,000**
Harvard University is making significant changes to its financial aid policy, making undergraduate admission tuition-free for families making up to $200,000 and completely free for families making up to $100,000. According to Harvard, 86% of U.S. families could be eligible for financial help under the new system. This move is part of a trend among selective universities to make their financial aid more generous, with schools such as Stanford, Princeton, and the University of Texas system covering tuition for students whose families earn close to or above six-figure salaries. As Harvard President Jake Kaufmann said, 'The goal is to remove the ability to pay from the factors an admitted student will weigh when deciding whether to attend.'
