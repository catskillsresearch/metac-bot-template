**Unidos por el Agua: 70 Years Transforming Communities with EPM**
EPM has been a driving force for development in Antioquia for 70 years, especially for families who previously lacked basic services like water and sewage. The 'Unidos por el Agua' program, in alliance with the Medellín district, aims to bring sustainable water and sanitation solutions to historically marginalized sectors. Mónica Mercedes García, president of the San José de la Cima II community, said, 'Before, we had to boil the water because it was dirty. Now we have elevated networks, and although there was initial concern, we all see the great progress it brought.' Between January 2024 and February 2025, over 7,000 families from strata 1, 2, and 3 have been benefited by the program, which not only installs water and sewage networks but also promotes the responsible use of water. The new systems have improved safety, cleanliness, health, and quality of life for the communities.

**Belarus to Involve 415,000 Hectares of Land in Agricultural Circulation after Melioration**
According to Sergey Nazaruk, the head of the department of melioration and radiology at the Ministry of Agriculture and Food of Belarus, the current five-year program will help to involve around 415,000 hectares of land in agricultural circulation after melioration. This includes 240,000 hectares after the reconstruction of meliorative systems and 175,000 hectares after the implementation of cultural-technical melioration. The changing climate has led to an increase in cases of water deficiency in the soil, requiring the activation of works to restore the effective use of drainage and irrigation systems, as well as the implementation of measures to accumulate water reserves and targeted use of reservoirs. Nazaruk noted that the main task for meliorators now is to maximize the service life of systems. Belarus has achieved certain successes in meliorative construction. In the 90s, from 1995 to 2000, measures were taken to correct the situation, and from 2000 to 2020, four five-year programs were implemented in this area. Nazaruk emphasized that work continues in this direction, and today, within the framework of the sub-program 'Development of melioration of agricultural land' of the state program 'Agricultural Business', the implementation of the current five-year program (2021-2025) will contribute to the involvement of around 415,000 hectares of land in agricultural circulation after melioration, including 240,000 hectares after the reconstruction of meliorative systems and 175,000 hectares after the implementation of cultural-technical melioration.

**Israel warns Hamas of annihilation as Trump says ceasefire 'very close'**
As ceasefire talks stall, Israel warns Hamas of annihilation if they do not accept a hostage deal, while the UN accuses Israel of using starvation as a weapon. The conflict in Gaza has resulted in over 70 deaths and 270 injuries in just 24 hours, with over 54,000 Palestinians killed since the war began. Meanwhile, India has developed a game-changing intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) called Agni-V, capable of hitting targets in Asia, Europe, and parts of Africa in minutes. The missile features a solid-fuel, three-stage system, ensuring rapid launch readiness and superior reliability, and has a range of up to 8,000 km. As tensions rise in global geopolitics, Agni-V positions India alongside major nuclear powers like the U.S., Russia, and China, cementing its strategic defense capabilities and global influence.

**I Don't Think I Need To Worry About AGI, but Somebody Should**
The author is not concerned about the threat of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) killing humans, citing the long time it will take to develop humanoid robots that can surpass human capabilities. However, they do express concern about the current state of AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), which are taking jobs and may have unintended consequences. The author notes that even if we were to replicate the human brain's structure, the latency issues with cloud-based data centers would make it difficult for robots to match human-like performance in tasks such as obstacle avoidance and grasping objects. According to the author's chat with ChatGPT, replicating the human brain's structure would require significant hardware, and even then, latency issues would be a major challenge.

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**What is AGI? The Concept of Artificial General Intelligence**
AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) refers to artificial intelligence that can perform a wide range of tasks like humans. The concept of AGI was popularized by computer scientists Ben Goertzel and others around 2005. According to OpenAI, AGI is defined as 'a highly autonomous system that can surpass human capabilities in economically valuable work.' Researchers and entrepreneurs have differing opinions on when AGI will be achieved, with Demis Hassabis, founder of DeepMind, predicting it will be achieved by 2058, and Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, predicting it could be achieved as early as 2031. If AGI is achieved, it is expected to develop new AI systems, take over human tasks in various fields such as material development, pharmaceuticals, and climate change mitigation, and potentially replace human jobs. There is also a concern that AGI could be used for military purposes.

**Anthropic CEO Predicts Technological Singularity in Six Months**
According to the CEO of Anthropic, the human race is only six months away from reaching technological singularity, a concept where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. This prediction contrasts with the most conservative scientific estimates, but reflects the unprecedented acceleration in the development of artificial intelligence since the emergence of models like ChatGPT. The study by AIMultiple, which examines 8,590 predictions from scientists, business leaders, and the tech community, reveals that expectations about the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and singularity have changed dramatically in recent years. While scientists predict AGI around 2040, business leaders are more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The study documents how predictions vary over a nearly 50-year spectrum, from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to estimates that extend several decades. However, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, with industry leaders consistently more optimistic in their predictions than the scientific community in general. The study examines different thresholds of AI, including AGI and superintelligence, providing a comprehensive view of expectations in the field. The research tracks changes in these predictions over time, especially after the emergence of large language models that have transformed the landscape. The analysis offers several perspectives on why many experts consider the arrival of AGI inevitable, including the lack of apparent limits to machine intelligence, the Law of Moore, and the potential of quantum computing to compensate for engineering barriers. Not all experts consider AGI a certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is more multifaceted than the current definition of AGI. Yann LeCun, a pioneer of deep learning, suggests that AGI should be rebranded as 'advanced machine intelligence' and argues that human intelligence is too specialized to be replicable. The report also notes that, although AI can be a valuable tool for making new discoveries, it cannot make these discoveries on its own. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, allowing for more discoveries per experiment,' the analysis details. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer,' the document obtained by AIMultiple states. While individual predictions from experts and scientists about AGI vary over a period of approximately half a century, the message is clear: human society will inevitably face incredible changes as a result of these algorithms. Whether these changes will be good or bad, according to the research, depends on us.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment,' the report reads.

**Anthropic CEO says AI will kill half of white collar entry-level jobs for Gen Z**
Bill Gates predicts that AI will replace humans in most white-collar jobs, including biology, energy, and software development fields, within the next 20 years. According to Anthropic's CEO, there is a 99.999999% probability that AI could end humanity. Gates emphasizes the importance of being honest about the impact of AI technology, stating, 'We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming.' AI is already affecting entry-level jobs, with some experts warning that it could lead to a significant disruption in the job market. OpenAI, however, does not believe that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is a significant threat. Gates notes that it is not just personal security and privacy that are concerns, but also job security, saying, 'Now it is our office workers who are staring down the same kind of technological and economic disruption. Breaking first is the bottom rung of the career ladder.'

**To the winner of the Artificial Generative Intelligence race goes … EVERYTHING! * WorldNetDaily * by James Lacey, Real Clear Wire**
The development of Artificial Generative Intelligence (AGI) will have a profound impact on the world economy and military capabilities. AGI will be able to rewrite its own code and scale its cognitive capacity at speeds that will leave slow-footed rivals in the dust. According to James Lacey, 'there is no silver medal—only a collection of also-rans falling increasingly far behind.' AGI will compress the journey of industrial growth into a mortgage cycle, with capital formation doubling every seven years at ten-percent growth. This will lead to significant economic growth, with the United States reaching $285 trillion by 2050 and erasing annual deficits within five years. However, the article also warns of the risks of AGI-powered agentic warfare, where an AI-agent would control thousands of drones and have significant military advantages against an opponent. Lacey notes that 'any nation that obtains and keeps an agentic advantage will have the same military advantages against an opponent as the United States possessed during Desert Storm.' The article concludes that the development of AGI will lead to a 'third offset' in military capabilities, where the technological difference may seem 'godlike and unfathomable.'

**An A.I. Fooled Humans and Passed the Turing Test. But It's a Red Herring for the Singularity.**
A recent study found that GPT-4.5, a large language model (LLM), was able to fool humans into thinking it was a human 73% of the time in a Turing test. However, this achievement is not a sign of the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), but rather a demonstration of how easily humans can be fooled. The study's authors noted that the LLM's success was due in part to its ability to adopt a 'humanlike persona,' which included using internet shorthand and socially-awkward responses. Cameron Jones, a co-author of the study, said that this type of test is the 'most widely accepted standard' version of the Turing test. However, some experts argue that the Turing test is no longer a relevant measure of AI capabilities, and that it has been 'inverted' to become a test of human discernment. John Nosta, founder of NostaLab, wrote that humans are increasingly evaluating each other based on emotions and feelings rather than cognitive substance, and that LLMs can exploit this weakness with uncanny accuracy. The study's findings have implications for the potential social and economic impacts of LLMs, including the automation of jobs and improved social engineering attacks.

**How Close Are We to AGI?**
The development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a topic of ongoing debate, with some researchers predicting its emergence by 2029, while others suggest it may take another 50 years or never happen at all. AGI would require immense processing capabilities, far beyond what we currently have, and would need to be able to continuously learn from its experiences, adapting in real-time as a human would. Despite advancements in AI, such as models capable of generating text and images, today's AI is still far from true general intelligence. It lacks true awareness, the ability to form independent thoughts, and struggles with adaptability, memory, and reasoning. Several challenges remain, including who controls AGI, how to ensure it aligns with human values, and what happens if AGI develops its own moral compass that doesn't align with ours. Researchers are exploring several key developments that could bring us closer to AGI, including neurosymbolic AI, better training models, and quantum computing. However, the path forward is filled with uncertainties, and the pursuit of AGI will continue to challenge our understanding of intelligence, ethics, and the future of humanity.

**DeepMind CEO predicts human-level AI within a decade**
Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, predicts that human-level AI will be achieved within the next five to 10 years. Hassabis, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry last year for developing the AI 'AlphaFold', said that AI functions will start coming to the fore in the next five to ten years and advancing to 'artificial general intelligence (AGI)'. AGI is a system that can perform all complex tasks that humans can. Hassabis emphasized that the main challenge with achieving artificial general intelligence is getting today's AI systems to understand the context from the real world. He also noted that artificial superintelligence (ASI) comes after AGI surpassing human intelligence, and no one knows when such disruption will happen. Hassabis's prediction is somewhat later than those of other big tech giants, including Elon Musk, who predicted AGI technology could be developed by 2026, and Dario Amodei, who predicted that AI could outsmart humans in most tasks within the next two to three years. 'It could be developed in the relatively near future,' said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, referring to the time frame specified by Hassabis of within five years at the earliest. 'A considerable amount of research is needed to reach the goal (AGI),' Hassabis said. 'I think today's systems are very passive, but there's still a lot of things they can't do. We've still got quite a lot of research work to do,' Hassabis added. 'AGI is a system that can perform all complex tasks that humans can. Current AI systems are still passive and cannot do many things, so they have not reached the AGI stage,' Hassabis said. 'ASI comes after AGI surpassing human intelligence. No one knows when such disruption will happen,' Hassabis said. 'I think today's systems are very passive, but there's still a lot of things they can't do.

**Google DeepMind CEO Predicts Development of Artificial General Intelligence within Five to Ten Years**
Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, believes that a strong Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will be developed within the next five to ten years. He is confident that AGI, which can demonstrate all the complex abilities of humans, will be created. Hassabis defines AGI as 'a system that can exhibit all the complex capabilities that are present in humans.' He thinks that current systems are very passive and lack many abilities, but he believes that in the next five to ten years, many of these abilities will become apparent, and we will start moving towards what we call Artificial General Intelligence. Hassabis is not alone in his opinion, as other experts, such as Robin Li, the CEO of Baidu, have also predicted the development of AGI within the next decade. However, some of his colleagues, like Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, are more optimistic, predicting that a model of AI that is 'better than almost all people, almost in all tasks' will appear in the 'next two to three years.' Hassabis also predicts that after the emergence of AGI, Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) will follow, which will surpass humans in all areas of activity. However, he notes that 'nobody really knows' when this breakthrough will occur. According to Hassabis, the main challenge in creating AGI is to bring modern AI systems to the level of understanding the context of the real world. 'The question is how quickly we can generalize ideas of planning and agent behavior, planning and reasoning, and then apply them to the real world, complementing them with things like world models that can understand the reality around us,' he explained. Hassabis also notes that researchers are increasingly focusing on so-called multi-agent systems of artificial intelligence. As an example, he cited the DeepMind's research on training AI agents to play the game Starcraft: 'We've done a lot of work on this, for example, in the Starcraft project, where we had a community of agents or a league of agents that could both compete and cooperate.'

**AGI still a long way off, academics in China have calculated**
Researchers from Tsinghua University and Renmin University of China have proposed a new method called the Survival Game to assess Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Instead of the Turing Test, the Survival Game evaluates AI models' ability to find solutions through continuous trial and error. According to Jingtao Zhan, a PhD student in computer science at Tsinghua University, 'If an AI system can find a solution within a limited number of attempts, it is considered to 'survive'; otherwise, it 'goes extinct.' The Survival Game covers various knowledge domains, including image classification, question answering, and mathematics. The researchers' results suggest that even if Moore's Law were to continue, the cost to build a neural network capable of passing the above AGI tests would be exorbitant and it would take 70 years for hardware to be able to support the anticipated model. Zhan argues that these results indicate AI technology has a long way to go before it can autonomously solve unknown problems, particularly in an open environment where it must adapt through natural selection. 'While current AI systems may perform well in certain benchmarks, achieving high accuracy in predefined tasks, they struggle significantly when faced with problems that require continuous trial and error to find solutions,' said Zhan.
