**"Not with a bang, but a whimper": Experts say charging NJ Democrat will backfire on Trump DOJ**
Rep. LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat, has been charged with two counts of assaulting, resisting and impeding an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. The charges were announced by U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, who previously served as President Donald Trump's personal lawyer. McIver's office and the Justice Department have not commented on the charges. McIver has denied the charges, saying they are 'purely political' and 'meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight.' Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani said that while the alleged offense does 'fit within the four corners of the law,' the prosecution may be an overreach. A group of 10 former Republican members of Congress have 'unequivocally rejected' the charges against McIver, saying she was present at the ICE facility as part of her official congressional duties. McIver's prosecution has raised concerns about the separation of powers and the government's use of selective prosecution. 'I think it's overreach,' Rahmani said. 'It's political intimidation, and I will not be intimidated,' McIver told CNN. 'We've seen this administration come after and attack leaders for doing their jobs,' she added. 'It's not something that you typically see and, historically, there would be an exercise of prosecutorial discretion, not making a federal case out of something relatively minor,' Rahmani said. McIver also has a 'pretty strong defense' in that she was conducting a legitimate oversight duty at the time of the altercation, Rahmani added. 'It is a felony if there's any physical contact,' Rahmani said. 'I think the Justice Department has earned the opposite of the benefit of the doubt,' said Barbara McQuade, a law professor at the University of Michigan and former federal prosecutor. 'It is cast with doubt, and that is because we have heard people like the head of the FBI, Kash Patel, and the president himself talk about how they're going to seek retribution and going to go after their rivals and their enemies.'

**US Department of Justice Files Charges in Fatal Shooting of Israeli Embassy Employees**
The US Department of Justice has filed charges against Elías Rodríguez, a 31-year-old man from Chicago, for his involvement in the fatal shooting of two employees of the Israeli Embassy in the country. The incident occurred on Wednesday night in a context of growing tension in the Middle East. Rodríguez has been identified as the main suspect by the police. Former US President Donald Trump reacted to the news on his Truth Social account, emphasizing the need to end antisemitism immediately. He wrote, 'These horrible murders in D.C., based on obvious antisemitism, must end NOW! Hate and radicalism have no place in the United States.' The tension in the Jewish community has increased due to the recent escalation in the Israel-Palestina conflict, which began on October 7, 2023. This resurgence of the conflict has sparked growing discontent towards US policy in the region, which may be influencing the current social and political climate. The implications of this shooting go beyond the tragic events that occurred and highlight a problem that deserves attention, as hate and violence can arise at any moment and affect entire communities in the country.

**JUST IN: Trump DOJ Charges Woman Who Spit On Top Official**
Emily Gabriella Sommer, 32, has been federally charged with assault by the Trump administration's Justice Department for allegedly spitting on former interim US Attorney Ed Martin during a live TV segment in Washington, DC. According to the criminal complaint, Sommer approached Martin and said, 'Who in the fuck are you?' before spitting on his left shoulder. Martin was unharmed and continued his interview after wiping his face. Sommer later admitted to spitting on Martin in a series of posts on X, stating, 'I only apologize that this city left me so dehydrated and unable to get water that I couldn't produce more to stain and drip down your face.' Sommer could face up to eight years in prison if convicted.

**US Threatens Sanctions Against Brazilian Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes**
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that there is a 'great possibility' of the US government imposing sanctions on Brazilian Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes. This was said during a hearing of the US House of Representatives' Foreign Relations Committee in Washington, which discussed the role of the Department of State and its commitment to protecting American interests. The topic was raised after a direct question from Republican Representative Cory Mills, who expressed concern about what he called the 'deterioration of human rights in Brazil', citing recent episodes of censorship, political persecution, and the threat of imprisonment against former President Jair Bolsonaro. Mills also highlighted that this scenario has exceeded Brazilian borders, affecting citizens in the United States, and mentioned the possibility of sanctions against Moraes based on the Magnitsky Act. Rubio confirmed that the case is being evaluated by the US government, led by President Donald Trump, and emphasized that the application of sanctions is a concrete possibility. The testimony of former Air Force Commander Carlos de Almeida Baptista Júnior in the Supreme Court presented a more severe account of former President Jair Bolsonaro's actions in the alleged 2022 coup attempt, differing from the version presented by former Army Commander Marco Antônio Freire Gomes. The difference in the reconstruction of Bolsonaro's meetings with military leaders did not only concern the account of the threat of imprisonment that Freire Gomes allegedly made to the former president. In his testimony, Baptista Júnior emphasized, in a clearer manner, that Bolsonaro intended to prevent the inauguration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The testimonies are part of the ongoing criminal process against Bolsonaro and seven other defendants accused of attempting a coup in 2022. Freire Gomes and Baptista Júnior were called to testify, under the commitment to tell the truth, by the Attorney General's Office (PGR), which made the denunciation and speaks for the prosecution. 'I started to think that the goal was to prevent the inauguration of the elected president,' said Baptista Júnior, referring to several meetings between Bolsonaro and the military leaders in November 2022. In those occasions, the former president convened the military leaders for 'analysis of the conjuncture' and consulted them about the possibility of declaring a guarantee of law and order operation (GLO).

**Former Judicial Employee Charged with Fraud Against the Public Administration**
The Public Prosecutor's Office has filed charges against a former employee of the Judicial Power of Río Negro for allegedly committing fraud against the Public Administration. According to the prosecution, between June 2022 and January 2025, the woman took leave from her position at the Defensoría cipoleña using labor licenses, while holding remunerated positions in the Municipalidad de San Martín de los Andes and the Obra Social de Petroleros Privados. The prosecutor stated that the accused 'used various licenses to absent herself from her job, with the intention of defrauding the Public Administration', receiving simultaneous remunerations, despite being prohibited from holding positions outside the Judicial Power. The investigation was initiated after detecting irregularities in the administrative headquarters of the Procuración General in Viedma and was supported by official documentation from various organizations, including the Agencia de Recaudación y Control Aduanero, ANSES, and unions. The Superior Tribunal of Justice had already ordered the employee's dismissal in February of this year. Now, the judge of Guarantee has opened the penal investigation for four months to continue with the process. The defense lawyers requested that the hearing be reserved, a request that was partially accepted to protect the personal data of the accused. They also raised the possibility of a suspension of the trial at the request of the State, which will be evaluated after the opinion of the provincial State, in its capacity as victim.

**With polygraphs and probes, Trump administration chases even minor leaks**
The Trump administration is cracking down on leaks to the press, even for unclassified information. According to nine current and former federal government employees, the administration is using lie detector tests and investigations to expose leakers. The employees were told they could be fired if they refuse to take the tests, and some have resigned due to fear of being wrongly accused. The administration is also seeking greater access to journalists' records, with the Justice Department making it easier for prosecutors to subpoena records and testimony from journalists. Critics say leak investigations are a politicized tool to root out perceived disloyalty. 'President Trump has made it clear he will not tolerate federal government employees leaking to the fake news media,' said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. 'Government employees who spend their time leaking to the media instead of doing the job American taxpayers expect should be held accountable.'

**US Charges Suspect in Shooting Deaths of Israeli Embassy Staff**
The US Department of Justice has charged a suspect in the shooting deaths of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, D.C. with murder of a foreign official and other crimes. According to the prosecutor, more charges may be added as the investigation continues to be treated as a hate crime and terrorist attack against the Jewish community. US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jenena Piro said, 'Anti-Semitism is absolutely intolerable, and in the nation's capital, it is zero tolerance.' The victims were shot and killed on May 21 near the Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The suspect, 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, Illinois, has been arrested. US President Trump tweeted, 'The horrific killings in Washington are clearly based on anti-Semitism and must end.' Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said, 'Harming diplomats has crossed a red line.'

**House committee chairs threaten to subpoena ActBlue officials**
Top officials with Democrat fund-raising platform ActBlue face being subpoenaed if they don't voluntarily agree to interviews with House committees investigating allegations it accepted fraudulent and foreign donations during last year's presidential campaign. According to a letter sent to an attorney representing current and former ActBlue officials by U.S. House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, House Oversight Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., and House Administration Chairman Bryan Steil, R-Wis., several witnesses initially agreed to interviews but later backed out after President Donald Trump ordered the Justice Department to also investigate. 'If they don't voluntarily agree to interviews, we will have to consider subpoenaing them,' said Jordan. The House committee chairs are investigating allegations that ActBlue accepted fraudulent and foreign donations during the 2024 presidential campaign. ActBlue officials have been accused of failing to properly vet donors and allowing foreign nationals to contribute to the platform. 'We will not tolerate any attempts to undermine the integrity of our elections,' said Comer. The investigation is ongoing, and the House committee chairs have not yet decided whether to issue subpoenas. 'We will take all necessary steps to ensure that the truth comes to light,' said Steil.

**First Terrorism Indictments Announced Over Drug Cartel Support**
The U.S. Department of Justice has unsealed its first indictment against a foreign national for providing material support to a Mexican drug cartel, the Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), which was recently designated a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) by the U.S. Department of State. Maria Del Rosario Navarro-Sanchez of Mexico is alleged to have facilitated firearms, narcotics, cash, and human trafficking on behalf of CJNG. President Trump declared in a January executive order that 'international cartels constitute a national-security threat beyond that posed by traditional organized crime' and directed federal agencies to implement the terrorism designation against such international criminal organizations. The U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has also issued a Geographic Targeting Order (GTO) directing financial institutions in multiple border towns to file currency transaction reports (CTRs) with FinCEN at a $200 threshold. This is the first of what is anticipated to be many terrorism charges against individuals aiding or abetting a cartel or other foreign criminal enterprise now designated an FTO.

**Trump Orders Investigation of Former Employees Who Criticized Him**
Donald Trump has ordered the Department of Justice to investigate two former employees who criticized him. Miles Taylor, a former high-ranking official in the Department of Homeland Security, and Christopher Krebs, who led Trump's cybersecurity agency, have lost their security clearance after denying Trump's claims of election fraud. Trump has called Taylor a 'traitor' and claimed he is 'guilty of treason'. This is the latest move in what Politico describes as Trump's 'vengeful campaign', where the president uses federal agencies in unusual ways to punish political opponents. 'This is the last nail in the coffin of the Trump administration's abuse of power,' Taylor said on X after the announcement. Taylor wrote an anonymous op-ed criticizing Trump in 2018 and later wrote a book detailing the chaos in the White House. He revealed his identity and supported Biden before the 2020 election. Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday, 'I barely remember him. A guy who went out and wrote a book and said all sorts of terrible things that were lies.' Trump called Taylor a 'traitor' and claimed he was 'guilty of treason.' Krebs was fired by Trump on Twitter in 2020 after he denied the president's claims of election fraud. He was also a key witness for the January 6th committee. This move by Trump is unprecedented, as it blurs the line between the White House and the Department of Justice.

**Trump orders DOJ to investigate former officials for alleged treason and election misconduct   - NaturalNews.com**
President Donald Trump has directed the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate two former administration officials, Christopher Krebs and Miles Taylor, accusing one of them of 'treason.' Krebs, the ex-director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), was fired by Trump in November 2020 after publicly declaring the election 'the most secure in American history.' Trump said of Krebs, 'He's the fraud. He's a disgrace. If it wasn't a safe election, he's got a big price to pay.' Taylor, the former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) chief of staff, was accused of 'illegally' releasing classified information and violating his oath. Trump called Taylor a 'traitor,' adding, 'I think he's guilty of treason.' The move has sparked legal concerns and highlighted unresolved tensions from Trump's presidency, testing democratic norms amid escalating political polarization.

**Opinion - Trump literally wants these 2 men arrested for criticizing him**
President Trump has ordered the prosecution of two former administration officials, Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor, for criticizing him. This move is seen as a threat to the independence of the Justice Department, which is supposed to act independently of the president. Trump's actions are reminiscent of the tactics used by his mentor, Roy Cohn, who would use the law to silence his enemies. The author, James D. Zirin, a former federal prosecutor, warns that this move could be a sign of a larger threat to democracy, and that it is unclear who will speak out in defense of Krebs and Taylor. Zirin notes that Trump's modus operandi is to use lawsuits and criminal prosecutions to silence his opponents, and that this time, he may actually mean it. 'A man is not immune from prosecution just because a United States attorney happens not to like him,' as Robert M. Morgenthau once said. However, Trump's actions suggest that he believes he is above the law, and that his critics are guilty of 'being unpopular with the predominant or governing group, being attached to the wrong political views.'

President Donald Trump has ordered the Department of Justice to investigate two former officials from his first administration, Christopher Krebs and Miles Taylor, for their alleged betrayal of him. Trump believes that Krebs is 'guilty of treason' for his recent statement on the security of the 2020 Election, which Trump claims was 'highly inaccurate.' Krebs has been terminated as Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the DOJ to investigate 'some of the malign acts' Krebs may have participated in. Taylor, who authored an anonymous op-ed and memoir criticizing Trump, has been accused of 'treason' by Trump for leaking classified conversations to sell his book. Taylor has denied that his actions were treasonous, saying 'dissent isn't unlawful.'

Krebs was fired from his post in 2020 after falsely denying that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, while Taylor wrote a book and opinion editorial criticizing the Trump administration. Trump has also targeted law firms that he accused of 'weaponizing the justice system,' including Susman Godfrey, which represented Dominion Voting Systems in its lawsuit against Fox News. Krebs and Taylor have responded to the executive order, with Krebs saying 'Honored to serve. We did it right.

Trump has accused Taylor of 'treason' and has been critical of Krebs' efforts to correct claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election. Taylor, who wrote an anonymous op-ed and a tell-all book, has endorsed former President Joe Biden and launched a group called REPAIR. Krebs, who was Trump's election security director, was fired over Twitter in 2020 after correcting claims of voter fraud. Following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, Krebs said that Trump should be convicted for inciting an insurrection. Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, testified that 'politics will not play a part' in cases investigated or brought by the Justice Department.

**Trump orders probes of two ex-officials, accusing one of 'treason'**
US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to investigate two former officials, Miles Taylor and Christopher Krebs, accusing one of 'treason.' Taylor, a former member of the Department of Homeland Security, wrote an Op-Ed piece in 2018 under the pseudonym 'Anonymous' criticizing Trump. Trump has stripped both officials of their security clearances and is directing the Justice Department to investigate their activities. Taylor has reacted to the news, saying 'Dissent isn't unlawful. It certainly isn't treasonous.' Trump has also accused Krebs of saying the 2020 election was 'great,' despite evidence of corruption. This move is seen as an exceptional step by a US president, as Trump has directed the Justice Department to open investigations into his political opponents.

**Trump orders probe of former cybersecurity chief for declaring 2020 election secure**
President Donald Trump has ordered a federal investigation into two former top Department of Homeland Security officials, Christopher Krebs and Miles Taylor, for saying the 2020 election was secure. Trump revoked their security clearances and instructed the Justice Department to investigate 'malign acts' they participated in while in office. Trump fired Krebs as the nation's top civilian cybersecurity official in November 2020 for being an outspoken defender of the nation's election security apparatus. Trump claimed the 2020 election was 'rigged' and 'a disaster,' despite numerous investigations disproving his allegations. Democrats criticized Trump's actions, saying he was 'attacking government employees for saying things he didn't like.' Krebs was unavailable for comment, but Taylor's office also declined to comment. Krebs had previously said the 2020 election was 'the most secure in the history of our country,' while Taylor had written a critical tell-all book about his time in Trump's administration.
