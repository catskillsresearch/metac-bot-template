**New Study Warns of Early Global Warming Threshold**
A recent study by researchers from the University of Graz suggests that the 1.5°C global warming threshold could be reached as early as 2028, rather than 2030 as previously predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The researchers improved the accuracy of temperature measurements by accounting for the uncertainty above the oceans, which was previously not taken into account. According to their new data, the global temperature has already exceeded 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels in 2024, and could reach 1.62°C by 2028. The researchers call for a new evaluation framework to be established to implement the Paris Agreement, and for the objectives to be clarified, particularly the 'well below 2°C' target. 'It is high time to make these international climate targets truly measurable and verifiable to support urgent climate action on a physically valid basis,' they conclude.

**Are We Still on Track with the Paris Agreement? A New Analysis Raises Concerns**
The world is getting closer to exceeding the +1.5°C global warming limit set by the Paris Agreement in 2015. According to a new analysis by the Wegener Center and Institute of Physics at the University of Graz, Austria, the global temperature could exceed this limit as early as 2028, with a margin of error of plus or minus two years. This is earlier than the predicted timeframe of 2030-2035 by the IPCC. As Dr. Wegener said, 'it's time to reassess our standards for evaluating our adherence to the Paris Agreement.'

**The global temperature may be even higher than we thought**
Researchers have proposed a new method to calculate the global surface air temperature, which suggests that the world is warming faster than previously thought. According to the new dataset, the temperature rise since pre-industrial times is 6% higher than previous estimates, putting us on track to breach the 1.5°C climate goal in 2028 instead of 2030-2035. Gottfried Kirchengast and Moritz Pichler developed a new calculation method to convert global mean surface temperature into a single global surface air temperature, which they say is a more accurate reflection of warming. 'The benchmark record takes the best of conventional temperature datasets and brings in this new refinement,' says Kirchengast. However, Duo Chan argues that GSAT isn't the best metric to use to judge the rate of warming, and Andrew Jarvis emphasizes the need for the scientific community to agree on a single method for judging progress against the Paris targets.

**The global crisis behind America's new nuclear bomb**
The US dropped 'Little Boy', a uranium bomb, on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, killing 245,000 people. The 'Fat Man' plutonium bomb in Nagasaki three days later ended World War II but opened the door to nuclear terrorism. Historian Hobsbawm noted that Hiroshima marked 'the beginning of nuclear blackmail.' The US government initially justified the bombings as a 'humanitarian action to end the war,' but the true motive was to avoid a costly war of attrition on the mainland and demonstrate nuclear deterrence to the Soviet Union.

**Japan Introduces New Regulation to Protect Workers from Extreme Heat**
Japan has introduced a new regulation requiring employers to take sufficient preventive measures to protect workers from extreme heat, or face a fine of up to ¥5 million (approximately NT$103,350). The new rule, which came into effect on June 1, is a rare national-level workplace heat safety policy globally. According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, there were 30 workplace deaths and approximately 1,200 heat-related injuries in Japan last year, with most victims working in construction or manufacturing. The Japanese government stated that after setting a record for the hottest July on record last year, authorities immediately strengthened protective measures. If companies fail to implement the relevant regulations, they may face a maximum fine of ¥5 million. Heatstroke is a disease that can be life-threatening if not treated promptly, and can cause severe damage to organs. According to the World Health Organization's report last year, nearly 500,000 people died globally from heat-related causes between 2000 and 2019. In addition to public health impacts, heat also affects labor productivity, and the economic losses caused by heatwaves have raised concerns among all parties. The World Meteorological Organization pointed out that the global average temperature exceeded the pre-industrial level of 1.5°C for the first time in 2024, and may continue to break heat records in the next five years. The new law requires employers to establish a mechanism to immediately identify and assist workers with heatstroke symptoms. The policy encourages companies to implement workplace buddy systems, distribute wearable monitoring devices, and provide emergency transportation services. Employers are urged to monitor the 'comprehensive temperature heat index' (WBGT), which takes into account factors such as direct sunlight, humidity, and heat pressure. When the WBGT value exceeds 28°C or the temperature reaches 31°C for more than 1 hour, or the daily cumulative time exceeds 4 hours, specific protective measures must be taken. A 2019 International Labour Organization study found that workers performing moderate-intensity work in an environment with a temperature of 33°C to 34°C will see their productivity halve. The report also estimates that if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced, the economic losses caused by heat will reach $2.4 trillion by 2030. Clearwater Construction, a large Japanese contractor, stated, 'We are arranging rest times according to the heat index and monitoring body temperature through wearable devices.' The company, which has over 20,000 employees, emphasized that it will continue to update its heatstroke prevention policies. Yamato Transport, a major logistics company, plans to distribute 75,000 cooling vests with fans to delivery personnel and install 3,000 WBGT measurement devices at its nationwide locations. The company emphasized that these measures are not implemented solely in response to the new law.

**Severe Heatwave Expected to Hit North America, Europe, and Asia**
A severe heatwave is expected to hit North America, Europe, and Asia in the coming months, with temperatures reaching as high as 70°C (158°F) in northern China and the US. The heatwave is a result of climate change, and experts warn of extreme temperatures, droughts, and wildfires. The heatwave is expected to cause power outages, crop failures, and increased energy prices. In the US, around 89 million people are at risk of power outages, and the heatwave is expected to cause losses of up to $200 billion by 2030. In Europe, the heatwave is expected to cause intense heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires, and the region is already experiencing a severe heatwave. In Asia, Japan and the Sudeste Asiático are expected to experience a hotter than usual summer, and China is expected to suffer from droughts. The heatwave is a result of climate change, and experts warn of the need for adaptation and mitigation measures.

**Geopolitical tensions, trade wars take big toll on global economic growth**
The world is facing significant challenges due to geopolitical tensions, trade wars, and climate change, leading to low economic growth and heavy public debt. Many countries are struggling with fiscal buffers and interest burdens, while climate change is causing droughts, floods, and warmer climates, resulting in heavy damage and losses. The Paris agreement to bring down temperature below 1.5°c from the pre-industrial level has not been met, and the world is experiencing extreme heat levels and high warming. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres stated, 'As per the annual SDG report card 2024, the world is getting a failing grade. The takeaway is simple - our failure to secure peace, to confront climate change and to boost international finance is undermining development.' The 2024 Sustainable Development Goals report highlighted that nearly half of the 17 targets are showing minimal or moderate progress, while over a third are stalled or going in the reverse. Global leaders must come forward to overcome these challenges and take required measures to reduce tension and war, conflict, and focus on global economic growth and development with equal emphasis on climate change measures.

**WMO Sounds Alarm: 1.5-Degree Target May Be Reached Sooner Than Thought**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has sounded the alarm, warning that the 1.5-degree Celsius target may be reached sooner than previously thought. The accelerated timeline is due to higher temperatures than expected in recent years, decreasing air pollution that cooled the Earth, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide despite the growth of renewable energy. This means that irreversible tipping points in the climate system, such as the melting of Arctic ice shelves or the widespread collapse of coral reefs, are closer than scientists previously thought. According to the new WMO forecast, the next five years will likely average above 1.5 degrees Celsius. Combined with the recent hot years and expected rising temperatures after 2030, 2027 is likely to be the first year in which the long-term average temperature exceeds the limit, says Zeke Hausfather. The Paris Agreement aimed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, but some scientists and experts privately feared that the more ambitious goal would be impossible due to the difficulty of transforming the energy system. Despite the growth of renewable energy, it still only makes up about a third of the global energy mix. Even if wind, solar, and batteries grow in the power grid, the world consumes more electricity than ever before. The failure of the climate goal puts politicians and negotiators who have tried to gain support for reducing climate-damaging emissions in an uncomfortable position. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres claims that the 1.5-degree target 'hangs by artificial respiration' and 'will soon be dead.' Eventually, nations will acknowledge this failure and need to develop a new goal. 'You could imagine governments saying: 'Hey, 1.5 won't be achievable, but here's what we'll do, and here we'll strengthen our efforts,' says David Victor. 'That's an approach. Another approach would be to give up.' Zeke Hausfather, a climate researcher and head of climate research at Stripe, is personally skeptical about the willingness to spend billions of dollars on dealing with 'Overshoot.' After another decade of inaction, we will talk about the 2-degree target as we now talk about the 1.5-degree target. The nations could focus their attention on the less ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, keeping temperatures below two degrees Celsius. This goal is more achievable, but currently still unlikely. The planet is currently on its way to about 2.5 degrees Celsius. 'The longer we wait, the harder it will be,' emphasizes Hausfather. 'After another decade of inaction, we will talk about the 2-degree target as we now talk about the 1.5-degree target.'

**India and Pakistan's Nuclear War Threat: A Global Catastrophe**
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), as of January 2024, there are 12,121 nuclear warheads around the world. India and Pakistan possess 172 and 170 nuclear warheads, respectively. The devastating effects of a nuclear war between India and Pakistan would be catastrophic, with an estimated 20% of the population killed immediately due to the blast, heat, and immediate radiation effects. A study published in 2014 estimated that a limited nuclear war between India and Pakistan would release 1,500 kilotons of TNT equivalent, killing up to 20% of the population. The study also predicted that the war would cause 100 massive firestorms, releasing 5-45 million tons of soot into the stratosphere, leading to a global 'nuclear autumn' with a 30°C temperature increase in the stratosphere, causing a 20-50% loss of ozone, and a 30-80% increase in UV radiation. A more recent study published in 2022 estimated that a limited nuclear war between India and Pakistan would kill over 1 billion people, while a global nuclear war would kill over 5 billion people. The study also predicted that a global nuclear war would cause a 'nuclear winter' with a 10-20°C temperature decrease, leading to a 20-50% decrease in global food production and a 6% decrease in global precipitation.

**India and Pakistan: A Regional Conflict with Global Consequences**
India and Pakistan's conflict has escalated since 2014, with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi using tensions with Pakistan as a political tool. Every time there are important elections in India, nationalist rhetoric increases and military actions become more aggressive. In 2019, Modi revoked Kashmir's autonomy, leading to a new cycle of repression and clashes. Since then, the frequency of incidents has grown. Each time, the narrative is the same: an attack in Kashmir, an immediate accusation against Pakistan, and a military response from India without conclusive evidence. In 2025, the situation escalated again, with Pakistan destroying Indian planes and India using drones over Pakistani cities, bringing the conflict to its most dangerous point in decades. Both powers have hundreds of nuclear heads and launch systems that can cross their borders in minutes. The greatest risk is not the explosion of a bomb, but what comes after. According to scientists, a limited nuclear war between India and Pakistan would release massive fires in dozens of cities, sending millions of tons of black carbon into the atmosphere. This would block sunlight, causing a 'nuclear winter' that would cool the planet, reduce rainfall, and collapse global agriculture. Models simulated by researchers at Rutgers University showed that a scenario with 100 nuclear bombs between India and Pakistan would cause a global temperature drop of up to 5°C, a 20% reduction in global food production, and a persistent effect for a decade. 'It's not speculation,' said a scientist, 'it's based on models similar to those used for climate change.' The use of nuclear weapons would also break the nuclear taboo of 1945, which has been a brake on global destruction. If it's broken, other nuclear states will feel empowered to use them in regional conflicts, making the world more unstable.

**The Devastating Consequences of a Nuclear War Between India and Pakistan**
A nuclear war between India and Pakistan could have devastating consequences for the global environment. According to a study, the explosion of 100 atomic bombs over populated areas would release massive amounts of smoke into the atmosphere, causing a global agricultural collapse. The study, conducted by a team of researchers, used computer simulations and climate models to predict the effects of a nuclear war on the global climate. They found that the smoke would block sunlight, causing a global temperature drop of up to 1.25°C, and would also reduce global precipitation by 10%. The researchers also found that the stratosphere would heat up by more than 50°C, leading to a decrease in the ozone layer. The study's lead author, Alan Robock, said, 'The consequences of a nuclear war would be catastrophic, and would lead to a global food crisis.' The researchers also pointed out that the effects of a nuclear war would not be limited to the immediate area, but would have far-reaching consequences for the global environment. They warned that a nuclear war could lead to widespread famine, economic collapse, and social unrest. The study's findings were published in the journal Spektrum der Wissenschaft. 'A nuclear war would be a disaster of unimaginable proportions,' said Robock. 'It would be a catastrophe that would affect not just the immediate area, but the entire world.' The researchers emphasized that the study's findings should serve as a warning to policymakers and the public about the dangers of nuclear war. 'We need to take action to prevent a nuclear war from happening,' said Robock. 'We need to work towards a world where nuclear weapons are no longer a threat.'

**Khaled Montaser: A Nuclear War Between India and Pakistan Would Be Catastrophic**
Renowned thinker and doctor Khaled Montaser has expressed concern about the ongoing war between India and Pakistan, stating that a nuclear war between the two countries would be one of the most catastrophic scenarios in the world. Montaser, in a Facebook post, questioned why the world is not paying more attention to the conflict, highlighting that both India and Pakistan possess a significant number of nuclear warheads. He noted that the conflict is centered around the disputed region of Kashmir. Montaser further emphasized that estimates of the potential casualties in a nuclear war between the two countries are staggering, citing research by institutions such as Princeton University and the Union of Concerned Scientists. According to these estimates, the immediate death toll from a nuclear strike could be between 50 to 125 million people, while the long-term effects would include widespread radiation poisoning, a complete collapse of the healthcare system, and the spread of diseases. Montaser concluded that the global consequences of such a war would be severe, including a 'nuclear winter' that would lead to a global temperature drop of 1.5 to 3 degrees Celsius, a 15-30% decline in global agricultural production, and potentially a global famine that could affect the lives of over a billion people. As Montaser put it, 'The reason the world is standing on the edge of its seat and is not paying attention to this war is because it is not happening in their backyard.'

**Study Reveals Most Resilient Countries to Nuclear Winter**
New Zealand researchers believe that the key to survival in a nuclear winter is the ability to maintain agricultural production. A study by the University of Otago analyzed the impact of a massive release of ash into the atmosphere after nuclear explosions and the subsequent reduction of sunlight on the agricultural sector. 'If a large-scale conflict between Russia and NATO were to release 150 teragrams of ash (equivalent to a large portion of existing warheads), global agricultural production could drop by 80% over several years, and nearly to zero in the northern hemisphere,' researchers noted. As a result, island or peninsula countries have the best chances of survival. These countries include New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands, which can maintain stable agricultural production despite the temperature drop and reduced sunlight. The researchers also previously discovered an ecosystem weighing over 20 billion tons beneath the Earth's surface. Additionally, they reported that the Arctic ice will disappear by 2027.

**Scientists Suggest Detonating a Thermonuclear Bomb to Save the Environment**
Andrew Haverly, a scientist from Rochester Institute of Technology (USA), has proposed detonating a massive nuclear bomb to save the environment. According to Haverly, a thermonuclear explosion at the bottom of the ocean could significantly delay the rise in global temperature. He suggests that the explosion would break down basalt rocks into particles that could react with carbon dioxide and neutralize it. Haverly estimates that the bomb should have a power of around 81 megatons, which is 1600 times more powerful than the 'Tsar Bomba' thermonuclear bomb. He proposes placing the charges under the Kerguelen Plateau in the Southern Ocean, which is located at a depth of about five kilometers. Haverly notes that the basalt would absorb not only carbon dioxide but also a significant portion of the radioactive fallout. However, he acknowledges that the radioactive background at the blast site would increase in the long term, potentially leading to some casualties, but considers this a 'drop in the ocean' compared to the current rate of radiation release. Haverly points out that humanity releases massive amounts of radiation into the atmosphere every year, equivalent to 2000 nuclear bombs, and notes that climate change will threaten 30 million lives by 2100.

**Top Scientist Warns Against the Existential Threat of Nuclear Weapons**
Top scientist Prof. Theodore Postol warns of the existential threat of nuclear weapons, citing the risks of nuclear war and the devastating consequences of a single nuclear detonation. According to Postol, a single 800-kiloton nuclear detonation at a height of about one mile above an American city would release the equivalent of a million tons of TNT, causing temperatures to reach 100 million degrees Celsius, and creating a 'fireball' of superheated air that would expand at one million miles per hour. The resulting fires would efficiently heat large volumes of air, producing an enormous amount of energy, and the winds would be powerful enough to uproot trees and suck people into the fire. Postol also notes that the nuclear debris cloud would drag with it radioactive isotopes, producing lethal radiation on the ground near and downwind of the target area. He emphasizes that avoiding nuclear war should be the highest priority, and that systems should be in place to ensure this, nationally and internationally. The ultimate solution, he suggests, can be only in the form of almost complete elimination of nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction.

**Nuclear Bomb Detonation to Combat Global Warming: A Shocking Proposal**
Andrew Haverly, a researcher from the Rochester Institute of Technology in the US, has proposed a shocking idea to combat global warming. He suggests detonating a powerful nuclear bomb at a great depth in the ocean to help nature. According to Haverly, the explosion of a thermonuclear device would break down basalt rocks into microscopic particles, which would then react with carbon dioxide and neutralize it. The researcher estimates that the bomb would need to be around 81 megatons in power, 1600 times more powerful than the infamous 'Tsar Bomba'. Haverly believes that the best location for such an explosion would be under the Kerguelen Plateau in the Southern Ocean, at a depth of approximately 5 kilometers. He also claims that basalt would not only absorb carbon dioxide but also partially neutralize radiation. However, Haverly acknowledges that the radiation level in the area would increase in the long term, potentially causing some casualties. Nevertheless, he considers this a 'drop in the ocean' compared to the current problems. Haverly notes that humanity already releases a massive amount of radiation into the atmosphere, equivalent to 2000 nuclear bombs annually. He also states that climate change could threaten the lives of 30 million people by 2100, making his idea a lesser evil.
