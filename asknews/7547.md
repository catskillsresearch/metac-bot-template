**Why the US trade deal could come with a long-term health cost for the UK**
Critics argue that the recent UK-US trade deal could compromise public health by introducing lower standards for food and allowing in cheaper US imports, such as hormone-treated beef and chlorinated chicken. While the UK government insists it will not compromise on standards, critics are sceptical, citing concerns about the 'enhance agricultural market access' language in the deal. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) warns that cheap US beef could undercut UK cattle raised under stricter welfare and environmental rules, and that the deal could destabilise farm incomes and reduce local feed supplies. However, cheaper imports could ease grocery bills in the UK, a welcome prospect given food price inflation peaked at more than 19% in 2023. But not all cheap calories are healthy, and increased access to cheaper beef could nudge intakes beyond recommended levels. The NFU warns that Britain's high standards shouldn't be quietly traded away under pressure from US agribusiness, and that regulators must hold the line if the US pushes harder.

**Kano: Bagwai LG bans farming in cattle grazing reserves, begins enforcement**
The Bagwai Local Government Council in Kano state has banned all farming activities within designated cattle grazing reserves in the area. According to the acting chairman, Alhaji Haruna Garba Sarkin Biro, the decision aligns with the directive of the Kano State Governor to address growing tension over illegal grazing and land encroachment. He emphasized that grazing reserves are strictly for herders and not for farming, and individuals seeking access must present valid documentation. The council has warned herders operating outside approved areas to return to compliance or face sanctions, and enforcement of the ban will begin immediately.

**Ban on livestock markets before Eid is a harsh move on farmers: Prakash Ambedkar**
The Maharashtra Goseva Ayog has issued a circular banning the holding of livestock markets from June 3 to June 8, 2025, ahead of Bakri-Eid on June 7. The move has raised concerns among cattle rearers, who are mostly daily wage farmers, as they will incur significant financial losses during this period. Prakash Ambedkar, founder of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, has strongly opposed the circular, stating that it is a harsh step against farmers and those who depend on the market. He questioned the authority of the Maharashtra Goseva Ayog to issue such a circular and asked who will compensate for the losses incurred by farmers. The circular has also disrupted the plans of people who plan to purchase animals for Bakri-Eid rituals, which involve animal sacrifice, primarily goat or sheep.

**Denmark's Historic Agreement to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Agriculture**
Denmark has made a historic agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, a sector that accounts for nearly half of the country's emissions. The 'Green Three-Party' agreement, signed by seven parties, including the government and opposition, aims to reduce emissions by 1.8 million tons of CO2 equivalent by 2030. The agreement includes measures such as reducing the number of cows and pigs, increasing the use of organic farming, and planting 250,000 hectares of new forest by 2045. A CO2 tax will be introduced on livestock production from 2030, with a rate of 300 DKK per ton of CO2 equivalent, rising to 750 DKK in 2035. The tax will be phased in over time to give farmers time to adapt. The agreement also includes measures to improve water quality, reduce pollution, and promote biodiversity. Louise Korsgaard Frederiksen, a young farmer from Jutland, is skeptical about the agreement, citing concerns about the cost of implementing the measures and the impact on her farm. However, she is optimistic that the agreement will set an example for other countries and inspire them to take action on climate change. 'We're not doing this to save the planet, but to show the world that we can do it,' she said. 'And if the EU follows our lead, it will make more sense for us.' The agreement has been hailed as a breakthrough in Denmark's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable agriculture. 'This is a historic agreement that will make a significant difference in the fight against climate change,' said Jeppe Bruus, the Minister for the Green Three-Party agreement. 'We're not just talking about reducing emissions, we're talking about creating a more sustainable and resilient food system.'

**Maharashtra Government's Decision to Close Animal Markets Ahead of Eid al-Adha Sparks Controversy**
The Maharashtra government has taken a significant decision ahead of Eid al-Adha, which is celebrated on June 7. The Animal Welfare Board of Maharashtra has instructed all Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) to close all animal markets from June 3 to June 8. This move is aimed at preventing the illegal slaughter of animals. In Maharashtra, the slaughter of cows and bullocks is completely banned, and the sale of their meat is also considered a crime. Under this order, all animal markets, including those for goats, sheep, and buffaloes, will be closed for a week. The Animal Welfare Board has issued a circular on May 27 to all APMC, stating that during Eid al-Adha, a large number of animals are sacrificed, so no animal markets should be organized in any village during the first week of June to prevent animal slaughter incidents. The board has implemented this order under the Maharashtra Animal Preservation Act, which imposes strict restrictions on animal slaughter in the state. However, this decision has been met with opposition from various communities, particularly the Muslim community. They have questioned the need to close all markets for a week, as it will not only affect the sale of cows and bullocks but also other animals like goats, sheep, and buffaloes. Farooq Ahmed, the state vice-president of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, has said that the closure of markets will affect the livelihood of farmers, laborers, Kurmi-Khatik community members, and other related professionals. He has also questioned the authority of the Animal Welfare Board, saying that it can only provide advice, not issue direct orders. The Maharashtra government has 305 major and 603 minor APMC, under which there are 292 animal markets in the state. These markets are of great importance to the farming community, where they buy and sell animals during the monsoon season, use them for farming, and then sell them after the harvest due to the cost of their maintenance. During Eid al-Adha, the demand for goats, sheep, and small animals increases in these markets as Muslims buy them. This order will put a stop to all these activities for a week, making it a significant commercial and social issue. In this controversy, the Animal Welfare Board has clarified that its intention is only to prevent the illegal slaughter of cows and bullocks. The board believes that if animal markets are open, the sale of animals for sacrifice during Eid al-Adha will increase, and the chances of illegal slaughter will also increase. However, the closure of markets will affect the income of people involved in the sale of small animals, and a suitable solution needs to be found. The state government needs to make a balanced decision, taking into account the sentiments of all parties, so that both religious faith and the law are respected.

**Maharashtra Goseva Aayog Calls For Ban On Livestock Markets Before Eid al-Adha On June 7; Sparks Controversy**
The Maharashtra Goseva Aayog, a state commission for the welfare of indigenous cows, has issued a directive to halt all livestock markets across the state from June 3 to June 8, ahead of Eid al-Adha on June 7. The move aims to prevent illegal slaughter of cows and their progeny, but has drawn criticism from Muslim groups and others, who argue that the blanket ban is unjustified and economically harmful. Farooq Ahmad, State Vice President of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, stated, 'This order halts the livelihood of thousands, including farmers, brokers, transporters, porters, and butchers, especially from the Qureshi and Khatik communities.' Shekhar Mundada, Chairman of the Goseva Aayog, clarified that the circular was merely an advisory and not a binding order, stating, 'Our intention is to ensure cow slaughter does not occur under any guise during Eid. The temporary suspension of other animal trade is a precautionary measure and will last only a week.'

**Are Bio-Products Really Better? The Results Are a Surprise**
Bio-products are popular among consumers, but what lies behind the 'Bio' label? Is Bio really better? Bio-products are in high demand in Germany, with three-quarters of Germans buying them at least occasionally. The reasons for this are often the desire for animal-friendly farming, lower pollutant levels, and environmental protection. However, do Bio-products really live up to their promises? What's behind the Bio-label? 'Bio' and 'eco' are protected terms that are subject to strict legal controls. These include animal-friendly farming and the avoidance of synthetic fertilizers. Bio-farmers work according to the closed-loop principle: the feed for the animals is grown on-site, and the animal manure is used as organic fertilizer for the fields. This creates a closed nutrient cycle with minimal external inputs. Chemical-synthetic pesticides are prohibited in organic farming. Instead, Bio-farmers rely on natural methods of pest control, such as planting flower strips and using beneficial insects. While copper and sulfur-based products are allowed, they are strictly limited in their use. Animal-friendly farming Bio-farming places great emphasis on animal welfare. Chickens are allowed to scratch and peck, pigs dig in the ground, and cows graze in the pasture. In addition, larger outdoor areas and free-range areas are prescribed. Compared to conventional farming, which also has minimum standards for animal husbandry, the regulations in the Bio sector are much stricter. Health benefits of Bio-products Whether Bio-products are really healthier is a matter of scientific debate. Some studies found higher levels of antioxidants and lower nitrate levels in Bio-products, which may reduce the risk of cancer. Also, Bio-milk and Bio-meat have a more favorable fatty acid composition. Furthermore, the risk of taking in harmful pesticide or fertilizer residues is much lower with Bio-products. Environmental friendliness Bio-farming avoids chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which means fewer pollutants enter the groundwater and soil. Biologically cultivated soils are often healthier, more humus-rich, and can store more water. This increases biodiversity and binds more CO2, which can mitigate climate change. The avoidance of synthetic fertilizers reduces the energy consumption of Bio-farms by up to a third and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Grazing, which is often practiced in Bio-farming, can be more climate-friendly than stall-feeding, as it avoids imported soy and cows emit less methane. However, it is disputed whether Bio-farming is overall climate-friendly. Studies show that emissions per liter of milk or kilogram of meat can be higher in Bio-farming, as the animals are less efficient. A study by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research Heidelberg (ifeu) even found partial disadvantages of Bio-products in terms of CO2 emissions, as they require more cultivation area due to lower yields. Tips for buying Bio-products When buying Bio-products, it is recommended to look for certified labels. Formulations such as 'from controlled cultivation' are not protected and can be misleading. Labels from Bio-associations like Bioland or Naturland often have stricter criteria than the EU Bio-label. Buying regional Bio-products on farmers' markets or in farm shops supports local farmers and promotes direct marketing. Seasonal and unpackaged shopping is also recommended. Bio-products are often comparable in price to conventional products, especially for unprocessed and plant-based products. 'Bio-products are not necessarily better, but they are often better for the environment and animal welfare,' said a spokesperson for the Bio-association Bioland. 'However, it is essential to look for certified labels and to support local farmers.'

**Río Grande Strengthens Local Production and Consolidates New Alternatives**
The Secretary of Productive Development, Facundo Armas, highlighted that food production has become one of the pillars of local economic development: 'Six years ago, we started to strengthen food sovereignty, to reduce our dependence on food from the continent. And we have demonstrated that it is possible.' Armas noted that the production scale has shifted from almost family-based to semi-industrial schemes. For example, poultry production began in 2022 with a batch of 1,500 grilled chickens and now reaches 60,000 units per year. 'We are supplying butcher shops in Tolhuin and Ushuaia. The product we are offering does not exist in Patagonia, so there is demand and a highly valued quality differential,' explained Armas. The development of RGA Alimentos, initially articulated with La Misión Salesiana, has been the core from which other production lines such as tomatoes, potatoes, garlic, and vegetables have been strengthened. Currently, more than 1.5 tons of tomatoes are produced per season, even in months like May and June, extending the historical seasonal period. In this process, companies from the technology sector based in the city have also begun to participate. 'In addition to electronics, Río Grande demonstrates that it can develop food and there are companies like Mirgor that are starting to participate in this,' said Armas, highlighting the synergy between sectors. The possibility of developing trout production is also being explored, reusing municipal facilities in disuse such as the old water treatment plant. 'Río Grande identifies with trout, but few riograndenses have tried it. We want to make it a local, accessible, and sustainable product,' proposed Armas. Significant advances have also been made in the strengthening of pig production, which already has more than 55 registered producers in the municipal program. In 2023, around 8,000 pigs and 6,000 cattle were slaughtered. The Municipal Abattoir was completely refurbished and now works in conjunction with the private plant Los Jazmines. Additionally, local butcher shops were accompanied to improve their conditions of traceability and ensure the local supply of meat in the domestic market. Another highlighted policy is the support for the artisanal fishing sector, historically marginalized. The Municipality implemented a registry of fishermen, delivered nets and work clothing, and articulated commercialization through the Paseo Canto del Viento, ensuring the supply of fresh fish throughout the year. The development of the sector also includes the production of fresh eggs, with over 100 active poultry producers in the city. In the near future, the Avícola Seal, a certification of good practices promoted together with INTA and SENASA, will be implemented, which aims to add value and security to these products. This entire strategy is linked to employment and training programs. From the Employment Department, courses related to food production were added as a concrete labor outlet. 'The idea is that those who are trained can have a profitable business and generate a sustained income,' emphasized Armas. Finally, the official recognized that some projects cannot advance due to lack of financing and change in national government priorities. 'There were projects related to feedlots, production of forage, four-season greenhouses, and a refrigerator with BID financing for almost $8 million. Unfortunately, they did not prosper due to lack of provincial support to take on the debt,' lamented.

**Why Are Politicians Banning Cultivated Meat? This New Study Gives A Hint**
A new study suggests that cultivated meat may threaten the livestock industry, particularly beef and lamb, due to its lower carbon footprint and potential to disrupt the market. Some lawmakers have banned cultivated meat, citing concerns over food safety and protecting ranchers. However, the study found that the livestock industry is backed by government subsidies, making it difficult for cultivated meat to compete on price. The researchers modelled two scenarios, one with a carbon tax and one without, and found that conventional beef, lamb, milk, and egg are more likely to lose market share to cultivated meat. Pork and chicken, with lower climate footprints, proved more resilient to the carbon tax. The study suggests that sheep and cattle rearing could be most vulnerable to competition, especially if a carbon tax is introduced. 'While there are still plenty of uncertainties here – such as whether technologies will ever improve to the point where cultivated proteins are commercially viable – this study suggests that sheep and cattle rearing could be most vulnerable to competition, especially if a carbon tax is introduced,' said Nick Roxburgh, a social systems simulation modeller at the James Hutton Institute. 'This is not an anti-farmer sector; this is a sector that is using farmed products in new ways. And generally using farmed products that are more profitable and highly sustainable in the way they’re produced,' said Roxburgh. 'These bills establish a precedent for adopting policies and regulatory requirements that could one day adversely affect the bills’ supporters,' said a letter. 'What we’re protecting here is the industry against acts of man, against an ideological agenda that wants to finger agriculture as the problem, that views things like raising cattle as destroying our climate,' said an Alabama politician. 'The main factor influencing choice is price. Cultivated meat firms must focus on cost reductions,' said Roxburgh. 'Farmers are more game for cultivated meat than politicians,' said a farmer. 'Given the potential for disruption, it will be important to plan carefully for the possible impacts of cultivated proteins on livestock farming and rural livelihoods,' said Roxburgh.

**Austrian Government Coalition Agrees on Ban of Full-Spate Pig Pens**
The Austrian government coalition has agreed on a new regulation for the ban on full-spate pig pens in pig farming. The bill, which was passed in parliament on Tuesday, sets a shortened transition period until 2034. This implements a ruling by the Constitutional Court, which had overturned the previously planned deadline of 2040. The new law includes several stages to develop animal welfare standards, including the completion of the 'IBeST+' research project by the end of 2026, the development of a new minimum standard from 2027, and the introduction of improvements in existing stables from 2029. From mid-2034, the keeping of pigs on full-spate pens will be generally prohibited. However, around 170 farms that invested in new stables between June 2018 and December 2022 will receive an individual transition period of 16 years. Landwirtschaftsminister Norbert Totschnig praised the regulation as a 'sustainable and constitutionally compliant compromise'. However, the Greens criticized the planned amendment, saying it would be 'a mess that would be even more vulnerable to attack due to the too long transition periods' and that there would be no mention of a new statutory minimum standard from 2027. The animal welfare organization VGT described the draft as 'unbelievable', saying that the passage about all pig holdings having to comply with the new minimum standard from 1 January 2040 had been omitted. This means that all pig holdings would have to comply with the ridiculous new version of the full-spate pen without straw from 1 June 2039. The NEOS representative Christoph Pramhofer emphasized that farmers need more legal certainty to make investments. Without this, they would not be able to invest. Josef Hechenberger from the Farmers' Association assured that there would be higher standards in animal welfare in the future and that the supply of Austrian pork would continue to be guaranteed. The FPÖ, on the other hand, expressed skepticism, fearing that many pig farmers would give up. As a result, more meat would be imported from countries with lower animal welfare standards.

**Coalition Reaches Compromise on Full-Slat Floor Ban in Pig Farming**
The coalition government has agreed on a bill to introduce a transition period for the ban on full-slat floors in pig farming. The ban was originally set to come into effect on June 1, 2025, but the Constitutional Court had previously struck down the transition period, which was set to end in 2040. The new bill shortens the transition period to 2034. According to Health and Agriculture Minister Norbert Totschnig, 'this is a sustainable and constitutionally compliant compromise.' However, the Greens have criticized the bill, calling it 'a mess.' The Farmers' Association welcomed the agreement, saying 'the development in the pig industry will continue.' The Animal Protection Association has condemned the bill, saying it 'is unbelievable' that the transition period has been shortened and that the ban on full-slat floors without straw will come into effect in 2039. 'This means that all pig farms will have to switch to the new, ridiculous version of the full-slat floor without straw by June 1, 2039.'

**Coalition Agrees on Compromise for Full-Slat Floor Ban in Pig Farming**
The coalition government has agreed on a bill to introduce a transition period for the ban on full-slat floors in pig farming. The ban was originally set to take effect on June 1, 2025, but the Constitutional Court of Austria (VfGH) struck down the transition period, which was set to end in 2040, in January 2024. The new bill sets the transition period to end in 2034. According to a joint statement from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, the bill is a 'broadly supported compromise' that will be voted on in parliament next week and take effect on June 1, 2025. The Austrian Farmers' Association welcomed the agreement, but saw it as a 'painful compromise'. The Greens, on the other hand, called it a 'mess'. 'The development in the pig farming industry will continue', said the Austrian Farmers' Association. The bill includes further stages until the ban takes effect, including the completion of the research project 'IBeST+' by the end of 2026. Landwirtschaftsminister Norbert Totschnig (ÖVP) described the regulation as a 'sustainable and constitutionally compliant compromise'. The organization 'Verein gegen Tierfabriken' (VGT) was 'baffled' by the bill, saying that the passage requiring all pig farms to meet the new minimum standard (with straw) by January 1, 2040, was removed. Without this passage, all pig farms would have to meet the new version of the full-slat floor without straw by June 1, 2039. Other animal welfare organizations also called the bill a 'scam'.

**Trump's tariffs: Why won't countries buy US meat products?**
US President Donald Trump has called out several countries for restricting imports of American beef and poultry, citing $3 billion in Australian beef imports last year. However, the restrictions are due to food safety regulations, including the detection of BSE (Mad Cow Disease) in US cattle in 2003, and the use of growth hormones in US cattle farming. Australia and Argentina have lifted their bans on US beef, but require US producers to meet their biosecurity laws. The EU and UK have restricted US beef imports since 1989 due to the use of growth hormones, and the US has criticized EU bans on importing US poultry cleaned in chlorine. US poultry farmers wash poultry meat in chlorine solutions to kill bacteria, but European authorities are concerned about lower standards of hygiene and animal welfare in earlier stages. US animal farming practices are incompatible with EU food safety demands, and would require US producers to cease using growth hormones and end chlorine washing in poultry. Polling data suggests Europeans are against allowing US meat products in, with 80% of the British public against importing chlorinated chicken.

**Farms face being blocked from expansion by net-zero campaigners**
Net-zero campaigners are planning to use a legal precedent to block new pig and poultry farms from expanding, citing the implied emissions from their feedstocks. The proposed mega-farm in Norfolk, which would house up to 14,000 pigs and 714,000 hens, has already sparked opposition among residents. According to Sustain, the facility would cause 120,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases to be released every year, equivalent to 28,000 cars on the road. Campaigners say the feed used for pigs and poultry contributes to deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and elsewhere. Ruth Westcott, a campaigner at Sustain, said, 'The Finch ruling is a victory for communities. It's shocking that corporations have been able to hide the true environmental impact of developments like industrial livestock units.' The Government plans to extend the environmental-permitting regime in England to dairy and intensive beef farms by 2025, which could lead to scrutiny over the methane produced by additional cow and sheep burps.

**Swine Farmers Call for Delay in Ban on Full-Spate Concrete Floors**
Swine farmers are calling for a delay in the ban on full-spate concrete floors for piglets, citing the need for more time to implement other animal welfare measures required by law. Styriabrid-Obmann Kurt Tauschmann stated, 'It would be economically fatal if the full-spate concrete floor ban were to come before 2033.' The Steirische Landwirtschaftskammer is pushing for a two-stage transition period for full-spate concrete floors, with older stables to be converted first, but allowing newer stables to continue operating for longer. Horst Jauschnegg, the head of animal breeding at the Steirische Landwirtschaftskammer, said, 'We would like to have a deadline of 2039.' However, David Richter from the Verein gegen Tierfabriken (VGT) believes that this is taking too long and that more space and straw are needed for pigs. Richter stated, 'I compare it to the battery cages for chickens that were banned in Austria in the early 2000s. We were able to achieve this and it was a success for everyone. We want the same for pigs, so that they no longer have to suffer on these terrible concrete floors.'

**Angola Prohibits Importation of 'Miudezas' of Chicken, Cattle, and Pig**
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Angola, through the Veterinary Services Institute, announced today that the importation of certain animal-derived food products will be prohibited, including poultry (chicken and duck), pigs (pork), and cattle (beef). According to the document, dated Wednesday, importers of animal-derived products will not be issued licenses for the importation of 'miudezas' (small parts) of birds, pigs, and cattle, as long as local production conditions exist. Starting from March 15, licenses will not be issued for the importation of 'bovine organs such as liver, brisket, kidneys, heart, and lungs', as well as 'bird wings, chicken, duck, gizzards, heart, back, neck, and liver'. Additionally, pork-derived products, such as 'head, ears, snout, tail, liver, heart, and other miudezas', will also be covered by the government measure. In a second phase, on July 31, the importation of 'pig necks, tail, and cattle heads, chicken thighs, chicken drumsticks, and turkey thighs' will be prohibited, as indicated. This is a measure by the Angolan government to strengthen internal production and reduce dependence on the external market.
