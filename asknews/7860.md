**Balochistan Engages Religious Scholars To Promote ‘Family Planning’ Efforts - Daily Parliament Times**
The Balochistan government has launched a new initiative to promote family planning efforts by engaging 150 religious scholars across 31 districts. These scholars, designated as Family Planning Assistants, receive honorariums and Islamic literature emphasizing the Islamic legitimacy of responsible family planning, reproductive health, parental responsibility, and child welfare. Maulana Mula Dad, one of the scholars, says, 'We deliver our message through the lens of Islamic values – that every individual is entitled to a healthy life, proper education, and financial stability.' The initiative aims to promote healthier families and create a sustainable balance between population growth and available resources. The province's population has grown from 1.2 million in the early 1950s to 14.8 million in 2023, with an annual growth rate of 3.2%. If this trajectory persists, the population could double by 2045, placing unsustainable pressure on employment, housing, education, and healthcare services. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns that if growth remains above 2%, the province will require 6.5 million new employment opportunities, one million homes, and over 7,000 educational institutions by 2040.

**JUI-F rejects Child Marriage Law, announces nationwide protests**
Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman has strongly opposed the newly enacted Child Marriage Restraint Law, calling it 'contrary to the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah.' He argued that Pakistan, founded in the name of Islam, is losing its Islamic identity due to recent legislative developments. Fazlur Rehman announced a nationwide protest movement against the legislation, accusing the government of yielding to international pressure. He also criticized the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) for its protests, claiming they are aimed at safeguarding its political reputation rather than fighting corruption. The protests will take place in major cities, including a significant rally on June 29 in the Hazara Division. Fazlur Rehman urged stronger diplomatic ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan and warned that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's policies are increasing regional tensions.

**Fazl rejects child marriage bill, announces protest across country**
Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUIF) chief Maulana Fazlur Rahman has rejected the Child Marriage Restraint Bill, calling it a means to promote adultery and erode the Islamic identity of the country. He claimed that the legislation is against the teachings of the Holy Quran and Sunnah, and that it would make the process of nikah more difficult, leading to an increase in adultery. Maulana Fazlur Rahman also criticized the rising number of mega-corruption scandals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the PTI government, and called for a judicial probe into the corruption scandals. He further stated that China is rapidly emerging as a regional power and that the region could be plunged into chaos due to the 'insane decisions' of Indian rulers. He urged the Indian people to think about the policies of Modi administration and stressed the need for improved relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

**Afghanistan Denies Reports of Ban on Poetry Nights**
The Ministry of Information and Culture of Afghanistan has denied reports of a ban on poetry nights in the country. According to the ministry's press service, a traditional festival 'Aнар Голь' (Granate Flower) took place in the Kandahar province on Saturday night, attended by dozens of Pashto-language poets from various provinces, artists, and hundreds of local residents. High-ranking government officials from Kabul also attended the event. Deputy Minister of Information and Culture Atilkulla Azizi addressed the gathering, saying, 'Recently, several biased media outlets spread false stories claiming that poetry meetings were canceled. However, we are now witnessing a colorful and culturally significant event in historic Kandahar. Isn't this a strong and worthy response to these unfounded accusations?' Azizi also confirmed Afghanistan's commitment to promoting poetry and literature, stating that the government does not aim to suppress literature, but rather supports poets and organizes poetry festivals. 'The Islamic Emirate does not aim to restrict or suppress literary expression. On the contrary, we actively work to support poets and organize more effective poetry festivals. In accordance with the directive of the Supreme Leader of Afghanistan, the Ministry of Information and Culture is authorized to annually evaluate the work of poets, their contribution to national literature, and award those who have made significant contributions,' Azizi emphasized.

**Pakistan Upgrades Diplomatic Ties with Afghanistan**
Pakistan has upgraded its diplomatic ties with Afghanistan by appointing a full ambassador in Kabul, signaling an improvement in bilateral relations and a desire to pursue deeper cooperation on regional security and economic integration. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar attributed the decision to the momentum generated during his visit to Kabul on April 19, 2025, saying 'Pakistan-Afghanistan relations are on a positive trajectory.' Dar expressed confidence that the appointment of a full ambassador would catalyze high-level engagement and bolster cooperation in critical areas such as counter-terrorism, border security, trade, and economic development. The move comes amid a notable shift in regional dynamics, with Pakistan pursuing simultaneous diplomatic overtures to both China and Afghanistan, even as it remained locked in a tense standoff with India earlier this month. A recent China-Pakistan-Afghanistan trilateral meeting held in Beijing on May 21, reviving a dialogue mechanism last active in 2023, further underscored this pivot. Both Kabul and Islamabad, with Beijing's backing, expressed a clear willingness to exchange ambassadors 'as soon as possible,' according to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Beijing also announced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), would now extend into Afghanistan, linking the landlocked country to broader regional infrastructure and trade networks. Senior Pakistani officials confirmed that another round of trilateral consultations is expected within weeks, aimed at building on the progress made in Beijing. The officials also said Afghan Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi was expected to visit Islamabad soon. 'The dates for this (possible three-day) visit are being finalised. We are heading to closer cooperation,' one official said.

**Shaheen: Delaying Recognition of Islamic Emirate No Longer Logical**
Suhail Shaheen, the ambassador of the Islamic Emirate in Qatar, stated that regional countries have begun engaging with the caretaker government in Afghanistan due to the 'current reality' of the Islamic Emirate.

**Islamic Emirate Rejects Pakistan's Claims Over Balochistan Attack**
The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has rejected Pakistan's claims that the recent attack on a student transport vehicle in Balochistan was linked to Afghanistan. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Islamic Emirate's spokesman, stated, 'We have declared the position of the Islamic Emirate and condemned this attack. It is truly regrettable, and there is no justification for taking the lives of civilians, especially children. Furthermore, the claims by Pakistani officials connecting this attack to Afghanistan are unfounded and baseless.' Experts have called on Pakistan to change its approach towards Afghanistan, emphasizing that defending its citizens is the responsibility of the Pakistani government, not Afghanistan. 'Unfortunately, Pakistan has always maintained a hostile policy toward Afghan governments,' said Mohammad Zalmai Afghanyar, a political analyst. 'The question now arises whether Pakistan can assure us it does not have intelligence operations against Afghanistan?' China's efforts to improve ties between Kabul and Islamabad have been noted, amidst deteriorating relations between the two countries due to security challenges and the forced deportation of Afghan migrants.

**Race Against Time: Kabul's Groundwater May Run Dry by 2030**
According to a report by The Japan Times, Kabul's groundwater is at risk of running dry by 2030 due to population growth, climate change, and unregulated water extraction. Experts estimate that up to 80% of Kabul's groundwater is contaminated, and more than 100,000 unregulated wells extract water in the city, resulting in a 76-million-cubic-meter annual deficit. The Islamic Emirate's Ministry of Energy and Water has proposed a plan to transfer water from the Panjshir River, which would require a budget of $300 to $400 million. As The Japan Times notes, 'the situation in Kabul is clearly deteriorating' and urgent action is needed to address the water shortage.

**IEA Refuses to Recognize ICC Jurisdiction, Emphasizes Realistic Engagement**
The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) has refused to recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC), citing a lack of respect for mutual principles. The IEA also criticized the ICC for remaining silent on injustices. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) emphasized the importance of realistic engagement with Afghanistan, avoiding selective behavior. Pakistan announced it would expel Afghan refugees from Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The foreign ministers of 17 countries expressed concern over restrictions on women in Afghanistan, with the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) chief warning that curbs on women's education and work would result in long-term harm. Meanwhile, imports from Afghanistan to India surged, but exports declined since the IEA's takeover. Iran underlined support to Afghan investors, saying they could obtain residency in the country's free trade zones. 'We deal with Afghanistan based on realities,' said Tariq Ali Bakhit, the special representative of the OIC for Afghanistan. 'Pressure tactics not only failed to facilitate engagement but also drove nations and countries further apart,' said Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the deputy prime minister for economic affairs. 'Afghanistan is part of the world and the Islamic Emirate is fully prepared for positive engagement with all based on national and Islamic interests,' said Maulvi Mohammad Yaqoob Mujahid, the acting minister of defence.

**Afghanistan  --  the perils of cuddling India**
The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) is seeking to diversify its foreign relations through 'hedging diplomacy', which includes exploring alliances and trade with countries like China, Russia, Iran, and India. However, this approach is complicated by the IEA's internal fissures, its inability to resolve issues like girls' education, and its reliance on Pakistan for trade and other leverages. India's re-insertion into Afghanistan is a 'red line' for Pakistan, which has historically stood by Afghanistan and expects reciprocity. The IEA's overtures to India are seen as an angry reaction to Pakistan's influence, and Kabul needs to realize the lingering psychological dependence of its citizenry on Pakistan. Pakistan's shift from geo-politics to geo-economics is not coming anytime soon, and Central Asia's trade potential will remain a pipedream without Pakistan's cooperation.
