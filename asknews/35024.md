**Nvidia's Stock Price Surges on US-China Trade Deal**
Nvidia's stock price surged 5.29% to $122.80 on May 12, 2025, driven by a new trade deal between the US and China. The reduction of tariffs between the two countries has strengthened market confidence in global supply chains, benefiting tech companies like Nvidia with international business. The temporary decrease in import tariffs sent a strong signal, particularly for Nvidia, which has a significant portion of its business in the Chinese market. The relief of fewer trade barriers has pulled up various technology stocks on US exchanges, with Nvidia standing out as one of the top performers of the day.

**Here's Why NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Fell in Q1**
Baron Funds' 'Baron Technology Fund' investor letter for Q1 2025 highlighted the challenges faced by NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) in the quarter.

**US Stock Market Closes with Slight Gain as Investors Await Fed Meeting and NVIDIA GTC Conference**
Investors are waiting for the Federal Reserve meeting and the NVIDIA GTC conference to gain more insight into the demand for artificial intelligence. The US stock market closed on Monday (17th) with a slight gain. The S&P 500 index rose by about 0.6%, marking the second consecutive trading day of rebound, while the Dow Jones index rose over 350 points, and the Nasdaq index rose slightly over 0.3%. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent continues to downplay market concerns, saying he is not worried about the recent stock market downturn. He pointed out that the US government is preventing a 'inevitable' financial crisis. The concern about stagnant inflation continues to affect the bond market, leading to a rise in short-term debt yields after the release of weak February retail sales data on Monday. The US 2-month retail sales growth rate was 0.2% higher than the previous month, beating the previous month's downward revision of 1.2%, but lower than market expectations. The New York Federal Reserve's monthly manufacturing survey showed that New York state's business activity declined significantly in March. The overall general business conditions index fell 26 points to -20, the lowest since May 2023, far below market expectations. This week is a super-central bank week, with major central banks around the world, including the US, Japan, and the UK, holding monetary policy meetings. The market is focused on the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting starting on Tuesday. People generally expect the Federal Reserve to maintain interest rates unchanged during the meeting, and investors are looking for signs of changes in the Fed's view of the economy's future under the Trump administration. NVIDIA's annual artificial intelligence conference, 'GTC 2025', opened on Monday in San Jose, California, with CEO Jensen Huang scheduled to deliver a keynote speech at 1am Taiwan time on March 19 at the SAP Center, introducing AI and accelerated computing technologies that are changing the world. NVIDIA (NVDA-US) fell 1.76% to $119.53 per share. Supply chain sources said that NVIDIA will officially unveil the details of its new products, including the Blackwell Ultra (B300) and GB300, at the GTC conference. Tesla (TSLA-US) plummeted over 4.7% to $238.01 per share on Monday, with Morgan Stanley downgrading its target price to $430, citing Tesla's sales difficulties due to worsening geopolitics, brand recognition, and increased competition, leading to Tesla's market share loss and weak demand for the updated Model Y. PepsiCo (PEP-US) announced on Monday that it will acquire the Poppi sparkling water brand for approximately $2 billion, with the stock rising 1.85% to $151.34 per share. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B-US), led by Warren Buffett, rose 1.62% after increasing its stake in five Japanese trading companies, marking its latest investment in Japan's top commodity companies in nearly five years. Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist at US Bank Asset Management, said, 'Although the stock market has rebounded in the past few weeks after a sell-off, the future volatility may continue to increase. At least in the next few weeks, volatility will exist and may persist for a longer period, depending on the progress of the tariff issue.' McGraw-Hill said, 'We should be concerned about whether the Federal Reserve will fail to meet market expectations of two to three rate cuts this year. This concern stems from people's doubts about whether the Federal Reserve is no longer 'in control' and has transferred overall economic policy control to the Trump administration.' Morgan Stanley estimated, 'The Federal Reserve will maintain the federal funds rate between 4.25% and 4.5% unchanged on Wednesday, with Chairman Powell likely to continue his patient stance since the January meeting, and is expected to maintain a data-dependent policy strategy, providing no clear guidance on future policy rate actions.'

**Stock market today: S&P 500 ends higher as cyclicals offset tech wreck By Investing.com**
The S&P 500 closed higher after cutting losses on Monday as cyclical stocks, including energy, helped offset a rotation out of growth stocks, including tech. Energy stocks rose over 3% due to rising oil prices, while semiconductor stocks, including NVIDIA, fell due to concerns about a prolonged Fed pause and higher interest rates. The upcoming inflation data, expected to show a 2.9% year-over-year increase, will be closely watched. Economists are also expecting a slower pace of annual price gains, with the Fed now projecting inflation to rise 2.5% in 2025. Banks will kick off earnings season later this week, with Macy's stock falling 8% after soft guidance and Moderna stock plummeting 17% after cutting its 2025 sales forecast by $1 billion.
