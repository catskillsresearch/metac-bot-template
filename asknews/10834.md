**Beltway Buzz - June 2025**
The US Department of Labor (DOL) has announced that it will rescind the Biden-era ESG rule, which allowed plan fiduciaries to consider environmental, social, and governance factors in investment decisions. Instead, the DOL will pursue notice-and-comment rulemaking to rescind the regulation. Joseph Edlow, nominee for director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), stated that he wants to restrict optional practical training (OPT) for F-1 students, allowing them to work only while they are in school. US consulates have been instructed to pause student visa interviews due to new social media vetting protocols. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce's Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development held a hearing on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) on college campuses, focusing on fallout from the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling prohibiting affirmative action in college admissions. Republican lawmakers have solicited feedback on potential revisions to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) to ensure labor organizations adhere to high standards of responsibility and ethical conduct. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer testified on the DOL's priorities, including staffing levels, workforce training programs, and the independent contractor rule.

**6 In 10 Americans Fear Social Security Will Vanish Before They Retire, As 2033 Insolvency Clock Ticks Louder - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)**
A recent survey by DepositAccounts found that 59% of working-age Americans fear that Social Security will not exist by the time they retire, with 70% of Generation X sharing this concern. The anxiety is driven by the program's main trust fund's depletion in 2033, which would leave incoming payroll taxes covering only 79% of promised checks. Jaime Eckels, a certified-financial-planner, warned that the countdown has moved from abstract to immediate for many savers, saying, 'It's not that far away. We're creeping up on it.' However, not all gauges are as bleak, with the 2025 Retirement Confidence Survey finding that about half of workers remain at least 'somewhat confident' that the government will pay benefits of equal value to today's. Despite this, 60% of workers worry about cuts to Social Security benefits. Analysts stress that insolvency does not equal disappearance, with LendingTree's Matt Schulz saying, 'The truth is that it's highly, highly unlikely Social Security 'won't be available.'

**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**Trump administration blocks California's electric vehicle mandate**
The California dream of a fully electric state has been shattered by the federal government. Since 1970, California has set its own rules for emissions, which are stricter than the federal government's. However, this has been challenged by the Trump administration, which has blocked the state's mandate to sell a certain percentage of electric vehicles by 2035. The norm is 35% in 2026, 68% in 2030, and 100% in 2035. California Governor Gavin Newsom maintains that the state will still meet its climate goals, citing its 'legal responsibility under federal law to protect the community and reduce major pollutants to levels required by federal law.' According to Mary Nichols, former president of the California Air Resources Board, the state could consider stricter emissions limits for factories and oil refineries to make up for the difference. The state could also encourage public transportation or impose penalties on gas-powered vehicle owners, as seen in Europe.

**Trump's 2030 Plan: A Complex and Ambitious Agenda**
According to Minister Cossío, a recently discovered book, 'Project 2025, Mandate for Leadership, a conservative promise' (Heritage Foundation), reveals the goals of the group that directs Trump for 2030. The book, a collection of strategic essays, is extensive and time-consuming to read, but necessary to understand the current situation. Cossío notes that the Trump of 2025 is more ambitious and complex than the one in 2016-2020, with plans to attack top American universities, repeat the 'reloaded' narrative with Mexico, and implement a new global tariff project. The book, which repeats the phrase 'Mexico's moment of glory ended with the triumph of narco-trafficking,' aims to portray Mexico as a migration problem, not a commercial partner. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has detailed a plan to regain control of the US, with the voice of Steve Bannon, a former advisor to Trump, in the background. Cossío suggests reading and studying the book to understand the enemy's plan and to form groups of thought, write, and discuss the implications.

**World coming up short on promised marine sanctuaries**
A global target of having 30% of the oceans protected by 2030 is at risk of not being met, with only 8.4% of the oceans currently protected. Conservationists say that countries like the US are reversing course and abandoning efforts to protect marine areas. 'With less than 10% of the ocean designated as MPAs and only 2.7% fully or highly protected, it is going to be difficult to reach the 30% target,' said Lance Morgan, head of the Marine Conservation Institute. The institute's research shows that many MPAs are not effective in protecting fish populations, with only a third of them having levels of protection that would yield proper benefits. Daniel Pauly, a professor of fisheries science, said that MPAs have not been proposed for the protection of biodiversity, but rather to increase fish catches. He emphasized the importance of fishing bans in MPAs, but noted that such restrictions account for only 2.7% of the ocean's area. The NGO Oceana is calling for a ban on bottom trawling, a technique that involves towing a heavy net along the sea floor, churning it up. A recent WWF report said that just 2% of European Union waters were covered by MPAs with management plans, highlighting the need for governments to back their words with action.

**Accelerated Decarbonization Project to be Submitted in 2025: 'Ending Coal-Fired Thermoelectric Plants'**
President Gabriel Boric announced that the accelerated decarbonization project will be submitted to Congress in the second half of 2025. He emphasized that the goal of a carbon-free energy matrix by 2040 is challenging but achievable, and that it will be driven by private investment and economic development. Boric mentioned the possibility of advancing the goal to 2035 or even earlier, depending on institutional conditions. He stated that 'while there are more clean energy projects, we will be able to decarbonize sooner and at the same time reduce the rise in tariffs.' Boric also noted that 'with the collaboration of all sectors, we could not only meet the goal set by President Piñera for 2040, but also advance it to 2035 or earlier, depending on the institutional verification of the conditions.' He concluded by saying that 'with this, we will achieve an unprecedented energy transition at the global level.'

**US Treasury Secretary Confident US Will Never Default on Debt**
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the US government will never default on its debt, despite the lack of a decision on raising its debt ceiling. 'The United States will never default, this will never happen', he said in an interview with CBS News. Bessent added that the US authorities 'are on a warning path and will not hit a wall'. According to the International Monetary Fund's calculations, the US government debt will increase to 122.5% of GDP by 2025 and continue to rise, reaching 128.2% by 2030. Earlier, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the country's government debt is on an 'unsustainable trajectory', but has not yet reached an unacceptable level, and it is unknown when this threshold will be crossed.

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**California Environmental Law & Policy Update 5.23.25**
The US Senate has blocked California's plan to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, setting up a potential legal battle. The decision will impact 11 other states that intended to follow California's lead, accounting for 40% of the US auto market. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta have vowed to challenge the Senate's action. The Senate also voted to prevent California from requiring half of new trucks to be electric by 2035 and limiting emissions of nitrogen oxide from cars and trucks. President Donald Trump is expected to sign these measures into law.

**US Senate votes to block California 2035 electric vehicle rules**
The US Senate has voted to block California's plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, which has been adopted by 11 other states. The plan, which aims to have at least 80% electric vehicles by 2035, was granted a waiver by the US Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden in December. The vote sends the measure to President Donald Trump to repeal the waiver. This move could impact the US auto market, which represents a third of the country's vehicle sales.

**US Senate Rejects California's 2035 Zero-Emission Car Plan**
The US Senate has rejected a bill that would have required all new cars sold in California to be 'zero-emission' by 2035. The bill, which was passed by the California legislature in 2022, was backed by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom. California is the state with the most electric vehicles in the US, and has had a stricter environmental standard system in place for over half a century. The Senate's decision revokes an exception to the Biden administration's rule banning internal combustion engine cars by 2035. The only Democrat to vote in favor of the bill was Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah said, 'Because of their market share, the California ban on selling internal combustion engine cars will affect the entire country.' He added, 'But Gavin Newsom doesn't have the power to screw over the other 49 states.' The text has been sent to the White House and is expected to be signed into law by Trump. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the Republican decision, saying it 'will give China the upper hand in the US auto industry.' The dispute may ultimately end up in court. Trump has repeatedly called climate change a 'scam' and has expressed a desire to drill for oil at will. He is also a well-known critic of electric vehicles and has abandoned the goal of selling 50% electric vehicles in the US by 2030 set by his predecessor Biden.

**US Senate Votes to Block California's Ban on Gas-Powered Vehicles**
The US Senate has voted to prevent California from banning the sale of gas-powered vehicles in favor of electric ones. The resolution, passed by Republicans, reverses an exception made by the Biden administration regarding the ban on gas-powered vehicles by 2035. Senator Elissa Slotkin, from Michigan, was the only Democrat to vote in favor. Senator Mike Lee stated, 'Because of their market share, this ban on gas-powered vehicle sales in California would affect the entire country.' He added on X, 'But Gavin Newsom doesn't have the power to ruin the 49 other states.' The resolution is now headed to the White House, where it is expected to be signed by Donald Trump. Governor Newsom had denounced the decision as 'giving up American dominance in the automotive industry to China and choking the lungs of our children.' The dispute may end up in court. Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called climate change a 'scam,' campaigned in 2024 on his promise to drill for oil at will and is a well-known critic of electric vehicles. Since returning to power, he has abandoned the goal set by his predecessor, Joe Biden, to sell 50% of electric vehicles in the US by 2030. The US Transportation Department has also suspended a program to fund the construction of charging stations for electric vehicles, which was voted on in 2022 by Congress as part of a landmark law of Joe Biden's mandate. California and 16 other US states had already launched lawsuits against the Trump administration in early May, accusing it of illegally blocking $5 billion in funding for these infrastructure.

**What to know about the US Senate's effort to block vehicle-emission rules in California**
The US Senate is expected to vote on a measure to block California's rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The rule, which requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, has been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and is supported by several states, including New York, Colorado, and New Mexico. However, Senate Majority Leader John Thune argues that the rule is an 'improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority' and would 'endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation's energy supply.' California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state air regulators say the measure is illegal and will likely sue if it advances. The Biden administration restored California's ability to enforce its standards in 2022, and the state has set a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2045. However, the state remains far short of what is eventually needed, with only about 84,000 public electric vehicle chargers in the state, but needing 1.2 million by 2030 to support the EV transition.

The rule, which requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, has been in place since 2022 and aims to reduce planet-warming emissions.

Several states, including New York, Colorado, and New Mexico, have announced plans to follow California's policies. However, critics argue that the nation's grid cannot handle the surge in electric vehicles and that the rule is unfeasible. Newsom's administration argues that the state is building out an electric grid and charging infrastructure to support the transition.

**Delhi Takes Action Against Pollution: Ban on Gasoline and Diesel Vehicles by 2035**
The city of Delhi, with 32 million inhabitants, is trying to breathe: it has already planned to ban internal combustion engines by 2035, but in the meantime, it proposes a drastic law. According to the latest available data, 16 million Italian drivers would be on foot. Delhi's Minister of the Environment, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, has announced plans to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2035 and to stop refueling vehicles over 15 years old. In the meantime, 900 new electric buses and 5,000 of the 7,500 vehicles will be powered by clean fuels by 2025, 2026, and 2027. The city also plans to ban tuk-tuks by 2030 and 2035. Delhi is taking action to reduce pollution, as stated by Minister Sirsa, 'We are taking a big step towards a cleaner and healthier Delhi.'

**12 US States Are Planning to Ban the Sale of Gas-Powered Cars**
Twelve US states have announced plans to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035, following California's lead. The states are California, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. These states have adopted California's Advanced Clean Cars II regulations, which require 35% of new cars to be zero-emission by 2026, 68% by 2030, and 100% by 2035. The ban does not affect existing vehicles or prevent the purchase of used cars. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. President Joe Biden has set a goal of having half of all new vehicle sales in the US be electric by 2030. Automakers such as General Motors, Stellantis, and Mercedes-Benz have announced plans to phase out gas-powered vehicles in the coming years.

**Waiver Allowing California Gas Car Ban by 2035 Poised for Reversal**
The Biden administration's waiver allowing California to ban gas cars by 2035 is poised for reversal due to a Congressional review. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is following the law by sending the waivers to Congress, which has a 60-day window for review. The waivers, approved by the previous administration, would have increased costs for consumers and impacted 12 states and the District of Columbia. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said, 'The Biden administration failed to send rules on California's waivers to Congress, preventing members of Congress from deciding on extremely consequential actions that have massive impacts and costs across the entire United States.' The waivers would have implemented the Advanced Clean Cars II policy, which aims to move new car sales to zero emissions by 2035, and the Advanced Clean Fleets policy, which regulates trucking fleets. A third rule would have reduced nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel-powered trucks by 90%.
