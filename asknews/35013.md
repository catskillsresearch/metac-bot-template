**2025 AI capex outlook remains strong, Nvidia, Broadcom top picks- BofA By Investing.com**
Bank of America (BofA) analysts predict a strong outlook for data center and artificial intelligence spending demand in 2025, citing positive indicators from major U.S. hyperscalers. BofA's top picks for this trend are AI chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom, with AMD and Marvell Technology Inc also benefiting from expanded spending. Despite concerns over slowing spending, BofA expects total AI capex spending to reach $414 billion in 2025, a 44% increase from last year, and $432 billion in 2026. The analysts note that major hyperscalers such as Google, Microsoft, and Meta have reaffirmed or increased their capex outlooks for 2025, while Amazon has maintained its $105 billion outlook. BofA analysts wrote, 'We expect AI scaling to continue on: 1) traditional pre/post-training of frontier models (model sizes 2x every six months), 2) derivative models (like DeepSeek), 3) test-time scaling for inference (up to >100x more tokens generated vs. normal inference), and 4) sovereign/enterprise AI which are still in their early innings.'

**Visualizing AI vs. Human Performance In Technical Tasks**
AI systems have made rapid advancements over the past year, surpassing human performance in technical tasks such as advanced math and visual reasoning. According to a graphic by Visual Capitalist's Kayla Zhu, AI models have improved significantly in various technical tasks, with the only exception being multimodal understanding and reasoning. However, the gap is closing quickly, with OpenAI's o1 model scoring 78.2% on a benchmark that evaluates models on multi-discipline tasks, just 4.4 percentage points below the human benchmark of 82.6%. As noted by OpenAI, the o1 model has one of the lowest hallucination rates out of all AI models, and this is a major improvement from Google Gemini's score of 59.4% at the end of 2023.

**OpenAI's o3 Model Falls Short of Promised Performance on Complex Math Tasks**
OpenAI's new AI model o3, presented as a powerful tool for complex tasks, has shown more modest results in comparison to the claims made in December. According to the independent research group Epoch AI, the model performed well on only about 10% of the tasks in the FrontierMath dataset, which is significantly less than the 25% claimed by OpenAI. The company explained that the presented results were achieved with increased computational resources, which are different from those available in the public version of o3 released last week. OpenAI stated that the current version is optimized for practical use and response speed, not for high test scores. However, the fact remains that the available user version of the model shows much more modest results than previously demonstrated.

**OpenAI's o3 Model Falls Short of Claimed Performance in FrontierMath Test**
OpenAI claimed that its model, o3, achieved a 25% score in the FrontierMath test, a new record. However, the actual score was 10%, which is less than half of what OpenAI claimed. This discrepancy has sparked debate about the validity of standardized performance tests. Epoch AI, the company that developed the FrontierMath test, notes that even the best AI models have only managed to answer 9% of the questions correctly in a single attempt. OpenAI's model may have used more powerful computing resources to achieve the higher score, but the commercial version of the model may have been optimized for energy efficiency, which could have reduced its performance. ARC Prize, the organization behind the ARC-AGI test, has also weighed in on the issue, stating that the released model, o3, is different from the one they tested in December 2024. They plan to retest the model and publish the updated results.

**OpenAI's o3 Model: A Lesson in Transparency and Benchmarking**
OpenAI's new AI model, o3, was announced to have achieved a 25% success rate in the challenging FrontierMath test, doubling the previous best result. However, when the commercial version of the model was released, it only achieved a 10% success rate, sparking controversy and criticism about the transparency of benchmarks in AI development. According to ARC Prize, the model used for the internal tests was more powerful than the one released to the public, with a 'level of computation' that was significantly higher. OpenAI has promised to collaborate with entities like ARC Prize to reevaluate their models publicly. The incident highlights the importance of clear communication about what is being measured, with what tools, and under what conditions, to ensure that users, developers, and companies can trust the real capabilities of AI.

**OpenAI's o3 claimed 25%, independent test says "try 10"**
OpenAI's o3 AI model scored lower on the FrontierMath benchmark than initially claimed, according to independent tests by Epoch AI. While OpenAI claimed o3 could answer 25% of FrontierMath questions, Epoch's tests found it scored around 10%. The discrepancy may be due to differences in testing setups or the version of o3 used. OpenAI's chief research officer, Mark Chen, stated that o3 achieved over 25% in 'aggressive test-time compute settings.' However, the public o3 model is 'tuned for chat/product use' and has smaller compute tiers than the version tested by OpenAI. OpenAI plans to release a more powerful o3 variant, o3-pro, in the coming weeks. This incident highlights the need for caution when interpreting AI benchmarks, particularly when they are used to promote commercial products.

**The Limitations of Current AI Benchmarks: An Expert's Perspective**
The benchmark for AI models, Chatbot Arena, has ranked Gemini 2.5 Pro as the most intelligent AI model, with a score of 1,440 points. However, experts argue that the current benchmarks do not accurately measure the true capabilities of AI models. Jaime Sevilla, CEO of EpochAI, suggests that the current benchmarks are too easy for humans but difficult for AI models, and that new benchmarks like FrontierMath, which consists of 300 complex math problems, are needed to truly test AI capabilities. Sevilla also emphasizes the importance of measuring the 'agentive behavior' of AI models, or their ability to perform tasks autonomously. He believes that the current trend of AI improvement will continue, and that in less than a decade, AI models will be able to complete complex tasks independently. Sevilla also disputes the idea that AI models do not generate new knowledge, but rather combine existing data to 'regurgitate' their responses, citing FrontierMath as an example of AI models combining knowledge in new and innovative ways.

**Don't over-update on FrontierMath results -- LessWrong**
The author, an employee of the European AI Office, reflects on the recent results of the FrontierMath benchmark, which showed that AI models, such as o3-mini (high), achieved high scores, but struggled with real-world math problems. The author suggests that the discrepancy between the benchmark scores and real-world performance may be due to the nature of the problems on the benchmark, which are often easy to solve and require less creativity than real-world math problems. The author also notes that the benchmark may not be a good indicator of the AI's true capabilities, and that it's difficult to interpret the results without a deep understanding of the domain. The author proposes several ways to improve benchmarks, such as making them more representative of real-world problems and providing more context for the results.

**Did OpenAI Cheat on Its Big Math Test? - Decrypt**
OpenAI's o3 model achieved a 25.2% score on the FrontierMath benchmark, but it has been revealed that OpenAI helped create the benchmark and had access to its problems and solutions. Epoch AI, the company behind FrontierMath, acknowledged OpenAI's support in creating the benchmark, but this raised red flags among enthusiasts. OpenAI had hired Epoch AI to provide 300 math problems and their solutions, and while they claimed not to have used the questions and answers to train o3, experts note that access to the test materials could still allow performance optimization. Tamay Besiroglu, associate director at Epoch AI, said that OpenAI had initially demanded that its financial relationship with Epoch not be revealed, and that they had a verbal agreement that the materials would not be used in model training. However, Elliot Glazer, Epoch AI's lead mathematician, believes that OpenAI was true to its word and that the score is legit. The issue raises concerns about the validity of AI model evaluations, as it is impossible to properly assess how powerful or accurate their models truly are.

**OpenAI quietly funded independent math benchmark before setting record with o3**
OpenAI's involvement in funding FrontierMath, a leading AI math benchmark, was only revealed after the company announced its record-breaking performance on the test. The benchmark's developer, Epoch AI, acknowledges they should have been more transparent about the relationship. OpenAI's o3 model achieved a 25.2% success rate on the benchmark's challenging math and logic problems, a massive jump from previous models. Epoch AI had signed an agreement preventing them from revealing OpenAI's financial support until o3's announcement. However, the more than 60 mathematicians who helped create the benchmark problems remained in the dark about OpenAI's involvement, even after o3's announcement. Epoch AI's Tamay Besiroglu admits they made mistakes and promises to improve transparency in future collaborations. 'We should have pushed harder for the ability to be transparent about this partnership from the start, particularly with the mathematicians creating the problems,' he writes. 'For future collaborations, we will strive to improve transparency wherever possible, ensuring contributors have clearer information about funding sources, data access, and usage purposes at the outset,' Besiroglu adds. The situation highlights the complexity of AI benchmarking and the need for complete openness from the start, especially since mathematical reasoning is a major weakness of language models.
