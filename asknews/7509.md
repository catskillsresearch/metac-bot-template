**Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin to Reach $250,000 by End of 2025**
Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX, predicts that the price of Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2025. Hayes made this statement at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, where he also mentioned that he believes US President Donald Trump's administration will shift its focus from tariffs to monetary policy. Hayes stated that the Fed will increase money printing, which will lead to new economic incentives for the public. He also mentioned that the potential re-listing of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are currently under government control, could provide cheap liquidity to the housing market and increase interest in riskier assets. Additionally, Hayes suggested that the US government may impose taxes on foreign investments in US Treasury bonds, stocks, and real estate, which could increase demand for gold and Bitcoin. Finally, Hayes mentioned that the US government may relax the leverage limits on banks, allowing them to use 'nearly unlimited leverage' to invest in US Treasury bonds. Hayes believes that this policy change would be highly positive for global capital markets. This prediction is in line with a similar statement made by billionaire investor Tim Draper, who also believes that the Trump administration will introduce more favorable regulations for Bitcoin and that many companies will adopt Bitcoin as a reserve currency.

**6 In 10 Americans Fear Social Security Will Vanish Before They Retire, As 2033 Insolvency Clock Ticks Louder - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)**
A recent survey by DepositAccounts found that 59% of working-age Americans fear that Social Security will not exist by the time they retire, with 70% of Generation X sharing this concern. The anxiety is driven by the program's main trust fund's depletion in 2033, which would leave incoming payroll taxes covering only 79% of promised checks. Jaime Eckels, a certified-financial-planner, warned that the countdown has moved from abstract to immediate for many savers, saying, 'It's not that far away. We're creeping up on it.' However, not all gauges are as bleak, with the 2025 Retirement Confidence Survey finding that about half of workers remain at least 'somewhat confident' that the government will pay benefits of equal value to today's. Despite this, 60% of workers worry about cuts to Social Security benefits. Analysts stress that insolvency does not equal disappearance, with LendingTree's Matt Schulz saying, 'The truth is that it's highly, highly unlikely Social Security 'won't be available.'

**AI Energy Consumption to Surpass Bitcoin Mining by 2025, Study Warns**
According to a new study, the energy consumption of AI systems is growing faster than expected and could surpass that of Bitcoin mining by the end of 2025. By then, AI will account for almost half of the global energy consumption of data centers, up from 20% currently. The study's author, Alex de Vries-Gao, criticizes the lack of transparency from tech companies about the actual energy costs of AI applications. He draws parallels with the cryptocurrency industry, where the 'bigger is better' approach has led to environmental degradation. The study warns that the US market could see a 25% increase in energy consumption from AI, Bitcoin mining, and traditional data centers by 2030. However, it's not just the amount of energy that matters, but also its source. For example, a search query in West Virginia generates almost twice as much CO2 emissions as the same query in California, where renewable energy dominates. Despite progress in efficiency and sustainability, the study finds the situation alarming. The global energy consumption of data centers could reach the level of Japan's total energy demand by 2026, according to the International Energy Agency. Additionally, the increasing demand for specialized chips and other components drives up the demand for rare earth materials, while water consumption for cooling systems is also on the rise. In some regions, the establishment of data centers and their water consumption is already in conflict with the needs of the local population.

**US Plans to Create Strategic Bitcoin Reserve**
The US is planning to accumulate Bitcoin and not share it with anyone, according to officials in Washington. The goal is to create a strategic reserve of cryptocurrency, and the Trump administration has already taken steps to achieve this. The reserve will consist of around 200,000 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $16.5 billion. The move is seen as a way to diversify the country's financial assets, protect against inflation and economic instability, and promote technological leadership. The initiative also aims to help the US pay off its national debt. According to analysts, the creation of the Bitcoin reserve could lead to a surge in the cryptocurrency's price, as investors become more interested in it. The move is also seen as a way for the US to counter the growing influence of alternative financial systems in Russia and China. 'We want to accumulate as much as possible and not sell a single Bitcoin,' said Bo Haines, executive director of the White House Council on Digital Currencies, at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. 'This is a strategic reserve, and we will not share it with anyone.'

**Why stablecoin regulation might be the best thing for crypto**
The U.S. Senate is advancing the Genius Act, a landmark legislation that sets clear rules for stablecoins, aiming to bring stability and institutional trust to the crypto market. Analysts predict the stablecoin market could hit $2.5 trillion by 2030, up from $150 billion today. This regulation opens the door for traditional banks and finance giants to enter the stablecoin game, with full regulatory blessing. FOHLE, a wallet service, is already ahead of the curve, planning to integrate regulated coins in a compliant and user-friendly way, ensuring simplicity for users and compliance under the hood.

**From Taxation To Confiscation: Europe's Wealth Exodus & The Coming Asset Seizure**
Europe's deindustrialization and bankruptcy continue, with the next step being asset seizure. Governments are raising taxes, including wealth taxes, but individuals are leaving the country to avoid them. Norway's experience shows that raising wealth taxes can lead to a loss of tax revenue as individuals with wealth leave the country. Spain has recorded a negative millionaire migration, and the UK has lost 12,500 high-net-worth individuals in 2023, with 9,500 more expected to leave in 2024. The proposed solution is an exit tax for citizens leaving the country, but the author believes the next step will be confiscation. The EU has already taken steps towards confiscation, including requiring citizens to register all their assets in a central register and eliminating cash. The author advises buying Bitcoin and self-custodying it to avoid seizure.

**Global Stablecoin Payment Market Exceeds $128 Trillion, Expected to Continue Growing**
The global stablecoin payment market has grown rapidly, exceeding $128 trillion in the past two years. According to Artemis, a blockchain data analysis company, the total stablecoin payment amount from 2023 to 2025 is $94.2 billion. Among these, B2B transactions accounted for the largest share, with $36 billion annually. Card-linked stablecoin payments also showed rapid growth, exceeding $13.2 billion annually. As the use of stablecoins in real-world economies increases, governments and traditional financial institutions are also showing growing interest. In the US, stablecoin regulation bills are being discussed, and the UAE and EU are also allowing the issuance of some stablecoins, accelerating institutional entry. US Vice President J.D. Vance said at the recent 'Bitcoin 2025' event, 'Stablecoins do not threaten the dollar and strengthen it.' He also stated, 'The Genius Act will bring stablecoin activity to the US, strengthening the dollar's position.' Stablecoins are backed by collateral to maintain their value, with most dollar-based stablecoins, including USDC, backed by US Treasury bonds. In terms of market share, Tether (USDT) dominates the stablecoin market, with a 86.1% market share as of February this year. USDC, issued by Circle, follows closely behind. The stablecoin market has grown 54.5% in the past year, with a market capitalization of $24.73 billion. The market is expected to continue growing, with Citibank predicting that the market will reach $160 trillion by 2030.

**Trump Media and Technology Group to Raise $2.5 Billion for Bitcoin Treasury**
The Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has announced plans to raise $2.5 billion in debt to build a 'Bitcoin Treasury'. This move follows the example of US software company Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has used a combination of stock sales and convertible bonds to raise funds for its Bitcoin holdings. TMTG aims to follow a similar strategy, which minimizes the risk of default while allowing investors to profit from the volatility of the asset. Meanwhile, several US banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and US Bank, are exploring the development of a joint dollar stablecoin to compete with existing players like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). Additionally, the Dubai Land Department has launched a platform for tokenizing real estate, allowing investors to purchase fractional ownership rights in Dubai properties starting at $540. The project aims to digitize $16 billion worth of Dubai's real estate market by 2033. Furthermore, the Sui blockchain was hacked, resulting in a loss of $220 million, which was partially recovered through a vote by SUI stakeholders. The incident has sparked debate about the decentralization of the Sui network. Finally, traditional banks are now offering services for buying and storing cryptocurrencies, providing a more convenient and secure option for investors.

**Reform backs cryptocurrency tax cut as party receives first Bitcoin donations**
Reform UK has pledged to cut taxes on cryptocurrencies and set up a 'Bitcoin reserve' if elected. Party chairman Zia Yusuf said a Reform government would reduce capital gains tax on assets such as Bitcoin to 10%, generating up to £1 billion for the Treasury over a decade. Yusuf also announced that Reform would allow people to pay tax in Bitcoin and establish a 'Bitcoin reserve fund' to 'diversify' the UK's reserve holdings. Party leader Nigel Farage said Reform would begin accepting donations in cryptocurrency, calling for the UK to 'launch in Britain a crypto revolution' and make London 'one of the major trading centres of the world'. Reform has already received its first cryptocurrency donations, which are compliant with Electoral Commission rules.

**Bitcoin Predicted to Reach $1 Million by 2030: Experts Weigh In**
Several financial commentators and investment analysts are predicting a long-term price increase for Bitcoin, potentially reaching $1 million by 2030, driven by growing inflation and expanding global debt. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, predicts a price of $1.5 million by 2030 in the 'Bull Case' scenario, requiring a 58% annual growth rate over the next five years. Robert Kiyosaki, a popular financial educator and author of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', predicts a more modest price of $1 million by 2035. Kiyosaki believes that the increasing national debt and credit card debt in the US will lead to a search for protection assets like precious metals and Bitcoin. Other analysts, including Raoul Pal, point to the devaluation of fiat currencies as a key reason for Bitcoin's appeal as a protection asset. Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, also predicts that Bitcoin will reach $1 million, highlighting its potential to 'transform the global economy in incredible ways'. Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, notes that the next significant resistance for Bitcoin is near $122,000, based on recent price movements. André Dragosch, European research head at Bitwise, predicts that Bitcoin could extend its rally to a top above $200,000 by the end of 2025, citing the increasing concerns about sovereign credit risk and institutional flows.

**Bitcoin Volatility: US Fiscal Policy and National Debt Drive Market Uncertainty**
The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been volatile, reaching $107,000 on May 19, its highest point since January, before dropping to $103,000. This volatility is occurring on the fifth week of a net influx of capital into Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as macroeconomic uncertainty surrounding US fiscal policy and the growing national debt. 'While Bitcoin is fluctuating just below new highs, we expect high volatility on the market as traders prepare for new trade deals and the final version of fiscal policy,' said Coindesk, citing HashKey Business Group director Hayaan Ru. Despite the volatility, investors are transferring capital to Bitcoin, according to Ru, as concern grows over the US national debt increasing by trillions of dollars. This is happening in the context of a proposed US tax law. On Sunday, May 18, President Donald Trump's tax-cutting bill received approval in Congress and may be voted on in the House of Representatives as early as this week. Reuters reported that the initiative would add between $3 trillion and $5 trillion to the country's national debt over the next decade. Two days earlier, international rating agency Moody's downgraded the US credit rating from AAA to A1 due to concerns over the growing national debt. They expect the debt to grow to around 134% of the US GDP by 2035, compared to 98% in 2024. Historically, the growth of the US national debt has correlated with the growth of Bitcoin's price. Many experts have made long-term predictions based on this correlation, such as BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes, who believes that the inability of the US to 'rein in spending' will cause the price of Bitcoin to reach $1 million by 2028.

**2030 Could Be the Year Bitcoin Mining Turns Eco-Friendly - Crypto News Flash**
Bitcoin mining is expected to be 70% powered by renewable energy by 2030, with companies relocating and scaling hydro-powered facilities to achieve this goal. However, geopolitical challenges, such as US tariffs on mining machines from Southeast Asia, and the Trump family's involvement in the mining sector, pose obstacles to this shift. While the transition to green energy is underway, it is not without its environmental costs, and the question remains: how clean is really clean? 'The goal is not just profit, but also political and economic positioning,' said Eric Trump, Chief Strategy Officer of American Bitcoin, a company launched by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. in partnership with Hut 8.

**25% of Major Companies Might Hold Bitcoin by 2030. But Should You Buy It? | The Motley Fool**
According to Elliot Chun, a partner at Architect Partners, by 2030, approximately 25% of companies in the S&P 500 will hold Bitcoin as a long-term asset on their balance sheet. This would be a significant trend, as it would mean a large cohort of the world's largest players would be invested in Bitcoin. The adoption of Bitcoin by corporate actors and financial institutions is accelerating, and if they decide to hold Bitcoin, they will be buying a vast quantity as a group, which would increase the price. Chun notes that companies are unlikely to sell their coins unless it's absolutely necessary, as they would have to pay capital gains taxes. Instead, they are more likely to use the value locked in their Bitcoin as collateral to borrow against, which would have very bullish consequences if it comes true. To benefit from this potential trend, investors can buy and hold Bitcoin, even if the predicted amount of purchasing activity doesn't occur, as a small amount of additional demand can generate significant increases in the asset's value.

**Ultra Rich Flock to Experimental City for Gene Therapies, Raising Ethical Concerns**
The island of Roatan in the Caribbean, home to the city of Prospera, has become a hotspot for the ultra wealthy, where they can undergo experimental gene therapies banned in the US. The city, which uses Bitcoin as its official currency and has low taxes, offers a range of treatments, including one that claims to extend human lifespan. Bryan Johnson, a well-known bihacker, has undergone this treatment and is reportedly satisfied with the results. However, the local population is concerned, saying that the influx of wealthy tourists has not brought them any economic benefits and has instead created an exclusionary environment. The city's population is expected to reach 38,000 by 2030, but the experimental city has also raised ethical and legal concerns.

**US Could Hold 25% of Bitcoin by 2035, Says Michael Saylor**
Michael Saylor, a prominent figure in the crypto world, has proposed a plan to include Bitcoin in the US national reserves. The Treasury and Commerce Departments are considering this idea, which could see the US hold 5% to 25% of all Bitcoin by 2035. This strategic reserve could potentially grow to $16 trillion to $81 trillion by 2045, helping to tackle the country's debt. Saylor believes that this move would boost the US economy and keep it at the forefront of global finance. He also emphasized the need for businesses to be able to create digital assets without permission, for exchanges to trade and hold them freely, and for banks to offer crypto services instead of blocking them. According to Saylor, this plan could bring in $10 trillion in new markets, $20 trillion in securities growth, $10 trillion for the dollar, and $20 trillion in wealth from Bitcoin.

**VanEck research reveals if Strategic Bitcoin Reserve can pay off US debt by 2049**
VanEck research suggests that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, introduced by Sen. Cynthia Lummis, may offset 18% of the national debt by 2049, assuming the government collects one million bitcoins in five years and holds them for 20 years. However, to fully pay off the national debt, the government would need to purchase over five million bitcoins. Donald Trump has claimed that Bitcoin could pay off trillions of U.S. debt, but experts say this is unlikely due to the limited supply of Bitcoin and the difficulty of accumulating such a large amount. As Sen. Lummis noted, the goal is to reduce debt, not cover it entirely. The research also highlights the challenges of exchanging a large amount of bitcoins for cash, which could negatively impact the price and reduce the value of the remaining reserves.

**What's Next for Crypto in 2030?**
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is expected to experience volatility in the next few years, with estimates ranging from US$66.14 to US$3,681 by 2030. Despite this, BCH remains relevant due to its focus on fast transactions and low fees. However, its future depends on adoption rates and competition with other scalable blockchains. The regulatory environment will play a crucial role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency, with governments implementing policies to protect consumers and promote innovation. Tighter regulations may curb illicit uses, while favorable regulatory environments could drive mainstream adoption, ultimately establishing the legitimacy of the industry.

**Bitcoin to Get to Several Billion People by 2030, Says Brian Armstrong**
Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes that Bitcoin adoption will reach several billion people by 2030, citing the current rate of growth. Armstrong agrees with Mario Nawfal's projection that crypto adoption is 43% faster than mobile phones and 20% faster than the internet, with 300 million users in just 12 years. Armstrong notes that the forecast depends on how one defines the 'official year' of introduction for Bitcoin, the internet, and mobile phones. He says that the projection is 'directionally correct' and that the current rate of growth suggests that Bitcoin will reach a large number of people in the coming years. The growth of the crypto industry is being driven by factors such as younger generations, inflationary fears, and the pro-crypto stance of the current administration in the United States.
