**Kremlin Announces Russian Delegation's Visit to Istanbul for Ukraine Talks**
The Kremlin announced that the Russian delegation has set a date for their visit to Istanbul, where they will hold negotiations with Ukraine on June 2nd. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitriy Peskov stated that the European security issue requires discussion with Europeans, saying, 'We cannot do it without them. However, the direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations will be the main agenda at the meeting in Istanbul on Monday.' Peskov emphasized that the Russian delegation is preparing for the negotiations in Istanbul on June 2nd, saying, 'The Russian negotiation team is heading to Istanbul; they will be ready for the second round of negotiations on Monday morning.' When asked about the possibility of a summit between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenskiy, and US President Donald Trump in Turkey, Peskov replied, 'Before such a meeting, it is necessary to achieve results from the direct talks between the two delegations. If results are achieved, we can certainly talk about high-level meetings.'

**Russian Negotiators to Travel to Istanbul for Second Round of Peace Talks**
Russian negotiators will travel to Istanbul on Monday to participate in the second round of peace talks, although Ukraine has not yet confirmed its presence. 'Our delegation of negotiators will leave for Istanbul. And is ready from morning on Monday to continue the conversations, the second round of negotiations,' said Dmitry Peskov, in his daily telephone press conference. Russia proposed June 2 in Istanbul as the date and location for the meeting, which will follow the one held on May 16 in the same Turkish city. Both parties have confirmed that the memoranda of agreement they agreed to prepare after the telephone conversation between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump on May 19 are ready. 'We expect both projects, the Russian and Ukrainian, to be addressed in the second round,' said Peskov. The same applies to the document with the conditions for a ceasefire declaration on the entire Russian-Ukrainian front. However, Ukraine insists that it wants to study the Russian memorandum before traveling to Istanbul to prepare a balanced response. Moscow considers these demands unjustified, which Kiev has interpreted as a new delaying tactic to continue the current offensive in the Donbás and in northern Ukraine. Peskov also ruled out the presence of European representatives in Istanbul and a quick tripartite summit between Putin, Trump, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until the negotiations produce concrete results. However, he acknowledged that 'regardless, the future of European security will have to be discussed with the Europeans. It's inevitable.' The international press leaked that Russia wants the NATO to commit in writing to stop expanding towards Russian borders, i.e., to renounce the entry of Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova. Among the Russian demands for a ceasefire, Moscow demands that Western countries suspend arms supplies to Kiev, which agreed this week with Germany to jointly manufacture long-range armament.

**Daily Buzz: 27 May 2025**
King Charles III began a two-day visit to Canada, where he will become the first British monarch since 1977 to open the nation's parliament. US President Donald Trump stepped up rare criticism of President Vladmir Putin after Russia unleashed its biggest drone and missile attack to date in Ukraine. Trump called the Russian leader 'absolutely crazy' and warned that if Putin attempts to take over all of Ukraine, it will lead to the 'downfall' of Russia. Chinese electric carmaker BYD's price cuts of up to 35 percent fueled fears of a renewed price war in the highly competitive market of new energy vehicles, sending shares of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers plunging in Hong Kong trading. China's Ministry of Commerce and seven other agencies released a new plan to accelerate the development of 'smart' supply chains across sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, wholesale and retail. The plan aims to cut nationwide logistics costs and boost industrial resilience by promoting AI-powered smart factories, warehousing and retail systems. US President Donald Trump said his tariff policies are not aimed at encouraging domestic production of lower-cost, textile-related goods. 'I'm not looking to make T-shirts. I'm not looking to make socks,' he said. 'We want to make big things. We want to do the AI thing with computers. We are looking to do chips and computers, and tanks and ships.' The US dollar lost further ground against major world currencies after the Trump administration extended the deadline for 50 percent tariffs on the EU from June 1 to June 9. The euro rose as much as 0.55 percent against the dollar, and the yen added a quarter of a point against the greenback. The US dollar index, which tracks the currency against six major rivals, sank 0.3 percent after losing 2 percent last week, as concerns about rising US government debt caused some investors to flee dollar-denominated assets. Tripadvisor said about 8 percent of the 31 million reviews of travel sites and amenities submitted to the company in 2024 were fake, more than twice the number detected in 2022. Becky Foley, vice president of trust and safety at Tripadvisor, said the company's policing process means that not all the fake reviews were published. Some 7 percent of submissions in 2024 were auto-rejected before being posted and another 5 percent were referred to human review, she said.

**US Senators Promise Tougher Sanctions on Russia, 'Putin's Game is Soon to End'**
US Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal visited Ukraine on May 30, 2025, and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Speaking to the press, the lawmakers stated that a bill to impose additional sanctions on Russia for its refusal to cease fire may be considered in the US Congress as early as next week. Graham said that there are congressmen who are ready to move forward with the bill. 'You will see the steps of Congress,' he said. Graham noted that President Donald Trump had said that the next two weeks would be crucial. He expressed doubt about the upcoming meeting in Istanbul, saying that he does not see any peaceful intentions from Russia. 'When these two weeks are over, everyone will understand that Russia is playing against peace, not just the US. We will change the rules of the game for Russia,' he said, adding that 'Putin's game is soon to end.' Graham emphasized that the new sanctions will hurt Russia significantly and will also change the situation for China, which buys Russian energy resources. The new sanctions propose a 500% tariff on goods from countries that continue to import energy resources from Russia. Blumenthal confirmed the plan to impose 500% tariffs, saying that the US Senate's response will be clear and unequivocal. 'Tariffs of 500% against all who buy Russian oil, gasoline, or chemicals,' he said. Blumenthal expressed admiration for the European allies who have called for the US to impose harsher sanctions on the aggressor country. He also urged Washington to provide Ukraine with more Patriot air defense systems, artillery, and aircraft, saying that concrete actions are needed, not just rhetoric. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelensky thanked Graham and Blumenthal for promoting the bill on new sanctions against Russia and noted that the document has already been supported by 82 senators. The head of state stated that the aggressor country is making a mockery of diplomacy, using negotiations as a cover for a new attack.

**Turkey Proposes Leaders-Level Peace Summit in Istanbul**
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has proposed a leaders-level peace summit in Istanbul, hosted by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, following a meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sibiha in Kiev. Fidan said, 'It is possible to crown the meetings held in Istanbul with the participation of Trump, Putin, and Zelenskiy.' Fidan also met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow, where Lavrov suggested holding the next direct talks between Russia and Ukraine on June 2 in Istanbul. Ukraine's Sibiha stated that they want to see a document outlining Russia's proposals for a peace agreement before sending a delegation to Istanbul. US President Donald Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, expressed his expectation that the proposed talks on June 2 in Istanbul will take place. Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenskiy wants to have a direct meeting with Putin. Fidan is also expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenskiy, Prime Minister Denis Şimiyal, and Head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak during his visit to Ukraine. Fidan's meetings in Moscow and Kiev are seen as crucial in turning the current momentum into concrete and result-oriented negotiations, following the first-ever direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on May 16, which was facilitated by US President Donald Trump's pressure. The Ukrainian side has been pushing for leader-level direct talks to end the war, and Zelenskiy reiterated this call on May 28, suggesting a three-way summit with Putin and Trump's participation. However, the Kremlin responded that the talks can only take place if the Russian and Ukrainian delegations reach a concrete agreement.

**Ukraine and Russia: Kiev asks Moscow to share conditions before second meeting**
The war between Russia and Ukraine has reached its 1191 day since it began on February 24, 2022. On May 29, 2025, Kiev asked Moscow to share its conditions before a second meeting. Russia's air defenses shot down 48 Ukrainian drones, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. The minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umérov, asked Russia to deliver a memorandum with the Kremlin's conditions to advance the negotiations. Umérov said, 'We do not oppose more meetings with the Russians and we expect their 'memorandum', so that the meeting is not empty and we can truly advance towards the end of the war.' Donald Trump expressed his disappointment with Vladimir Putin's continuous attacks on Ukraine, saying, 'I am very disappointed, very, very disappointed.' Trump gave Putin two weeks to determine if he has a genuine intention to achieve peace. The US president said, 'In two weeks, we will know if we are following the same path or not, and if we are, we will respond differently.'

**French President Emmanuel Macron to make state visit to UK in July**
French President Emmanuel Macron will make a state visit to the United Kingdom in July, staying at Windsor Castle from 8-10 July. This visit comes as the two countries seek to strengthen ties in the face of Russian aggression and the economic impact of US President Donald Trump's trade policy. Macron's visit will likely precede Trump's, who was invited by King Charles III in February but has yet to set a date. The visit highlights the historic ties between Britain and France, which have been strained in recent years due to Brexit and disagreements over migrants crossing the English Channel. As King Charles said in a 2023 visit to France, 'the alliance between our two countries is more important than ever'.
