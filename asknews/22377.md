**Not Just React or Angular: What It Really Takes to Build for the Web in 2025**
Front-end development has evolved to become a multidisciplinary craft that requires knowledge of system design, motion engineering, real-time rendering, and network-aware architecture. React remains the most popular framework, with a complete ecosystem and tools like Framer Motion, Zustand, and React Three Fiber making it ideal for complex, animated, and immersive experiences. Angular, on the other hand, is favored for large-scale enterprise systems due to its opinionated nature, strict typing, and CLI tooling. In 2025, motion is no longer just a post-development enhancement, but an intentional part of the application's system. Framer Motion and GSAP are the industry benchmarks for orchestrating layout-aware transitions and interactive animations, while Three.js is the industry standard for real-time 3D rendering in the browser. To build world-class front-end systems, developers need to think beyond HTML and components, master animation as architecture, and design systems.

**Russian IT Specialists Can Now Verify Their Skills on 'Gosuslugi'**
Russian IT specialists can now verify their skills through the 'National IT Competencies System' page on the 'Gosuslugi' and hh.ru portals. According to the Ministry of Digital Development, this allows anyone to confirm their IT competencies for free, voluntarily, and regardless of their education level. 'Now, everyone can confirm their IT competencies by passing a test on the special platform... On the 'National IT Competencies System' page on 'Gosuslugi', choose a skill, go to the platform, and take the assessment. You can also do this on the operator's platform website - hh.ru,' the ministry said. Those who pass the test will receive a certificate from the Ministry of Digital Development, which will allow employers to evaluate the level of specialists more accurately, and for job seekers, it will be an additional advantage when looking for a job. The document will be available for a year in the personal account on 'Gosuslugi' in the 'Education' section. Currently, specialists can take the test in five programming languages (Python, Java, SQL, C#, PHP) and 12 theoretical areas. The ministry added that two more programming languages (C++ and Go) and two theoretical areas will be added within a year.

**Standardization without Pain: How Strict Syntax Saves Time and Nerves**
The article discusses the importance of strict syntax in programming languages for team development. The author compares several popular languages, including Java, Kotlin, and Python, from the perspective of their syntactic unambiguity, flexibility, and ability to scale in team development. The author argues that languages with strict syntax, such as Java, are more suitable for large teams because they minimize variability and provide clear rules. In contrast, languages with more flexible syntax, such as Python, can lead to inconsistencies and make it harder for new team members to join. The author also discusses the importance of type systems, parameter passing, and null safety in maintaining code quality and stability. The article concludes that strict syntax is not about limiting creativity, but about creating a solid foundation for effective team work and high-quality results.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment,' the report reads. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer.'

**Is it worth learning Python and how much time does it take?**
Python courses are in high demand due to the language's ease of use and versatility. Python has been used for various tasks, including automating routine tasks, working with files, and processing text data. Today, it is used for more complex tasks such as web application development, scientific computing, and machine learning. According to workers, they will return to office work under certain conditions. This suggests the potential and possibility of its further development. Python is considered not only flexible but also relatively simple, making it attractive to beginners. Key features include a clear syntax, concise code, and an emphasis on readability. In web development, Python enables the easy creation of dynamic web applications. It solves a range of tasks, including creating server-side web application parts, developing AI, web scraping, and automating web application testing. Python is also a great choice for creating microservices due to its simplicity. However, becoming proficient in Python requires a significant amount of time. It is recommended to spend at least 10 hours per week studying, which would take approximately a year. However, with proper guidance from professionals, it is possible to achieve this faster. For example, courses from Mate academy contain valuable information that will be useful during practice. With them, it is possible to learn the basics of Python much faster, especially with persistence. Additionally, there is a free learning program for several categories of citizens, including those over 45 years old, veterans, internally displaced persons, and people with disabilities.

**TIOBE Programming Index News May 2025: Python Hits Major Milestone**
Python has reached a 25.35% share of community interest in programming languages, a major milestone in the TIOBE Programming Community Index. This is the highest share of interest in a programming language in decades, with Python having a more than 15% lead over the next most popular language, C++. According to TIOBE Software CEO Paul Jansen, Python is 'interpreted and thus prone to unexpected run-time errors,' but is still the default language for many domains. The top 10 list of the TIOBE Index remained the same, with C++ and C decreasing in popularity, and Go losing some ground. Rust, which was a contender for the top 10 in 2024, has dipped in popularity and now holds 19th place in the top 20.

**Will Python Remain the Top Programming Language in 2025?**
Python's dominance as the top programming language is being threatened by several challenges. One of the main drawbacks is its speed, being an interpreted language, it is slower than other languages like C and Rust. Additionally, Python lags behind in sectors like cloud computing, memory safety, and data analytics. Languages like Go, Julia, and TypeScript are surpassing Python in these areas. Go is designed by Google and is a popular choice for cloud computing, while Julia excels in scientific computing and data analytics. TypeScript has become the preferred language for large-scale applications due to its enhanced features. As a result, Python is losing ground in the web development sector and its overall dominance is being challenged.

**Can English Dethrone Python as Top Programming Language?**
English has emerged as the top programming language of 2024, according to experts, due to its widespread use in generative AI (GenAI) and its ability to enable developers to create digital solutions using natural language. Andrej Karpathy, co-founder of OpenAI, said 'The hottest new programming language is English' in 2023. Brad Shimmin, an analyst at Omdia, agrees, stating that natural language is the biggest programming language of the year, with GenAI code completion and full-stack development tools enabling developers to use English as a declarative programming language. By 2028, IDC predicts that natural language will become the most widely used programming language, with developers using it to create 70% of net-new digital solutions. However, some experts, such as Eric Newcomer, an analyst at Intellyx, argue that English is not a programming language in the classical sense, but rather a de facto language used in GenAI tools.
