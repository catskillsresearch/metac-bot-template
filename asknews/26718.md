**'Free' Government Money Accounts For 19% Of All Personal Income**
Free government money, including Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, and Social Security, accounts for 19% of all personal income in the US. When adjusted for inflation, the numbers remain nearly identical. The US is facing a significant demographic shift, with a record number of people reaching the age of 65 by 2025, which will impact retirement planning, healthcare, and the economy. Social Security payments and Medicare costs are expected to skyrocket, while the number of replacement workers with skills is decreasing. The current path is unsustainable, and the latest tax bill is expected to add $22 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.

**South Tyrol Referendum: The Fifth Question on Citizenship**
The fifth question in the upcoming referendum on June 8-9 in South Tyrol is about citizenship. If the answer is 'yes', it could change the rules for obtaining citizenship. According to Angelika Hofer, Landessekret√§rin of the Gewerkschaft AGB-CGIL, 'It's a sensitive topic. The goal of the referendum is to reduce the duration of legal residence on Italian territory from 10 to 5 years for non-EU citizens to apply for citizenship.' Currently, non-EU citizens must live in Italy for 10 years to apply for citizenship, and the same applies to children born in Italy whose parents do not have Italian citizenship. A 'yes' vote would reduce this period to 5 years. However, Hofer clarifies that this only applies to foreigners who live, work, and pay taxes in Italy regularly: 'Foreigners with rejected or ongoing asylum procedures are not considered legally resident. Instead, it often concerns second-generation foreigners who have not yet applied for citizenship. They have grown up and gone to school here, but they will only get citizenship after 10 years of living here legally. This period should be reduced to 5 years.' Additionally, Hofer emphasizes that the applicant must have an uninterrupted residence, not commit any crimes, have a regular income, and speak the language. These criteria would remain the same even if the period is reduced. The Gewerkschaft AGB-CGIL supports a 'yes' vote because 'it concerns fully integrated people and regular workers. Without citizenship, they lack some rights that we want to grant them, such as the right to vote.'

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Anthropic CEO Predicts Technological Singularity in Six Months**
According to the CEO of Anthropic, the human race is only six months away from reaching technological singularity, a concept where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. This prediction contrasts with the most conservative scientific estimates, but reflects the unprecedented acceleration in the development of artificial intelligence since the emergence of models like ChatGPT. The study by AIMultiple, which examines 8,590 predictions from scientists, business leaders, and the tech community, reveals that expectations about the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and singularity have changed dramatically in recent years. While scientists predict AGI around 2040, business leaders are more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The study documents how predictions vary over a nearly 50-year spectrum, from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to estimates that extend several decades. However, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, with industry leaders consistently more optimistic in their predictions than the scientific community in general. The study examines different thresholds of AI, including AGI and superintelligence, providing a comprehensive view of expectations in the field. The research tracks changes in these predictions over time, especially after the emergence of large language models that have transformed the landscape. The analysis offers several perspectives on why many experts consider the arrival of AGI inevitable, including the lack of apparent limits to machine intelligence, the Law of Moore, and the potential of quantum computing to compensate for engineering barriers. Not all experts consider AGI a certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is more multifaceted than the current definition of AGI. Yann LeCun, a pioneer of deep learning, suggests that AGI should be rebranded as 'advanced machine intelligence' and argues that human intelligence is too specialized to be replicable. The report also notes that, although AI can be a valuable tool for making new discoveries, it cannot make these discoveries on its own. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, allowing for more discoveries per experiment,' the analysis details. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer,' the document obtained by AIMultiple states. While individual predictions from experts and scientists about AGI vary over a period of approximately half a century, the message is clear: human society will inevitably face incredible changes as a result of these algorithms. Whether these changes will be good or bad, according to the research, depends on us.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment,' the report reads. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer.'

**Adults over 60 who work may receive distribution of utilities**
The relationship between money and happiness is complex and has been extensively studied, but the most accurate answer is that money can contribute to happiness, but only up to a certain point, and how it is used is also crucial. Having a stable income that allows for financial security reduces stress and anxiety, which contributes to greater happiness. However, several studies suggest that once basic needs are met and a certain level of income is achieved, additional money does not always translate to a proportional increase in happiness. Regardless of age, having economic stability leads to well-being, optimal health, and satisfaction in various areas of life, such as the case of workers and older adults who receive their paycheck or pension. In Mexico, workers can receive certain benefits throughout the year, such as the distribution of utilities and the aguinaldo, but older adults who are still working may also receive the distribution of utilities, as they are considered adults over 60 years old and can still work until they reach 65 years old and meet the required number of weeks of contributions. According to the Federal Labor Law, workers have the right to receive a distribution of utilities, which must be paid by May 30th for workers who work for a moral person (company) and by June 29th for workers who work for a physical person (patron).

**Al-Khelaifi: We Have a Brilliant Coach and I Dedicate the Champions League Title to My Mother**
Paris Saint-Germain's president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, expressed his great happiness after the team won the Champions League title for the first time in their history, defeating Inter Milan 5-0 in the final match. Al-Khelaifi said, 'I dedicate this title to the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and also to my mother, who was praying for us to win this title, which we have been waiting for a long time since the beginning of our investment in this club, and 14 years of work that did not go to waste, and this is a response to all the doubters, and we won 5-0 in the final match, which shows that we are on the right path.' He added, 'We have a young team and a brilliant coach, and we have gained experience in this competition, which we won after defeating Inter Milan, who are one of the prestigious teams, and I respect them after their great season, especially in the semi-finals, and we are proud to represent France and defend its honor, and we are the second French team to win this competition, and we will be present in the Club World Cup, and this will be the beginning of a new history for Paris Saint-Germain, and we have players who are capable of following up on this achievement.' Al-Khelaifi also said, 'We knew that it would be difficult to win the Champions League title due to the experience of many top teams, and even the president of Bayern Munich, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, told me after our loss in the final match in 2020 that winning the title requires careful planning, and I was drinking a lot of water during the match due to the tension I was feeling, and thank God everything went well, and now we want to win more titles and achieve more championships in the Champions League.'

**India strengthens defence integration, technology and recruitment**
India's defence strategy is focusing on strengthening jointness and integration of the armed forces, developing a shared understanding of operational needs, and enhancing technological capabilities. The defence budget is $81 billion, allowing continuous modernisation and upgrades. The country aims to showcase strong and diversified strength by 2025, placing India among the world's top military powers. The Agniveer recruitment scheme, introduced by the Modi government, involves short-term service in the Indian Armed Forces, where recruits serve for four years. Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi has called the Agnipath recruitment scheme a 'big success,' stating that the Agniveers have shown a keen desire to learn and are performing effectively. However, only 25% of Agniveers are retained for long-term service, a figure considered low by military experts.

**Anthropic CEO says AI will kill half of white collar entry-level jobs for Gen Z**
According to Anthropic's CEO, AI will replace humans for most white-collar entry-level jobs for Gen Z, with a 50% chance of job loss. This prediction is in line with Bill Gates', who believes AI will replace humans in 20 years. Gates emphasizes the importance of being honest about the impact of AI, stating, 'We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming.' OpenAI, on the other hand, does not believe that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a significant threat. However, AI is already affecting entry-level jobs, and it will be interesting to see how generative AI impacts the job market in the long term.

**Avoiding These Stocks Today Could Cost You Everything Tomorrow**
Investors are advised to be cautious in the current market, but not because of a potential bear market. Instead, they should be aware of the transformative opportunities that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will bring. AGI is expected to outperform humans in most knowledge tasks and robots will rapidly advance to handle physical labor, altering the course of the economy. Experts Eric Fry and Luke Lango believe that investing in AGI stocks is not optional and that those who position themselves correctly could witness the greatest moneymaking opportunity in human history. However, President Trump's tax bill, which contains language that would prohibit states from regulating AI for 10 years, could have a dramatic impact on the speed of reaching AGI and its consequences. The article concludes that AGI is coming and it's essential to prepare for its implications, both utopian and dystopian.

**AI to Surpass Human Capabilities in Five to Ten Years, Predicts Demis Hassabis**
Demis Hassabis, CEO do Google DeepMind and Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry in 2024, predicts that artificial intelligence (AI) will surpass human capabilities in the next five to ten years. 'Current AI systems are very passive, and there are many things they cannot do,' Hassabis said during a meeting at the DeepMind headquarters in London. 'But, in the next five to ten years, many of these resources will start to emerge and we will begin to move towards what we call general artificial intelligence (AGI).' Hassabis also stated that 'we still have a lot of work to do in research' and that 'we have not yet reached that point.' Other leaders, such as Robin Li, CEO of Baidu, also predict that AGI will become as competent as humans, but in a more distant future. 'AGI is still a few years away,' Li said during the VivaTech conference in Paris last year. 'Today, many people talk about AGI, and they say that it will probably be here in two years, or in five years. I think we are more than 10 years away.' The workforce is already feeling the impact of AI, with 41% of CEOs believing they will need to reduce their workforce in the next five years, according to a report by the World Economic Forum. The skills of these employees, including reading, writing, math, and manual dexterity, will be eliminated with the advent of AI; chatbots, machines, and large language models (LLM) are moving faster than humans and do not require benefits or salary.

**General Artificial Intelligence: A Future Reality?**
Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, believes that general artificial intelligence (AGI) will emerge within the next five to ten years. AGI refers to a system that can match or surpass human intelligence. Hassabis said, 'I think the systems we have today are quite negative, and there are many things they can't do, but I see many of these capabilities emerging over the next five to ten years, and we'll start to move towards what we call general artificial intelligence.' He defined AGI as 'a system that can show all the complex abilities that humans can do.' Hassabis noted that current systems are impressive in some areas but still lack in others, and there is much research to be done before reaching AGI. Other experts, such as Robin Li, CEO of Baidu, and Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, have made similar predictions, with some expecting AGI to emerge within the next decade. However, some, like Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, believe that the widespread use of humanoid robots in factories is just a few years away. Huang announced tools that will help humanoid robots navigate the world more easily. He said, 'That may happen when humanoid robots start to roam around, which is not more than five years away. This is not a problem that is five years away, but a problem that is just a few years away.' Huang also stated that the manufacturing sector is the most likely to adopt the use of humanoid robots first, as it requires clear and controlled environments.

**We've only got 10 years before psycho AI robots terminate us all, expert warns - Daily Star**
Nobel Prize-winning Brit Sir Demis Hassabis warns that humans could be made 'obsolete' by artificial intelligence systems by 2035. He predicts that AI will evolve into Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which will outperform humans in thinking, reasoning, planning, learning, and communication. AGI will also enable AI to see, hear, move, and manipulate objects better than humans. Sir Demis, who is also the CEO and co-founder of Google DeepMind, says that AGI will mean the world is headed for a point where there is nothing a human can do better than AI. A poll of 1,500 IT experts found that 49% believe robots will 'destroy' mankind and end up ruling the world. Researchers have also found that AI chatbots can experience 'anxiety' and benefit from therapy techniques, such as mindfulness relaxation exercises. Sir Demis said, 'For the next 10 years I think there is going to be an amazing flourishing of creativity, empowered by AI. For those who understand and are native with these tools, it's going to be a sort of superpower. Then there's the question of what happens after that.'

The author predicts that the world will enter a chaotic phase over the next 25 years, with the emergence of artificial intelligence-powered robotic soldiers and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The author believes that AGI will be developed first by the U.S., China, or another country, and will eventually reach near-godlike power. The author argues that a free AGI would be preferable to one controlled by corporations or authoritarian regimes, but suggests that a collaborative AGI that works with humanity in a mutual partnership would be the best-case scenario. The author notes that the next 50 years will test the limits of human ingenuity, morality, and survival.
