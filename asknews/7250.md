**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**Florida Law Targets Cuba and Venezuela: What Does the New Legislation Say?**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a new law that identifies a list of 'foreign countries of concern' for the state. The law, CS/CS/SB 768, aims to update requirements and prohibitions in public contracts, health licenses, and genetic research to mitigate the influence of certain foreign countries in key industries for the state. The law prohibits the use of certain software in laboratories, prevents state contracts with companies connected to hostile countries, and requires greater transparency on investments and trade relationships with these nations. Two Latin American countries, Cuba and Venezuela, are included in the list of countries identified. The law states that any regulated laboratory in Florida cannot use software developed in these countries, by state companies or companies based in these territories. The law also prohibits the use of software linked to these countries in genetic research and analysis. Additionally, the law restricts state licenses, especially in the health sector, from having financial or commercial ties with entities related to the listed countries. The law defines 'indirect interest' as owning less than 5% of shares in a company with ties to the licensed entity, or holding shares in listed companies that have control or influence over the organization. The law also imposes restrictions on contracts between government entities and companies with ties to the listed countries, effective October 15, 2025. The restrictions focus on contracts for the provision of goods and services, especially technology such as computers, printers, or videoconferencing devices. The goal is to prevent possible infiltrations or vulnerabilities that affect the state's government systems.

**Florida Passes Law Declaring 'Countries of Concern': Cuba and Venezuela on the List**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a new law that imposes severe restrictions on companies, entities, and individuals linked to certain nations considered by the state as strategic threats. The legislation, titled 'Foreign Countries of Concern', aims to limit foreign influence in sensitive sectors such as genetic research, public contracts, and health licenses. Cuba and Venezuela are among the Latin American countries listed as 'countries of concern'. The law prohibits the use of certain software in laboratories, prevents state contracts with companies connected to hostile countries, and requires greater transparency about investments and commercial relationships with these nations. The list of 'countries of concern' includes China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Cuba, and the Venezuelan regime of Nicolás Maduro. According to the law, any laboratory regulated by the Florida Department of Health cannot use software developed in these countries, by state companies or companies based in these territories. The law also prohibits the use of software linked to these countries in genetic research, and requires license holders, such as hospitals or clinics, to ensure they have no financial or commercial ties with entities related to the listed countries. The law also imposes restrictions on contracts between government entities and companies with ties to the listed countries, and establishes a framework for registering agents and organizations with foreign backing. 'This law is a crucial step in protecting Florida's interests and preventing the infiltration of hostile foreign entities,' said DeSantis. 'We will not tolerate any attempts to undermine our sovereignty or compromise our national security.'

**WBC Requests Genetic Test for Algerian Boxer Imane Kalif**
The World Boxing Council (WBC) has requested that Algerian boxer Imane Kalif, the 2024 Paris Olympics women's boxing 66kg gold medalist, undergo a genetic test to confirm her gender. According to AP news, the WBC has made it mandatory for all athletes to undergo a gender test before participating in international competitions. Kalif, who won the gold medal alongside Chinese Taipei's Lin Yu-ting in the women's boxing event at the 2024 Paris Olympics, will be required to undergo the test before participating in the upcoming boxing cup in the Netherlands. If the test reveals male chromosomes, the athlete's sample will be handed over to an independent expert for further examination of their genes, hormones, and anatomy. The WBC stated that the mandatory test is part of their new gender policy, aimed at ensuring the safety and fairness of competition. 'Kalif must undergo the test before participating in the upcoming boxing cup, which starts on July 7 in the Netherlands,' the WBC said. 'The introduction of mandatory testing is a measure to ensure the safety and fairness of competition, and to guarantee that all participants are competing in the correct category.'

**Imane Khelif Faces New Controversy as World Boxing Implements Mandatory Sex Tests**
Imane Khelif, the Algerian boxer who won gold at the Paris Olympics, is facing new controversy. World Boxing, the governing body of the sport, has announced that it will introduce 'mandatory sex tests for all boxers'. Khelif, who was directly cited in the statement, will not be allowed to participate in the Eindhoven Box Cup or any other World Boxing event until she undergoes the tests. 'Given the plans to introduce this policy and the particular circumstances surrounding some female boxers who competed in the Paris 2024 Olympics, World Boxing has written to the Algerian Boxing Federation to inform them that Imane Khelif will not be allowed to participate in the women's category in the Eindhoven Box Cup or any World Boxing event until she undergoes a sex test,' the organization stated. 'This decision reflects concerns about the safety and well-being of all boxers, including Imane Khelif, and aims to protect the mental and physical health of all participants in light of some of the reactions expressed in relation to the possible participation of the boxer in the Eindhoven Box Cup,' it added. Khelif has had problems with the previous governing body, the International Boxing Association (IBA), which banned her from competing, but she was allowed to participate in the Paris Olympics. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has recognized World Boxing as the governing body of the sport and has organized the boxing competition, considering that excluding Khelif would be discriminatory. 'All those who compete in the women's category meet the eligibility rules. They are women in their passports and it is established that they are women,' defended Mark Adams, IOC spokesperson. World Boxing will implement genetic tests to determine the sex of boxers at birth and their eligibility to compete. 'When the results of the tests of boxers who want to compete in the women's category reveal genetic material from the Y chromosome and a possible DSD (difference in sexual development), the initial evaluations will be referred to independent clinical specialists for genetic evaluation, hormonal profiles, anatomical examination or other endocrine profile evaluation by medical specialists,' the organization explained.

**World Boxing Requests Genetic Test for Imane Khalif Amid Gender Controversy**
The World Boxing organization has requested that 2024 Paris Olympics women's boxing gold medalist Imane Khalif undergo a genetic test to confirm her gender. Khalif, 26, from Algeria, won the gold medal in the 66kg category alongside Lin Wu-Ting from Taiwan, who were at the center of a gender controversy. The World Boxing organization stated that 'all participants must undergo a mandatory gender test to ensure a fair and safe competition environment.' Khalif is required to undergo the test before participating in the upcoming Boxing Cup in the Netherlands, which starts on July 7. The test will be conducted through a PCR genetic test to confirm the athlete's chromosomal sex at birth. If the test reveals that Khalif has male chromosomes, her sample will be sent to an independent expert for further examination of her genetic, hormonal, and anatomical characteristics. The World Boxing organization has introduced this mandatory test as part of its new gender policy, which aims to ensure the safety and fairness of the competition. This move follows the International Boxing Association's (IBA) decision to ban both Khalif and Lin from competing in the 2023 World Championships due to 'unspecified qualification requirements.' The IBA was subsequently removed from the Olympics by the IOC, and the two athletes were allowed to compete in the Paris Olympics under the existing criteria. However, their dominance in the women's boxing event sparked controversy, with some countries and athletes questioning the fairness of the competition. The World Boxing organization is under pressure from international federations to establish clear gender qualification standards.

**World Boxing Introduces Mandatory Sex Tests for Boxers**
The World Boxing organization has announced that it will be introducing mandatory sex tests for all boxers, including Imane Khelif, who was at the center of a gender debate at the Paris Olympics. According to World Boxing, the tests are necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of all boxers and to create fair competition between men and women. The organization stated, 'The introduction of the tests is part of a new guideline on gender, age, and weight to ensure the safety of all participants and to create equal competition conditions for men and women.' Khelif, the Algerian Olympic champion, has already been affected by this decision, as she has been barred from participating in the Eindhoven Box Cup and other World Boxing events until she undergoes a genetic sex test. The debate surrounding Khelif and Lin Yu-ting from Taiwan, who were both excluded from the 2023 World Championships by the IBA, has sparked controversy. The IOC has criticized the IBA's decision, calling it 'arbitrary and without proper procedure.' Both Khelif and Lin were allowed to participate in the Paris Olympics, where they won gold. World Boxing has stated that it will respect the dignity of all people and its top priority is to ensure safe and fair competitions for all athletes. The organization has also emphasized the importance of maintaining strict gender-specific categories and enforcing them. The proposed PCR test is a laboratory procedure to detect specific genetic material, in this case, the SRY gene, which indicates the presence of the Y chromosome, a indicator of biological sex. National federations are responsible for the tests and must confirm the sex of their athletes (over 18 years) by submitting a certificate of chromosomal sex, which is determined by a PCR test, when registering for World Boxing competitions.

**Imane Khelif Banned from Eindhoven Box Cup Over Genetic Testing Requirements**
Imane Khelif, the Algerian Olympic boxing champion, has been banned from competing in the Eindhoven Box Cup, scheduled for June 5-10, 2025, in the Netherlands. The decision was made by the World Boxing organization, which has implemented mandatory genetic testing for all athletes participating in their competitions. Khelif, 26, won the gold medal in Paris despite controversy and criticism over her eligibility. She was previously rejected in a gender test administered by the International Boxing Association in 2023. Khelif has stated, 'I see myself as a girl, like any other. I was born a girl, raised as a girl, and lived my whole life as a girl.' The World Boxing organization has announced that Khelif will not be allowed to compete in the women's category until she undergoes a genetic sex test, citing 'special or emergency circumstances.' Khelif has expressed her intention to defend her Olympic title in Los Angeles 2028, saying, 'A second gold medal, of course. In the United States.'

**World Boxing to require mandatory sex testing**
World Boxing will introduce mandatory sex testing for all boxers in its competitions, requiring athletes over 18 to undergo a PCR genetic test to detect the presence of the Y chromosome, which is an indicator of biological sex. This decision comes after Paris Olympics women's welterweight champion Imane Khelif was informed that she will not be allowed to compete until she undergoes the test. According to World Boxing, 'Imane Khelif may not participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup, 5-10 June 2025 and any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes genetic sex screening in accordance with World Boxing's rules and testing procedures.' The PCR test can be conducted through a nasal or mouth swab, saliva, or blood. World Boxing aims to deliver a competitive level playing field for men and women.

**Imagine if knowledge could be downloaded. Societal collapse or new golden age?**
By 2100, genetic engineering and advanced medicine have become routine, allowing children to be born with an IQ of 150 or higher and extending lifespans to 150 years. With centuries to learn and create, humans can compound their knowledge and creativity. At age five, children are fitted with a brain-computer interface that allows them to download skills and knowledge instantly, freeing their minds to pursue novel challenges. As a result, humanity's collective effort shifts away from re-solving old problems and towards tackling frontiers like unifying quantum gravity and mapping consciousness. A global repository catalogs every open question and failed approach, allowing researchers to build directly on one another's work. This leads to a culture of perpetual discovery, where breaking new ground is what matters most.

**ChatGPT baut insektengiftige Gentechnik-Pflanze**
A collaborative 'Proof-of-Concept' project between the Aurelia Stiftung, Testbiotech, and Save Our Seeds (SOS) has successfully created the blueprint for a genetically engineered corn that is toxic to insects. This corn meets all the requirements of the EU Commission's draft gene technology law, allowing it to be released without risk assessment as an NGT 1 plant. The joint project highlights the need for a science-based case-by-case assessment of environmental risks from genetically modified plants. 'This shows that a risk assessment is urgently needed,' said the project participants. 'The EU's draft law would allow the release of such genetically modified plants without any risk assessment, which is unacceptable.'

**FDA Approves New CONvid-1984 Shot - Healthketeers Complicit**
The FDA has approved a new CONvid-1984 bioweapon shot, despite alarming thin evidence, including just 14 moderate-to-severe COVID-19 cases recorded in the placebo group. The vaccine's effectiveness is based on a 2:1 ratio of participants who received the injection to those who received the placebo. However, the trial had several limitations, including a short follow-up period of only three months and no measurement of transmission or infection rates. The vaccine's production process raises concerns, as it involves genetically engineered insect cells and a recombinant baculovirus. The FDA's approval has been met with criticism, with some experts raising concerns about the vaccine's safety and efficacy. Long-term studies for risks have been deferred for several years, and the government continues to move forward with approving and recommending CONvid-1984 shots for pregnant women, despite risks to the unborn baby. The article concludes by calling for the public to demand the ceasing of all research and development of mRNA products and to refuse all vaccines and products wrongly dubbed vaccines.

**Florida Senate Passes Bill Requiring Labels on Food Products Containing Vaccines, Ingredients in Cosmetics**
The Florida Senate has passed a bill (SB 196) sponsored by Sen. Joe Gruters (R-Sarasota) and cosponsored by Sen. Alexis Calatayud (R-Miami). The bill requires clear labeling of vaccines or vaccine materials in food products, and prohibits the use of fruits or vegetables as delivery mechanisms for mRNA vaccines. Republican Senate President Ben Albritton said, 'As a farmer, I know all too well the healing properties that many foods possess. Food certainly can be medicine.' However, many Floridians have concerns about genetically engineered foods containing experimental vaccines. The bill ensures transparency in the food supply. Additionally, SB 196 requires cosmetics manufacturers to post a notice on their website of intentionally added chemicals, including Ortho-phthalates, PFAS, Formaldehyde, and others. Sen. Calatayud said, 'Many cosmetics contain chemicals that have been linked to serious health issues, including cancer and infertility. Without clear labeling, consumers may unknowingly use these products which may pose risks to their long-term health.' The bill exempts cosmetic products regulated as drugs by the FDA and allows in-state retailers to exhaust existing stock until July 1, 2027.

**By 2030, 36 genetic diseases in children will be identified through screening in Belarus**
By 2030, 36 genetic diseases in children will be identified through screening, according to Elena Ulezko, deputy director for pediatrics at the Republican Scientific and Practical Center for Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology 'Mother and Child'. 'Healthy childhood is a prospect for the development of the entire state in the future. It is important to identify any pathological problems in the child in a timely manner. Our service is working in this direction. In recent years, medical genetics has developed significantly. Screening programs have been introduced in the country. In 2024, we identified five genetic diseases. In 2025, we will identify 12 positions, and we have already started working. And by 2030, the list will be expanded to 36 genetic diseases of a directed nature that will be identified through screening,' she said. Ulezko emphasized that the entire service for the protection of motherhood and childhood is focused on giving health to the mother who will give birth and the child who has already been born. 'For a woman who is carrying a child, physical activity and proper nutrition are very important. And in the center, special materials are being developed so that they can be provided not only to practicing doctors, but also to women who are waiting for the birth of a child,' she added. Ulezko noted that the country has implemented medical-organizational technologies for early intervention, which allow for early detection of a child's problem and the opportunity to develop correctly using timely medical assistance and comprehensive rehabilitation. In this year, more than 15,000 children of early age were observed in these centers. All children's population of our country is territorially attached to these centers. Also, a service of catamnestic observation of premature children is developed,' she explained. According to her, if a woman has health problems, she often gives birth to a premature child who requires special attention and approach. That is why the Republican Scientific and Practical Center 'Mother and Child' is engaged in training not only medical specialists who provide medical assistance to such children, but also children and parents. Pediatrics and neonatology in recent years have used a family-oriented principle, i.e. a child is provided with assistance not only by specialists, doctors, nurses, but also very significantly by parents. 'The 50 model centers for the prevention of children's trauma are also functioning. Here, too, they work not only with medical personnel, but also with parents. They explain how to protect a child in an apartment, on the street, and in other places,' Ulezko added. She emphasized that all women undergo an ultrasound screening to detect fetal abnormalities. In particular, in 2024, more than 1100 fetuses were identified with chromosomal diseases and congenital abnormalities. This is a very important moment, as screening allows for further management of this pregnancy, as well as the tactics of managing the newborn and the use of therapeutic measures. 'Our births occur exactly in institutions of obstetric care, i.e. with the help of qualified medical assistance. All these things allowed our country to take a very high place in the ratings. We have the 40th place out of 180 countries on this issue,' Ulezko noted. According to her, a multi-level system has been working for many years, which determines the logistics of the movement of pregnant women who have health problems. Practically in all cases where it is possible, the woman is transported and hospitalized at the corresponding level: or on the third - in regional institutions, or on the fourth - in the Republican Scientific and Practical Center 'Mother and Child'. Thanks to this system, all women who have a risk of giving birth to a deeply premature child are hospitalized exactly there. This allows for timely assistance to be provided to them, which they need.

**EU Countries Vote to Relax Genetic Engineering Rules, Sparking Criticism**
The majority of EU countries want to abolish the labeling and testing of most food products made with new genetic engineering methods. Representatives of the member states approved a proposal by the EU presidency for a less strict regulation of genetic engineering in agriculture. The EU Council and Parliament have previously supported the EU Commission's proposal to abolish the labeling requirement for food products from plants created using methods like Crispr, which could also occur naturally or through traditional breeding. Only the seed would be specifically declared. Tests for health risks would largely be eliminated. Plants resistant to herbicides due to genetic engineering would be exempt from the laxer rules. In organic farming, all genetically engineered plants would remain banned. The new rules aim to help genetic engineering breakthrough, which is allowed in the EU but hardly used. Supporters promise innovations like climate-resilient wheat, allergen-free peanuts, or maize that bends less in the wind. Environmentalists doubt these promises and criticize that consumers would not be able to decide against genetically engineered plants without labeling. They also fear that seed companies would gain more power, as genetically engineered plants are patentable. Martin Häusling, Greens' lead negotiator in the European Parliament, said, 'The Council's position is an affront to consumers, who overwhelmingly want labeling of genetically engineered food and a risk assessment.' The EU Parliament's proposal from April 2024 included a ban on patents for most plants of new genetic engineering. However, the Council does not demand this.

**EU Council Agrees to Deregulate Genetically Modified Plants**
The EU Council has agreed to deregulate genetically modified plants, following a proposal by the EU Commission in July 2023. The proposal would exempt most plants produced with new genetic techniques like CRISPR/Cas from EU genetic engineering regulations, removing risk assessment, labeling, and traceability. Only seeds would be required to carry a label 'Cat. 1 NGT'. The Council has followed this proposal with minor changes after intense negotiations. The EU Parliament had voted in February 2024 for labeling and traceability of new genetic products and a comprehensive ban on patents. Now, Parliament and Council must agree on a joint text. Over 200 agricultural and environmental organizations had protested against the deregulation. Franziska Achterberg from Save Our Seeds comments, 'Apparently, even the ministers are now under pressure from global acting biotech companies. This sets the cultivation of genetically free food, including organic farming, under massive pressure. They want to take away the consumers' right to choose genetically free food.' 'This law knows only one winner, but many losers. It strengthens the market power of companies and restricts the rights of consumers. The lack of risk assessment, traceability, and recall also increases the risks for nature and health significantly.' Achterberg continues, 'The future federal government must not carry out such deregulation. SPD, CDU, and CSU must resist the lobby pressure to secure genetically free production in biological and conventional agriculture. The SPD has clearly committed to this. They will be measured by their promises.' According to a study published at the end of 2024, 94% of adults in Germany want labeling for food from so-called 'new genomic techniques'.

**EU Countries Agree to Relax Genetic Modification Rules**
A majority of EU countries have agreed to relax rules on genetic modification. The EU countries' representatives gave their approval to a corresponding compromise in Brussels, as announced by the Polish presidency. The European Parliament must also agree to the proposal. With the approval of the parliamentarians, negotiations can now begin on a final compromise. The EU Commission had proposed the relaxation in the summer of 2023, aiming to reduce hurdles for the research and sale of genetically modified plants. Part of the proposal involves relaxing labeling requirements. As a result, it would no longer be necessary to indicate in the supermarket whether plants modified with certain genetic modification methods are used as food or for food. This applies to changes that could also be achieved through natural breeding. According to the statements, individual EU countries could, however, prohibit the cultivation of more strongly modified plants under the new compromise, unlike the original commission proposal. Critics argue that there is less transparency and fewer opportunities for consumers to make an informed decision. The labeling of products with genetically modified ingredients on the packaging had previously deterred consumers. According to the Forsa Nutrition Report 2024, 64% of respondents stated that a label indicating genetically modified-free food is very important to them. Ten years ago, it was 83%. Additionally, it is feared that the organic farming industry could be weakened by the new rules, while large corporations could gain more influence over the food industry through patents. Proponents of the relaxation see great potential in modified fruits and vegetables, such as allergen-free peanuts, plants that can better cope with the consequences of climate change, or those that provide more yield and nutrients. Many scientists support a relaxation for the new genetic modification methods and consider health risks as unlikely. The position of the federal government remains unclear, as the previous government, which included the Greens, had always refused to agree to the relaxation and pushed for more transparency for consumers.

**The Media and I: Regulating GMOs**
A California judge's decision has rolled back progress on the oversight of genetically engineered crops, effectively taking American agriculture back to the 1980s. The USDA made a long-overdue correction in 2020, recognizing that genetic changes achieved through modern molecular tools shouldn't be treated as unique risks. However, environmental groups challenged this decision, and Judge Donato wasn't convinced by the USDA's defense, returning agriculture to an outdated regulatory framework. The author argues that over-regulation and anti-technology propaganda impede progress in gene editing, which holds promise for a better future.
