**Trump offers rare praise to European Union after latest threat**
President Donald Trump praised the European Union for setting dates to meet with the administration about a potential trade deal, just days after threatening 50% tariffs on the bloc's goods. Trump had threatened to impose the tariffs on June 1, but delayed them after speaking with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen reportedly wants to 'get down to serious negotiations' and Trump agreed to an extension of the deadline to July 9, 2025. Trump wrote on Truth Social, 'I have just been informed that the E.U. has called to quickly establish meeting dates. This is a positive event, and I hope that they will, FINALLY, like my same demand to China, open up the European Nations for Trade with the United States of America.'

Trump said, 'I felt extremely satisfied with the 50% tariff assignment to the European Union, especially because they were being slow (to put it mildly!) in our negotiations with them.

Since his return to power, Trump has imposed tariffs on his trading partners, some of which he has temporarily suspended until July 9, amidst negative market reactions.

**Trump Delays EU Tariff Implementation, Market Mood Shifts to Optimism**
US President Trump announced that the 50% punitive tariff on EU goods, originally set to take effect on June 1, will be delayed until July 9, after a phone call with European Commission President Van der Leyen. This move sparked a heated debate in the market, with many netizens joking that 'Trump has shrunk again' and 'he's changed his face just for the weekend'. Some even mocked that 'the Air Force was in a panic for two days for nothing'. According to a report by The New York Times, Trump posted on Truth Social on May 25 that he received a call from Van der Leyen, asking to delay the tariff deadline, and responded, 'Delaying until July 9 is my honor.' Van der Leyen also posted on social media, describing the conversation as 'good' and emphasizing that the negotiations will 'move quickly and decisively.' The NYT noted that Trump was unhappy with the EU's failure to make concessions within the 90-day window, and had previously threatened to impose tariffs starting from June. The news sparked a surge in US stock futures, with the market mood shifting to optimism. The US-EU trade war had been expected to cause market volatility, but Trump's sudden announcement to delay the tariff implementation has left many analysts in a panic, with some netizens joking that 'he's softening just two days after announcing it' and 'he's not doing well.' The delay in tariff implementation has caused a significant shift in market sentiment, with investors who had previously bet on a market downturn now finding themselves on the receiving end of the market's wrath.

**Trump Recommends 50% Tariff on EU Starting June 1, 2025**
US President Donald Trump has recommended imposing a 50% tariff on the EU starting from June 1, 2025, citing 'unproductive' trade negotiations. Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, 'The European Union, created to take advantage of the US in trade, has been very difficult to manage. (...) Our conversations with them are not yielding results! Therefore, I recommend a 50% tariff for the European Union starting from June 1, 2025. No tariff will be applied if the product is manufactured in the United States.' Trump also mentioned the 'powerful trade barriers' of the EU, including VAT, corporate sanctions, non-monetary trade barriers, monetary manipulations, and unjustified demands against US companies, which have generated an 'unacceptable' trade deficit. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that 'with the exception of the EU', most countries are 'negotiating in good faith' and hopes that Trump's warning will motivate the EU to act in favor of a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Trump Issues Ultimatum to EU: 50% Tariff if No Concessions in Negotiations**
US President Donald Trump announced on Friday that trade negotiations with the European Union (EU) 'are not yielding results', recommending a 50% tariff on the bloc. Trump stated, 'The European Union, created to take advantage of the US in trade, has been very difficult to manage. (...) Our conversations with them are not yielding results! Therefore, I recommend a direct 50% tariff for the European Union starting from June 1, 2025. No tariff will be applied if the product is manufactured in the US.' Trump cited 'powerful trade barriers' of the EU, including VAT, corporate sanctions, non-monetary trade barriers, monetary manipulations, and unjustified demands against US companies, as reasons for the 'totally unacceptable' trade deficit. Since his return to power, Trump has implemented several tariff measures against his trade partners, some of which he has temporarily suspended. The current tariffs include 25% on steel, aluminum, and their derivatives, 25% on cars and certain car parts, and a 10% base tariff applicable to all trade partners. The EU tariff of 10% could rise to 20% once the current US pause expires on July 9. US Vice President JD Vance expressed his hope for 'greater synergy' between Washington and the EU in Rome last Sunday. US and EU agreed to intensify technical negotiations to reach a tariff agreement, expected to be more favorable than the ones with the UK and China. The European Commission adopted countermeasures against US tariffs on steel, aluminum, and their derivatives, but suspended them until July 14 to leave room for negotiations. Brussels is currently studying new countermeasures, worth around 100,000 billion euros, affecting US agricultural and industrial products if negotiations fail.

**Trump proposes 50% tariff on EU goods from June 1**
President Donald Trump has proposed a 50% tariff on EU goods starting from June 1, blaming the EU for being unhelpful in trade discussions. He criticized the EU for maintaining restrictive trade practices, levying high taxes, and taking legal action against US companies. Trump warned that if these issues aren't addressed, the US will impose a heavy 50% tariff. The announcement caused stock markets to fall, with US stock futures dropping 1.6% and Europe's main stock index falling by 2.1%. US trade officials are set to speak with EU trade leaders soon, hoping to resolve the dispute. The EU has prepared a response, approving a 21 billion pounds package of tariffs on US goods, which could start as early as mid-July.

**Trump Drops Tariff Bomb, Instantly Craters Stock Futures**
President Donald Trump announced a new trade policy on social media, recommending a 50% tariff on the European Union starting June 1, 2025. Trump stated that the EU's trade barriers and unfair practices have led to a $250,000,000 annual trade deficit with the US, which he deemed 'totally unacceptable.' The news caused a steep drop in major stock futures indices, with the Dow Jones Industrials falling 500 points. This move comes after Trump's recent trade deal with the UK and tariff truce with China, which had calmed markets. However, experts have criticized the new tariff as 'insubstantial' and the market will have three days to react before trading resumes on Tuesday.

**Trump Proposes 50% Tariff on EU Imports Starting June 1**
US President Donald Trump announced that trade talks with the European Union have made no progress and proposed a 50% tariff on EU imports starting June 1. Trump stated on social media: 'The European Union was established primarily to exploit the United States in trade, and it has proven to be a very difficult structure to deal with. Strong trade barriers, VATs, absurd institutional fines, non-monetary trade barriers, currency manipulations, unjust and unfair lawsuits against American companies, and more have resulted in a trade deficit of over $250 billion per year with the US. This number is completely unacceptable. Our talks have made no progress! Therefore, I recommend that a 50% tariff be applied directly to the European Union starting June 1, 2025. This tariff will not apply to products manufactured or built in the United States.' Following Trump's statement, the stock markets plummeted, with US stock markets experiencing losses of up to 2% in futures trading. The price of gold also rose by 1.7% to $3,350 per ounce.

However, some of the improvement is attributed to Trump-friendly polls, while other polls, such as Economist-YouGov and Reuters-Ipsos, show little change in their trend lines. Silver Bulletin's averages on the intensity of approval and disapproval are also stable, with 27-28% strongly approving and 41-42% strongly disapproving. Trump's job-approval ratings on handling particular issues, such as the economy and trade, have also shown little change. The generic congressional ballot also shows recent stability, with Democrats leading by a two-point margin (45.5% to 43.5%). As the 2026 midterm elections approach, this metric will become increasingly important.

**Trump Signals Possible Extension of TikTok Deadline Beyond June 19 Amid China Tariff Standoff**
US President Donald Trump has indicated that he is open to further extending the June 19 deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's US operations if a deal isn't reached by then. Trump expressed flexibility on the timeline, saying, 'I would... I'd like to see it done.' The proposed deal, which would create a new US-based entity majority-owned by American investors, has been stalled following China's refusal to approve the arrangement. Trump imposed steep new tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, escalating trade tensions. Despite the gridlock, negotiations continue, though progress hinges on resolving the broader US-China tariff dispute. Trump acknowledged China's eagerness to strike a deal, citing the damaging impact of the new tariffs on its economy. The current law had required TikTok to cease operations in the US by January 19, 2025, unless a sale was completed. Trump chose not to enforce the deadline upon taking office, instead issuing successive extensions. 'TikTok is very interesting, but it will be protected,' Trump added.

**At 100 Days, Trump Approval Rating Is As Low As First Term**
Donald Trump's approval rating has dropped to its lowest point in his second term, mirroring his first term's performance at the 100-day mark. According to the Silver Bulletin, Trump's net approval rating has fallen to -9.1%, with 53.2% of Americans disapproving of him. The trend lines are concerning, with Trump's approval rating dropping into the 30s in the latest AP-NORC poll. Trump has been attacking pollsters, claiming they are 'Negative Criminals' suffering from 'Trump Derangement Syndrome.' However, the reality is that polling outlets like Times-Siena and Fox News accurately predicted the 2024 results. Trump's approval rating is deteriorating across issue areas, including immigration, the economy, and tariffs. Independents are souring on Trump, with 56% disapproving of his job performance on immigration and 70% on tariffs. Trump's unraveling of his party's coalition could be a significant challenge for his second term.
