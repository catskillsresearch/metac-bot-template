**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**The Moon: Why We Want to Go Back | üî¨ LatestLY**
Space agencies and commercial companies are planning to use the moon as a gateway to Mars, with NASA and ESA collaborating on the Artemis program. The program aims to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole and launch a new space station, called Gateway, into the moon's orbit. China and India have also had successful moon missions recently. The moon has abundant resources, including water, regolith, and helium-3, which could be used to make rocket propellant and power nuclear fusion. Scientific research on the moon is also a key goal, with the European Space Agency's Moon Exploration Programme aiming to investigate the nature of lunar environments and how they affect human health and performance. The long-term goal is to use the moon as a staging post for more distant space travel, including to Mars. As Sara Pastor, ESA's Lunar and Gateway Program Manager, said, '[Scientists] will investigate the nature of lunar environments, how their unique conditions affect human health and performance, and robotic exploration systems, and how human activity affects these environments.'

**The moon: Why we want to go back**
NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole, called Artemis Base Camp, and launch a new space station, Gateway, into the moon's orbit. A joint China-Russia project, the International Lunar Research Station, also plans to build a moon base by 2035. The moon's resources, including water, regolith, and helium-3, make it an attractive destination for future space missions. These resources can be used to sustain lunar bases, extract minerals from asteroids, and even provide fuel for nuclear fusion power. The moon's distance from Earth also makes it an ideal location for testing technologies and equipment for future Mars missions. According to Sara Pastor, ESA's Lunar and Gateway Program Manager, 'Humans have had a continued presence in space for the past 20 years aboard the International Space Station. But the ISS is only 250 miles away in low-Earth orbit, which is as little as four hours after launching from Earth. The moon is 250,000 miles away -- about three days' spaceflight -- and a far riskier journey for astronauts.' The first research on the moon aims to make that journey safer and easier, and to determine how human activity affects the lunar environment. 'ESA is developing instruments for radiation environment measurements, drilling and in-situ sample analysis, geophysics and lunar space weather,' Pastor said. The long-term goal of building surface and orbital moon bases is to serve as a staging post for more distant space travel, and to provide a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration, as Pastor noted, 'A colony on the moon will be extremely useful and a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration.'

**Russians Eager to Travel to Mars: 27% Want to Take the Leap**
According to a survey conducted by SuperJob for RIA Novosti among 1600 respondents, approximately one in four Russians (27%) are interested in traveling to Mars. The desire to travel to Mars is stronger among younger people. Despite this, 73% of respondents are not willing to trade Earth for Mars. Men are 1.5 times more likely to dream of flying to the Red Planet than women. In cities with a population of over a million, the most enthusiastic about traveling to Mars are residents of Ufa (38%), Yekaterinburg (37%), and Rostov-on-Don (33%). Residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg are less interested in traveling to Mars, with 25% and 26% respectively. As a reminder, Elon Musk recently announced a roadmap for Mars colonization and presented a new generation of the Starship rocket, which will travel to the Red Planet, first with robots and then with people, as Musk said, 'It's a big step for humanity.'

**Elon Musk's Ambitious Plan to Colonize Mars**
Elon Musk's SpaceX has been working towards establishing a human settlement on Mars, with the goal of making humanity a multi-planetary species. Musk has stated that he believes it is essential for the survival of humanity, and that Mars can serve as a backup plan in case of a global catastrophe on Earth. However, experts have raised concerns about the feasibility of establishing a human settlement on Mars, citing the planet's harsh environment, lack of water, and extreme temperatures. Musk's plan involves using his Starship spacecraft to transport people and cargo to Mars, with the goal of establishing a permanent human presence on the planet by 2028. However, many have questioned the practicality of this plan, and whether it is worth the estimated billions of dollars that Musk is investing in it. Other billionaires, such as Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, are also working on space-related projects, with Bezos' Blue Origin aiming to establish a human settlement on the moon. Musk's motivations for pursuing this goal are unclear, but some have speculated that it is a way for him to gain attention and build his brand, rather than a genuine scientific or humanitarian pursuit.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**Rare Astronomical Phenomenon: Moon and Mars Conjunction on June 1, 2025**
On June 1, 2025, the Arab region will witness a rare astronomical phenomenon where the moon will be in conjunction with the planet Mars after sunset. The red planet will appear near the moon, making it easily visible to the naked eye, provided the atmosphere is clear and free from natural or artificial obstructions. According to the Astronomy Society in Jeddah, the phenomenon will start at 7:27 PM local time, and it is recommended to observe the sky in the western direction, where the moon and Mars will be 62 degrees above the horizon, forming a striking pair. The distance between the moon and Mars will be approximately 2.46 degrees, making it easy to observe them together using binoculars or small telescopes. The moon will be about 32% illuminated, while Mars will appear as a bright, red star, distinguishable from real stars that twinkle. Mars' red color is due to iron oxide dust on its surface, and its average distance from Earth is about 225 million kilometers. Due to its position next to the moon, it will be easy to identify without the need for complex observation tools. The Astronomy Society notes that such phenomena recur periodically, but they are not always visible as they are tonight, thanks to favorable timing, location, and lighting conditions. For photography enthusiasts, the society recommends using a lens of 200mm or more to capture the scene, with a tripod to ensure a stable image, and no special filters are needed.

**Mars and the Moon: A Celestial Encounter**
The Moon and Mars will be visible in the sky tonight, in a phenomenon known as a conjun√ß√£o astron√¥mica. According to the observation guide InTheSky.org, the Moon and Mars were below the horizon at 6:48 am (Bras√≠lia time) on Sunday, but they will still be visible tonight. From S√£o Paulo, the pair will be visible in the northwest direction of the sky between 6:00 pm and 10:30 pm. The Moon will be at magnitude -11.4, while Mars will be at magnitude 1.3, both in the constellation of Leo. To identify Mars, look for the bright red dot below the Moon. 'The proximity to Earth makes the planet appear very bright in the sky, and its characteristic red color makes it easy to identify,' says the article. After Mars, the Moon will pass by Saturn, Venus, Mercury, and then return to Mars on the 29th. This series of conjunctions occurs because the Moon orbits the Earth in the same plane as the planets orbit the Sun, called the ecl√≠ptica.

**Elon Musk targets 2026 for first space mission to Mars**
Elon Musk aims to launch the first space mission to Mars by the end of 2026, but acknowledges that overcoming technological hurdles, particularly in-orbit refueling, is crucial for the long journey. A favorable planetary alignment in late 2026 provides a unique opportunity for a relatively short transit between Earth and Mars. If Starship is not ready by then, a new mission in 2028 would be targeted. The first mission would consist of -built Optimus humanoid robots. Despite failed test flights, including a fuel leak and uncontrolled spinning on the ninth test flight, Musk remains optimistic, citing each failure as valuable data for accelerated testing. NASA relies on Starship for its Artemis program, which aims to send astronauts to the moon as early as 2027, a stepping stone to possible human missions to Mars in the 2030s. Musk's ultimate vision is to launch up to 2,000 Starships every two years to establish a permanent and self-sustaining human settlement on Mars.

**3.7 Billion-Year-Old Organic Molecules on Mars: A Step Towards a New Era of Life?**
NASA and private space companies are in a priority race, while organic molecules discovered on Mars have caused excitement in the scientific community. Andy Weir's 'The Martian' novel and film, which has become a reality, is a step-by-step process. What does this mean for humanity and our world? In recent years, Mars has become the biggest excitement for the scientific community and space enthusiasts. Mars, being a neighbor to Earth, has a potential for new life and exploration. Searching for life signs on Mars, solving the planet's past climate, and establishing permanent settlements, are considered important milestones for humanity's future in space. The Martian film, which was adapted to the big screen in 2015, detailed and realistically portrayed NASA's plans to send humans to Mars by 2035. The film tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, who is left behind on Mars after a storm and must survive with limited resources. NASA also makes a great effort to rescue him. The Martian has turned into a reality. In the US, there is a debate about whether Mars or the Moon should be prioritized. Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman thinks that Mars should be prioritized. However, Elon Musk's priority is also Mars, but he has been criticized for his approach. China's increasing activity on the Moon is also affecting the US's strategic decisions. Trump and Musk's priority on Mars can be interpreted as follows: 'Mars, although it seems like both of their priorities, has not been left out of the equation. Ultimately, Mars is a difficult road, and the Moon is an important station. It's a destination, as well as a stopover.' 'Of course, Mars is much more important and has a much greater return. Both scientifically and technologically, Mars travel requires significant investments. The work done will result in technologies that can be adapted to daily life on Earth, changing our lives in different forms.' 'Even if humans are not on Mars by 2031, they will be very close to it in the 2030s.' Elon Musk has announced that he will send an 'unmanned' spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026 and that humans can go to Mars by 2031. Do you think humanity is close to achieving this goal? 'Because this work has long exceeded the realm of imagination. This process can be described as 'a very ambitious goal.' The fact that large companies are investing so much in this indicates that they have significant commercial expectations. The timeline may be a bit behind schedule. Humans may not be on Mars by 2031, but they will be very close to it in the late 2030s.' 'The fact that Mars has signs of past life, which may indicate that the necessary conditions for life exist there, is a significant discovery.' Sabancƒ± University Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Astrofysics Professor Ersin G√∂ƒü√º≈ü recently discovered large organic molecules on Mars. This has raised questions about biological activity on Mars. The molecules found on Mars are similar to those produced by life on Earth and have remained intact for approximately 3.7 billion years without being affected by geological activity, moisture, or heat. This suggests that the molecules on Mars are as old as life on Earth. What does this mean? Can Mars give us clues about our world's past and future? 'Of course, it can.' 'We know that the first signs of life appeared on Mars and Earth around the same time, approximately 4 billion years ago. We also know that Mars lost its atmosphere due to extreme solar winds, which could have led to the end of life. Although this is not a risk for Earth, humanity's excessive use of the planet could have negative consequences.' 'The Mars mission is motivating the development of new technologies.' Some people criticize the billions of dollars spent on sending humans to Mars, saying that 'it's a luxury to invest in space while solving problems on Earth.' Do you think this criticism is justified?

**Trump Administration's Plan to Conquer the Moon and Mars Before China**
The Trump administration has a plan to send humans to Mars and return to the Moon before China does. The plan involves the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) allocating millions of dollars in resources. China has a Martian exploration program, with a mission called Tianwen-3 scheduled for 2028, which aims to bring back Martian soil samples. According to Wu Weiren, the chief designer of the Chinese lunar program, the plan is to establish a permanent research base on Mars by 2045. The Trump administration's plan aims to regain the US leadership in the space race, allocating over $7 billion for lunar exploration and $1 billion for Mars-focused programs in 2026. However, the US faces budgetary and technical challenges, including the cancellation of the Mars Sample Return mission due to its high cost. Despite these obstacles, NASA plans to send humans to Mars and establish a significant presence on the planet. The US plan involves transitioning to more efficient technologies, international collaboration, prioritizing scientific research, and developing commercial systems for future missions. NASA is also actively working on developing conditions necessary for human life on Mars, including the MOXIE experiment to produce oxygen for breathing or as fuel, and methods for growing plants to ensure food for astronauts and regenerating or recycling water and air.

**Elon Musk Warns of Earth's Destruction, Calls for Colonization of Mars**
Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, warned that the sun will eventually destroy all forms of life on Earth, and called for the colonization of Mars as a long-term survival strategy for humanity. He emphasized the need to create a self-sufficient civilization on Mars, considering it a guarantee of life for humanity. Musk stressed that all forms of life on Earth will be destroyed. He also issued a stark warning about the final destruction of all forms of life on the surface of the moon. Musk said that creating a civilization capable of self-sufficiency on Mars is the only applicable long-term survival strategy for humanity. Benefits of colonizing Mars In a video clip shared on the social media platform X, Musk discussed the benefits of colonizing Mars, emphasizing the need to make life 'multi-planetary', pointing out that this is not just about temporary visits to Mars but about establishing a permanent and independent foothold for humanity. According to the Times of India website, Musk pointed out that eventually, the sun will destroy all forms of life on Earth as it expands gradually, emphasizing that at some point, a multi-planetary civilization must be built because the Earth will burn. Musk described colonizing Mars as a guarantee of life for a collective existence, ensuring the continuation of civilization after the Earth's eventual demise. Despite acknowledging that the end of the world due to the sun is still hundreds of millions of years away, Musk called for immediate action, emphasizing that humanity should take advantage of its current power and resources. He warned, 'If the Earth has existed for four and a half billion years, then the Earth contains only about 10% of life before it becomes too hot for life to be possible'. He also emphasized the critical phase when Mars will achieve self-sufficiency, saying, 'The key point in the future where the fate of life as we know it will be affected forever'. Reports indicate that an internal team is working on architectural designs and addressing medical and biological challenges to establish a Martian colony. Musk says that the first city on Mars will be named 'Terminus', but added that it will ultimately depend on the Martian residents to choose the name of their city.

**They Thought We'd Cure ALL Disease by 2000: The 1960s Predictions That Will Shock You Today**
A 1966 magazine article, 'World in 2000,' predicted a future that was both remarkably accurate and amusingly misguided. The article foresaw a permanent lunar base, regular missions to Mars and Venus, and a population of 6 billion by 2000. While humans did establish a lunar base, it was only temporary, and no human has visited the Moon since 1972. However, the population prediction was surprisingly accurate, with the actual population reaching around 6 billion by 2000. The article's predictions reflect the post-war optimism and technological wonder of the 1960s, offering a fascinating glimpse into the collective imagination of the time.

**Elon Musk Aims to Colonize Mars, Claims it Will be Part of the United States**
Elon Musk has announced plans to establish a human settlement on Mars, which he claims will be part of the United States. However, this initiative contradicts the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which states that 'outer space is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or any other means.' Musk's plan aims to establish a permanent human presence on Mars by 2054, with a projected population of over 1 million people. The plan includes the creation of an autonomous infrastructure, with the launch of the Starship rocket in 2026, which will be used for transportation to the red planet. A robotic mission to Mars is planned for 2028, followed by a human mission in 2030. Between 2035 and 2050, SpaceX plans to develop permanent settlements on Mars, including greenhouses for food production and industrial plants for resource extraction. Despite the harsh Martian environment, SpaceX is advancing various initiatives to facilitate human colonization, including the development of habitable modules, space suits, and medical studies on human reproduction in an extraterrestrial environment. As Musk said, 'I will die in the United States. I won't go anywhere. I could go to Mars, but it will be part of the United States.'

**Is Mars the key to humanity? Elon Musk predicts a self-sustaining colony on the red planet in the next 20 years**
Elon Musk predicts that a self-sustaining human presence on Mars can be established within the next 20 years. According to Musk, one million people and a massive cargo shipment will be required for the mission. Musk's statement comes in response to concerns about the urgency of establishing a human presence on Mars, citing the possibility that humanity's technological capabilities may deplete before a permanent settlement can be established. Musk's tweet sparked a range of reactions from users, with some expressing skepticism about the feasibility of the mission and others seeing it as a necessary step for human survival. As one user wrote, 'This must become a reality if the human race is to survive.' However, others raised concerns about the environmental challenges of establishing a human presence on Mars, with one user saying, 'I struggle with the idea that the earth could get so bad that Mars, which is deadly in every environmental respect, would be better.'

**Musk Predicts 1 Million People on Mars in 20 Years, Establishing a Self-Sufficient City**
Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has predicted that humans will establish a self-sufficient city on Mars within 20 years, with a population of 1 million people. He also revealed that 2029 will be a historic moment when humans first set foot on Mars. According to Deutsche Welle, Musk stated on X platform that SpaceX plans to execute a landing mission in 2026, aiming to send Tesla's humanoid robot 'Optimus' to Mars using the 'Starship' rocket. If the mission is successful, he estimates that humans will complete their first Mars landing in 2029, but the most likely implementation time is 2031. Musk emphasized the importance of establishing a self-sufficient Martian city for the continuation of human civilization, saying, 'Even if Earth faces a disaster, Martian residents can survive independently.' He added, 'We need to build a self-sufficient city on Mars as soon as possible, which is the key threshold to ensure the survival of civilization. Even if Earth's supply ships stop flying or a major disaster occurs, the Martian civilization can continue.' Musk also mentioned that building a self-sufficient Martian city requires rebuilding all industrial foundations on Earth, and the primary task in the harsh Martian environment is to build a living module similar to a glass dome to provide a suitable space for human habitation. The 'Starship' rocket, developed by SpaceX, is considered the core of Musk's Mars plan. This reusable heavy-lift rocket will not only support NASA's 'Artemis' program to help humans return to the Moon but also undertake the mission of humans setting foot on Mars.

**NASA's Dilemma: To the Moon or Directly to Mars?**
NASA is facing a dilemma under Trump's administration, with the possibility of dropping the moon mission and going straight to Mars. This comes as Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, is pushing for a direct Mars mission. NASA's former deputy director, Jim Free, who was a strong advocate for the Artemis program, has left the agency without explanation. The Artemis program aims to place humans on the moon, establish a permanent presence, and use the experience as a stepping stone for a manned mission to Mars. However, Trump is now considering dropping the moon mission and going directly to Mars, with SpaceX's Starship rocket playing a key role in the mission. Boeing has announced plans to cut up to 400 jobs from its Space Launch System (SLS) program, citing the program's high costs and limited success. Many experts believe that a manned mission to Mars is unlikely to happen before the end of the 2030s or early 2040s, but Elon Musk and SpaceX are more optimistic, aiming for a manned mission to Mars in the 2020s. NASA's current strategy documents state that the goal is to establish a sustainable human presence on Mars by the 2030s. Jim Free argued in October that the Artemis program should be continued, despite increased skepticism around Boeing's SLS rockets. 'If we leave the moon, I think we will fall apart and drive around, and others in the world will pass us,' Free said during a meeting of the American Astronautical Society. 'Leaving the moon would also let China stand alone in planting its flag on the moon's southern pole with a planned crewed mission in 2030,' notes space policy analyst Laura Forczyk.

**NASA Seeks Collaboration with Mexico for Lunar and Mars Missions**
NASA's Deputy Administrator, Pam Melroy, visited Mexico City to discuss cooperation between the US and Mexico in space exploration. She announced plans to send humans to Mars by the end of the 2030s and to establish a permanent presence on the Moon, with the goal of visiting the Moon once a year by the end of the decade. Melroy emphasized the importance of international cooperation, stating, 'We're going to try to go to the Moon once a year before the end of the decade, so we can go to the Moon consistently and make great strides in each trip during periods of time that are getting longer and longer.' She also highlighted Mexico's potential role in these missions, saying, 'I hope that Mexico will find what it wants to be on the Moon.' Melroy predicted that the US and its international partners will be ready to start planning for a trip to Mars in the late 2030s and to send humans to the planet in the 2040s. She noted that the success of these projects will depend on funding, stating, 'You can only go as fast as the money allows you to, like any project, even the ones you do at home.'
