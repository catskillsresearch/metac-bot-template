**Iran's 'Blessing of War': A Double-Edged Narrative**
As tensions between Iran and Israel escalate, the possibility of a direct military confrontation between the two countries is at its highest level ever. According to reliable sources, Israel is preparing a precise attack targeting 12 Iranian nuclear sites, which could happen if nuclear talks fail. In response, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned of Israeli military threats in a letter to the United Nations. Meanwhile, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei stated that nuclear talks with the US have reached a dead end, expressing his skepticism about their future. The Iranian regime has a history of viewing war as a blessing, dating back to the establishment of the Islamic Republic. The current leader, Khamenei, has repeatedly spoken about the 'blessings of war' and the 'treasure of sacred defense that never runs out.' In this context, war is not seen as a humanitarian disaster, but rather as a means to achieve internal cohesion, purge opponents, and strengthen the regime's ideological identity. Israeli officials, including Defense Minister Yisrael Katz and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have openly stated that Israel will not hesitate to defend itself. On the other hand, Iranian military officials have warned that any attack will be met with a 'severe and devastating response.' The Iranian people, however, have a different experience with war, which has brought only destruction, death, and long-term sanctions and deprivation. As the late Iranian youth activist Sareina Esmailzadeh shouted, the popular demand is: 'Welfare, welfare, welfare... no to war, no to threats.'

**WHO Chief Calls on Israel to 'Have Pity' on Gaza Amid Humanitarian Crisis**
The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has called on Israel to 'have pity' on Gaza, as the humanitarian situation worsens. The WHO has reported that 2.1 million people in Gaza are at 'imminent risk of death'. Meanwhile, an attack on the Israeli embassy in Washington has led to increased tensions between Israel and Europe. The US has accused Iran of seeking to become a nuclear power, and the two countries are set to meet in Rome for talks on the Iranian nuclear program. In the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army has continued its ground offensive, killing dozens of civilians each day. The WHO has also reported that 16 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on Friday. The Director-General of the WHO has called for an end to the war and the 'systematic destruction' of the healthcare system in the territory. He has also warned that the war is harming Israel itself and will not bring a lasting solution.

**Syria, Israel, and the Meddlers**
Turkey is fully supporting the new Syrian government and wants Syria to remain conflict-free. However, other 'meddlers' such as the US, Iran, and Israel are causing problems. The US is uncertain whether to withdraw or threaten, making it difficult to understand their intentions. Iran is negotiating with the US while supporting the PKK's Syrian branches, while Israel claims the region as its own. The US is supporting Iran and Syria, and is bombing the region. The future of the PKK's Syrian branch, YPG, is also uncertain, as they may either integrate with the Syrian army or continue with proxy wars. This will be crucial for Syria's future and the fight against terrorism. Provocations are possible during this process. Russia and China's silence on Syria is also noteworthy. The upcoming days may be filled with discussions about Syria. The end of the road may be near for Israel, as the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza by Israel's attacks since 2023 has reached 54,000, mostly children and women. The number of buildings destroyed and people killed by disease is also increasing. Conscience has been shattered. It's too late, but the world has finally started to react. The UK, EU countries, and others have spoken out. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu may be facing the end of the road, as he is becoming increasingly isolated and the Israeli people are also upset. The Bosnian genocide in Europe comes to mind. Those who committed the crime were punished and their names are now in the shame pages of history. History will also judge the Israeli government. Shall we laugh or cry? US President Trump had a discussion with South African President Ramaphosa about 'genocide' during a meeting in the US. I thought it was about Gaza when I heard the news, as South Africa had filed a genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. However, the situation was different. Trump said that genocide was committed against white farmers in South Africa, showing a video. Ramaphosa denied the allegations, but did not mention Israel. It seems that Zelensky's White House discussion came to mind, but Ramaphosa told Trump, 'I don't have a plane to give you, Mr. President.' This caused laughter in the room. It seems that this was just a joke, but it only made me wonder.

**Three Killed in Israeli Airstrikes on Lebanon's South**
The Lebanese Ministry of Health reported three deaths in Israeli airstrikes on the country's south, where Israel continues to target Hezbollah despite a ceasefire in place since November. According to the ministry, 'one person was killed in an enemy Israeli drone raid targeting a car in the village of Aïn Baal', in the Tyre district. Other drone attacks killed one person in the village of Yater and another in Aitaroun, two localities near the Israeli border. The Israeli army claimed to have 'eliminated the terrorist Hussein Nazih Barja' in a strike targeting the Tyre region, without specifying the village. According to them, Hussein Barja was a key engineer in the local production of Hezbollah's armament, also responsible for developing the infrastructure for the movement's surface-to-surface missile production. The Israeli army also stated that they 'eliminated a commander' of the al-Radwan force, Hezbollah's elite military unit, in the Yater locality and struck a 'Hezbollah terrorist' in Aitaroun. A local official in Yater said that the attack on his village killed a man who was using a bulldozer to clear the rubble of his damaged house from the last war, reported the National Information Agency Ani. This is the fourth Israeli attack in three days on the south of Lebanon. On Tuesday, nine people were injured. Israel claimed to have 'eliminated a local Hezbollah commander'. Despite the ceasefire that came into effect on November 27, the Israeli army continues to bomb Lebanon, saying it is targeting combatants and Hezbollah infrastructure, and has maintained five positions in the southern Lebanese territory. Lebanon regularly calls on the international community to pressure Israel to stop its attacks and withdraw from its territory. The conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, triggered by the Gaza war in October 2023, turned into an open war between September and November 2024. The Lebanese pro-Iranian formation came out weakened from this confrontation, in which it lost its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, killed in an Israeli strike. The truce agreement brokered by the United States and France provides for the dismantling of its military infrastructure between the Litani River and the Israeli border, about thirty kilometers south. On Tuesday, the US deputy envoy to the Middle East, Morgan Ortagus, said that Lebanon still 'has a lot to do' to disarm Hezbollah, and 'not only in the south of the Litani' but also 'all over the country'.

**Lazar Berman's Articles: Updates on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict**
Lazar Berman's articles cover various topics related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the war in Gaza, hostage negotiations, and international diplomacy. Netanyahu has set a new condition for ending the war: implementing Trump's Gaza relocation plan. The PM also stated that 21 hostages are definitely alive, but there is 'doubt' about 3 others. Sara Netanyahu said fewer than 24 hostages are still alive in Gaza, contradicting her husband's previous estimate. Dermer predicted that the war will be over in a year and that regional peace deals will follow. An Israeli official stated that Israel won't accept a 5-year Gaza truce, and Qatar isn't helping hostage talks. Trump said Iran talks are going 'very well,' but Netanyahu warned that a bad deal 'is worse than no deal.' Mossad head David Barnea traveled to Doha for a meeting with Qatari PM on hostage deal efforts. Rubio said Iran can have a civilian nuclear program if it gives up enrichment. The Foreign Ministry deleted an X post expressing sorrow over Pope Francis' death, and a Hamas delegation headed to Cairo as Egypt takes mediation lead in hostage talks.

**Weekend long read**
The Gaza death toll remains uncertain due to methodological problems and revisions by the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The Government Media Office (GMO) has provided false and unsupported figures for over a year. Meanwhile, Iran's influence in the region is evident in its proxy warfare strategy, as seen in the Houthi ceasefire. Israel has eliminated over 4,000 Hezbollah operatives and injured another 10,000, affecting approximately 15% of the group's total troop strength. The US must accept the limits of diplomacy with Iran, as the Islamic Republic's core orientation remains incompatible with long-term resolution. A senior Hamas official, Sami Abu Zuhri, sparked anger in Gaza with his remarks on the war, calling the death toll 'the price we have to pay' and suggesting that women will compensate for the loss by having more children.

The conflict in Gaza cannot be solved by military means, and a political solution must be the basis for the solution'.

**The Middle East 2025: The Good, the Bad and the Tragically Ugly**
The Middle East remains a region of conflict, violence, and political instability, but there are also opportunities for change and peace. The region's balance of power has shifted, with the US still the preeminent outside power, but with competitors like Israel, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE playing a more active role. The conflict triggered by the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel has led to several strategic changes, including the destruction of Hamas as a governing organization in Gaza and the weakening of Iran's influence. However, the region remains unstable, with publics dissatisfied with their governments and respect for human rights low. The ongoing negotiations between Tehran and Washington are a positive development, but the possibility of war against Iran remains real. The article also highlights the need for action to restore stability in Syria and Lebanon, and the ongoing civil war in Sudan, which has produced an estimated 150,000 deaths and 14 million displaced Sudanese. The author concludes that the region presents a conflicting portrait of hope and despair, opportunity and desperation.

**Saudi Arabia and Iran Discuss Regional Developments Amid Escalating Conflict**
Saudi Arabia and Iran discussed the current situation in the region during a phone call between Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan and his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi, according to the Saudi Press Agency (SPA). The conversation focused on the current situation in the region and the efforts being made to address it, but no further details were provided. Meanwhile, Israel announced that it had intercepted three rockets launched from Lebanon towards the settlement of Matla, and subsequently launched a series of airstrikes on Lebanon, resulting in the deaths and injuries of several people. Hezbollah denied any involvement in the rocket launch, while Lebanese officials, including President Michel Aoun, Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and Speaker of the Parliament Nabih Berri, warned of attempts to drag the country into a new cycle of violence. The conflict between Israel and Lebanon began in October 2023 and escalated into a full-scale war in September 2024, resulting in over 4,000 deaths and 17,000 injuries, including a large number of children and women, as well as the displacement of over 1.4 million people. Despite a ceasefire agreement on November 27, 2024, Israel has committed 1,245 breaches of the agreement, resulting in at least 96 deaths and 311 injuries, according to official Lebanese data. Israel has also refused to complete its withdrawal from southern Lebanon by February 18, 2025, as agreed, and continues to occupy five key Lebanese hills. Following Israel's refusal to enter the second phase of the ceasefire and its renewed war on Gaza, the Houthis launched a ballistic missile attack on Israeli positions and ships in the Red Sea, while the US-British coalition launched daily airstrikes on Houthi positions in Yemen. Israel has also resumed its genocidal war on Gaza, resulting in the deaths of 634 Palestinians and the injury of 1,172 others, mostly women and children, as of Saturday, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.

**Israel and Iran: A Conflict on the Brink of War**
The conflict between Israel and Iran has escalated to a new level, with the two countries engaging in direct attacks for the first time in their history. Iran has been accused of supporting the Hamas terrorist group, which carried out a devastating attack on Israel in October 2023, killing nearly 1200 people and taking over 250 hostages. Israel has responded with airstrikes against Iranian targets, including the country's consulate in Damascus and the headquarters of its main ally, the Hizbullah militia in Lebanon. The conflict has the potential to escalate into a full-blown war, with the global oil market at risk of disruption. Iran's nuclear program is also a major point of contention, with Israel warning of the dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran. The situation is complex and volatile, with multiple actors and interests at play. 'The axis of resistance is broken,' says Jonas Roth, a commentator on the conflict. 'But Iran is still unpredictable and could become a North Korea-like regime if it doesn't acknowledge its own weakness.' The conflict has the potential to have far-reaching consequences for the region and the world.

**Over 500 Days of War: By the Numbers**
The 500th day of war between Israel and Hamas has passed since the Hamas massacre on October 7, 2023. The devastating toll of the war has resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,200 Israelis, with 251 hostages taken into Gaza, 73 still held, and 36 believed to be dead. Over 10,000 rockets have been fired at Israel from Gaza, and Iran has launched numerous attacks, including 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 120 ballistic missiles in April 2024, and 200 ballistic missiles in October 2024. The statistics also show that 894 security forces have been killed in combat, with 15,000 wounded, including 8,600 physically injured and 7,600 facing psychological challenges, such as PTSD and depression. The report highlights the significant number of security forces who sustained both physical and mental injuries simultaneously, with 66% of those wounded being reserve soldiers. The State Comptroller has warned that Israel must do more to support traumatized soldiers and civilians, with an estimated 3 million Israelis potentially developing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD as a result of the war.

**Middle East Conflict Escalates: Ceasefire at Risk, Airstrike on Gaza, and Nuclear Program Threats**
The conflict in the Middle East continues to escalate. Hamas has announced that it will release new hostages to maintain the ceasefire in Gaza, but Israel has denied any agreement. The Israeli army has launched an airstrike on Gaza after detecting the launch of a rocket that did not cross into Israel. The president of Iran, Masoud Pezeshkian, has stated that his country has the capacity to rebuild and revitalize its nuclear program in the event of an attack by its 'enemies'. The European Union has proposed a plan to accelerate the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon, with the aim of replacing them with UN peacekeepers. The president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, has visited Israel and crossed into Gaza to oversee the delivery of humanitarian aid. The number of deaths in Gaza has risen to 48,239, with 111,676 people injured since the start of the conflict in October 2023. The UK has announced that it will modify its economic sanctions against Syria, following the fall of the Assad regime. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, controlled by Hamas, 9,000 Palestinians remain detained in Israeli prisons, with over 6,000 not having been convicted and 5,000 suffering from illnesses.

**The Ongoing Conflict Between Israel and Hamas: A War with No End in Sight**
The conflict between Israel and Hamas has been ongoing for 15 months, with a devastating attack on a peaceful festival in October 2023, resulting in 1200 deaths and 253 kidnappings. The attack was a 'blood exhibition' with the diffusion of photos and videos to celebrate the perceived victory. The strategy included the mimicry of terrorist leaders with the Palestinian population in Gaza, using them as a human shield against Israeli military power. The Israeli bombings have caused an unspecified number of Palestinian victims, with Hamas claiming around 50,000, a figure not corroborated by any international organization. The conflict has spread to the south of Lebanon and Iran, causing the near annihilation of main terrorist structures and the weakening of Iran. The war has taken its toll on human lives, with the Palestinian population in Gaza facing a 15-month humanitarian emergency, with half of the population displaced and struggling to meet basic needs. The speculation of politics also uses war as an instrument, with Iran seeing this conflict as a way to prevent an Israeli approach with Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region. The slow pace of releasing Israeli hostages in Hamas' hands and prisoners accused of terrorism in Israeli prisons highlights the lack of trust and the weight of radicalized sectors, both in Shia organizations and the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. No war resolves anything, and the confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians is millennial. A lasting peace is necessary, where Israel and Palestine's borders are recognized and their rights are acknowledged.
