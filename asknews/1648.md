**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Musk: Chances of Starship Flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50**
Elon Musk said that the chances of Starship flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50. The spacecraft has already completed nine test flights, with the last one taking place on May 27. However, the mission ended in an emergency due to a fuel leak. The previous flights in January and March also ended in failure, with the spacecraft exploding within the first 10 minutes of flight. Despite this, Musk is optimistic about the progress made and believes that the data collected will help improve the spacecraft. The next version of Starship, Version 3, is expected to be 124.4 meters tall and will be capable of flying to Mars. The spacecraft will be reusable and will have a refueling system on orbit, which is necessary for long-distance space travel. The first flight of this version is planned for the end of this year, and if successful, Starship may fly to Mars as early as next year. SpaceX plans to send five Starship Version 3 spacecraft to Mars in 2026 to test the spacecraft and its technologies. However, Musk believes that it will be challenging to achieve this goal, citing the need to master the refueling of Starship in space as the main problem. He estimates the chances of success as 50/50. If successful, SpaceX plans to send around 20 spacecraft to Mars in 2028-2029, which may be crewed. However, Musk also suggests that two robotic landings may be conducted before sending humans. The final decision will be made later. In the third launch window (2030-2031), up to 100 Starship spacecraft may be sent to Mars, and in the next window (2033), up to 500. SpaceX is currently searching for a suitable location for a Martian city, which should be relatively far from the poles, have access to water ice, and have a flat surface for landings and takeoffs. The main candidate is the Arcadia Planitia region. The ultimate goal is to create a self-sufficient settlement on Mars with a population of over a million people, which will require transporting millions of tons of cargo. According to Musk, the construction and maintenance of such a city will be carried out using Starship, possibly its future 142-meter version. During periods of Earth-Mars alignment, thousands of upper stages of the spacecraft will be able to arrive and depart.

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Humans Will Live Up to 1000 Years or Become Immortal by 2050**
Experts predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as genetic engineering, brain-computer interfaces, and virtual reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever by uploading their consciousness into computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to the merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs are not just about living longer, but about a complete transformation of humanity. Dr. Pearson believes that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through advanced technologies, such as genetic engineering and brain-computer interfaces. He predicts that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Dr. Kurzweil predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to the merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. de Grey thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. He believes that the first person to achieve this will already be born. His approach, 'integrative rejuvenation,' uses a comprehensive treatment to remove cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we will be able to achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will increase faster than time passes. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will help significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' that cause inflammation in the body. 'We already understand the processes of aging well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, Dr. de Grey's vision may transform death from aging into a rare event, opening a medical path to eternal life. As a reminder, we previously wrote about some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, which can stop aging or even turn back time.

**Largest Plasma Ejection of 2025 to Hit Earth on June 1**
According to experts, a massive gas cloud will reach Earth in just a few hours. On June 1, a powerful magnetic storm will occur on Earth as a result of the largest plasma ejection on the Sun in 2025. Specialists predict that the disturbances of the magnetic field may lead to the emergence of a G4-class storm. 'Calculations confirm an exceptionally high speed of plasma, approximately 1,200 kilometers per second. It will take the plasma only about 37 hours to cross the 150 million kilometers between the Earth and the Sun,' the laboratory statement reads. During this time, a massive gas cloud will hit the group of space apparatus in the Lagrange point L1, including the SoHO spacecraft. Other space means near Earth will also be affected by the plasma.

**Large Plasma Cloud to Reach Earth on Sunday**
A large cloud of plasma, resulting from a strong solar flare on Saturday, is expected to reach Earth on Sunday around 16:00 MSK. According to the Laboratory of Solar Astronomy at the Institute of Cosmic Research and the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the plasma will travel at a speed of approximately 1200 km/s, covering the 150 million km distance between the Earth and the Sun in about 35 hours. 'About 20-30 minutes before reaching Earth, the plasma will collide with a group of spacecraft located in the L1 Lagrange point, 1.5 million km closer to the Sun, including the SoHO spacecraft, which houses the LASCO telescopes. Information from these satellites will serve as a warning for the entire group of spacecraft based near Earth,' said the laboratory. This event is the largest solar mass ejection of the year, directed directly at Earth, and is a result of a strong solar flare of M8.2 level, which occurred on Saturday at 03:05 MSK in active region #4100.

**ESA Launches 'The Blue Danube' into Space**
The European Space Agency (ESA) will launch 'The Blue Danube' into space on Saturday, May 31, to 'host' the famous waltz by Johann Strauss II on the Voyager 1 spacecraft, the farthest human-made object from Earth. The piece will travel at the speed of light, passing through Spain, specifically the Cebreros Station in Ávila, where the ESA's 35-meter-diameter parabolic antenna for deep space will transmit the waltz to the stars. The Orquesta Sinfónica de Viena, directed by Petr Popelka, will perform the piece live at the MAK (Museo de Artes Aplicadas) in Vienna. The signal will be sent via electromagnetic waves to the Voyager's exact location, about 25 billion kilometers from Earth. Once converted to a digital file, the recording will travel to the Voyager at the speed of light, taking about 23 hours. However, experts note that the Voyager is not equipped to receive the signal, making it a symbolic and beautiful act, like the waltz. The concert will be projected on screens in various locations around the world, including New York and the Cebreros Station. The Planetario de Madrid will also open its projection room to the public to follow the event live. ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher stated, 'Music connects us all through time and space in a very particular way. The European Space Agency is pleased to share the stage with Johann Strauss II and open the imagination of future scientists and space explorers who may one day travel to the tune of the space hymn.' The Cebreros Station, which participates in the 'Waltz into Space' project, has supported other notable missions like Rosetta, Mars Express, and the NASA's Perseverance rover. '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) by Stanley Kubrick made the famous waltz the space hymn by default. However, the piece was surprisingly left out of the 'Golden Record of the Voyager' when it was launched in 1977. This omission is considered a 'cosmic error' by the ESA, which now wants to rectify it with this initiative. 'Vals al Espacio' will have an impact beyond our Solar System and inspire people on Earth to experience culture in Vienna,' said Norbert Kettner, director of the Vienna Tourism Office.

**Blue Origin launch: How to watch Jeff Bezos' company's next human spaceflight from Texas**
Blue Origin is preparing to launch its next human spaceflight from Texas, which will be the 32nd mission of the New Shepard spacecraft. The crew will include Aymette (Amy) Medina, Jorge Gretchen Green, Jaime Alemán, Jesse Williams, Mark Rocket, and Paul Jeris. The mission will be livestreamed on Blue Origin's website. The New Shepard spacecraft will reach supersonic speeds of over 2,000 mph during its ascent, and the crew will experience weightlessness as the spacecraft reaches its highest point above the Kármán Line. The rocket booster will separate from the crew capsule and land vertically about two miles from the launchpad, while the capsule will make a soft landing in the desert using parachutes. According to Eric Lagatta, the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network, 'During its ascent, the spacecraft reaches supersonic speeds surpassing 2,000 mph before the rocket booster separates from the crew capsule. At that point, those aboard the capsule become weightless as the spacecraft continues toward its highest point on its brief voyage above the Kármán Line – the 62-mile-high internationally recognized boundary of space.'

**Fusion-Driven Spacecraft Sunbird Could Halve Travel Time to Mars**
Pulsar Fusion, a British company, is developing Sunbird, a fusion-driven spacecraft that can reach speeds of up to 805,000 kilometers per hour. The company believes that creating fusion in space is easier than on Earth, as the vacuum environment is more natural for the fusion process. The Sunbird system could deliver 2000 kg of payload to Mars in less than six months and make interplanetary missions more time-efficient. The company plans to test some components in orbit this year, with a smaller part of the Sunbird system expected to be launched in 2027 to verify that the physics works as planned. Dinan, a representative of the company, explained, 'It's basically circuit boards that are sent up to be tested, to ensure they work. Not particularly exciting since it's not fusion, but we have to do it.' The prototype is expected to cost around $70 million, and a fully functional Sunbird system is expected to be ready in four to five years, pending necessary funding. The system would use only grams of fuel, primarily a rare isotope called helium-3, to create protons that would serve as a 'nuclear exhaust' for propulsion. The Sunbird system could deliver up to 2000 kg of payload to Mars in less than six months, send sondes to Jupiter or Saturn in two to four years, and enable a round-trip journey to a nearby asteroid in one to two years instead of three.

**13 Of The Fastest Human-Made Objects To Ever Enter Space - SlashGear**
Humans have achieved impressive feats in space exploration, including building spacecraft that can sustain high speeds. While the International Space Station travels at 17,500 mph, there are even faster human-made objects in space. According to scientists, actual space begins at 50 to 62 miles above Earth's surface, and satellites, including Starlink, are not fast enough to make the list of the fastest ever spacecraft. For reference, the land speed record is 763.035 mph and a bullet can travel at up to 2,727 mph, making these spacecraft excessively fast. 'Actual space is about 50 to 62 miles above Earth's surface, depending on which scientists you ask,' said the article, highlighting the distinction between space and high-altitude flight.

**Parker Probe Repeats Record Brush With The Sun in Daredevil Dive**
NASA's Parker Solar Probe has repeated its record-breaking performance, coming within 6.1 million kilometers (3.8 million miles) of the Sun's surface, the closest any human-made object has ever been. The probe, which was designed to study the Sun's atmosphere, particle winds, and magnetic fields, cruised at a speed of 192 kilometers per second, the fastest speed ever recorded by a human-made object. According to NASA's Sarah Frazier, the spacecraft checked in on Tuesday with mission operators at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, indicating it was in good health and all systems were operating normally. The probe is planned to make five close approaches at the 6.1 million kilometer distance, with the next one scheduled for June 19. However, the mission is unlikely to continue much past December 2025, as the spacecraft will eventually run out of fuel and be incinerated by the Sun's pressure, leaving behind a molten blob in a 10-solar-radii orbit.

**Parker Spacecraft Sets New Record for Closest Approach to the Sun**
The Parker spacecraft has successfully flown by the Sun, becoming the closest human-made object to our star. On March 22, the NASA spacecraft approached the Sun to within 6.1 million kilometers while traveling at 692,000 kilometers per hour. This marks the spacecraft's 23rd perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, and sets a new record for the fastest and closest human-made object to the Sun. According to Dr. Saeed, 'The Parker spacecraft has been designed to withstand the extreme conditions of the solar environment and to provide unique insights into the behavior of the Sun.' The spacecraft's advanced heat shield allows it to operate within the Sun's corona, collecting data on the origin of the solar wind and the dynamics of the solar magnetic field. This mission is crucial for understanding solar phenomena, such as solar storms, which can impact satellites, communications, and power grids on Earth. The Parker spacecraft will continue to complete new orbits, getting closer to the Sun, with the next approach scheduled for June 2025.

**NASA's Parker Spacecraft Makes Record Close Approach to the Sun**
NASA's Parker Spacecraft made its 23rd close approach to the Sun on March 22, marking its second closest approach to the Sun to date. During the pass, the spacecraft approached the Sun to within 6.1 million kilometers, reaching a speed of 692,000 kilometers per hour (430,000 miles per hour), matching the record speed it achieved in its December 2024 pass. The spacecraft, which was launched by NASA in 2018, is the first human-made object to approach the Sun and enter the Sun's corona. It collected important data from the Sun's outer atmosphere, the corona, while all its scientific instruments were active. This close approach will enable measurements of the Sun's solar wind and coronal activity that have not been possible before. The spacecraft is protected by a special heat shield against the extreme heat and radiation of the Sun. These missions will contribute to a better understanding of space weather, which affects satellites, astronauts, and energy grids on Earth.

**Parker Solar Probe to Make Second Record-Breaking Flyby of the Sun**
The Parker Solar Probe is preparing for its second record-breaking flyby of the Sun, which is scheduled to take place over the next few days. According to NASA, the spacecraft will approach the surface of the Sun at a distance of 6.1 million kilometers, repeating its December record. At the point of maximum proximity, the probe, which holds the record for the fastest human-made object, will reach a speed of 692,000 km/h. The mission team will confirm the success of the maneuver not earlier than Tuesday, as the spacecraft will be out of radio contact with Earth during the critical phase of the flyby. The probe, launched in 2018, continues to fulfill its main task of studying the solar corona, a region that remains one of the greatest mysteries for astrophysicists. The corona's temperature is hundreds of times higher than the surface of the Sun, and scientists hope that the upcoming flyby will provide new data to help identify key aspects, such as the mechanism of heating the corona, the nature of solar wind acceleration, and the behavior of high-energy particles in extreme conditions. These processes are crucial for understanding space weather, which affects satellite systems and power grids on Earth. The flyby will subject the spacecraft's equipment to unprecedented thermal loads of 1370°C. The data collected by the probe has already allowed scientists to revise 60 models of solar activity, and the upcoming data may provide a key to predicting 'space weather' with unprecedented accuracy, as said by NASA, 'the Parker Solar Probe is designed to operate in the harshest environment in the solar system, and it's doing just that'.

**NASA spacecraft set for second close encounter with the sun -- what it hopes to learn**
NASA's Parker Solar Probe is set to make its second close encounter with the sun, aiming to unlock the secrets of our star. The spacecraft, launched in 2018, will reach record speeds of 430,000 mph (690,000 kph) during its closest approach, making it the fastest human-made object ever built. The mission is to study the solar wind and the solar corona, which remains one of astronomy's biggest mysteries. By flying directly through the intense region, Parker is gathering data that could help scientists better predict solar storms, which can impact satellites, communication networks, and power grids on Earth. The probe is equipped with a 4.5-inch-thick (11.4 cm) carbon-composite heat shield to withstand the extreme environment. After this flyby, Parker will make one more close pass through the corona before continuing its long-term mission, eventually reaching within 3.83 million miles (6.16 million kilometers) of the sun by 2025.

**Asteroid threat to Earth will 'need a lot of nukes' in Armageddon movie style assault**
Asteroid 2024 YR4 is hurtling through space at 17 km/s, with a 0.28-3.1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032. Experts say a nuclear assault, like in the movie Armageddon, may be the only way to divert it. Dr. Andrew Rivkin, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University, stated, 'I don't want to say humanity would throw in the towel, but you're going to need a lot of nukes.' A previous NASA mission, Dart, successfully slowed down an asteroid by slamming a spaceship into it. Plans are also in place to use bombs or thrusters to deflect incoming asteroids. Aerospace engineer Brent Barbee suggests repeatedly firing blasts at space rocks or using a spacecraft to hit and deflect them. However, he notes that it would be the first time doing so, and new ways to build and launch spacecraft would be needed in an emergency.

**Jesús Calleja's Historic Journey to Space: A Closer Look at the 'New Shepard' Mission**
Jesús Calleja, a Spanish astronaut, is set to embark on a historic journey to space aboard the 'New Shepard' spacecraft. In an interview with Informativos Telecinco, Calleja describes his emotions before the launch: 'Here, fear doesn't fit.' The countdown has begun, and Calleja is preparing for the journey of a lifetime. The 'New Shepard' spacecraft will reach a maximum speed of 3,600 kilometers per hour, 'much faster than a bullet,' according to Calleja. The launch will be followed by a separation of the propulsor from the capsule, which will reach an altitude of 106 kilometers, marking the official entry into space. Calleja will be carrying a camera to capture the experience and make history by being the first person to broadcast live from space. The spacecraft will then begin its descent, consisting of two parachute phases, before landing safely. Calleja emphasizes the importance of safety, stating that 'any failure that could occur during the launch or landing phase has a countermeasure.' The 'New Shepard' spacecraft is 99% reusable, with the propulsor and capsule able to be recovered and reused. 'The fuel comes from water, and the carbon footprint will be 0,' concludes Calleja.
