**Britain facing race to avoid $1 billion in EU carbon tax costs**
Britain is facing a race to link its carbon market to the EU's before the EU's carbon border tax kicks in next year, to avoid UK companies facing annual bills of around 800 million pounds ($1.08 billion). Market experts say it's unlikely to happen in time, with the earliest possible link being 2028, but more likely 2029 or 2030. The UK government says avoiding the EU's carbon border tariff would save 800 million pounds a year, but EU officials say Britain needs to link its carbon market to the EU's to get exempted. Technical hurdles, such as adjusting national rules and aligning emissions permit auctions, need to be resolved before a link can happen. Industry experts say these issues are technically straightforward to resolve, but the UK needs to act quickly to avoid the costs.

**UK Prepares for War Amid Rising Tensions in Europe**
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's predecessor, Keir Starmer, announced that the UK is increasing its defense investments to prepare its armed forces for combat amid rising tensions in Europe. Starmer stated, 'We are moving to a [regime] of readiness for combat as the primary goal of our armed forces.' He emphasized that the country's security will be based on partnership with NATO allies, and the UK will never fight alone: 'Our defense policy will always be primarily focused on NATO.' Starmer highlighted that the alliance is 'a fundamental source of strategic power' for the UK, and the country aims to implement innovations in its armed forces 'at the speed of war.' He plans to make British forces 'ten times more lethal by 2035.'

**Britain to get defence boost to send message to Moscow  --  and possibly Trump**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with the UK building new nuclear-powered attack submarines and creating an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defence Secretary John Healey said the changes would 'transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment' and that the 3% goal is 'on track' to be met. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks. The UK will also invest £15 billion in its nuclear arsenal and increase its conventional weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons. Mr. Starmer said re-arming would create a 'defence dividend' of well-paid jobs, and the move is also a message to President Donald Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defence.

**UK PM: We can't ignore Russian threat**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that Britain cannot ignore the threat posed by Russia, citing the conflict in Ukraine as an example. The UK will increase military spending to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. This move is part of a broader effort to deter Russia and bolster Europe's defenses. NATO chief Mark Rutte is expected to discuss a commitment to spend at least 3.5 percent of GDP on defense at an upcoming meeting. Robert Jenrick, a Conservative Party spokesman, called for the government to be more ambitious and raise spending to 3 percent of national income by 2029, stating, 'We think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation.'

**Britain is getting a defense boost aimed at sending a message to...**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with Starmer saying 'we have to recognize the world has changed' and 'with greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.' The government will also build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send 'a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. Healey also stated that plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 are 'on track' and that there's 'no doubt' it will hit 3% before 2034. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks.

**UK to Boost Naval Fleet with 12 New Attack Submarines**
The British government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is increasing its naval fleet with the addition of 12 new attack submarines by the end of 2030. According to Defense Minister John Healey, 'We know that threats are increasing. We must act decisively to defend against Russian aggression.' The new submarines will be nuclear-powered and equipped with conventional weapons, replacing the current fleet of seven submarines. The project is part of the Aukus security partnership between the UK, US, and Australia. This move comes as other European leaders, including Starmer, are strengthening their defense capabilities following US President Donald Trump's call for European countries to take more responsibility for their own security. The EU has also established a 150 billion euro defense fund to support member states' defense investments, aiming to reach up to 800 billion euros by 2030.

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**UK Reaches Agreement with EU on Trade, Defense, and Security**
After nearly nine years of voting to leave the union, Britain, with its significant defense capabilities, will participate in joint procurement projects. The two parties have also agreed to facilitate the entry of British food and tourists into the European Union and signed a new fishing agreement. The tariffs imposed by Trump, along with warnings that Europe needs to make more effort to protect itself, have forced governments around the world to rethink their trade, defense, and security relationships, bringing the UK and European leaders closer together. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who voted to remain in the EU in the Brexit referendum, is betting that presenting tangible benefits to the British people, such as faster electronic gates at EU airports, will outweigh the cries of 'betrayal' from Nigel Farage, a member of the Brexit campaign. The government says the agreement with its largest trading partners will reduce bureaucracy for food producers and farmers, making food cheaper, improving energy security, and adding around £9 billion to the economy by 2040. This is the third deal the UK has made this month, following agreements with India and the US, and while it is unlikely to lead to a significant economic boost immediately, it may increase business confidence and attract the investments that are desperately needed. Sunak said in a statement, 'It's time to look forward... to move on from old, stale discussions and political battles to find practical, logical solutions that benefit the British people.'

**UK, Europe strike post-Brexit deal on defense, trade issues**
The United Kingdom and the European Union have reached a landmark agreement on defense and trade issues, five years after Brexit. The deal, announced by British Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds, includes improved fishing rights and defense cooperation. Thomas-Symonds said, 'Historic day,' and 'Britain back on the world stage, with a Government in the service of working people.' The agreement does not include rejoining the EU's single market or customs union, nor does it allow for the free movement of people between the U.K. and the EU. However, it does include a youth mobility plan and improved trade for food imports and exports. An unnamed European diplomat told The New York Times that the agreement will allow European boats access to U.K. fishing waters until June 30, 2038. The deal comes as the return of President Donald Trump brings a greater sense of urgency for cooperation between the U.K. and the EU.

**EU and UK Reach Agreement to Reset Relations After Brexit**
The European Union and the United Kingdom have reached a general agreement to reset their relations after Brexit. The agreement, reached after intense negotiations, does not cross any of the red lines set by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The UK will not rejoin the EU market or customs union, and will not restore the free movement of European citizens. The main novelty of the London summit is a defense and security pact, which will allow the UK to participate in joint armament purchases with the EU's 150 billion euro credit fund. This consolidates military cooperation between the two sides of the English Channel, which was reinitiated with the war in Ukraine. The UK and France now lead the 'coalition of volunteers' preparing security guarantees for Kiev in case of a ceasefire. In exchange for the defense pact, the Labour government of Keir Starmer has agreed to extend the EU's access to British territorial waters until June 30, 2038, a concession that has generated strong controversy in the UK. The rest of the agreement's chapters are still vague and will be concretized at a later date. The EU and the UK have announced their intention to close a phytosanitary agreement, of unlimited duration, to facilitate the entry of British agricultural products into Europe. They will also negotiate an energy agreement, with the goal of allowing the UK to participate in the EU's electricity market on similar terms to before Brexit. The most contentious and difficult issue has been the agreement on youth mobility, which the EU has been demanding to facilitate the study, work, or volunteer opportunities of young people on both sides of the English Channel. This request has been difficult for the Starmer government, whose critics argue that it is a step backward in terms of freedom of movement.

**UK and EU Agree to Significant Redefinition of Trade and Defense Ties**
The United Kingdom has agreed to a significant redefinition of its trade and defense ties with the European Union, following a global shift made by US President Donald Trump. This move has forced both sides to put aside their bitter divorce and come to a new agreement. The UK, a major defense player, will now participate in joint procurement projects. The two parties have also agreed to facilitate access to food and visitors from the UK to the EU and signed a new and contentious fishing agreement. The tariffs imposed by Trump, along with warnings that Europe should do more to protect itself, have forced governments around the world to rethink their trade, defense, and security ties, bringing UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer closer to Emmanuel Macron, the French President, and other European leaders. Starmer, who supported remaining in the EU during the Brexit referendum, believes that the offer of tangible benefits to the British, such as the use of faster electronic gates at EU airports, will silence the 'betrayal' cries of Brexit activist Nigel Farage. The government says that the redefinition with its largest trading partner will reduce bureaucracy for farmers and food producers, making them cheaper; improve energy security and add almost £9 billion to the economy by 2040. This is the third agreement the UK has made this month, after deals with India and the US, and while it is unlikely to lead to a significant economic boost immediately, it could raise corporate sentiment and attract much-needed investments. 'It's time to look forward,' Starmer said in a statement. 'Leave behind the old debates and political fights to find practical and sensible solutions that bring the best for the British people.' 'We're ready to work with partners if that means we can improve people's lives here at home,' he added.

**Zakharova comments on Georgia's EU prospects with 'there would be somewhere to join'**
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova commented on Georgia's potential to join the EU by 2030, saying 'there would be somewhere to join'. She also reminded the experience of the United Kingdom, which left the EU 'for quite understandable reasons'. Zakharova noted that 'it's not about the good things that the UK would not have left', but rather that 'where there is something to gain, the British will be the first'. She added that 'crisis phenomena within the EU are so obvious, and its potential is so predictable, that there is nothing to do for those who think about their national economies'. Zakharova emphasized that 'it's a sovereign matter for everyone', and that Georgia should 'look at specific numbers, not just slogans'. She also mentioned that Russia and Georgia have been discussing this issue, despite their political differences and lack of diplomatic relations, and that they are building bilateral ties in a mutually respectful and beneficial way. 'We are having a dialogue on this matter', Zakharova said.

That's why we are so committed to this, because you inspire us with your dedication and motivation,' Budris said.

**Ukraine to Join EU Before 2030 if it Maintains Current Pace, Says von der Leyen**
Ursula von der Leyen stated that if Ukraine continues at the same pace, it will join the European Union before 2030. She made this comment during a meeting between Volodymyr Zelensky and high-ranking foreign guests with representatives of the media. Von der Leyen noted that if a specific date for Ukraine's EU entry is set, other candidate countries may request the same. 'If Ukraine continues at the same pace, it will join the EU even before 2030. So let's keep working, maintain that pace,' she said.

**Ukraine's EU Accession Could Happen Before 2030, Says von der Leyen**
Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, has praised Ukraine's progress in implementing reforms and its potential for joining the EU before 2030. 'Ukraine is an example of merit, quality, and speed in the reform process,' von der Leyen said in Kiev. 'If it continues at this pace, its accession to the EU could be before 2030.' Antonio Costa, President of the European Council, added that Ukraine's accession to the EU would be 'the most important guarantee of security for its future' and that the EU has already decided that the next institutional cycle will be one of enlargement. 'What Ukraine is doing is impressive, as it is writing a new manual on how to make reforms during wartime,' Costa said, also referencing the work done by Western Balkans and Moldova to achieve enlargement. However, Costa noted that the 27 EU member states must also work to make the necessary reforms to welcome new member states. 'It is essential that Europe participates in peace talks not only to represent the position of the 27 member states, but also that of our partners, such as Norway, Iceland, and the United Kingdom,' Costa added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated the importance of maintaining unity between the US and Europe, saying 'if Ukraine falls, all similar countries, such as Estonia, are at risk due to the Kremlin's policies.'

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has expressed optimism about Ukraine's potential to join the European Union before 2030. Speaking at a press conference in Kyiv, von der Leyen praised Ukraine's progress toward reaching EU norms, saying, 'I really appreciate the political will that is there. I would even say Ukraine’s merit-based process, if they continue at that speed and at that quality, perhaps they could be earlier than 2030.' This move could help deter Russia from future aggression, particularly given the United States' reluctance to allow Ukraine to join NATO or provide soldiers for a postwar peacekeeping force.
