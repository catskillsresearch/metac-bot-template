**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**Ray Kurzweil Predicts Humanity Will Reach 'Speed of Longevity Escape' by 2029**
Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that humanity will reach the 'speed of longevity escape' by 2029, where our life expectancy will increase by more than one year for every year that passes, allowing us to gain time rather than lose it. Kurzweil bases this prediction on the concept that medical and technological advancements will soon reach a pace where improvements in treatments and therapies will extend our life expectancy faster than we naturally age. He notes that currently, we recover approximately four months of longevity per year due to scientific advancements, but by 2029, this number will reach one year. Kurzweil's methodology is based on the 'law of accelerating returns,' which states that technological progress advances at an exponential rate. He also predicts that humans will be able to merge their neocortex with the cloud by the early 2030s, surpassing the biological limitations of the human brain. However, he acknowledges the limitations of his predictions, stating that 'achieving the speed of longevity escape does not guarantee living forever.'

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Scientists in Panic: Planet Faces Catastrophic Consequences Due to Ice Loss**
A group of international scientists from Switzerland, the US, Belgium, and other countries have concluded that if the current rate of warming continues, three-quarters of the Earth's ice mass will disappear by 2100, resulting in a 23 cm rise in sea levels and other irreversible consequences. The study, published in the Science journal, notes that the situation in Alaska is particularly alarming, where up to 69% of the ice could disappear, despite the region having the third-largest ice reserve in the world (16,246 gigatons). Even under an optimal scenario, Alaska would lose 41% of its ice, with global losses reaching 47%. Unlike previous studies, which were limited to 2100, the new modeling considers a period of up to 330 years to reach 'equilibrium' for Alaska's ice. The study involved 21 scientists from 10 countries, using eight different climate models to analyze 200,000 ice formations. The researchers emphasize that even if warming stops, ice will continue to melt for hundreds of years due to 'climate inertia.' They stress that the current decade is critical for taking measures to preserve the Earth's cryosphere.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Australian actor raising money to cryogenically preserve teen son**
Australian actress Clare McCann is raising $300,000 to cryogenically preserve her 13-year-old son, Atreyu, who died by suicide on May 23 after months of bullying at his school. McCann blames the school for not taking adequate action against the bullies, saying 'This was not his fault. He was let down by the schooling system as he suffered horrendous amounts of bullying.' Southern Cryonics has agreed to freeze Atreyu's body, but there are no guarantees that future medical technology can bring him back. As of Friday, the fundraiser had raised just under $16,000.

**Australian Actress Starts Crowdfunding Campaign to Preserve Son's Body through Cryonic Preservation**
Australian actress Clare McCann has started a crowdfunding campaign to raise R$ 1 million to preserve her 13-year-old son's body through cryonic preservation. The goal is to freeze his body in the hope that future medical advancements may allow for his reanimation. McCann wrote on Instagram, 'We only have one more chance to preserve his body cryogenically in the next 7 days. If we lose this window, we also lose the chance of any possible future reanimation that science may offer.' Cryonic preservation involves storing human bodies at low temperatures using liquid nitrogen, which can preserve cells and tissues, and potentially allow for reanimation in the future. However, scientists warn that this process is still in its infancy and that there is no guarantee that the person will be able to be revived or that they will not suffer from severe side effects. As of now, the campaign has reached only 2% of its goal, with approximately R$ 36,000 raised. McCann has shared the link to the campaign on her personal profile, asking her fans to donate and help her achieve her goal.

**Four ways humans are trying to 'resurrect' & come back from the dead**
Humans are exploring various ways to 'resurrect' or come back from the dead, including cryonics, digital clones, and holograms. Cryonics involves deep-freezing bodies to preserve them for the future, with the Cryonics Institute in Michigan having nearly 270 patients preserved. Digital clones, created by companies like Eternos, can replicate a person's voice, knowledge, and life stories, with a cost ranging from $25 to $100 per month. Holograms, like the one created for Kim Kardashian's 40th birthday, can also bring back memories of the deceased. However, actual resurrections, or bringing biologically dead patients back to life, are of significant ethical concern, with a biotech firm, BioQuark, conducting clinical trials on brain-dead patients, although the project has since folded.

**The hidden flaw in cryonics that could ruin your shot at living forever | BBC Science Focus Magazine**
Cryonics, the process of freezing and storing human remains for potential revival in the future, has gained renewed interest. However, experts warn that the process is still plagued by significant hurdles, including irreversible cellular damage, especially to the brain, caused by freezing. The human body is a complex system sustained by delicate biochemical processes, and freezing can cause irreparable harm. Even with advanced technology, reviving a frozen body is not like 'flicking a switch' but rather like trying to unscramble an egg. The brain, in particular, is vulnerable to damage due to its intricate structure and high metabolic demands. Additionally, rebuilding neuronal connections and memories is a daunting task, akin to rewriting a burned book from ashes. Cryonics relies heavily on optimism, but experts caution that people should think twice before risking their lives on a very unlikely outcome. As one expert notes, 'it's a process with many significant hurdles to overcome before it could be said to 'work', in any meaningful way.'

**Man's Body Frozen in Hopes of Future Revival**
A 24-year-old man from England, who had been diagnosed with a condition known as 'cryonic', was transported 5,790 kilometers to Michigan, USA, where he was placed in a 'deep freezer' in the hopes of being revived in the future. The man had signed up for a 'long-term cryonic preservation' program in Michigan before his death, which involves freezing the body at extremely low temperatures in the hopes that future technology will be able to revive it. The process involves cooling the body to -196°C using liquid nitrogen, and the man's body was transported to the Cryonics Institute in Michigan, where it was placed in a cryostate. The institute's president, Dennis Kowalski, described the process as 'a journey to a future hospital' and said that the goal is to revive the person in the future using advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and nanotechnology. However, critics have described the process as 'pseudoscience' and 'a waste of money', and some have questioned the ethics of freezing the body of a person who has already died. Despite these criticisms, the Cryonics Institute has over 250 members, including people from all walks of life, and is one of the largest cryonic preservation facilities in the world.

**Frozen in Hope: Cryonics and Our Quest to Outrun Death. ❄️**
Cryonics, the preservation of recently deceased individuals by rapidly cooling their bodies to incredibly low temperatures, has made significant scientific advances in recent years. Researchers have successfully vitrified and rewarmed a mammalian brain without significant structural damage, and created less harmful chemicals that reduce tissue damage during preservation. However, cryonics raises important questions about ethics, humanity, and the privilege of revival. If revival becomes possible, who gets a second chance at life, and will this privilege only extend to the wealthy? Additionally, there are practical challenges, including the high cost of cryonic preservation and the need for trusts or insurance to fund it indefinitely. Despite these challenges, cryonics is a bold gamble that forces us to reflect deeply about life, death, and the lengths we might go to hold onto hope.

**Sleeping for Centuries**
Cryonics is a method that preserves the human body after death, with the hope of reviving it in the future when technology advances. The process begins immediately after a person is declared legally dead, with a team cooling the body with ice to slow down decay. The blood is replaced with a chemical that prevents ice crystals from forming, protecting the cells. The body is then placed in a cryonics chamber filled with liquid nitrogen, which drops the temperature to -196°C (-320°F), stopping all biological activity and decay. As one expert might say, 'it's not alive, but it's not gone either'.

**Man spends £100,000 so his wife and kids can be frozen when they die**
Dennis Kowalski, a 55-year-old father of three, has spent £110,000 to have himself, his wife, and their three sons cryogenically preserved at the end of their lives. The process involves storing the body in a vat of ultra-cold liquid nitrogen, but experts believe it is currently impossible to revive a corpse that has undergone this process. Kowalski, who is the president of the Cryonics Institute, hopes that future discoveries could prove the sceptics wrong. He believes that cryonics is a 'lottery ticket to immortality' and is willing to take a chance at life extension for himself and his family. As of now, more than 264 human bodies have undergone cryogenic freezing, but the business model of cryonics firms faces significant obstacles, including the cost of maintaining the frozen bodies. Kowalski's goal is to 'try to alleviate suffering and pain and to help restore life whenever possible,' and he is willing to 'fight the good fight' to achieve this goal, even if the chance of success is small.

**Cryonic Preservation of Pets: A Russian Company's Offer**
A Russian company is offering cryonic preservation of pets, with prices ranging from 100,000 rubles for DNA preservation to 1.5 million rubles for full-body preservation. The company claims to have preserved 65 animals, including dogs, cats, hamsters, and even birds and fish. The process involves cooling the animal's body to -196°C using liquid nitrogen, and storing it in a Dewar flask. The company's representative, Valeria, explained that the process is similar to taking a biopsy, but instead of removing a small sample of tissue, they remove a thin layer of skin and preserve it. The company's cryonic facility is located near Tver, but it is still under construction. Valeria stated that it is possible to visit the preserved animal, but only with prior agreement. The company has also preserved several human brains, including that of Albert Morenkov, who was the first person to be cryopreserved in Russia in 2003. The cost of cryopreserving a human brain is 1.8 million rubles, and the company claims that it is possible to revive the brain in the future. However, there are no guarantees that the revived brain will be functional or healthy. The company's representative emphasized that they are not gods and cannot guarantee the success of the cryonic preservation process.

**German Start-Up Offers to Freeze People for a Second Chance at Life**
A German start-up, Tomorrow.Bio, is offering to freeze people for a second chance at life for $200,000. The process involves cooling the body to -196°C and storing it in a cryogenic facility in Rafz, Switzerland. The company's founder, Emil Kendziorra, a former cancer researcher, believes that the idea of reviving the dead is realistic, saying, 'Many things that don't work today simply haven't been researched enough.' However, many scientists are skeptical, including Clive Coen, a professor of neuroscience at King's College London, who says that the method is unrealistic because cell decay begins immediately after death. Despite this, the company is optimistic, citing research on worms and rats that have been successfully revived after cryopreservation. Kendziorra sees cryonics as a breakthrough on par with organ transplantation, which was once considered impossible. However, there are also ethical questions, such as who is responsible for long-term storage and revival, and how to secure the preservation of the body over decades or centuries. The company plans to expand its services to the US this year and aims to develop reversible cryopreservation by 2028.
