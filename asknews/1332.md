**Saudi Arabia Achieves 87.5% Reduction in Infectious Diseases**
According to the 2024 Annual Report on the Transformation of the Health Sector, Saudi Arabia has made significant progress in enhancing public health and community prevention through a comprehensive system that focuses on early detection, vaccination, and awareness expansion. The report highlights a notable decrease in targeted infectious diseases, including a 87.5% reduction in rates of hepatitis B, dengue fever, tuberculosis, malaria, measles, German measles, and congenital syphilis, as well as an increase in the rate of HIV/AIDS prevention among those infected. The report attributes this success to the expansion of vaccination programs and nationwide campaigns targeting all age groups and geographic areas. The report also mentions the launch of the Public Health Academy as a national training platform to build preventive capacities, enhance the readiness of public health professionals, and promote applied research in areas related to epidemics, environmental health, chronic and infectious diseases. Additionally, the report highlights initiatives aimed at early detection of newborns for genetic diseases and nutritional deficiencies, as well as blood disorders that can be transmitted through generations. The report also mentions the launch of the national strategy to combat drowning, which aims to prevent one of the leading causes of death among children and adolescents through awareness campaigns, practical training, and cooperation with the Ministries of Education and Sports to integrate awareness into curricula and summer activities. The report also highlights efforts to localize the healthcare industry, which has seen numerous services and efforts contributing to achieving health security and self-sufficiency in the Kingdom through providing local industrial needs. The report also mentions the center's efforts to promote mental health, including initiatives to train community members, teachers, and healthcare professionals on basic support skills and rapid intervention in mental health crises, as well as developing specialized training packages and accredited certificates to expand community awareness and reduce the stigma of mental illness. These efforts are part of the Vision 2030 goals to enhance prevention against health risks, improve public health, and focus on early detection of diseases that threaten human health, solidifying the transformation of the health sector in the Kingdom from a treatment-focused system to a preventive and proactive model. This has contributed to raising the average life expectancy in the Kingdom to 78.8 years, with a target of reaching 80 years by 2030, enabling a vibrant and healthy community.

**Child in Africa 50 times more likely to die before age five - Bill Gates**
Bill Gates, chair of the Gates Foundation, has warned that global health inequalities remain stark, with children born in parts of Africa 50 times more likely to die before age five than those in wealthier countries. Despite progress, most child deaths under five still occur in low-income countries, which Gates described as 'profoundly unjust'. However, he also acknowledged the progress Africa has made in reducing child deaths, citing increased vaccine access, strengthened health systems, and political will across many African countries. Gates attributed the improvement to a partnership in the early years of the foundation, which led to a 70% reduction in HIV deaths. He praised Zimbabwe for achieving some of the best rates globally in HIV treatment coverage and viral suppression. Gates also highlighted the near eradication of polio in Nigeria and the development of a $2 rotavirus vaccine that once cost $30. He emphasized the importance of tackling malnutrition, which may be an even greater challenge than malaria or HIV, and called for more investment in nutrition solutions and early intervention.

**Africa: Pandemic Impact on Africa, World, Health Decline Revealed in Report**
The 2025 World Health Statistics Report reveals a significant decline in global health due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), global life expectancy fell by 1.8 years between 2019 and 2021, the largest drop in recent history. The report also notes that increased levels of anxiety and depression linked to COVID-19 reduced global healthy life expectancy by 6 weeks. A new study by the McKinsey Health Institute (MHI) highlights the shortage of healthcare workers, with Africa accounting for 52% of the global shortage. The study's author, Marc Canal Noguer, notes that 'Africa has 17 percent of the world's population, but it accounts for 52 percent of the shortage of healthcare workers, and this needs to be addressed.' The report also notes that eliminating the worker shortage could extend global life expectancy at birth by 18 months, but this improvement is slight in comparison to the potential for Africa, where individuals could live seven years longer. To address this, the healthcare workforce requires attention, investment, and innovation, particularly in Africa where many healthcare workers leave for countries with higher standards of living.

**Minister of Health: 74% of Global Deaths Caused by Non-Communicable Diseases**
According to Health Minister Walid Abdel Ghaffar, 74% of global deaths are caused by non-communicable diseases. He emphasized the importance of investing in preventive healthcare infrastructure, stating that the national health strategy focuses on two main pillars: preventing non-communicable diseases and treating existing ones. Abdel Ghaffar also highlighted the need to support the expanded vaccination program, citing the clear link between vaccinations and improved public health, not only in reducing infection rates but also in reducing the economic burden of treating chronic diseases. He noted that a 2024 study by the World Health Organization found that approximately 74% of global deaths are attributed to non-communicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases. The study suggests that investing in prevention and early detection programs can provide more than $7 trillion in healthcare cost savings globally by 2030.

**USAID Cuts to Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under five years old. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.' Bill Gates has announced that he will increase his donations to global health programs to $10 billion annually and maintain the investment for 20 years.

**Trump cuts will reverse progress on AIDS**
The global AIDS epidemic is at risk of spiraling out of control due to the Trump administration's cuts to foreign assistance and recommitment to funding global health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of new HIV infections in 2023 was still more than three times the 2025 target of 370,000 or fewer new infections. If this trend continues, the target of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 will not be reached. UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima warned that the Trump funding freeze 'means that overnight one in every three dollars for fighting disease, preventing pandemics, has halted.' This has led to real-world consequences, including clinics shutting down and HIV, TB, and malaria efforts grinding to a halt. Byanyima estimated that 5,800 people are now being infected every day, up from 3,500, and that if the U.S. global health funding cuts become permanent, there will be an additional 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths globally by 2029. 'All the progress made over the last 25 years would be gone,' Byanyima warned. 'It would be a disaster for those countries with the highest HIV burden in Africa. But it would also be an unmitigated crisis for global health with devastating consequences too for rich countries.'

**USAID Closure: A Political Decision with Lethal Consequences**
A study by the Global Health Institute of Barcelona (ISGlobal) has found that the decision by the US Administration, led by President Donald Trump, to close the US Agency for International Development (USAID) will result in 14 million deaths between now and 2030. This includes 4 million children under the age of five in poor countries. The USAID, which had a budget of $44 billion in 2024, funded around 43% of global humanitarian aid. The study's findings are 'sencillamente escalofriante' (simply chilling). Trump's decision to dissolve the USAID is a 'decisión política con consecuencias letales' (a political decision with lethal consequences). The USAID was created in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy to promote global economic prosperity, food security, democracy, human rights, public health, and humanitarian assistance. Trump's order to dissolve the USAID is a 'apuesta resuelta por la muerte de millones de personas' (a resolute bet on the death of millions of people). The study also found that the USAID's actions have prevented 91.8 million premature deaths between 2001 and 2021 through its policies against HIV, malaria, and tropical diseases. The world is advancing, but many people still suffer from their needs and are left behind. The situation is 'grave e interpela a otros países' (grave and appeals to other countries), including European countries that are planning to cut their foreign aid budgets.

**COVID-19 Pandemic Reduces Global Life Expectancy by 1.8 Years, WHO Reports**
The COVID-19 pandemic has had 'profound health consequences' and reduced the global life expectancy by 1.8 years, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The pandemic has caused a slowdown in progress and a slower recovery, prompting the WHO to call for global measures to 'regain' momentum. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has lamented the 'deficiencies' in access to protection and investment, and has urged governments to act with 'urgency', 'commitment', and 'accountability'. The WHO has also reported that 1.4 billion people are now living healthier lives, thanks to a reduction in tobacco consumption, improved air quality, and better access to water, hygiene, and sanitation. However, maternal and infant mortality rates are not decreasing 'quickly enough' to meet global goals, and are related to a lack of investment in primary care, a shortage of qualified healthcare personnel, and deficiencies in vaccination and safe childbirth services. The WHO has also highlighted the need to prevent the deaths of 700,000 mothers and 8 million children under the age of five. Additionally, the organization has noted that premature deaths from non-communicable diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer, are still a major concern. While the WHO does not believe that the world is on track to reduce this mortality by a third by 2030, it has noted that tobacco and alcohol consumption are decreasing globally, with a reduction in per capita alcohol consumption from 5.7 liters to 5 liters between 2010 and 2022. The WHO has also highlighted the need to address the ongoing issue of air pollution, which caused over 6.7 million deaths in 2022. On a positive note, the organization has reported a decrease in the incidence of HIV and tuberculosis, as well as a decrease in the number of people needing treatment for neglected tropical diseases. However, it has also lamented the resurgence of malaria since 2015 and identified antimicrobial resistance as one of its main challenges. Furthermore, the WHO has noted that vaccination rates have not fully recovered from the pandemic, and that many countries are 'falling behind' in the fight against health risks such as malnutrition, air pollution, and insecure living conditions. Finally, the organization has highlighted the need to address recent interruptions in international funding, which is expected to result in a shortage of 11.1 healthcare professionals by 2030, with nearly 70% of this deficit concentrated in Africa and the Middle East.

**Global Life Expectancy Decreases by 1.8 Years, WHO Reports**
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global life expectancy has decreased by 1.8 years over the past two years, from 2019 to 2021. This is the largest decline in recent history. 'Each data point represents a person - a child who did not reach the age of five, a mother who lost her life during childbirth, a life cut short by a preventable disease,' said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The report highlights that progress in expanding access to basic healthcare and protecting populations in emergency situations has not met the set targets. While 431 million more people have gained access to basic healthcare, this is far below the target of 1 billion. Maternal and child mortality rates are decreasing at a slow pace. Limited investments in primary healthcare, a shortage of qualified healthcare workers, and gaps in services such as immunization and safe childbirth are hindering progress. On the other hand, premature death rates from non-communicable diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer, are increasing. These now account for the majority of deaths among people under 70. The world is falling behind schedule to reduce premature deaths from non-communicable diseases by 2030. Progress has been made in areas where governments and civil society have taken necessary measures, such as reducing tobacco and alcohol consumption. However, air pollution remains a major cause of preventable deaths. Mental health is also a significant factor, with anxiety and depression reducing healthy life expectancy by six weeks. Rates of HIV, tuberculosis, and tropical diseases are decreasing, but malaria is on the rise again since 2015. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance remains a serious problem.

**USAID Dissolution Could Lead to 14 Million Additional Deaths by 2030**
A study by the Institute of Global Health of Barcelona (ISGlobal) estimates that 14 million people will die worldwide, 4.5 million of them children under the age of five, if the US Agency for International Development (USAID) is dissolved and funding cuts continue. The study, which analyzed the impact of USAID's programs, found that they have helped prevent over 91 million deaths globally, nearly a third of them children, in the last 20 years. USAID's funding has reduced global mortality by 15%, with a 74% reduction in deaths from HIV, a 53% reduction in malaria deaths, and a 51% reduction in deaths from neglected tropical diseases. However, US President Donald Trump has frozen funding for 90 days and reevaluated its relevance. 'These cuts will cause permanent damage to the health of vulnerable populations, especially because they are being made abruptly,' said Davide Rasella, lead author of the study. 'The terrible impact of the cuts is already being seen in many places.' The study also found that other countries, such as the UK, France, and the Netherlands, have announced reductions in their aid budgets, exacerbating the crisis. 'The children will suffer the most from these cuts. It's paradoxical that we always talk about cost-effectiveness when investing in health, and there is no more effective act globally than saving the life of a child in an African country,' said Rasella.

**Malaria Remains a Deadly Threat to Children in Africa**
Despite progress, malaria remains a deadly threat to children in Africa. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were nearly 600,000 deaths in 83 countries due to malaria in 2023. The majority of cases and deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where 94% of cases and 95% of deaths were reported. Children under five years old accounted for 76% of deaths in Africa, with over 1,000 children dying every day. Malaria can have a mild course and is treatable if caught early, but prevention is key. Measures include avoiding mosquito bites, using insecticide-treated nets, and wearing long clothing. Two malaria vaccines have been approved for children and have been introduced in 13 African countries. Studies have shown that the combination of vaccination and insecticide-treated nets is effective in reducing malaria cases. However, challenges remain, including increasing resistance to insecticides, the spread of invasive mosquitoes, and mutations of the malaria parasite. The WHO aims to reduce malaria incidence and mortality by 90% by 2030. The US decision to freeze USAID funding has created significant gaps in funding for malaria programs, leaving many African countries with critical shortages of rapid tests and medicines. The climate crisis is also expected to impact malaria transmission, with some studies predicting a reduction in malaria transmission areas in Africa due to climate change. However, other studies suggest that the spread of malaria could increase in regions with high temperatures and humidity. 'We cannot allow funding setbacks to jeopardize the global malaria agenda,' said Jérôme Salomon, WHO Deputy Director-General. 'Our goal is to ensure that this vaccine complements other measures to reduce malaria incidence and mortality by 90% by 2030,' said Charles Shey, WHO Africa Director of the Department of Diseases Preventable by Vaccination. 'We must not let funding setbacks jeopardize the global malaria agenda,' said Jérôme Salomon, WHO Deputy Director-General.

**UN Report Warns of Major Setback in Reducing Maternal Mortality Due to Aid Budget Cuts**
According to the United Nations, the reduction of aid budgets threatens the fragile progress made in eliminating maternal mortality. Despite major challenges, countries must recommit to ending deaths related to childbirth. The probability of a woman surviving pregnancy and childbirth has never been higher, but the UN warns of a major setback due to unprecedented cuts in aid budgets worldwide. A new UN report released today, on the occasion of World Health Day, shows a 40% global decline in maternal deaths between 2000 and 2023, largely due to improved access to essential health services. However, the report reveals that the rate of progress has significantly slowed since 2016, and approximately 260,000 women died in 2023 due to complications during pregnancy or childbirth, equivalent to about one death every two minutes. The report highlights the urgent need to strengthen health systems, improve access to quality maternal healthcare, and address underlying health issues such as anemia, malaria, and non-communicable diseases that increase risks. It is also crucial to ensure girls remain in school and women and girls have the knowledge and resources to protect their health. The report emphasizes that investing in maternal mortality prevention is urgent, as the global maternal mortality rate is still far from the UN's Sustainable Development Goal of 2030, which aims to reduce the rate by 15% annually.

**Maternal Mortality Decreases by 40% Globally, but Progress Stalls in Some Regions**
According to the UN, maternal mortality has decreased by 40% globally from 2000 to 2023, primarily due to improved access to basic medical services. However, the UN warns that the reduction in global healthcare funding poses a threat to the lives of pregnant women, especially in vulnerable countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the decline in funding has disrupted the supply chains of essential medicines, particularly for treating bleeding, pre-eclampsia, and malaria, which are the main causes of maternal mortality. 'Reducing global healthcare funding puts the lives of pregnant women at risk, especially in vulnerable countries, limiting their access to necessary care. The world must urgently invest in midwives, nurses, and healthcare workers to give every mother and child a chance to survive,' said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. The UN notes that progress in reducing maternal mortality has stalled in 5 regions since 2015, including Europe. Women today have a greater chance of surviving pregnancy and childbirth than ever before, but the pace of improvement has slowed significantly since 2016. In 2023, approximately 260,000 women died due to complications related to pregnancy or childbirth, which is roughly one death every 2 minutes. To achieve the desired result by 2030, the level of maternal mortality must decrease by 15% annually, ten times faster than the current rate (1.5%). 'In addition to ensuring access to quality obstetric care, it is crucial to strengthen basic health and reproductive rights of women and girls, which determine their chances of a safe pregnancy and childbirth,' said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The UN report also presents a global assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal survival. In 2021, an additional 40,000 women died due to the pandemic, 322,000 compared to 282,000 in 2020. This increase is linked not only to direct complications from COVID-19 but also to massive disruptions in the healthcare system. Despite the overall 40% decrease in maternal mortality, only three UN regions have achieved significant reductions since 2015: Africa south of the Sahara, Australia and New Zealand, and Central and South Asia. Africa south of the Sahara, despite significant achievements, remains the region with the highest level of maternal mortality, approximately 70% of the global total in 2023. High poverty rates and conflicts continue to deepen the crisis. Progress in reducing maternal mortality has stalled in 5 regions since 2015: North Africa and Western Asia; East and Southeast Asia; Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand); Europe and North America; and Latin America and the Caribbean. Pregnant women living in humanitarian crisis zones and conflict areas face the highest risks. Almost two-thirds of all maternal deaths now occur in countries affected by instability or war. The worst indicators are in Chad and the Central African Republic, Nigeria, Somalia, and Afghanistan. 'It is essential to ensure that every woman has access to quality healthcare, including reproductive health services, to prevent maternal mortality,' said Catherine Russell. The UN emphasizes that the global community must work together to address the root causes of maternal mortality and ensure that every woman has access to quality healthcare.

**New Report Warns of Global Funding Cuts Threatening Maternal Mortality Progress**
According to a new report by UNICEF and other UN agencies, the rate of maternal mortality has decreased globally, but the situation is still critical in many countries. The report warns that a unprecedented scale of funding cuts for global health services may lead to a significant setback in the fight against maternal mortality. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said, 'When a mother dies during pregnancy or childbirth, her baby's life is also at risk. Too often, preventable causes lead to the loss of both mother and child. The global funding cuts for health services, particularly in the most vulnerable regions, will make it even harder for pregnant women to receive the care they need during pregnancy and support during childbirth, putting even more lives at risk. The world must invest in midwives, nurses, and community health workers immediately to ensure that all mothers and babies have a chance to survive and thrive.' The report shows that maternal mortality rates have stagnated in five regions since 2015, except for North Africa and the Middle East, East Asia and Southeast Asia, Oceania excluding Australia and New Zealand, Europe and North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The report highlights that women living in humanitarian crises are at the highest risk, with two-thirds of maternal deaths occurring in countries with high vulnerability or conflict. For example, a 15-year-old girl in these countries is at a 51:1 risk of dying from pregnancy or childbirth, compared to 593:1 in more stable countries. The countries with the highest risk are Chad and the Central African Republic (24:1), Nigeria (25:1), Somalia (30:1), and Afghanistan (40:1). The report emphasizes the importance of ensuring access to essential services for pregnant women, including family planning, and preventing preventable causes such as anemia, malaria, and non-communicable diseases. It also highlights the importance of girls continuing their education and women and girls having access to knowledge and resources to protect their health. The world needs to invest urgently in preventing maternal mortality, as it is currently off track to meet the SDG target of reducing maternal mortality by 2030. To achieve the target, the global maternal mortality rate needs to be reduced by approximately 15% annually, a significant increase from the current annual reduction rate of 1.5%.

**Tuberculosis: How High is the Infection Risk in Germany?**
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there has been some progress in the fight against tuberculosis (TB), but the goals for 2030 are still far from being achieved. Despite a decrease in the number of deaths from TB, the disease remains a major threat. In 2023, it is estimated that 10.8 million people worldwide contracted TB, with 56% of cases occurring in five countries: India, Indonesia, China, the Philippines, and Pakistan. The number of deaths from TB decreased from 1.32 million to 1.25 million. In Germany, the number of TB cases is relatively low, but experts warn that the disease is a global threat due to its high mobility. Peter Sands, head of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, said, 'The important message of the report: If we act consistently, we can end TB.' However, more funding is needed for testing and treatment programs. The goal was to reduce TB deaths by 75% from 2015 to 2025, but the actual decrease was only 23% by 2023. The frequency of new infections should have decreased by 50% by 2025, but it only decreased by 8.3% in 2023. The best results were achieved in the European region, with a decrease of 27%, and in Africa, with a decrease of 24%.

**Tuberculosis: How Deadly is the Infection in Germany?**
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been some progress in the fight against tuberculosis (TB), but the goals for 2030 are still far from being achieved. Despite a decline in the number of deaths, TB remains a significant threat worldwide. In 2023, it is estimated that TB was the leading cause of death among infectious diseases, with 1.25 million fatalities. The WHO reports that the number of new cases in 2023 was 10.8 million, with 56% of these cases occurring in five countries: India, Indonesia, China, the Philippines, and Pakistan. In Germany, the number of TB cases is relatively low, with 0.8 cases per 100,000 people in 2023. Peter Sands, head of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, says, 'The important message of the report is that if we act consistently, we can end TB.' However, more funding is needed for testing and treatment programs. The goal was to reduce TB deaths by 75% between 2015 and 2025, but the actual decline was only 23% by 2023. The frequency of new cases was also not reduced as much as hoped, with a decline of only 8.3% by 2023.
