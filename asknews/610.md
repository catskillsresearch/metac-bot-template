**Two Scenarios: How Putin Will Respond to the Destroyed Planes**
Considering Putin's KGB background, there are two possible scenarios for his response to the destroyed planes. Firstly, he will not be able to remain silent about the incident on June 1st. A nuclear strike is unlikely, as Putin will be cautious. The reaction of other nuclear powers, including China and India, will be crucial. A simple drone attack or a ballistic missile strike on Kiev's center may not be enough to demonstrate Russia's strength. 'It won't be enough' from the perspective of the population, which will perceive the event as a sign of weakness. In Russian politics, growing such sentiments is unpleasant and dangerous for the tsar. Putin needs a 'small victory'. The second scenario is already underway - an increase in pressure on the front line, which does not rule out attempts to destroy Ukrainian leadership with rocket attacks. However, the pace of the Russian advance is not particularly breakthrough. It's clear that it's not enough for the 'second army of the world.' Even if the summer campaign is successful, the result will be closer to autumn. Before autumn, the population needs to be fed a fairy tale, especially against the backdrop of significant losses. Here, considering Putin's KGB background, I see two components. The first is to instill fear. Create a story about a terrorist threat. Start searching for dacha owners in containers. Of course, with their arrests. And come up with a few allegedly Ukrainian attacks on civilian infrastructure. By analogy with the bombings before the second Chechen war. Russians should be afraid and, conditionally, ask the tsar to protect them by any means. The second stage is the announcement of mobilization 'at the request of the working people.' On the one hand, it will be a game of 'patriotic war' in propaganda. On the other hand, it will solve the problem of additional meat for attempts to break through the Ukrainian defense. And, finally, the economy will save on the cost of signing a contract. The Ministry of Defense will likely pay the remaining 400,000 out of 3.5-4 million rubles. The rest will be covered by the federal subjects. These funds will be saved. After all, mobilization is not a contract. Thus, by June, we can expect the start of mobilization in Russia. The second, but not main, thing is to find a scapegoat. On the one hand, it could be the head of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Andrei Belyaninov, but he may hold on. As an auditor, he cleaned up several schemes. Therefore, he is not liked by some of the old cadres in the Ministry of Defense. But he is supported by Chemezov and Patrushev. Therefore, his resignation is not 100% likely. The dismissal of several generals is possible, especially if Belyaninov holds on - he will be a supporter of public flogging. So, a place will be freed up for his protégés. Supporters of the same flogging will be people from Chemezov. Because it is Rostec that will be responsible for the restoration of strategic aviation. And this is big, very big money. Considering the development and construction deadlines for new aircraft, the money must be shown without obligations by the end of the year. However, the above does not rule out air strikes by Russia. And, already in July, a significant improvement (even compared to the current situation) on the front. Putin needs a 'small victory'. A 'small victory' is needed, as life itself.

**Nikola Tesla's Prophecy : The Silent War of Artificial Intelligence**
Nikola Tesla predicted in 1898 that future wars would be waged with intelligence and remotely controlled machines, rather than bullets and bombs. He believed that when both sides can calculate the outcome with certainty, the rational choice would be surrender. Today, Tesla's vision of 'teleautomata' or remotely controlled warfare is a reality, with global powers already engaging in silent wars of artificial intelligence. As Tesla said, 'War will cease to be possible, when all the world knows tomorrow that the most feeble of nations can supply itself immediately with a weapon which will render its coast secure and its ports impregnable.'

**Western Media Predicts Devastating War by 2025**
Western media has gathered predictions from four well-known psychics, including Nostradamus and Bulgarian Baba Vanga, who claim that a devastating war will occur by the end of 2025. According to their predictions, the war will be so catastrophic that it will 'destroy' the population and lead to the 'destruction of humanity'. Atoos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian, also known as the 'Living Nostradamus', warned that the world is on the brink of a Third World War, stating that 'it will not be just a war between people, but also between machines, and the worst is yet to come'. Nicholas Aujula, a hypnotherapist from London, agrees that 2025 will be a year of 'lack of compassion' in the world, predicting 'horrific acts of human cruelty and violence towards each other - in the name of religion and nationalism'. The article concludes by speculating that Russia's recent actions, including the annexation of Ukraine and the threat of nuclear war, may be a cause for concern, but ultimately, the predictions of the psychics are unclear and may be a form of propaganda.

**Ukrainian Document Reveals Roadmap for Peace in Europe Before Istanbul Talks**
According to a document obtained by 'Reuters', the Ukrainian negotiators will present a roadmap to the Russian side in the upcoming talks in Istanbul on June 2. The roadmap includes a 30-day ceasefire, the release of all prisoners held by both sides, and the return of Ukrainian children who were moved to Russian-controlled areas. The plan also calls for a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The document states that Moscow and Kyiv, with the involvement of the US and Europe, will work together to draft the conditions for a comprehensive agreement to end the war, which is the largest conflict in Europe since World War II. Ukrainian officials said earlier this week that they had sent the plan to the Russian side before the Istanbul talks. The Ukrainian conditions for a peace agreement, outlined in the document, are largely the same as those previously proposed by Kyiv and include no restrictions on Ukraine's military power after a peace agreement, non-recognition of Russia's sovereignty over the areas of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces during the war, and compensation for Ukraine. The document also states that the current front line will be the starting point for negotiations on territory, which differs significantly from Russia's publicly stated demands in recent weeks. US President Donald Trump has urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together to reach an agreement to end the war between them. Russia has proposed a second round of face-to-face talks with Ukrainian officials in Istanbul next week.

**Ukraine Presents Roadmap for Peace Talks in Istanbul**
Ukraine's negotiators are preparing to present Russia with a 'roadmap' for achieving a strong peace during the planned talks in Istanbul on June 2. According to a document obtained by Reuters, the Ukrainian proposal includes a 30-day ceasefire, the return of all prisoners held by both sides, and the repatriation of Ukrainian children taken to Russian-controlled territories. Only after these steps are taken will a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin take place. The plan also calls for Moscow and Kiev, with the involvement of the United States and Europe, to work on agreeing the conditions for a complete ceasefire, which has become the largest conflict in Europe since World War II. Ukrainian officials have already sent the plan to the Russian side before the start of the Istanbul talks. The conditions outlined in the document largely match those previously proposed by Kiev: 'Our defense, our active actions, our diplomacy. We are doing everything to protect our independence, our state, and our people. I have defined the tasks for the near future. I have also defined our positions before the meeting in Istanbul on Monday', said President Zelensky.

**Four Prophets Predict Third World War by End of 2025**
Four renowned prophets have predicted a Third World War by the end of 2025, according to the New York Post. Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, French astrologer Nostradamus, Brazilian psychic Atos Salome, and London hypnotherapist Nicholas Ouley have independently predicted a massive conflict that could change the course of human history. Baba Vanga, known as the 'Balkan Nostradamus', has predicted the 9/11 attacks, the death of Princess Diana, and recent earthquakes caused by climate change. She sees the war in Europe this year as the beginning of 'humanity's downfall' and a global catastrophe for the planet's population. Nostradamus, in his famous 'Prophecies' of 1555, also made ominous predictions, including the rise of Adolf Hitler and the COVID-19 pandemic. He warns that Great Britain will be drawn into brutal wars, writing: 'When those from the lands of Europe see England establish its throne from behind, its flanks will be surrounded by brutal wars. The kingdom will be marked by wars so brutal that enemies from within and without will rise up.' He also added: 'The Great Plague of the past returns, there is no more deadly enemy under the sky.' Atos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian psychic, has also warned of an inevitable global conflict. According to his prediction, the Third World War will be especially dangerous due to the use of advanced technologies, cyber warfare, and machines. He says: 'This is not just a war of people, but a war of machines, and what will happen next? The worst is yet to come.' He believes that technological progress, which has the potential for incredible development, also creates a threat to humanity's existence. Nicholas Ouley, a 38-year-old London hypnotherapist, adds that the war may start as early as mid-2025. He attributes the cause of such a scenario to 'a lack of compassion in the world', which provokes horrific acts of violence and hostility in the name of religion and nationalism. According to his prophecy, humanity will face unprecedented brutality and absurdity.

He wrote: 'When those in European lands see England establish its throne behind, its flanks will be beset by brutal wars. The kingdom will be marked by wars so brutal that enemies from within and without will rise up.' Atos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian seer, also warns of an inevitable global conflict. According to his prophecy, the Third World War will be especially dangerous due to the use of new technologies, cyber weapons, and machines.

Nicholas Ouley, a 38-year-old London hypnotherapist, adds that the war may start as early as mid-2025. He attributes this to 'a lack of compassion in the world', which provokes terrible acts of violence and hatred in the name of religion and nationalism. According to his prophecy, humanity will face unprecedented brutality and senselessness. All these terrifying predictions coincide with the current tense geopolitical situation. In late May 2025, Pakistan and India exchanged rocket attacks on military targets, leading to US calls for negotiations to stop the escalation of the conflict. Although the parties agreed to a ceasefire, it was violated within hours in the Kashmir region. Meanwhile, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has claimed the lives of at least seven people in recent weeks due to massive rocket and drone attacks on Kiev and other regions. These events demonstrate the high level of tension and seriousness of the situation. Experts in the field of technology also warn of the danger posed by uncontrolled development of artificial intelligence, comparing it to nuclear weapons in terms of potential threat. This idea resonates with Atos Salome's warning about the 'machine war' of the future.

**80 Years of Peace, Another War Looms**
Stefan Zweig's book 'El mundo de ayer' (The World of Yesterday) highlights the alarming similarities between the past and present. Zweig, who lived through both World War I and II, notes that the world is once again on the brink of chaos. He attributes the start of the first war to an 'excess of energy' and the second war to the manipulation of information and the rise of nationalism. Zweig writes, 'No existía protección contra el hecho de ser continuamente informado e interesado. No había país al que huir' ('There was no protection against being constantly informed and interested. There was no country to flee to'). He concludes that the world is on the verge of another war, just like the one in 1914, after 80 years of peace.

**Four Psychics Predict a Catastrophic 2025: A Devastating War and Global Chaos**
Four well-known psychics, including Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, French astrologer Nostradamus, Brazilian psychic Atos Salome, and London hypnotherapist Nicolas Aujula, have made a chilling prediction that 2025 may be a catastrophic year for humanity. According to them, the world may be shaken by a devastating war that will lead to catastrophic consequences. Baba Vanga, known as the 'Balkan Nostradamus', has previously made accurate predictions, including the 9/11 attacks, the death of Princess Diana, and China's rise to power. She warned that Europe will be engulfed in a destructive war in 2025, marking the 'fall of humanity' and 'devastating' the population. Interestingly, her predictions about devastating earthquakes in 2025 have already begun to come true, as Myanmar and Thailand were hit by destructive tremors last month. Nostradamus, in his famous 'Book of Prophecies', written in 1555, also warned of a great war that will affect Britain. He wrote: 'When those who come from European lands see how England has established its throne behind. With its flanks, fierce wars will arise.' He said that 'the kingdom will be marked by fierce wars, enemies will arise from within and without. The great sea from the past will return, there is no more deadly enemy under the sky.' Atos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian psychic, known as the 'Living Nostradamus', also predicts an inevitable Third World War. Salome is known for accurately predicting the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of Queen Elizabeth II, and a global Microsoft system failure. He warned that 'the worst is yet to come' and noted the growth of problems related to cyberwar and the use of technology as the main forms of combat in the 21st century. 'This is a war not just of people, but also of machines,' he said. London hypnotherapist Nicolas Aujula, also 38, agrees that 2025 will be 'a year when the world will lack compassion.' He expects 'horrific acts of human cruelty and violence against each other - in the name of religion and nationalism,' predicting that the Third World War may occur before mid-year.

**Four Psychics Predict Apocalyptic End of 2025: 'The Worst is Yet to Come'**
Four well-known psychics, including Baba Vanga, Nostradamus, Brazilian psychic Atos Salome, and London hypnotherapist Nicholas Ojula, have made a chilling prediction that a Third World War will start in 2025. According to the New York Post, all four psychics are convinced that the war will begin this year. Baba Vanga predicted that a war will break out in Europe this year, which she called the start of 'humanity's downfall' and a major blow to the planet's population. Nostradamus also repeated this warning, stating that the UK will be drawn into the conflict. 'The kingdom will be marked by such brutal wars that enemies will rise both from outside and from within,' he said. Atos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian psychic, is also convinced that the Third World War is on the horizon and 'the worst is yet to come.' He believes that this conflict will be more terrifying than previous ones, as it will involve technology and cyber warfare. 'This is not just a war between people, it's a war of machines - and what will happen next?' he said with concern. His words echo those of technology experts who warn of the need to regulate artificial intelligence as strictly as nuclear weapons if humanity wants to survive. Nicholas Ojula, a 38-year-old hypnotherapist from London, also believes that the war could start as early as mid-year due to 'a lack of empathy in the world.' Referring to his visions, he claims: 'We will witness horrific acts of human cruelty and violence against each other - in the name of religion and nationalism.'

**Germany's New Chancellor Makes Controversial Statement on Taking Responsibility for Europe and the World**
New German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated that Germany will take responsibility for Europe and the world again, saying 'Germany will take responsibility - in Europe and in the world. Not loudly, but reliably. Not proudly, but as a partner.' However, this statement has sparked concern and criticism from Russia and other experts. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova questioned the timing of the statement, saying 'When did we hear this before?' and 'When once again will we hear this?' Political analyst Nikolai Starikov noted that Germany has a history of taking 'responsibility' for the world, citing the devastating consequences of World War II, which resulted in the deaths of 70-85 million people. Another expert, 'Starsher Edy', expressed surprise that Merz made the statement on April 19, the day before Adolf Hitler's birthday, and suggested that Germany's intentions may be more sinister. The article concludes that Germany's statement may be a sign of its intentions to start a new war, with some experts speculating that this could happen as early as 2029.

**Third World War to Start in Late 2024, Predicts Author**
The author believes that the third world war will start at the end of 2024. The war will be triggered by a conflict between Israel and Hamas, which will escalate into a larger Middle Eastern war between the US and Iran. The author also predicts that China will launch a military operation on Taiwan between November 6, 2024, and January 6, 2025, when the US will be in a state of civil war and unable to consolidate its efforts. The author notes that the recent election in Taiwan, where the Democratic Progressive Party won, which advocates for Taiwan's independence from China, has increased the likelihood of a Chinese invasion. The author believes that the war will start with a conflict between North and South Korea, which will divert US resources and lead to a full-scale third world war. The author predicts that the US will lose its global dominance and become a regional power, and the world will become a multipolar one with regional wars. The author warns that the world is entering a zone of strong turbulence and that the third world war is inevitable, with the only question being whether it will be conventional or nuclear, which would lead to the end of civilization.

**Russian tanks roll across the border, a barrage of missiles are fired on Britain - then nuclear hell breaks out: GENERAL SIR RICHARD SHIRREFF reveals how he believes WW3 will begin... and we have just two years to prepare | Daily Mail Online**
General Sir Richard Shirreff predicts that World War 3 will begin in two years, unless the West takes action to deter Russia. He believes that Russia will renege on a ceasefire deal with Ukraine and launch a full-scale attack. Shirreff warns that the West is not prepared for a conventional war with Russia, and that the US is not a reliable ally. He suggests that the West needs to establish a peacekeeping force in Ukraine, without US involvement, and be prepared for a long and bloody conflict. Shirreff also believes that Russia will use unconventional tactics, such as sabotage, arson, and cyber attacks, to weaken the West before launching a full-scale attack. He predicts that the conflict will escalate rapidly, with Russia launching a nuclear strike on Ukraine and the West retaliating with a nuclear strike on Russia. Shirreff concludes that the West needs to prioritize defense and be prepared to take a stand against Russia, or risk losing its very existence.

**Why World War Three is already here... and how UK will need to lead**
The article argues that World War III has already begun, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, marking the start of a global conflict. The war is not limited to Ukraine, but has spread to other parts of the world, including the Balkans, Caucasia, Baltic Sea, Libya, Sudan, the Sahel in Africa, Syria, and the Middle East. The article also highlights the role of China in supporting Russia's war efforts, and the need for Europe to take action to defend itself against Russian and Chinese aggression. The author argues that Europe must backstop Ukraine, implement a no-fly zone, and actively defend itself against Russian and Chinese sabotage, espionage, and influence peddling. The article concludes that Europe must stay strong and not fall for Putin's nuclear bluffing, and that the continent must secure its defense to prevent a catastrophic outcome.

**Is the Trump-Putin 'Amizade' the Gateway to the 3rd World War?**
The geopolitical landscape is shifting, with the US approaching Russia while Europe is on high alert and trying to protect itself. This precarious balance has some analysts warning of a general conflict. This is not the first time this threat has loomed, and in previous instances, it has weakened before consolidating. Now, it's even being discussed by US President Donald Trump, who said in a televised argument with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that the Ukrainian is 'playing with the Third World War'. Raquel Gontijo, a professor of International Relations at PUC Minas, notes that 'every war is unthinkable until it happens. Just before the Ukraine war started in 2022, analysts said that a war in Europe was unthinkable at that time. The First and Second Wars were unthinkable until they happened.' The world has changed since the Second War, and the start of a conflict will likely be different. There is at least one contemporary parallel with the dangerous scenario of the 1930s, according to the professor. 'An analogy that has been made is that, in the period before the Second War, the UK perceived the territorial expansion of Germany and adopted an appeasement policy, allowing it to expand and thinking that a peaceful configuration would be reached later. Clearly, that did not happen.' The parallel with this case is Russia and its expansionist ambitions. The peace agreement that the US is trying to broker between Russians and Ukrainians favors Putin, who would take at least a quarter of Ukrainian territory. What comes next is a mystery. 'What does Russia want? Just a part of Ukraine? The whole of Ukraine? More expansion in Eastern Europe? Where does this end? We don't know,' concludes the professor. Lucas Carlos Lima, a professor of International Law at UFMG, analyzes the situation with caution. 'It depends a lot on what is meant by the Third World War. If the sense is a conflict with a high number of participants, including nuclear powers, the risk exists. But, at the same time, there are many efforts to mitigate the risks. States are not economically or politically interested in a larger-scale conflict.' It is at this point that the apparent approach of Trump and Putin is worrying. In the field of international relations, movements are rarely transparent, and all that can be done is infer intentions from the actors. There are analysts who see in Trump's attacks on Zelensky and, consequently, in the affection for Putin, a attempt to distance Russians and Chinese. Others see it as a personal issue of Trump, admired by Putin's power. Or, still, a political calculation to increase his prestige as someone who ended a long war and saved resources for his country. 'The Trump administration has changed its position on the Ukraine war. This does not necessarily mean a general and unrestricted approach to Putin. First, the intention may be to reduce American presence in the European conflict. Second, to reduce tensions with the Russian administration, which was approaching a proxy war. Third, the approach may also serve to end Russian isolation, which automatically brought Moscow closer to Beijing,' considers the professor Lucas Carlos Lima. In the way, there is Europe. After Trump's attacks on Zelensky, European leaders rallied around the Ukrainian and announced billions of dollars to reinforce the continent's defense. The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that 'Europe faces a clear and present danger on a scale that none of us has experienced in our adult life.' Even between China, the US, and Russia, Europe is a major military and economic force, one of the protagonists in the global political game. 'The problem is that it is not a country, but several overlapping blocks. Sometimes, coordination fails, and each country will have its own interpretation, with governments more to the right, others more to the left. Acting as a block is difficult,' notes Professor Raquel Gontijo. For Latin America, for now, it remains to watch the dance of the great powers, at a time when a greater threat than a war in the short term for Brazil is the economic one, under the specter of Trump's taxes.

**Ukrainian Celebrities Remember the Start of the War**
Today, February 24, marks the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian celebrities have shared their memories of the start of the war on social media. Singer Vitaly Kozlovsky posted a video from 24 hours before the war, saying, '24 hours before the start of the full-scale war. Lightness and carelessness. I don't remember what this is... But it's nice to remember.' Presenter Nadezhda Matveeva recalled how she started the war and what she did that morning three years ago. 'I took my dog for a walk on February 24, three years ago. Because it's my daily routine and I still can't explain to Sammy why 'so-called people' need to destroy other people, and the rest of the world, watching this, can't or won't stop it for geopolitical and economic reasons. But I was lucky - I'm still alive.' Frontwoman of the group The Hardkiss, Julia Sanina, wrote about the tragic events for Ukraine: 'Three years of full-scale war. Three years since we woke up differently, and it will never be like 'before' again.' Presenter Anatoly Anatolich remembered how he woke up from strong explosions and showed an archival video from February 24, 2022, in his Instagram. 'We spent the night in the basement. The children are very scared, we are in the Vyshgorod area, there are tanks coming from Belarus. I'll show you the bomb shelter, we took everything out, now the kids are hiding, we threw everything we could. They spent time here.' Presenter Ekaterina Osadchaya also remembered the start of the war and urged not to put life on pause, no matter what. 'The hours stopped three years ago, in the calendar it was 22, outside it was 25, as if a lot was done, but the feeling that nothing was done, there are 22 and then many days in 2022... But let's promise each other that we will live in 2025 and enjoy it as much as we can, as we know how to, and as it was once.' Singer Dmitry Monatik showed an archival video of the first concert in a bomb shelter after the start of the war and told about his experiences from the events in Ukraine in 2022. 'Eleven years of fighting for our independence. Three years of unbreakability. Three years since we realized that our hearts are made of steel. At first, it seemed that the constant pain would atrophy our feelings. But with each passing day, we only become more convinced: united, we can withstand. We can get through everything. Every morning, after the night attacks, we gather the children in school. And my heart tightens with the thought that they are growing up in a world where war has become a norm. Black date in the calendar. But I believe that ahead of us is light. And we will definitely see it.' Presenter Masha Yefrosinina also urged to believe in victory and continue to do everything that depends on us. 'The day that will forever be remembered with phantom pain. But today, like all 1067, we plan, dream, and breathe, believe, and move forward.'

**Ukrainian Celebrities Remember the Start of the War**
Today, February 24, marks the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian celebrities have shared their memories of the day the war began in 2022. Singer Vitaliy Kozlovsky posted a video from the day before the war, saying '24 hours before the start of the full-scale war. Lightness and carefreeness. I don't remember what it was like... But it's nice to remember.' Host Nadia Matviyeva recalled how she started her day three years ago, saying 'I took my dog for a walk at 24 February, three years ago. Because it's my daily routine and I still can't explain to Sammy why 'so-called people' feel the need to destroy other people, and the rest of the world, watching this, can't or won't stop it for geopolitical and economic reasons. But somehow, I was lucky - I'm still alive.' The lead singer of The Hardkiss, Julia Sanina, wrote 'Three years of full-scale war. Three years since we woke up differently, and it will never be like 'before' again.' Host Anatoliy Anatolich showed an archive video from February 24, 2022, saying 'We spent the night in the basement. The children are very scared, we're in the Vyhurivskyi district, there are tanks coming from Belarus. I'll show you the bomb shelter, we took everything out, now the kids are hiding here, we left them what we could. They spent the time here.' Host Kateryna Osadcha also remembered the start of the war and urged people not to put their lives on hold, saying 'The clock stopped three years ago, in the calendar it was 22, outside it was 25, like a lot was done, but the feeling that nothing was done is 22 and then many days in 2022... Let's promise each other that we'll live in 2025 and enjoy it as much as we can, as we know how and as it was.' Singer Dmytro Monatik showed an archive video of his first concert in a bomb shelter after the start of the war and shared his experiences from 2022, saying 'Eleven years of fighting for our independence. Three years of unbreakability. Three years since we realized that our hearts are made of steel. At first, it seemed that the constant pain would numb our feelings. But with each passing day, we only become more convinced: united, we can withstand anything. We will be able to get through everything. Every morning, after the night's shelling, we gather the children to take them to school. And my heart tightens with the thought that they are growing up in a world where war has become a normal part of life. A black date in the calendar. But I believe that there will be light ahead. And we will definitely see it.' Host Masha Yefrosinina also urged people to believe in victory and continue doing everything they can, saying 'The day that will be remembered forever with a phantom pain.

**Oleg Zhdanov Warns of Global Tragedy: 'We Are on the Brink of a Catastrophe'**
Military expert Oleg Zhdanov believes that the current events are reminiscent of 1938, before the start of World War II. He thinks that if the actions of the new US president are not stopped, a similar global tragedy will occur. Zhdanov cited a statement from a US congressman, Patrick Fitzpatrick, who warned that 'a decisive number of members of the US Congress are ready, willing, and able to prevent the reward of dictator Putin.' Fitzpatrick proposed that a peace agreement should be made in such a way that Russian invaders are held accountable, and they should face a trial similar to the Nuremberg trials for war criminals. Zhdanov warned that if this is not stopped, it will be like 1938, when Chamberlain said 'I brought you peace,' but 11 months later, Hitler invaded Poland, starting World War II. 'The same will happen here if this move is not stopped,' Zhdanov said.
