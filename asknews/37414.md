**Musk confident DOGE will save $1 trillion as government cost cutting continues**
Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has left his position as the public face of DOGE, a government cost-cutting initiative. During his tenure, DOGE saved an estimated $175 billion, which amounts to $1,086.96 per individual taxpayer. The cuts were made across the government, including the complete dismantling of USAID, where 83% of the agency's programs and 5,200 contracts were canceled. President Donald Trump discussed some of the other significant cuts, including '$20 million for Arab Sesame Street in the Middle East' and '$8 million for making mice transgenders.' Despite some outlets disputing DOGE's estimate, Musk is confident that the total cuts will amount to $1 trillion in the coming years. 'The DOGE influence will only grow stronger,' Musk said. 'I'm confident that over time, we'll see $1 trillion of savings, and a reduction in $1 trillion of waste, fraud reduction.'

**Elon Musk stands up another goalpost for DOGE on his way out, saying savings will come 'over time'**
Elon Musk, the world's richest man, made his fourth promise about the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) during an appearance with President Trump, stating that he is 'confident that over time we'll see $1 trillion of savings, a trillion dollars of waste and fraud reduction.' Musk's latest promise comes after previous estimates of $2 trillion, $1 trillion, and $150 billion in annual savings. Trump also praised Musk's team, saying that the DOGE cuts are 'going to be very much more substantial over time' and suggesting that Musk's team had found more waste that hadn't been revealed publicly yet. Musk promised to remain an advisor and friend to Trump, and said that the DOGE team will 'only grow stronger over time.' However, DOGE's own website claims to have found $175 billion in savings, but outside analyses have found this data to be plagued by errors, suggesting that actual savings may be far lower.

**Contributor: DOGE was a good start. Trump needs to push further for real fiscal change**
Elon Musk's 'DOGE' initiative, which aimed to reduce wasteful spending in the federal government, has come to an end. Musk's team identified $175 billion in total savings, but much of this work will shift to the White House Office of Management and Budget, headed by Russell Vought. The initiative uncovered outrageous spending outlays, such as $382 million in fraudulent unemployment benefits and $20 million to a 'Sesame Street'-inspired early childhood initiative in Iraq. Vought is the right man to continue the mission, but there are still two steps to be taken: enacting the DOGE cuts into law and reforming entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security. The latter is a longer-term problem that requires bipartisan effort, but it must be done to rein in America's soaring annual deficits and national debt.

**Elon Musk's 'DOGE' Agency Saves $160 Billion, Aims for $1 Trillion**
Elon Musk has praised the results of his 'DOGE' agency, which he claims has saved the US administration $160 billion and is on track to reach $200 billion in savings. However, according to an estimate by The Atlantic, the agency has only achieved $2 billion in savings. Despite this, President Donald Trump has expressed his support for Musk, saying 'Elon will be back, he's not really leaving, Doge is his baby.' Musk has attributed the agency's success to its ability to cut unnecessary expenses, such as software licenses that were not being used. He has stated that the agency will continue to grow and that he is confident that it will reach its goal of $1 trillion in savings.

**Musk's Worthy DOGE Spotlight and the Fiscal Path Forward**
Elon Musk's 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) has identified $175 billion in total savings, but its work is coming to an end as Musk departs. The DOGE team claims to have found wasteful spending, including $382 million in fraudulent unemployment benefits and $2 million for sex-change operations in Guatemala. Russell Vought, the head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, will continue the mission. However, the DOGE cuts were not included in the recent House bill, and Congress must now enact the cuts into law. Vought must transmit a fresh rescission package to Speaker Mike Johnson's desk. The longer-term problem is to put America's entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Social Security, on a long-term path to sustainability, which will be difficult due to the 'nasty, divisive and radioactive' politics involved.

**Less than half of DOGE-terminated contracts can be publicly tracked, only about a quarter of grants: watchdog**
A report by Open The Books found that it is difficult for taxpayers to track the savings associated with the contracts and grants terminated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). According to the report, only 42% of contracts and 27% of grants can be publicly tracked. DOGE claims to have provided $175 billion in estimated savings, but watchdog groups and budget experts have contested these estimates, citing issues such as double-counting and misrepresentation of contract values. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said that DOGE has produced 'historic savings' for the American people, while Open The Books CEO John Hart emphasized the need for Congress to turn DOGE's recommendations into durable savings and tackle the long-term debt and deficit crisis. Open The Books proposed two 'common sense' standards to help establish an 'intellectually honest' approach to understanding the true impact of government cuts.

**Trump's Doge Praise: Fact-Check Reveals Contradictions**
During a press conference, Donald Trump praised Elon Musk and his Doge initiative, but not all of his statements were true. Here are the fact-checks for the most important claims about the Doge. BBC Verify investigated the amount of money saved by the Doge and compared it to Musk's promises. Musk promised to save 'at least two billion dollars' in government spending last year, but later reduced this goal to 150 billion dollars by the end of the next fiscal year in 2026. The Doge claims to have saved 175 billion dollars, but only 73.3 billion dollars is supported by individual entries, and only 44.1 billion dollars is supported by evidence. The Doge says it is working to upload all evidence in a 'clear and transparent way.' An analysis by 'The Atlantic' that ignores the Doge's claims and uses data from the Ministry of Finance on monthly expenses comes up with even lower savings: 16.5 billion dollars. Trump made this claim during his speech to Congress in March, but it is unclear where he got the number from. Several sources suggest that he was referring to studies on 'transgenic' mice, i.e. lab mice that have been genetically modified to better mimic human disease reactions. The White House released a statement after Trump's initial comments in March, citing studies on the effects of hormone therapy, but none of the listed studies focused specifically on 'making mice transgender.' 20 Minuten fact-checked this claim back in March. Musk claimed in February that his team had discovered that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) had sent 59 million dollars to 'luxury hotels' in New York City to house illegal migrants. He provided no evidence for this claim. Several sources have reported that the money was allocated by Congress and given to the city, not directly to the hotels, last year. Musk's claim likely referred to payments from the Shelter and Services Program, which provides funds to cities, towns, or organizations for immigration-related expenses, according to Associated Press. A spokesperson for the New York City government told the news agency that only a part of the 59 million dollars was used for hotel costs and that the city never paid luxury prices.

**White House: We'll Send Some DOGE Cuts to Congress Next Week, Enacting All Will Take 'Several Months'**
OMB Director Russ Vought announced that the White House will send a rescission package with some DOGE cuts to Congress next week. Enacting all the DOGE savings will take 'several months' and cannot be done in the reconciliation bill under Senate rules and law. The package will include foreign aid, USAID cuts, and waste reduction, and will not be subject to the filibuster. Vought stated that the goal is to make the DOGE cuts permanent through rescissions or impoundment, and that the executive branch has tools at its disposal to achieve this. He added that enacting all the DOGE savings will be a 'process over the next several months' and will not be included in a single bill. According to Vought, the total DOGE amount is $175 billion, and the White House has already sent up $160 billion in cuts to nondefense spending for fiscal year '26.

**DOGE Says More Than 25,000 Federal Contracts and Grants Canceled so Far**
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) task force has helped save around $175 billion and assisted in the termination of more than 25,000 federal contracts and grants, according to an update on Saturday. This translates to approximately $1,056 per U.S. taxpayer. The most savings have been achieved at the Department of Health and Human Services, the General Services Administration, the Education Department, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Department of Labor. Elon Musk, who was effectively in charge of the group, has since returned to work full-time on his business empire amid slumping sales at his electric car company Tesla. Musk wrote on social media that he is currently working full-time at his companies, including Tesla and X, and that it's up to Congress and federal agencies to act on whether they want to keep up with DOGE's savings goals. DOGE has faced some setbacks in a handful of court cases, including one that sought to limit its access to Social Security Administration records.

**'Zombie-Verträge': Musk's Doge-Behörde overstates savings claims**
Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge-Behörde) has been touting significant savings for the US government, claiming to have saved $170 billion (approximately €153 billion) so far. However, according to a report by the New York Times, many of the contracts renegotiated by Doge did not exist in the first place, and others were simply rebranded. Musk's goal is to reach $2 trillion (trillion) in savings by July 4, 2026, but so far, only 8.5% of that goal has been achieved, according to the 'Doge Tracker'. As Musk is known for his marketing prowess, it remains to be seen how accurate these claims are.

**DOGE claims cuts have saved whopping $115B, or around $700 per taxpayer**
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claims that its efforts to cut waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government have resulted in $115 billion in savings. According to DOGE, this translates to an average of $714.29 per taxpayer, based on 2022 figures. However, using the latest tax return year of 2023, the average saved per taxpayer would be $705.09. DOGE says the biggest savings have come from the General Services Administration (GSA), followed by the Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The agency has terminated over 5,350 contracts, worth around $20 billion, and nearly 7,500 grants, worth $17 billion. Additionally, nearly 800 leases have been canceled, resulting in $500 million in lease savings. DOGE was created by President Donald Trump and will operate until July 4, 2026. 'It is unclear exactly where the bulk of the GSA cuts emanate from,' the article notes. DOGE has faced criticism over its access to federal systems and its efforts to cancel federal contracts and make cuts at various agencies.

**DOGE's Claim of $55 Billion in Savings Criticized for Errors and Oversimplifications**
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), established in January 2025, aims to eliminate government waste. However, the data they released on their official website, claiming to have saved an estimated $55 billion (approximately 8.2 trillion yen), has been criticized for containing numerous errors and oversimplifications. The data includes incorrect accounting, assumptions, outdated information, and other mistakes. For example, some contracts were counted twice or thrice, while others were canceled but still listed as active. David Reed, a Michigan state environmental scientist, was surprised to find his project, which was already set to expire on December 31, 2024, listed as canceled by DOGE. Reed stated, 'This contract was not canceled by DOGE or anyone else. If they claim to have canceled it, they are lying.' The list also fails to account for already spent funds and does not consider the costs associated with staff layoffs and office closures. Furthermore, the rapid cancellation of projects may lead to lawsuits from contractors. An investigation by The New York Times found that DOGE had listed a single contract multiple times, including a $6.55 billion project from the USAID, which was incorrectly listed as a separate contract. Additionally, a contract for a technology support service was listed as $800 million, when in fact it was $80 million. The DOGE has updated their list, correcting some of the errors, but the total savings amount of $55 billion remains unchanged.

**Elon Musk Considers Distributing $5 Billion to Americans in Tax Refund Checks**
Elon Musk is considering distributing $5 billion to Americans in the form of a 'tax refund check' after the DOGE cryptocurrency reaches its end date in July 2026. This proposal was made by James Fishback, the CEO of investment firm Azoria, who has been advising DOGE from the outside. Musk responded to Fishback's plan on X, saying he would 'consult with the President' on the matter. Critics have labeled this proposal as 'too early' and have questioned the feasibility of the plan, given the government's current debt and potential tax cuts. According to The Daily Beast, DOGE has only managed to show a third of the $55 billion in savings it claims to have made, and these savings include the closure of agencies during the Biden administration.

**Fact Check: Yes, Musk said he'd ask Trump about $5K checks for US taxpayers funded by DOGE savings**
Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency, said he would ask U.S. President Donald Trump about a proposal to use DOGE savings to give a $5,000 refund to every taxpaying household in the country. The proposal, suggested by James Fishback, would use 20% of the department's $2 trillion savings target, approximately $400 billion, to fund the refund. Trump expressed interest in the proposal, saying his administration was deliberating it. However, some experts have expressed skepticism about the claim that DOGE could cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, and Musk himself has cast doubt on the figure. Fishback's plan suggested that the tax refund could be sent after the expiration of DOGE in July 2026. Musk said, 'Obviously, the President Is the Commander-In-Chief, so This Is Entirely up to Him,' and later said, 'Will Check with the President.'

**Trump Administration Considers $5,000 Bonus for US Citizens under 'DOGE Dividend' Plan**
The administration of Donald Trump is considering a plan to give a $5,000 bonus to US citizens under the name 'DOGE Dividend'. The plan, proposed by James Fishback, CEO of Azoria investment firm, aims to distribute 20% of the savings generated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to citizens. According to preliminary calculations, each household could receive up to $5,000, benefiting 79 million households that pay federal taxes. However, experts, such as Jessica Riedl from the Manhattan Institute, are skeptical about the idea that DOGE can generate $2 trillion in savings. Trump exclaimed, 'The numbers are incredible, Elon, millions, billions, hundreds of billions', referring to Elon Musk. The administration hopes that this payment will restore public trust between taxpayers and the government, with the payment expected to reach citizens in July 2026, when DOGE has completed its cost-cutting efforts.

Trump said, 'There's even under consideration a new concept, where we give 20 per cent of the Doge savings to American citizens and 20 per cent goes to paying down debt.' Elon Musk's cost-cutting effort has so far saved US taxpayers $8.5 billion, but some experts question the motives behind the effort, saying it may be driven more by ideology than a genuine attempt to save taxpayer dollars.
