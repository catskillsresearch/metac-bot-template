**US filings for jobless aid inches down modestly as uncertainty lingers**
The number of Americans filing unemployment claims last week fell by 2,000 to 227,000, according to the Labour Department. This is close to the 230,000 new applications analysts forecast. Despite concerns about a global economic slowdown, the US labour market remains robust, with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs. However, many economists anticipate that a negative impact from trade wars will materialise this year for American workers. The US and China have agreed to a 90-day pause in their trade war, but concerns remain about the impact of tariffs on the US economy. Fed chair Jerome Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment, and the government recently reported that the US economy shrank at a 0.3 per cent annual pace in the first quarter of 2025. Microsoft has begun laying off about 6,000 workers, nearly 3 per cent of its workforce, and other companies such as Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, and Facebook parent company Meta have also announced job cuts this year.

**US filings for jobless aid, a proxy for layoffs, inch down modestly last week as uncertainty lingers**
The number of Americans filing unemployment claims last week fell by 2,000 to 227,000, according to the Labor Department. This is close to the 230,000 new applications analysts forecast. Despite growing economic uncertainty over U.S. trade policy, businesses continue to retain employees. Fed chair Jerome Powell noted that the potential for both higher unemployment and inflation are elevated, complicating the central bank's dual mandate. Powell stated that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment, and the U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace in the first quarter of 2025. However, the labor market remains robust, with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs. The unemployment rate held at a historically healthy 4.2% in April, with U.S. employers adding a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs. 'The potential for both higher unemployment and inflation are elevated,' said Powell. 'Tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment, and the government recently reported that the U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace in the first quarter of 2025.'

**US weekly jobless claims fall as labor market remains stable**
The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits dropped to 227,000 for the week ended May 17, according to the Labor Department. Economists expect claims to rise in the coming weeks, driven by seasonal fluctuations, but this would not suggest a material shift in labor market conditions. Employers have been reluctant to lay off workers due to economic uncertainty, but economists predict layoffs will pick up in the second half of 2025. The economy added 177,000 jobs in April, and economists expect job growth to slow below 100,000 per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Continuing claims increased to 1.903 million, and the median duration of unemployment jumped to 10.4 weeks in April.

**Global workforce reality check - Why so many workers are still struggling despite record employment levels**
Despite reaching record-high global employment in 2024, millions of workers are still struggling to keep up with rising living costs. According to ADP's Global Workforce View 2024, more than half of workers worldwide report living paycheck to paycheck, with 57% of workers saying they struggle to pay their bills. Even among full-time employees, 54% are living paycheck to paycheck. Many people are turning to side jobs and gig work, with 23% of surveyed workers reporting holding two or more jobs. However, even with multiple sources of income, the pressure doesn't always ease, with 59% of workers with two jobs and 61% of workers with three or more jobs still living paycheck to paycheck. The reasons for holding multiple jobs go beyond financial survival, with younger workers taking on additional jobs to build experience and fund education or skills training. The gig economy is a double-edged sword, offering flexibility but limited protections, unstable income, and a lack of benefits. Employers and policymakers must understand that employment alone no longer guarantees economic stability and evolve strategies to retain and support talent, especially younger and lower-wage workers.

**Around 27% of total MGNREGS workers still ineligible for ABPS, says report**
A report by Libtech India found that around 27.5% of all workers and 1.5% of active workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) are still ineligible for the Aadhaar Payment Bridge System (ABPS), which was made mandatory in January 2024. The report also expressed concern over the budget for the scheme, citing budget cuts and wage payment delays as significant factors in the overall employment drop. The Rural Development Ministry has stated that ABPS ineligibility will not lead to loss of work, but field insights from 200 cases across 10 states inform that workers ineligible for ABPS are not provided work by frontline officials, fearing non-payment of wages. According to the report, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Jharkhand have the highest number of all workers ineligible for ABPS, while West Bengal, Bihar, and Punjab have the highest 'active' workers being ineligible. The report also noted that despite an 8.6% rise in registered households under MGNREGA in 2024-25, employment indicators point to a concerning decline, with person-days generated dropping by 7.1% and average days of employment per household falling by 4.3%.

**Labor market could face a ‘white-collar recession,’ report finds**
A recent report by Employ has found that the labor market is evolving due to changing demands, with certain segments experiencing a surplus of applications while others are struggling to find talent. According to Stephanie Manzelli, chief human resources officer at Employ, 'This is no longer a one-size-fits-all labor market.' The report found that job postings for desk-based workers have declined year over year, creating a bottleneck of qualified talent competing for a shrinking number of roles. A survey of 1,500 U.S. adults found that 82% of respondents foresee a 'white-collar recession' and 66% feel burnt out by a stagnant market. Employ recommends that desk-based employers streamline hiring processes, prioritize skills-based hiring, and ensure accurate job descriptions to reach the right candidates, while front-line employers can invest in recruitment marketing, on-the-job training, and broader talent pipelines.

**From Unorganized to Optimized: The Future of Blue-Collar Work in India**
India is undergoing a significant transformation in its employment landscape, with blue-collar work shifting towards greater structure and optimization. According to McKinsey & Company, by 2030, nearly 70% of the projected 90 million new jobs in India will be blue-collar positions. However, many of these jobs still operate within the unorganized sector, where workers face job insecurity, lack of benefits, and minimal growth opportunities. To sustain the country's economic momentum, India must transition these jobs from informal structures to well-organized, technology-driven employment models. The integration of technology, skill development initiatives, and government interventions are driving this transformation, with platforms connecting workers to employers, providing digital payment solutions, and offering training programs helping to formalize employment structures in these sectors. The formalization of the laundry services sector has far-reaching employment benefits, creating structured job opportunities and improving job security and career growth. Government initiatives such as the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan (PMSYM) scheme and the Code on Social Security, 2020 are also playing a crucial role in providing financial and social security to workers in these sectors. The private sector is also investing in workforce upskilling programs, employee benefits, and technology-driven job-matching platforms, ultimately benefiting their bottom line.

**Majority of U.S. workers report stress linked to job insecurity**
A majority of U.S. workers (54%) reported that job insecurity has had a significant impact on their stress levels at work, according to the American Psychological Association's 2025 Work in America survey. The survey found that two-thirds of employed adults (65%) said their company or organization has been affected by recent government policy changes. Arthur C. Evans Jr., PhD, APA's chief executive officer, stated, 'When people feel their jobs are at risk, it creates a sense of uncertainty that can affect every aspect of their lives. This cultural moment is threatening workers' sense of stability, control and ability to meet their basic needs.' The survey also found that workers who experienced significant impacts from government policy changes were more likely to report experiencing negative outcomes at work, including a lack of interest, motivation or energy, emotional exhaustion, and difficulty focusing. Additionally, 51% of workers said it would take them a significant amount of time to find a new job if they lost theirs, and 44% said they would need to move to a different field or industry to find a new job. Economic uncertainty appeared to have played a major role in workers' concerns about job security, with 44% of employed adults saying they were concerned that an economic slump, downturn or recession could lead to being laid off, furloughed or having their job eliminated within the year.

However, sectors catering to premium customers, such as accounting and taxation, saw a 30 percent increase in hiring, while real estate and media and entertainment also experienced growth.

**Labor market remains on firm ground despite economic volatility**
The US labor market is expected to show solid but muted job gains in March, with forecasters predicting 120,000 jobs added. However, economists warn that sweeping tariffs and federal government cuts could pose a threat to the overall economy. 'The job market is sluggish but healthy,' said Daniel Zhao, lead economist at Glassdoor. 'At the same time, we are now entering a period where there are some more substantial risks.' The tariffs, which include a 10 percent tax on most imported goods, are expected to raise prices for US consumers, hurt businesses, and curb job creation. Meanwhile, a spike in federal government layoffs in February led to the highest number of layoffs since the pandemic, but many federal workers are now in limbo as the Trump administration prepares for agencies to cut up to 50 percent of their employees. Despite these challenges, the unemployment rate remains near historically low levels, and the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits has fallen. However, finding a new job has become increasingly challenging, especially in white-collar sectors and for recent college graduates. 'People have a recent example of a much better labor market,' said Zhao, referring to the period between 2021 and 2023 when job creation boomed in response to heightened consumer demand coming out of the pandemic. 'There is some understandable bitterness in seeing how quickly the pendulum has shifted from workers back toward employers.'

**Job Market for White-Collar Workers Experiences Significant Decline**
The job market for 'white-collar' workers, including university graduates and those with high-paying jobs, is experiencing a significant decline. According to the New York Times, the unemployment rate for this group has surpassed 4% for the first time in over two years. Economists attribute this decline to the impact of the pandemic on the economy and the increasing use of artificial intelligence in the workforce. Many companies have laid off workers in recent years, citing the need to reduce costs and increase efficiency. The trend is particularly evident in the tech industry, where the unemployment rate has increased by over 50% between 2022 and 2024. Some economists believe that this decline is a permanent shift in the job market, while others argue that it is a temporary phenomenon. 'We're seeing a very tangible shift in the way work is being done in the 'white-collar' world,' said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. 'The industry that has seen the most change is the video game industry, which has experienced a surge in 2020 with Americans looking for new forms of home entertainment.' However, the industry has since laid off thousands of workers, and the number of jobs in the field has decreased significantly. 'Standard layoffs' have become a norm in the industry, with many companies cutting costs and reducing their workforce. Some workers have even formed a union to negotiate better working conditions and higher wages. 'I think it would have been great for them to get rid of two birds with one stone,' said Heather Rolfe, a former employee who was laid off. 'We were a target because we were trying to form a union.' The trend is not limited to the tech industry, with many other companies laying off workers in recent years. 'We're seeing a decline in the demand for white-collar workers, particularly in areas such as data entry and bookkeeping,' said Ed Davis, a former employee. 'These jobs are being automated, and it's making it harder for people to find work.' Some economists believe that the decline in the job market for white-collar workers is a permanent shift, while others argue that it is a temporary phenomenon. 'I think it's a big deal,' said Professor Katz from Harvard University. 'A larger proportion of workers with a college education rely on the federal government for their jobs, either directly or through funding for non-profit organizations.' He added, 'It looks like a big contraction in government spending on science, research, and education - it's likely to have a big impact.' 'It doesn't look like the overall unemployment rate for college graduates is high, but it may be in the next six months,' he said.

**Has the decline of knowledge work begun?**
The unemployment rate for white-collar workers, particularly those with college degrees, has been rising over the past few years. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the unemployment rate for college grads has risen 30% since September 2022, while the overall unemployment rate has increased by about 18%. An analysis by Julia Pollak shows that unemployment has been most elevated among those with bachelor's degrees or some college but no degree. Some economists, such as Carl Tannenbaum, believe that a permanent decline for knowledge work has begun, citing the impact of artificial intelligence and the targeting of federal agencies by President Donald Trump. Others, like Lawrence Katz, argue that the trends may be short-term and little cause for concern. However, there are signs that the returns on a college degree may have shifted over a longer period, with the gap in wages between those with a college degree and those without one flattening in recent years. Additionally, the use of AI could reduce the need for college graduates in certain jobs, such as software development, and lead to a decrease in the wage premium enjoyed by more experienced coders. 'We're seeing a meaningful transition in the way work is done in the white-collar world,' said Tannenbaum. 'I tell people a wave is coming.'

**Labor market expected to remain solid in February, as fears of a downturn mount**
The U.S. labor market is expected to show solid job gains in February, with forecasters predicting about 170,000 jobs added, according to the Labor Department's monthly jobs report. However, concerns are mounting that tariffs, federal government cuts, and other economic forces could soon deliver a hit to the overall economy. Economists, such as Sarah House from Wells Fargo, are warning of slower growth ahead, citing a deteriorating outlook and a challenging environment for job seekers. Guy Berger from the Burning Glass Institute notes that the policy mix is becoming more constrictive on the labor market, with many levers being pulled at once. The Labor Department has not released federal layoff data since January, but there are signs that layoffs have picked up, with 172,017 jobs cut in February, a 245 percent increase from the month before. Job seekers, such as Naomi Harding, are finding it challenging to find employment, especially in white-collar and remote settings. 'It kind of sucks to find a job right now,' said Harding, who has applied for hundreds of remote jobs but has yet to land one. 'I've applied for everything.'

**The Future of Work: From 'White-Collar' to 'Gold-Collar' Workers**
According to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs 2025 report, 170 million new jobs will be created in the job market by 2030, while 92 million jobs will be lost. Technology, particularly artificial intelligence and data processing systems, is the main driving force behind this transformation. By 2025-2030, approximately 460 million workers, or 39% of the workforce, will need to update or transform their skills. A new work model is expected to emerge, changing the way businesses operate. The concept of 'white-collar' workers will give way to 'gold-collar' workers, who will be characterized by their deep understanding of their work rather than just their knowledge. Experts say that companies will succeed by giving their employees more freedom, rather than controlling them. The traditional concept of white-collar workers will be replaced by gold-collar workers who are aware of their own limitations, creative, and courageous. In the future, companies will focus on 'placing the right person in the right job' rather than relying on large teams. Today's white-collar workers will become tomorrow's gold-collar workers, transforming the economy and becoming a powerful force that cannot be hired with just a salary. In the future, individuals will be able to work for multiple companies at the same time, with some days spent working for one company and others spent working for another. They will also have days off to spend in nature, without working.

**US Unemployment Rate Drops to 4.0% in January, Job Openings Decrease**
The US unemployment rate dropped to 4.0% in January, with 143,000 new jobs created. However, employers are posting fewer job openings, with monthly job postings falling from a record 12.2 million in March 2022 to 7.6 million in December. According to the Department of Labor, workers are losing confidence in their ability to find better pay or working conditions by switching jobs, with the number of people quitting their jobs decreasing from a record 4.5 million in April 2022 to 3.2 million in December, below pre-pandemic levels.

**Fewer Americans quitting their jobs—here’s why**
According to new data from the Labor Department, the number of Americans quitting their jobs has decreased significantly. In 2024, 39.6 million workers quit, down 11% from 2023 and 22% from 2022. The decline in job openings, with a current ratio of 1:1, and slower hiring, with 66 million new hires in 2024, down from 71 million in 2023, are major factors contributing to this trend. Experts, such as Michael Distefano, CEO of Korn Ferry's professional-search business, point to a hiring slump in white-collar jobs, describing it as a 'steady malaise.' Economists expect the labor market to continue cooling, but with a warning that it may not last forever, as Guy Berger, an economist at the Burning Glass Institute, noted, 'This labor market has shown that it can keep cooling for a long time without things breaking. Forever? Probably not.'

**US Job Openings Plunge in December Signaling Further Cooling of Labor Market**
Job openings in the US declined sharply in December 2024, falling short of market expectations. The number of employment opportunities dropped by 1.3 million in 2024. The December decline was concentrated in professional and business services, health care and social assistance, and finance and insurance. The quits rate remained flat at 2 percent, while the number of hires was flat at 5.5 million. Layoffs were muted in December, sitting at 1.8 million. Economists, such as Bill Adams and Dawn Fay, expect companies to boost their hiring efforts in 2025, but warn that it may be harder for out-of-work individuals to find work. The Federal Reserve has shifted its focus from maximum employment to price stability, and has signaled upside inflation risks. 'The labor market does seem to be pretty stable and broadly in balance,' said Powell. The Federal Reserve projects the median unemployment rate in 2025, 2026, and 2027 to be 4.3 percent.

**Apec Study Confirms Slowdown in White-Collar Hiring for Q1 2025**
According to a new study by the Apec, only 48% of large and medium-sized companies plan to hire at least one white-collar worker by the end of March 2025, down from 54% in the same period last year. The decline is even more pronounced for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with only 14% planning to hire at least one white-collar worker by the end of February 2025, compared to 18% in 2024. This trend is attributed to the uncertain economic climate, with concerns over the global economy, trade policies, and the upcoming 2025 budget in France. The study also found that the proportion of companies that can anticipate their activity level has decreased by four points in just three months, from 63% to 59%. Additionally, the proportion of managers who think it will be difficult to find a similar job if they were to change companies is declining, and salaries are also being adjusted accordingly, with only 40% of recruiting companies increasing salaries at least once last year, compared to 56% in 2023.
