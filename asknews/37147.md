**US Air Force and DOGE Partner to Save American Taxpayers Almost $5 Billion**
The US Air Force has partnered with DOGE to reduce a wasteful program serviced by external consultants, resulting in significant cost savings. The Air Force Strategic Transformation Support I (AFSTS I) contract, initially valued at $2.75 billion, has been reduced to $1.918 billion, with $832 million in unobligated savings and an additional $175 million in descoped work. As a result, the total savings of this initiative exceed $1 billion. The Air Force has also rescinded the solicitation for AFSTS II, which had a ceiling value of $3.8 billion. According to DOGE's estimate, the savings amount to $1,055.90 per taxpayer, calculated using an estimate of 161 million individual federal taxpayers.

**SEC chair says DOGE found $90M in cost savings, but public receipts don't add up**
SEC Chairman Paul Atkins claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has found $90 million in cost savings at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but a review of publicly available data found the actual savings to be tens of millions of dollars less, at $18.9 million. Atkins stated that DOGE has 'already been inside' the agency, identifying overlapping contracts and inefficiencies, particularly in technology investments. However, the data on DOGE's website only lists contract cancellations and savings up to May 9, with the highest-value cancellation being a $4 million contract with KUSI Global. Atkins said that the SEC has 'rationalized' its contracting, but the discrepancy between his figure and the published data remains. DOGE has been criticized for its lack of transparency and is currently fighting a court ruling that would subject it to Freedom of Information Act requests.

**Is DOGE Saving Taxpayers Money or Costing Them More?**
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), launched by President Donald Trump and initially led by Elon Musk, aimed to save taxpayers $2 trillion. However, the estimated savings have been reduced to $150 billion, while reports suggest that DOGE's actions could cost taxpayers approximately $135 billion due to workforce layoffs, rehiring expenses, lost productivity, and paid leave. Additionally, defending lawsuits and lost tax revenue from IRS staff cuts may add to the costs. A survey found that 64% of respondents were concerned about the loss of experienced government personnel and 55% think the federal government is functioning worse now than a year ago. Furthermore, some DOGE staff members are being paid relatively high salaries, with Jeremy Lewin making $167,000, Kyle Schutt making $195,000, and Nate Cavanaugh making $120,500 per year, which is higher than the average GSA employee's salary of $128,565.

**Are US taxpayers getting a 'DOGE dividend' check? Here's what we know about the idea floated by Trump and Musk**
James Fishback, founder and CEO of Azoria, proposed the idea of a 'DOGE dividend' on social media, suggesting that 20% of the money saved by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) be sent back to American taxpayers as a tax refund check. Elon Musk shared the idea with President Donald Trump, who promoted it onstage at a summit. However, Fishback's proposal assumed $2 trillion in cuts, which now seems unlikely. If DOGE achieves $2 trillion in cuts, 20% could be divided among 79 million taxpaying households, working out to $5,000 per household. However, only households above a certain income threshold would qualify, potentially excluding lower-income Americans. Fishback notes that this makes the DOGE dividend different from the stimulus checks sent out during the COVID-19 pandemic, which were sent out 'indiscriminately'.

**What did DOGE do this week? No new DoD cuts**
Bank of America reported that there were no new Department of Defense (DoD) contract cancellations this week, as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) held steady in its review of federal spending. The 'Wall of Receipts' showed a slight uptick in total claimed savings, rising from $31.7 billion to $31.9 billion. The US Agency for International Development remains the most targeted agency, with the Department of Health and Human Services seeing the largest weekly increase in savings. Meanwhile, Booz Allen Hamilton received a $210 million task order for Nimbus systems engineering services from the Air Force Research Lab, with $35.4 million of obligations provided under the task order in FY25. This brings Booz Allen Hamilton's new obligations to $107.1 million since January 20, compared to an estimated annualized obligation impact of ~$135 million from DOGE cuts to date.

**Musk gets into tense exchange with anchor on DOGE**
Elon Musk got into a tense exchange with CNBC anchor David Faber on Tuesday, discussing his leadership of President Trump's cost-cutting initiatives, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk defended DOGE's efforts, stating 'We are advisers. We are not -- we're not kings here.' Faber questioned the effectiveness of DOGE's efforts, citing a $160 billion spending cut as 'not really making the dent I think you may have thought you may have been able to achieve.' Musk maintained that DOGE has cut nearly $160 billion in spending, but Faber noted that Musk's own artificial intelligence chatbot, Grok, estimated the savings to be between $5 billion and $32 billion. Musk explained that DOGE is trying to tackle every part of the budget, but Faber suggested that more significant changes would require an act of Congress.

**There may not be a DOGE check, but these states will send stimulus payments in 2025**
Although there are no more federal stimulus checks scheduled, some states plan to send or have already sent stimulus payments to their residents in 2025 to mitigate the impact of rising costs and inflation. California is sending checks of up to $725 to eligible households, while Colorado is offering payments of up to $800 for single taxpayers and up to $1,600 for married couples filing jointly. These payments are part of the states' efforts to provide financial relief and boost the local economy. According to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC), between 2020 and 2021, three rounds of economic impact payments were made, totaling more than 476 million payments, equivalent to $814 billion in financial assistance, to households affected by the pandemic.

**Farm & Food File: On balance, I repeat myself**
The federal government's checkbook shows a $1.8 trillion shortfall in fiscal year 2024, covered by buyers of U.S. Treasury securities. The GOP-led Congress and White House aim to erase this debt by cutting 'waste, fraud and abuse' and reducing federal spending. However, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has found only a small percentage of wasteful spending, estimated to be around 0.0074% or 0.022% of all federal spending. This is not enough to cover the annual debt approaching $2 trillion. Several GOP congressional members have budget-slashing ideas, but few target the biggest federal programs, which account for at least 70% of current federal spending. The proposed $4 trillion tax cut and exemptions from federal income taxes will add an estimated $9.1 trillion to the federal deficit in the coming decade. As a result, the federal budget is unlikely to be balanced, with tax revenue covering only 74% of all federal spending in 2024.

**'Zombie-Verträge': Musk's Doge-Behörde overstates savings claims**
Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge-Behörde) has been touting significant savings for the US government, claiming to have saved $170 billion (approximately €153 billion) so far. However, according to a report by the New York Times, many of the contracts renegotiated by Doge did not exist in the first place, and others were simply rebranded. Musk's goal is to reach $2 trillion (trillion) in savings by July 4, 2026, but so far, only 8.5% of that goal has been achieved, according to the 'Doge Tracker'. As Musk is known for his marketing prowess, it remains to be seen how accurate these claims are.

**DOGE Says It Has Saved over $1,000 Per Taxpayer**
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claims to have saved over $1,000 per taxpayer, with a total estimated savings of $165 billion. This is attributed to various cost-saving measures, including asset sales, contract cancellations, fraud deletion, grant cancellations, interest savings, programmatic changes, regulatory savings, and workforce reductions. The breakdown of savings per taxpayer is calculated at $1,024.84, based on approximately 161 million individual federal taxpayers in the U.S. DOGE's 'Wall of Receipts' lists 9,497 terminated contracts totaling $32 billion in savings, with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) leading the agency leaderboard in terms of generating savings. Despite being on the poorer side of the leaderboard, the Department of Transportation is still generating savings, with DOGE praising its leader, Secretary Sean Duffy, for cancelling seven 'wasteful grants' with a savings of $51M.

**DOGE claims cuts have saved whopping $115B, or around $700 per taxpayer**
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claims that its efforts to cut waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government have resulted in $115 billion in savings. According to DOGE, this translates to an average of $714.29 per taxpayer, based on 2022 figures. However, using the latest tax return year of 2023, the average saved per taxpayer would be $705.09. DOGE says the biggest savings have come from the General Services Administration (GSA), followed by the Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The agency has terminated over 5,350 contracts, worth around $20 billion, and nearly 7,500 grants, worth $17 billion. Additionally, nearly 800 leases have been canceled, resulting in $500 million in lease savings. DOGE was created by President Donald Trump and will operate until July 4, 2026. 'It is unclear exactly where the bulk of the GSA cuts emanate from,' the article notes. DOGE has faced criticism over its access to federal systems and its efforts to cancel federal contracts and make cuts at various agencies.

**Trump considers giving Doge savings to Americans**
Donald Trump's administration is considering returning 20% of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) savings to Americans, which could amount to $400 billion. The proposal, originally suggested by James Fishback, would send a $5,000 check to all tax-paying households after Doge's scheduled end in July 2026. Trump said, 'There's even under consideration a new concept, where we give 20 per cent of the Doge savings to American citizens and 20 per cent goes to paying down debt.' Elon Musk's cost-cutting effort has so far saved US taxpayers $8.5 billion, but some experts question the motives behind the effort, saying it may be driven more by ideology than a genuine attempt to save taxpayer dollars.

**Trump Considers Returning 20% of DOGE Savings to American People**
US President Trump announced on Wednesday that he is considering a plan to return 20% of the government's efficiency department (DOGE) savings to the American people, while using a portion of the money to pay off debt. Trump praised the efforts of Musk and the government efficiency department to eliminate 'government waste, fraud, and abuse.' 'We're even considering a new concept, where we return 20% of the DOGE savings to American citizens, and 20% to pay off debt. Because these numbers are unbelievable,' Trump said. Trump stated that by identifying government waste and abuse, DOGE is saving a large amount of money for taxpayers every day. 'We're considering returning 20% to American citizens, and 20% to pay off debt,' Trump reiterated. Musk expressed his intention to 'verify' the idea of returning money to the American people on X platform on Tuesday. He was responding to a post by investment company Azoria CEO James Fishback, who proposed the 'DOGE dividend' concept. In his post, Fishback suggested using DOGE savings to reduce expenses and sending 'tax refund checks' to every taxpayer. A source familiar with the conversation told Reuters on Wednesday that Fishback is currently in contact with the Trump administration regarding his proposal. Fishback's memo suggests returning 20% of the DOGE savings, or $4 trillion, in the form of $5,000 checks to all taxpayer families in July 2026. This calculation is based on DOGE achieving $20 trillion in cost savings, which Musk described as the 'best outcome,' but his goal is $10 trillion. According to DOGE Live Tracker data, approximately $5.5 billion has been saved so far. However, it is unclear where these savings are coming from. ABC News reported that DOGE published a list of canceled federal contracts on its website, but these contracts only saved around $860 million. Meanwhile, economists warn that large-scale stimulus checks may exacerbate inflation.

**What is DOGE Clock? Understanding the real-time tracker for government spending cuts**
The DOGE Clock is a digital tracker that claims to monitor taxpayer savings under the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative led by Elon Musk. According to its official website, the tracker estimates and displays the amount of taxpayer money saved through policy changes introduced by DOGE. The tracker displays over $32 billion in savings, but it is not officially linked to the Donald Trump administration or the department itself. The DOGE Clock is part of the Department of Government Efficiency Community Meme Project, a community-driven initiative aimed at raising awareness about federal spending and regulation. The project's website clarifies that all data displayed on the tracker is 'not official' and describes it as a 'meme project designed for educational and entertainment purposes.'

**What is DOGE clock? All about new tool that tracks taxpayer savings in real time**
The DOGE Clock is a tool that tracks taxpayer savings in real-time, measuring the amount of dollars saved after new changes made by the Department of Government Efficiency come into effect. The clock also tracks key metrics such as the total number of initiatives proposed by DOGE and the overall savings achieved. According to the DOGE Clock website, the data is 'not official' and is part of a 'community-driven meme project designed to raise awareness of government spending and over-regulation.' The project is not directly affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency, but aligns with broader efforts to monitor and track government spending. As reported by Newsweek, the DOGE Clock features a countdown displaying the number of days remaining until July 4, 2026, which may be linked to the organisation's ambitious $2 trillion savings goal.
