**USDA offers $100M for local food and specialty crops**
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced two major grant funding opportunities totaling nearly $100 million to support local, regional, and specialty crop markets across the United States. The Local Agriculture Market Program (LAMP) offers $26.5 million in grant funding to help local and regional food entities develop, coordinate, and expand producer-to-consumer marketing, local and regional food markets, and local food enterprises. The Specialty Crop Block Grant Program (SCBGP) provides $72.9 million to support projects that enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops, including fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, floriculture, and nursery crops. Applications for both programs must be submitted through www.grants.gov by June 27, 2025, and July 7, 2025, respectively. USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) will provide webinars and online guidance to guide new applicants and offer grants management assistance.

**'That's our mission': Local food pantry continues to pivot amid potential funding cuts**
Food pantries in Southwest Michigan, including Kalamazoo Loaves & Fishes, are concerned about potential funding cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other food assistance programs. The proposed cuts of over $200 billion could lead to increased demand for services, as families struggle to afford groceries and meals. Kalamazoo Loaves & Fishes, which already serves over 800 people daily, is bracing for the impact of these cuts, which would be felt immediately. Director Jillian Bryant stated, 'When we're talking about losing things like SNAP, that's also going to drive up the need on an already now-strained system; and so, that's always going to impact what we do here.' The pantry is already dealing with cuts from the USDA and the Local Food Purchase Assistance (LFPA) grant, which will end in September. Despite these challenges, Bryant assured the community that Loaves & Fishes will continue to serve them, stating, 'That's our mission. We've been around for 43 years, so we've definitely weathered the storm as we've gone through different changes before. We've seen administration changes and policy changes, and we're just going to pivot.'

**Nebraska to ban soda and energy drinks from SNAP under first USDA waiver**
Nebraska has become the first state to receive a federal waiver to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps low-income families pay for groceries. The move, announced by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, affects about 152,000 people in Nebraska enrolled in SNAP. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said, 'There's absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks.' The waiver takes effect on January 1, 2026. Six other states have also submitted requests for waivers banning certain foods and drinks or expanding access to hot foods for participants. Anti-hunger advocates criticized the waiver, saying it adds costs, boosts administrative burdens, and increases stigma for people facing food insecurity.

**Following Nebraska's soda ban, Idaho could be closer to restricting junk food purchases with SNAP benefits - Local News 8**
Following Nebraska's lead, Idaho is on track to restrict what can be purchased with SNAP benefits, commonly known as food stamps. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brook L. Rollins signed a waiver to prevent SNAP recipients in Nebraska from buying soda and energy drinks with their benefits, effective January 1, 2026. Idaho submitted a similar waiver on May 16, which aims to ban purchasing soft drinks and candy with food stamps. According to the USDA, approximately 20% of all SNAP spending goes towards sugary drinks and snacks. Idaho Governor Brad Little and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare submitted their waiver application last Friday, and with the federal government's apparent support, Idahoans could expect a decision from Secretary Rollins in the coming weeks. Secretary Rollins said, 'Today's waiver to remove soda and energy drinks from SNAP is the first of its kind, and it is a historic step to Make America Healthy Again.' Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen added, 'There's absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks.'

**New Dietary Guidelines Will Recommend Americans 'Eat Whole Food,' Says RFK Jr. | ZeroHedge**
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that the upcoming 2025-2030 dietary guidelines will recommend Americans to 'eat whole food' and 'eat the food that's good for you.' The guidelines, which will be simplified to four pages, aim to promote healthy eating habits and will influence nutrition standards for federal programs, including the school lunch program. Kennedy stated that the current guidelines were 'clearly written by industry' and that the new guidelines will focus on locally sourced foods. He also expressed concern about the impact of packaged foods on children's health, saying 'We're poisoning this generation.' The public comment period for the guidelines closed in February, and the USDA and HHS plan to release the final guidelines by the end of 2025.

**Brown bagging it? These 5 recipes will shake up your lunchtime routine**
A recent report from Traceone shows that the number of food recalls issued by the FDA and USDA has increased by 15% between 2020 and 2024. This could be due to advancements in technology for identifying harmful pathogens and challenges with staffing and sanitation at manufacturing plants. The FDA and USDA have many regulations that food manufacturers must comply with, and when a noncompliant product makes it to stores' shelves, restaurants, or Americans' homes, the manufacturer typically issues a recall. The FDA maintains a real-time list of active food recalls, and in March 2025 alone, the FDA issued recall notices on foods such as Tostitos chips and frozen meals by Lean Cuisine and Stouffer's. To help keep people aware of recent recalls, Stacker has compiled a list of all food and beverage recalls issued by the FDA each month. It's essential to check the FDA's site for details on which specific batches are affected, based on their Universal Product Code located on the packaging.

**U.S. House Republican plan would force states to pay for a portion of SNAP benefits • Tennessee Lookout**
The U.S. House Agriculture Committee's portion of the Republican tax and spending bill would shift a portion of the costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to states, potentially leading to major cuts in the program. The bill would transfer between 5% and 25% of the cost to states, depending on each state's payment error rate, starting in 2028. Ty Jones Cox, vice president for food assistance at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said that this could lead states to opt out entirely, leaving needy families unable to pay for groceries. Republicans claim that the bill would 'restore SNAP to its original intent—promoting work, not welfare—while saving taxpayer dollars and investing in American agriculture.' However, experts and Democrats predict that the change in cost structure would lead to major cuts in the program. 'The bill's massive cuts disguised as 'cost shifts' pass the buck to states – but ultimately would leave families holding an empty grocery bag when states aren’t willing or able to backfill for lost federal funds,' Cox said. The changes would force state budget officers to choose from among unattractive options, including cutting SNAP, offsetting costs with corresponding cuts to other programs, or raising revenues through taxes or other measures. 'None look good,' Cox said. Democrats slammed the proposal, with Sen. Peter Welch saying, 'This is not a waste, fraud and abuse deal. This is really about taking away basic nutritional security that is so absolutely essential to the well-being of our families and our kids in Vermont and in every single state across the nation.'

**Advocacy groups urge SNAP providers to protect user data from Trump administration | StateScoop**
Three advocacy groups have urged financial providers that support the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to reject recent data access demands from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. According to Elizabeth Laird, director of equity in civic technology at CDT, 'This is an effort to grab sensitive personal information that intentionally and wisely hasn’t been shared with the federal government.' Laird stated that sharing this information increases the risk of data breaches, which can lead to identity theft and scams. The groups believe that USDA's actions are 'likely illegal' and a threat to data privacy. 'States collected this data to administer a program that feeds tens of millions low-income families, and forcing them to turn it over for unknown purposes is an alarming data privacy threat,' Laird wrote. The Enhanced Cybersecurity for SNAP Act has been cited as a potential solution to this issue.

**SNAP Changes: What foods could be excluded in Arkansas?**
Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced a plan to exclude certain foods from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in an effort to improve the health of over 300,000 residents who participate in the program. The excluded foods would include soda, fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice, candy, and artificially sweetened candy. However, hot, ready-to-eat rotisserie chicken would be added to the list of eligible foods. Sanders stated, 'Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health. We're paying for it on the front end and the back end.' The plan would go into effect in July 2026 if granted by the USDA. This is not the only state to introduce such a plan, as Indiana Governor Mike Braun also announced similar changes on Tuesday.

**Two States Say 'No More' to Taxpayer-Funded Junk Food**
Governors Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas and Mike Braun of Indiana have asked the Donald Trump administration to allow them to remove junk food and beverages, such as soft drinks and candy, from the list of items that can be purchased with food stamps. This decision aims to improve the health of nearly 350,000 residents who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). According to Arkansas, the new policy would go into effect in July 2026 and would prevent people from using food stamps to buy items such as soda, candy, and artificially sweetened candy. Indiana's Gov. Mike Braun stated, 'More SNAP money is spent on sugary drinks and candy than on fruits and vegetables. That changes today.' The decision has been met with opposition from lobbyists, but it is expected that more states will follow suit.

Arkansas is the first state to petition the USDA to restrict the purchase of junk food using SNAP benefits. Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the goal is to improve the health of nearly 350,000 Arkansas residents who participate in the program. The proposed ban would exclude soda, candy, and prepared foods, but allow the purchase of hot rotisserie chicken. Critics argue that the program should be more restrictive, limiting recipients to healthy and inexpensive foods, and that the current system encourages the overconsumption of unhealthy foods. Arkansas officials hope to implement the ban in July 2026.

**Millions of grocery shoppers to lose beloved snacks in new junk food boycott**
Millions of Americans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) may soon face restrictions on purchasing junk food and sugary drinks with their benefits. Ten states are considering changing the rules to limit what SNAP recipients can buy, citing concerns about unhealthy selections and health issues. USDA Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins aims to encourage healthier food choices through purchase regulations, saying, 'When a taxpayer is putting money into SNAP, are they OK with us using their tax dollars to feed really bad food and sugary drinks to children who perhaps need something more nutritious?' However, implementing these restrictions requires changes to federal law or state waivers, which have faced historical USDA resistance and opposition from food industry lobbyists.

**Trump officials want to ban junk food from SNAP. Past efforts show it's not easy to do**
Trump administration officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, are pushing to ban junk food from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps. However, removing certain foods from SNAP is not as simple as it sounds, as the program is run by the USDA and is authorized by the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which allows SNAP benefits to be used for 'any food or food product intended for human consumption.' Excluding any foods would require Congress to change the law or for states to get waivers, which have been rejected in the past due to concerns about implementation, cost, and potential impact on recipients' food purchases. Anti-hunger advocates argue that limiting food choices undermines the autonomy and dignity of people who receive SNAP benefits, and that research shows SNAP recipients are no more likely than other low-income Americans to buy sugary drinks or snack foods.

**SNAP February 2025 Calendar: Know the Payment Dates and Amounts by State**
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) continues to be a vital tool for millions of low-income families in the United States. In February 2025, the program, managed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), will provide financial assistance to approximately 42 million people, ensuring access to basic food items. SNAP benefits are deposited onto Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards, which allow users to purchase essential food items, such as bread, meat, fruits, and vegetables. However, there are restrictions on their use, including the prohibition on buying supplements, pet food, alcohol, cigarettes, and non-food items. The SNAP payment schedule varies by state, with different dates for each state. According to the USDA, the program has been instrumental in improving the quality of life for beneficiaries and contributing to the local economy by supporting small and large food businesses. It is essential for beneficiaries to check their specific payment dates and verify their EBT card balance. Unused funds remain available until they are spent, but they are not accumulative indefinitely. In February 2025, SNAP reaffirms its role as a lifeline for millions of families, promoting well-being and food security across the country. As USDA Secretary said, 'SNAP is a vital tool for millions of low-income families in the United States.'
