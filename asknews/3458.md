**Alentejo 2030 Launches Call for Proposals to Support Évora 2027 Cultural Initiatives**
The Alentejo 2030 program has launched a call for proposals to support actions that value culture and heritage, programming, and artistic creation for the European Capital of Culture (CEC) Évora 2027, with a budget of 1.75 million euros. The call, which is open until July 31, is exclusively for the Évora 2027 Association, the entity managing the CEC. The program is funded 85% by the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) and has an indicative budget of 1.75 million euros. 'The Alentejo 2030 program assumes a strategic and symbolic commitment to the region's cultural future by launching the call for support to the Évora Capital Europeia da Cultura 2027 initiative,' said the program. This funding will support initiatives listed in the CEC Évora 2027's book of candidacy. The director of finance of the Évora 2027 Association, António Costa da Silva, explained that this call 'fits within the financing of the Portuguese state' to the entity managing the CEC. This is 'the most structural and important funding in terms of financial volume' from European funds and will support various cultural program initiatives of the CEC until 2027, he highlighted. The call 'does not aim at artists and sector agents,' Costa da Silva said, adding that the competition for this purpose will be opened by the Évora 2027 Association in the second half of this year. The CCDR of Alentejo emphasized that 'more than the funding,' this support represents 'the recognition of culture as a structuring pillar of regional identity and a motor of social, economic, and tourist transformation.' The call aims to 'support actions that contribute to affirming culture as a pillar of society, structuring the vision of the territory and its affirmation of identity in equipment that, by their unique character, by their capacity for differentiating programming, by their potential for creative dynamics, are national and international references of the region,' he added.

**Denmark to Raise Retirement Age to 70 by 2040: A Response to Aging Population**
Denmark plans to raise the retirement age to 70 years by 2040, with the current retirement age being 67 years. The retirement age will increase every five years, reaching 68 in 2030 and 69 in 2035. This move comes as protests continue over low pensions, with experts calling for changes to labor laws to address the issue. A proposed labor reform aims to increase flexibility in work arrangements, reduce state intervention in private agreements, and allow for more flexible salaries and work relationships. Meanwhile, a proposed pension reform aims to address issues such as the 'envejecimiento poblacional' (aging population), where people are living longer but having fewer children, leading to uncertainty over the future of pensioners. Experts suggest moving from a 'beneficio definido' (defined benefit) system to a 'contribución definida' (defined contribution) system. According to Jacqueline Maubré, 'El sistema de reparto está en crisis en la Argentina. La expectativa de vida ha crecido, pero tambien baja el ritmo de la natalidad.' (The pension system is in crisis in Argentina. Life expectancy has increased, but the birth rate has also decreased.)

**Álava's Aging Population: A Need for More Care Services**
The 'baby boom' generation in Álava is aging, and many are starting to rely on social services. According to the Fundación Eguía-Careaga report, the number of people over 65 will increase by 17.2% by 2030, and those over 80 will increase by 26.8%. The report suggests that the current number of care home places is 'sufficient', but there is a need to strengthen other types of services, such as home care. The report also calculates that there will be a need for 160 more places in day centers. Additionally, the report notes that there will be a need for 1,300 family members to care for their relatives who are unable to perform daily activities without support. The study does not attempt to predict the future of disability in 2030, but notes that the number of people with recognized disabilities in Álava has increased by 80% since the COVID-19 pandemic. As Gorka Urtaran, the deputy for Social Policies, has previously stated, there will be a need for 1,000 more professionals to care for dependent people in their homes by 2030. 'We need to adapt the system to these changes,' said Urtaran. 'The people want to stay at home and live their last years there, or until they have no other choice but to go to a residence.'

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Novartis bets on ageing as next frontier in drug development**
Novartis has partnered with BioAge Labs to develop new therapies for age-related diseases. The partnership, which could cost up to $550 million, aims to leverage BioAge's vast trove of data on human longevity to identify the determinants of a healthy lifespan. Novartis has set up a research group called Diseases of Ageing and Regenerative Medicine (DARe) to build on its expertise in musculoskeletal diseases and understand what causes age-related diseases at the molecular level. 'Our goal is to understand the biological drivers of ageing to develop novel treatments for diseases related to ageing,' said Michaela Kneissel, global head of DARe. The market for geriatric medicines is expected to surge from $153 billion in 2023 to $222.5 billion by 2030. Novartis is getting back into the field of ageing research, armed with fresh perspective, new tools, and better data. 'There's more interest from big pharma in the biology of ageing as a source of novel targets, because for diseases like Alzheimer's it's clear that to treat them you have to look earlier in the course of disease, before symptoms even start,' said Kristen Fortney, CEO and founder of BioAge. Novartis hasn't provided details of the specific disease targets it is pursuing through DARe but has said that 'exercise biology' is a key priority, because exercise is 'an absolute proven intervention in quite a lot of diseases of ageing,' said Kneissel. 'If you look across the 8 billion people on this planet, there are a lot of people who already are ageing much more successfully than most of us,' said Fortney. 'If we can better understand ageing, we can discover the real drivers of disease and develop drugs that can even target multiple age-related diseases.'

**Over 1 Billion Young People to Face Adverse Health Conditions by 2030**
A new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, over 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity has increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The report also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. By 2021, over 1.1 billion adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, up from less than 1 billion in 2016. The study also warns that climate change and technology will play a significant role in the health of this generation. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with a mean annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. By 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24, facing a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.

**Valle d'Aosta Approves Law to Promote Active Aging**
The Valle d'Aosta Council has unanimously approved a proposal for a law to promote and value active aging. The initiative aims to 'value the role of older people in the community and promote their participation in family, social, civil, economic, and cultural life.' Claudio Restano, the proposer of the law, stated that 'this proposal is the result of a coordinated effort between the proposal deposited by me and the amendments presented by the Social Policies Assessor, Carlo Marzi.' The law aims to fill a gap between the outdated legislative framework in use in Valle d'Aosta and the architecture of territorial services, which recognizes older people as an active resource of the community rather than subjects to be assisted. The law aims to promote the personal growth of older people, valuing their experience and projective capacity, supporting self-organization, volunteering, active citizenship, and social networks. According to Mauro Baccega, 'in 2030, 38.4% of the population will be over 65, and in 2040, the percentage will rise to 34.1.' Aldo Di Marco added that 'this proposal of law fills a legislative gap, offering an organic framework to address the theme of active aging in a structured way.' Andrea Manfrin stated that 'this is a step forward in promoting active aging, a crucial theme in a context of continuous demographic evolution.' Carlo Marzi emphasized the 'importance of sharing this proposal of law: a significant fact, because the theme is being addressed by the Government and must be tackled with a unitary and non-divisive approach.'

**UN Secretary-General Warns of Demographic Shift: Elderly to Surpass Young by 2030**
According to UN Secretary-General Filmun Yang, the number of elderly people is expected to surpass the number of young people by 2030, with 1.6 billion people aged 60 or older, accounting for about 20% of the world's population. Yang emphasized that this demographic shift will affect all countries and societies, and will have far-reaching impacts on various fields, including policy-making, human rights, social development, and economic planning. He stressed the need for governments to adopt policies that meet the diverse needs of the elderly, who are an integral part of their communities. Yang also highlighted the importance of providing adequate healthcare, social protection, and economic security, which will 'increase significantly'. He emphasized that the international community must anticipate and adapt to these changes by providing equal opportunities for elderly people to access services that protect their dignity and human rights. Yang also underscored the need for comprehensive reforms in healthcare, social security, and economic systems. He noted that aging is 'not a gender-neutral experience', and emphasized the importance of ensuring equality between the sexes throughout life. During the meeting, Yang referred to the 'International Madrid Plan of Action on Aging', which recognizes that development, social policies, and human rights are interconnected, and calls for creating environments where the elderly can live healthy, safe, and fulfilling lives, and participate fully in their communities.

**Let's honor and respect older Americans this — and every — month**
Ageism, or stereotyping and discriminating against older people, is a pervasive issue in American society. However, by changing our perspective on aging, we can appreciate the value and contributions of older adults. This May, Older Americans Month, is a celebration of the positive aspects of aging and a chance to challenge stereotypes. The theme this year is 'Flipping the Script on Aging,' which aims to change the way Americans view aging. To celebrate, consider attending the Pennsylvania Department of Aging and Pennsylvania Council on the Arts exhibit, 'Older Artists of PA Showcase,' or hosting a celebration for older relatives, friends, or neighbors. Research shows that intergenerational programs can help eradicate ageism, so spending time with older adults can be beneficial. Additionally, volunteering through community organizations or agencies, such as delivering meals or providing companionship, can make a significant difference. With the number of older adults expected to grow to 82 million by 2050, it's essential to recognize the value and worth of older individuals, rather than viewing them as limited or declining. By embracing aging and celebrating what it means to be older, we can create a more inclusive and respectful society.

**Brazil Must Embrace Aging: A Challenge to the Country's Future**
Pope Francis emphasizes the importance of embracing aging in a recent book, 'Na espera de um novo começo. Reflexões sobre a velhice'. He states, 'We should not be afraid of aging, we should not fear embracing the aging process, because life is life, and sugarcoating reality means betraying the truth of things (...) It is true, we age, but that is not the problem: the problem is how we age.' Brazil, the world's largest Catholic country, faces the challenge of accepting its aging population. Recent projections from the IBGE show that by 2030, the country will have more elderly people than children, and by 2046, the 60+ age group will make up 28% of the population, almost double the current percentage. The lack of geriatric professionals is a significant issue, with an estimated 29,000 more geriatrists needed to support the current elderly population, according to the Federal Council of Medicine. Geriatrician Aline Laginestra attributes this deficit to a resistance to accepting aging: 'Seeing aging as a disease is very difficult. I say it's eugenism because we practice medicine for longevity, anti-aging.' The country also faces violence against the elderly, with 390 complaints of violence against the elderly per day in 2023, according to the National Human Rights Ombudsman. The majority of victims are women, and the crimes involve neglect, psychological violence, physical abuse, and financial abuse. The country must prioritize adapting its security structures and support systems for victims, as well as updating its pension system, labor market, urban structures, and access to leisure and culture.

**Combatir el edadismo: La ONU inicia la redacción de la Convención Internacional de Derechos de las Personas Mayores**
The world's aging population is having a significant impact, with the number of adults over 60 expected to surpass the number of children under 5 by 2030. According to Euromonitor, more adult diapers are sold worldwide than children's diapers, as the number of adults over 60 has surpassed the number of children under 5 years old for the first time in 2018. However, the rights of older adults are often ignored, perpetuating ageism and age-related discrimination. The United Nations has finally agreed to draft the International Convention on the Rights of Older Persons, a decision considered 'historic'. The intergovernmental working group, organized by the UN Human Rights Council, will promote the commitment and support of countries to this legal instrument, which aims to promote and protect the rights of older adults. The convention will provide clarity and guidance to states on how to better promote and protect these rights, and will require changes to laws to ensure compliance. Experts highlight the significant legal gaps in this area, leaving older adults unprotected, often excluded from social and political participation, and victims of abuse. The public is invited to contribute actively to the drafting of the document, with their voice being important in ensuring that the rights of older adults do not expire with age. This includes rights to health, a life free from violence, accessible environments, work, culture, and housing.

**The Aging Population: A Cultural and Economic Issue**
The world is concerned about the aging population, and Turkey is no exception. The number of elderly people has increased significantly over the past 20 years, and their benefits are still being felt. However, the elderly population is not just a demographic issue, but also a cultural and economic one. They play a crucial role in shaping the young generation's values, such as respect for justice, law, ethics, and fair competition. The elderly should also serve as a role model for the young, living a realistic life and sharing their experiences. The article notes that Turkey's elderly population ratio has increased from 10.6% in 2024 to 30% in 2034, 10 years ahead of the projected 2080 ratio. The author argues that the world should focus on addressing the root cause of the issue, which is the lack of skill development, respect, and sharing among the elderly, rather than just treating the symptoms.

**The 60+ Tazelenme Üniversitesi Projesi: A Project to Promote Active Participation of Elderly Individuals in Society**
Aging has become a significant social, economic, and cultural issue both globally and in Turkey. The increase in the elderly population is one of the most important demographic changes faced by societies. This process brings with it the difficulties that arise with the increase in people's lifespan, as well as the emergence of social problems. The world is entering a period where the elderly population is rapidly increasing. According to the United Nations, by 2050, approximately 16% of the world's population will be 60 years or older. This situation will require significant changes in areas such as health, retirement, workforce, and social services. Turkey is also affected by this demographic transformation. The number of elderly people in our country has increased in recent years, and the number of individuals aged 65 and over has rapidly increased. In Turkey, the population aged 65 and over was 9.4% in 2020, and it is expected to reach 16% by 2040. This increase highlights the need to strengthen social services and care systems for the elderly. The aging process brings with it many problems that affect not only individuals' lifestyles but also the social structure. Elderly individuals have to cope with physical and health problems, psychological problems, social and economic difficulties, and social participation and discrimination. However, various projects are being implemented in Turkey to enable elderly individuals to participate actively in society. One of these projects is the 60+ Tazelenme Üniversitesi Projesi (60+ Revitalization University Project). This project aims to enable individuals aged 60 and over to participate in social life by educating them. The Tazelenme Üniversitesi aims to develop the cognitive abilities of the elderly, increase their social skills, and improve their quality of life. In this project, themes such as mental activity, social relationships, social participation, lifelong learning, and social awareness are processed through education. Aging, although a biological process, is also an important social and cultural phenomenon. Overcoming the difficulties brought by aging is possible by giving more importance to elderly individuals in society and enabling their active participation in society. The 60+ Tazelenme Üniversitesi Projesi implemented in Turkey encourages elderly individuals to participate in education, thereby improving their quality of life and enabling social participation. Such projects will enable not only elderly individuals but also the entire society to age healthily and sustainably.

**South Korea's Aging Population: A New Growth Engine for the Economy**
South Korea is entering a super-aged society, where the elderly population is expected to reach 13 million by 2030 and 17 million by 2040. The senior market is growing rapidly, with a projected size of 271 trillion won by 2030, up from 72 trillion won in 2020. Seniors are becoming a major consumer group, with 70% of respondents expressing a willingness to spend twice as much on themselves as they did previously. The government needs to develop a first-mover strategy to capitalize on the global aging trend and establish South Korea as a leader in the AgeTech industry. AgeTech, which combines technology with senior care, is expected to grow rapidly, with a global market size projected to reach 45.36 trillion won by 2025, up from 1.8 trillion won in 2020. The industry is expected to be driven by innovations in AI, robotics, and IoT, among others. South Korean companies are actively investing in AgeTech, and the government is also investing in research and development in the field, including dementia research and the development of care robots. The country's care robot industry is expected to grow rapidly, with 84% of caregivers expressing a positive attitude towards the use of care robots.

**With Looming Federal Cuts, Senior Health Care Needs a Shake-Up, CA Leaders Say**
California's older adults are facing a crisis of isolation, with 9 million seniors projected to reach 11.4 million by 2040. Mental health is a significant gap, with many seniors struggling to access help due to social isolation, limited English, and cultural stigma. Anni Chung, president of Self-Help for the Elderly, said, 'You need to integrate all this with physical health, and for that you need not only funding but trust.' The pandemic has exacerbated these issues, with seniors struggling to access healthcare and social services. With federal funding cuts looming, California's health leaders are calling for change at the local level, citing examples of successful community-based programs. Sarah Steenhausen, deputy director of policy, research and equity at the California Department of Aging, said, 'We need to be funding change at the local level, and it can't be one-size-fits-all.' Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of behavioral health services for the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency, added, 'We're stuck in a culturally driven loop of being obsessed with crisis, which prevents us from actually caring for people over the long-term.' Recent landmark examples of this include the 2022 CARE Act and the 2024 Senate Bill 43, which aim to address mental health and conservatorship laws in California.
