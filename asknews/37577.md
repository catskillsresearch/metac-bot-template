**Netflix's New List of Biggest Series & Movie Hits of 2025 Includes Only 1 Anime**
What's on Netflix has released its list of top shows for the first quarter of 2025, with only one anime title, Sakamoto Days, making it to the top 20 non-English language series. The list was broken down into four categories, with Sakamoto Days fitting into the 'Non-English Language Series' section. However, the website also considered the number of cumulative views over the first two weeks, which may have disadvantaged new anime shows that typically release weekly. Despite this, Sakamoto Days has shown its power by placing second in the Netflix Global Weekly Top 10s with 36,300,000 views, and has spent 10 weeks in the top 10. The series has also demonstrated staying power, with its lovable action-comedy and fun characters making it a fan favorite. As the anime is planned to run with a split season one, with the first 11 episodes having just wrapped up its run, and the second half scheduled to air in July 2025, it remains to be seen how it will perform in the coming months.
