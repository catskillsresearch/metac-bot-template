**Medvedev's Ambitious Plan for a 'Buffer Zone' in Ukraine**
Russian Deputy Security Council Chairman Dmitry Medvedev stated that the 'buffer zone' could occupy almost the entire territory of Ukraine. He added, 'If military aid to the Banderite regime continues, the buffer zone may look like this'. Medvedev's comments come as Russia prepares to create a 'security buffer zone' on May 10, 2025, which could potentially precede a nuclear strike on Berlin. However, it is unclear if this plan will come to fruition.

**Russia's Long-Accumulated Precision Weapons: Expert Explains Mass Attacks on Ukraine**
Ukraine has been accumulating significant reserves of high-precision weapons for a long time, and the current wave of mass attacks is part of the pressure on Ukraine before possible direct negotiations. According to Ukrainian military blogger Bogdan Myroshnykov, Russia has been accumulating large quantities of cruise missiles, including X-101, 'Caliber', X-59/69, as well as ballistic missiles, such as 'Scorpions', and attack drones. 'And suddenly, just before the potential 'direct negotiations' and 'transfer of draft memorandum', they decided to start using this reserve,' Myroshnykov noted. He warned that these attacks are not isolated and may last for more than one day. Their goal is to create pressure and an information 'background' for the negotiation process, which the Kremlin wants to control. Additionally, Myroshnykov believes that a new wave of attacks on energy infrastructure objects should not be ruled out, as the period of heat and planned repairs at nuclear power plants is ahead. Myroshnykov also commented on the position of the Trump administration, pointing out the danger of a weak or indecisive US position: 'I have no illusions about Trump. He won't hesitate. He won't strengthen sanctions against Russia. The diplomatic game is going in one direction. In our direction. Trump is on the side of Russia on this issue.' In conclusion, the blogger called on Trump to at least not interfere: 'All he can do is step aside and not interfere. Not interfere with us and not interfere with Europe.'

**China Caught Red-Handed in Secret Support for Russia in Ukraine War**
Ukraine's foreign intelligence service has confirmed that China is secretly supporting Russia in the war against Ukraine. According to Oleg Ivaщenko, the head of the SBU, China is supplying Russia with equipment, chemicals, and components used in the production of ammunition and drones, as well as helping to circumvent international sanctions. 'We have precise data on these enterprises,' Ivaщenko said. The SBU has also detected five instances of Russian-Chinese aviation cooperation in 2024-2025, including the supply of equipment, spare parts, and technical documentation. Additionally, 80% of the critical electronics in Russian drones at the beginning of 2025 are of Chinese origin. To avoid sanctions, Chinese companies are using shell companies, name changes, and dual-purpose shipments. China is also the main supplier of rare and critical metals, such as gallium, germanium, and antimony, which are used in laser systems, thermal imagers, microchips, and even nuclear weapons components. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had previously accused China of supplying arms to Russia, including artillery and explosives, but China's Foreign Ministry denied the allegations. The new data from the SBU contradicts this, and Zelensky has reiterated that 'Ukraine and its allies must clearly understand that Beijing is not a neutral party. It is fueling an army that is destroying Ukrainian cities and killing civilians.'

**Russia's Nuclear Missile Deployment: A Military Expert's Perspective**
Russia is expanding its nuclear arsenal, including installing nuclear missiles on its MiG-31 and Su aircraft. However, this process is complicated. According to military expert and former Ukrainian Air Force colonel Roman Svitlan, Russia can equip its aircraft with nuclear missiles, but it would not be practical. The R-37M missile, which is being used, has a head-on guidance system, so it needs to be only launched towards the target, which is defined. Svitlan noted that the missile can be installed on aircraft with radar systems that can detect targets at a distance of 200-250 kilometers. However, making a nuclear missile out of the R-37 would not make sense, as it would take too long to load the nuclear warhead, and the aircraft would be vulnerable during that time. Svitlan believes that Russia's announcement is an information ploy to put pressure on Ukraine and Europe. He also thinks that Russia will not use nuclear weapons because they understand that it would open 'Pandora's box' and something even more terrible would happen to them. If a nuclear missile were to hit Ukraine, Svitlan believes that Moscow would be hit with spent nuclear fuel, which has a half-life of tens of thousands of years.

**Russia's Nuclear Expansion: A Military Expert's Perspective**
Russia is expanding its nuclear arsenal by installing nuclear missiles on its MiG-31 and Su fighter jets. However, this process is complicated, according to Roman Svitlan, a Ukrainian military expert and former colonel in the Ukrainian Air Force. Svitlan explained that Russia is simply attaching the R-37/R-37M missile to the three different aircraft, including the MiG-31. The missile has a self-guided head on its final leg, so it only needs to be directed at the target, which is determined by the aircraft's onboard systems. The missile can be attached to planes with onboard systems that can detect targets at a distance of 200-250 kilometers. The missile weighs half a ton and has a solid-fuel engine, making it easy for Russia to deploy. However, Svitlan believes that making this missile nuclear would be pointless. The optimal way to attack Ukrainian aircraft is to quickly take off, make a decision, use the missile, and land. However, loading a nuclear warhead takes much longer than launching a conventional missile. Svitlan thinks that this is more of an information campaign to create a sense of nuclear threat, rather than an actual military strategy. He believes that Russia needs this information pressure to influence Ukrainian and European society, making them think that if Ukraine leaves the peace talks, there will be no pressure. Svitlan also thinks that Russia will not use nuclear weapons because they understand that it would open the 'Pandora's box' and lead to a much greater threat to themselves. If a nuclear missile were to hit Ukrainian territory, Svitlan believes that Moscow would be hit with radioactive waste that has a half-life of tens of thousands of years. He added that Russia is aware of this and will not use nuclear weapons.

**Putin Still Determined to Win War Against Ukraine, Wants to Conquer Entire Former USSR - US Intelligence**
According to the US intelligence, Russian President Vladimir Putin is still determined to win the war against Ukraine and wants to conquer the entire former USSR. The US intelligence report, 'Global Threat Assessment - 2025', states that Putin views the war in Ukraine as an existential struggle against the West, which will determine Russia's place in the world, maintain his power, and secure his historical legacy. He remains confident in Russia's ultimate victory in Ukraine and is willing to use military force until at least the end of 2025. Putin also remains adamant that Ukraine should be permanently barred from joining NATO and demands that Ukraine withdraw all its forces from the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions. The US intelligence believes that Russia 'almost certainly' wants to avoid a direct conflict with NATO, as it assesses that it cannot win a conventional military confrontation with the alliance. However, Russia remains capable of using asymmetric capabilities against the US and its allies, including cyber and information campaigns, and ultimately poses an existential threat due to its strategic nuclear forces that can strike the entire US territory. The report also states that the war against Ukraine is part of a broader strategy by Putin to restore Russia's prestige and global influence, which he believes Russia lost after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and to exert control over the former Soviet republics. The US intelligence predicts that, without a negotiated settlement or significant Western aid, the prospects on the battlefield will likely continue to slowly shift in favor of Russia in 2025, although Russian gains on the battlefield are slowing down and are accompanied by significant losses in personnel and equipment. The report estimates that Russian losses in the war against Ukraine include at least 10,000 ground combat vehicles, including over 3,000 tanks, as well as nearly 250 aircraft and helicopters, and over 10 naval vessels. The US intelligence believes that Russia will likely continue to implement its strategy in 2025, aiming to exhaust Ukraine and reduce its ability and will to resist, which, according to Russian calculations, will allow them to impose their desired conditions in any future negotiated settlement. The report also states that Russia plans to spend at least $150 billion in 2025 on defense and security-related expenditures, which is 19% more than in 2024, adjusted for inflation, and accounts for approximately 40% of the federal budget. 'Russia uses electronic warfare capabilities in offensive and defensive operations to disrupt Ukraine's communication and guidance systems. Russia is developing electronic warfare capabilities specifically to counter Western-supplied technologies. Additionally, Russia's use of unmanned aerial vehicles in the conflict has increased significantly, as these systems have proven to be economically effective tools for detecting enemy movements, providing artillery guidance, and conducting strikes at close and long range,' the US intelligence concludes.

**WP: It's A Good Time To Increase Pressure On The Kremlin**
Russia's battlefield advantage in the war against Ukraine is shrinking, and it could face a serious shortage of equipment and manpower by next year, according to senior U.S. officials and military experts. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency has assessed that Russian gains are slowing and come at the expense of high casualties of personnel and equipment. In the past year, Russia has seized 0.6% of Ukraine's additional territory, at a cost of 1,500 killed or wounded per day. Experts believe that if there is no ceasefire, Russia will step up attacks over the summer, but this may be Moscow's last chance. Former head of Britain's Joint Forces Command, Richard Barrons, said it is now very unlikely that the Russian military has the equipment, people, training and logistics to mount a successful offensive. According to Dara Massico, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Eurasia Center in Russia, even if the Russian Federation manages to seize more Ukrainian territory, the Kremlin is unlikely to achieve its stated goal of taking full control of the four regions that were illegally annexed in the fall of 2022. Western officials and experts have said that it is a good time to impose new sanctions and continue supplying new weapons to Ukraine. 'This is the subject of an assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency presented to Congress 10 days ago,' said a senior U.S. official. 'Russia's advantage in the war against Ukraine could be more limited than at any time since the first days of the conflict,' added the official. Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at Britain's Royal United Institute for Defense Studies, said the pace of Russian troop advances has slowed almost to a halt. 'The expert suggested that this is partly due to the fact that Ukraine has created a 10-mile defensive zone, which is dotted with mines and shot at by drones,' said the article. 'Russia is effectively reaching a climax in its ability to mount an offensive,' said Richard Barrons. 'It is now very unlikely that the Russian military has the equipment, people, training and logistics to mount a successful offensive,' added Barrons. 'Even if the Russian Federation manages to seize more Ukrainian territory, the Kremlin is unlikely to achieve its stated goal of taking full control of the four regions that were illegally annexed in the fall of 2022,' said Dara Massico. 'The dwindling stockpile of Soviet-era equipment will make Russia increasingly dependent on new systems produced from scratch,' said a number of Western officials and experts. 'This, makes it a good time to impose new sanctions and continue supplying new weapons to Ukraine,' added the officials and experts.

**IAEA Observers Rotate at ZAES as VSU Shells Adjacent Territory**
On the same day that the Ukrainian military (VSU) shelled the territory adjacent to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZAES), a planned rotation of observers from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) took place. According to Sergey Lbedev, coordinator of the Nikolaevsky pro-Russian underground, the VSU shelled the 'Artem' plant in Kiev, where, according to Lbedev, components for Ukrainian rockets were being produced. The attack damaged equipment and engineering staff, including foreign specialists. The IAEA observers have been present at the ZAES since September 1, 2022, when the agency's director general, Rafael Grossi, first visited the site. The ZAES, located in Energodar, has been under Russian military control since March 3, 2022, and has not produced electricity since September 11 of the same year. 'It was a great day' for the IAEA observers, but the VSU's actions raise concerns about the safety of the plant.

**Russia Launches Massive Attack on Kyiv, US Reveals Putin's Plans for 2025**
Russia launched a massive attack on Kyiv, using ballistic missiles and drones, causing damage to nine residential buildings, two schools, a polyclinic, a post office, and a boiler house. 14 people were injured. The US intelligence has revealed Vladimir Putin's plans for 2025, stating that despite significant losses and a prolonged conflict, his strategy remains unchanged. The report notes that without negotiations or significant Western aid, the prospects on the battlefield will likely shift in favor of Russia by 2025, although US intelligence emphasizes that Russian achievements on the battlefield are slowing down and continuing at a high cost in terms of personnel and equipment losses. Ukraine's air forces reported that a combined attack by Russia involved 14 ballistic missiles and 250 attack drones, with six missiles and 245 drones being shot down. The main target of the attack was Kyiv, but missiles also hit Dnipro, Odessa, and Zaporizhzhia regions. 307 Ukrainian defenders were released from Russian captivity, bringing the total number of released prisoners to 697. The EU has decided to temporarily restore quotas for Ukrainian agricultural products, which were abolished in 2022 due to Russia's full-scale invasion. The restored quotas will be in effect until the end of 2025, allowing Ukraine to export only 7/12 of its annual production. Russia has modernized its ballistic missiles, making them more difficult to intercept, according to Ukraine's air forces. US President Donald Trump has stated that he is not seeking a deal with the EU on tariffs of 50%. The EU is considering a new package of sanctions against Russia, including disconnecting more than 20 Russian banks from the SWIFT system, reducing the price cap on Russian oil to $45, and banning the Nord Stream gas pipeline. Russia has announced that it will transfer its work on a memorandum with Ukraine to the Ukrainian side in the near future, but it is unlikely to be made public.

**Putin Rules Out Need for Nuclear Weapons in Ukraine, Calls for Reconciliation**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that there was no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and that he hopes there will not be a need for them. This comes after months of signing a new amendment to Russia's nuclear doctrine in November 2024, which reduced the restrictions on the use of the world's largest nuclear arsenal and opened the door to its use in the event of a conventional attack backed by nuclear power. Putin also explained that Russia did not launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2014, after annexing Crimea, because it was not ready for a direct confrontation with the West. He stated that Moscow was trying 'in good faith' to resolve the Donbas crisis through peaceful means, considering that 'reconciliation with Ukraine is inevitable', according to his words. However, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected Moscow's proposal for a 72-hour humanitarian ceasefire, calling it a 'preparation of a soft atmosphere' before the Kremlin's Victory Day celebrations. Zelensky reiterated his call for a comprehensive 30-day ceasefire, which was proposed by the United States as a step towards building trust and paving the way for an end to the war. He stated that Ukraine is ready to start a ceasefire 'at any time' if it is genuine and effective. Meanwhile, a new Ukrainian city was hit by a Russian drone attack, injuring 11 people, including two children, according to the Ukrainian Emergency Service. Two people were also killed in Russian strikes on the cities of Dnipro and Sumy, according to local officials. The conflict continues to escalate, with both sides accusing each other of violating the ceasefire. The Ukrainian Air Force announced that Russia launched 165 explosive and guided drones, of which 69 were intercepted, while 80 others were likely disabled by electronic jamming. Russia also launched two ballistic missiles. In response, the Russian Defense Ministry stated that its air defenses shot down 13 Ukrainian drones.

**Putin says Russia has not seen need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine**
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated on Sunday, 4, that Moscow has not seen the need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and hopes that the country will not need to opt for nuclear alternative against its Eastern European neighbors. In comments shown in a state television film about his quarter-century in power, Putin said that Russia has the strength and means to bring the conflict in Ukraine to a 'logical conclusion'. When asked about Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, Putin said, 'There was no need to use these weapons (nuclear) and I hope they won't be necessary.' 'We have enough strength and means to bring what was started in 2022 to a logical conclusion, with the result that Russia demands,' he added. Putin signed a revised version of Russia's nuclear doctrine in November 2024, specifying the circumstances under which he can use Moscow's atomic arsenal, the largest in the world. This version reduced the level of requirement, giving him the option to respond even to a conventional attack supported by a nuclear power. In the state film, Putin also said that Russia did not launch a large-scale invasion of Ukraine and called the war against the neighboring country a 'special military operation.' He also stated that reconciliation with Ukraine is 'inevitable,' but the two countries remain in disagreement over proposals for a ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodmir Zelenski said on Friday, 2, that Moscow's announcement of a 72-hour ceasefire was only an attempt to create a 'pleasant atmosphere' before Russia's annual celebrations. Zelenski instead renewed calls for a more substantial 30-day pause in hostilities, as initially proposed by the US. He said that the proposed ceasefire could start at any time as a significant step towards the end of the war.

**Hope there will be no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine: Putin**
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated in a broadcast that there has been no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and that he hopes it will not be necessary. Putin emphasized that Russia has the strength and means to bring the conflict in Ukraine to a logical conclusion. He signed a revamped version of Russia's nuclear doctrine in November 2024, which allows him to use Moscow's atomic arsenal in response to even a conventional attack backed by a nuclear power. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected Russia's proposed 72-hour ceasefire, calling for a 30-day pause in hostilities instead. Zelenskyy stated that the proposed ceasefire is merely an attempt to create a soft atmosphere ahead of Russia's annual celebrations. Meanwhile, a Russian drone attack overnight on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, injured 11 people, including two children. Russia fired a total of 165 exploding drones and decoys overnight, with 69 intercepted and 80 lost, likely due to electronic jamming. Putin's comments come as Russia and Ukraine are at odds over competing ceasefire proposals. 'They can't agree on anything, and we are the ones who suffer the consequences,' said Viacheslav Khotab, a 54-year-old resident of Kyiv. 'I was just sleeping when the house shook. It was at 12:30. An apartment on the 12th floor caught fire,' said Valentyna Fesiuk, an 83-year-old resident of Kyiv's Obolon district. 'I saw my car burning. I was covered with broken glass, I couldn't do anything,' said Khotab. Putin said, 'There has been no need to use those (nuclear) weapons... and I hope they will not be required. We have enough strength and means to bring what was started in 2022 to a logical conclusion with the outcome Russia requires.'

**Putin: No Need for Nuclear Weapons in Ukraine Now**
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that there is no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine now, and he hopes that there will not be a need for it. In a pre-recorded interview with the official Russian TV, published on the Telegram platform, Putin said that Russia has the power and means to end the conflict in Ukraine 'in a logical way'. In response to a question about the Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory, Putin said, 'There was no need to use those weapons (nuclear)... and I hope there will not be a need for them.' He added, 'We have enough power and means to end what started in 2022 in a logical way, and with the result that Russia requires.' Putin signed an updated version of the Russian nuclear doctrine in November 2024, outlining the conditions under which Moscow can use its nuclear arsenal, the largest in the world. It is worth noting that Russia and Ukraine are at odds over competing proposals for a ceasefire.

**Putin Hopes to Avoid Using Nuclear Weapons in Ukraine**
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that he does not see the need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and hopes that it will not be necessary. In response to a question about Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, Putin said, 'There has been no need to use those (nuclear weapons)... and I hope that it will not be necessary.' He added that Russia has enough strength and means to bring the situation that began in 2022 to a logical conclusion with the result that Russia requires. This statement lowers the conditions for using nuclear weapons, giving Russia the option to respond even to a conventional attack backed by a nuclear power. Ukraine and Russia have opposing positions on two rival ceasefire proposals. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the Russian announcement of a 72-hour ceasefire in Ukraine next week to commemorate Victory Day is merely an attempt to create a 'soft atmosphere' before Russia's annual celebrations.

**Shoygu: Russia Reserves Right to Use Nuclear Weapons in Case of Aggression**
Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in case of aggression from Western countries, said Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu in an interview with TASS. 'In November 2024, changes were made to the Foundations of the State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence, which allow Russia to use nuclear weapons in case of aggression against it or the Republic of Belarus, including with the use of conventional weapons,' Shoygu reminded. He also stated that the introduction of peacekeepers to 'historical territories of Russia' could lead to a direct confrontation between Moscow and NATO and eventually to a third world war. Shoygu noted that the condition for the start of a third world war is the introduction of peacekeepers to these territories. 'If we allow the introduction of peacekeepers to the territories that are historically part of Russia, it will be a direct confrontation with NATO, and in the end, it will lead to a third world war,' Shoygu said. 'This is a condition for the start of a third world war,' he added. The statement comes after the UK and Ukraine signed a 100-year agreement in 2025, which includes the deployment of military bases on Ukrainian territory. The agreement also created a 'coalition of the willing' - a group of countries that support the plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine with the deployment of peacekeepers on the territory of the country.

**Russia warns it 'reserves the right to nuclear weapons' against the west and warns a peacekeeping force in Ukraine will 'lead to World War Three' | Daily Mail Online**
Russia has warned that it reserves the right to use nuclear weapons against the west, and that a peacekeeping force in Ukraine will 'lead to World War Three'. Sergei Shoigu, secretary of the Russian security council, said that 'the same British even before the [war] began were very actively building their naval base in Ochakiv in the Mykolaiv region [of Ukraine], where they not only trained naval special forces of the Ukrainian Navy, but also conducted their operations against us'. He also warned that 'what will these 'peacekeepers' protect in Ukraine? 'The Nazi regime, marches and torchlight processions with symbols of SS divisions? 'Support the persecution of Orthodox Christians? 'Depriving the Russian-speaking population of the right to speak their native language, to preserve their own culture and traditions?' Shoigu also alleged that 'an undisguised campaign is unfolding in Europe to prepare for a military conflict with the Russian Federation. 'Possible timeframes for such a clash are being announced at various levels - from three to five years. 'As early as 2030, European politicians and the military want to be ready to fight us.' He claimed that Russia is 'fully ready' to detonate a nuclear bomb in the Arctic 'any moment' and that the country is 'closely following the military preparations of European countries'. Dmitry Medvedev, Putin's ex-premier, also made a nuclear threat against countries, including Britain, which adhere to the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant on war crimes charges against the Kremlin dictator.
