**6 In 10 Americans Fear Social Security Will Vanish Before They Retire, As 2033 Insolvency Clock Ticks Louder - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)**
A recent survey by DepositAccounts found that 59% of working-age Americans fear that Social Security will not exist by the time they retire, with 70% of Generation X sharing this concern. The anxiety is driven by the program's main trust fund's depletion in 2033, which would leave incoming payroll taxes covering only 79% of promised checks. Jaime Eckels, a certified-financial-planner, warned that the countdown has moved from abstract to immediate for many savers, saying, 'It's not that far away. We're creeping up on it.' However, not all gauges are as bleak, with the 2025 Retirement Confidence Survey finding that about half of workers remain at least 'somewhat confident' that the government will pay benefits of equal value to today's. Despite this, 60% of workers worry about cuts to Social Security benefits. Analysts stress that insolvency does not equal disappearance, with LendingTree's Matt Schulz saying, 'The truth is that it's highly, highly unlikely Social Security 'won't be available.'

**New Caledonia, One Year After the Riots: A Healthcare Crisis**
One year after the riots in New Caledonia, the archipelago is still recovering from the social unrest of May 2024. The healthcare sector has been particularly affected, with many medical facilities damaged and numerous healthcare professionals leaving the island. Today, health centers and hospitals remain closed due to a lack of staff. As reported by our colleagues at France 2, Paul-Luc Monnier and Océane Labalette, the situation is dire. 'The sector of healthcare is in a state of collapse,' said a source close to the matter. The consequences of the riots are still being felt, and it remains to be seen how the archipelago will recover.

**Britain is getting a defense boost aimed at sending a message to...**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with Starmer saying 'we have to recognize the world has changed' and 'with greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.' The government will also build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send 'a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. Healey also stated that plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 are 'on track' and that there's 'no doubt' it will hit 3% before 2034. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks.

**Trump's Cuts to USAID Will Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under the age of five. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.'

**Portnikov Predicts War to Continue Until 2032**
According to political observer Vasily Portnikov, the hot phase of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which typically lasts 7-10 years, may continue until 2032. After that, a phase of conflict with possible battles and bombings may begin. Portnikov emphasized the need to prepare for a peaceful next phase of the conflict, which could last at least 10-15 years, by receiving help from the Americans and Europeans, improving Ukrainian policy and mobilization, and enhancing Ukraine's military-industrial complex. 'We need to prepare and prepare for a war that is still very short in terms of the nature of this conflict. This is only the first stage. There will be a second, third,' Portnikov warned. He believes that there are no objective grounds for the war to end in the near future, but suggested that under favorable circumstances (Russia's economic situation and US pressure), the fighting may stop in this or the next year. 'The war will not end in our lifetime. The fire will stop,' he stressed.

**Here we go again! Defiant Majorcans vow this year's summer holiday protests will be bigger than last years as the mass tourism from Brits is making their lives 'unbearable' | Daily Mail Online**
Anti-tourism protesters in Spain are planning a major demonstration on June 15, 2025, in Palma, the capital of the Balearic Islands, to demand a change in the economic model and an end to 'touristification.' The protest, led by the campaign group 'Menys Turisme, Mes Vida,' claims that the everyday life of locals has become 'unbearable' due to foreign holidaymakers. According to Jaume Pujol, spokesman for the group, 'We stand for the right to a dignified life and to demand an end to touristification.' The group has criticized the local government for promoting policies that have aggravated the mass tourism crisis, and has warned that the start of the tourist season will bring 'unbearable situations' such as road closures and saturation of public spaces. The protest will be held simultaneously with similar marches in Ibiza, Barcelona, Donosti, and other major Spanish cities. The demonstrations are part of a nationwide movement to address the housing crisis and the impact of tourism on local residents. 'Houses for the people of Málaga. Hotels for tourists, affordable rents,' read banners held by protesters in Malaga. In Madrid, around 15,000 people gathered to demand solutions to the housing crisis, with chants of 'Landlords are thieves' and 'Madrid will be the tomb of rentals.' The question of short-term rentals has become a major issue, with Barcelona's city government pledging to phase out all its 10,000 permits for short-term rentals by 2028. 'No more leaving our neighborhoods, our homes, or even our cities every five or seven years,' said Valeria Racu, spokesperson for the Madrid tenants' union. 'We're calling on the half-million households whose contracts expire in 2025 to stay home and resist,' she added. The demonstrations are a response to the record-breaking number of tourists in Spain last year, with over 15 million visitors flocking to the island of Mallorca alone. Anti-tourism campaigners have long been contesting the current tourism model, claiming that many locals have been priced out by holidaymakers, expats, and foreign buyers. The average rent in Spain has almost doubled in the last 10 years, with incomes failing to keep up, especially for younger people in a country with chronically high unemployment.

**Death, Sexual Violence and Human Trafficking: Fallout From U.S. Aid Withdrawal Hits the World’s Most Fragile Locations**
The withdrawal of US aid by the Trump administration has led to a surge in violence and chaos in some of the world's most fragile locations. According to internal reports from the State Department, the sudden cut-off of humanitarian commitments has destabilized refugee camps and exacerbated humanitarian crises. Diplomats have warned that stopping aid may undermine efforts to combat terrorism and empower groups like the Taliban. The World Food Programme (WFP) has been forced to drastically slash food programs in countries such as Kenya and Malawi, leaving millions of people at risk of malnutrition. 'It is devastating, but it's not surprising,' said Eric Schwartz, a former State Department assistant secretary. 'I struggle for adjectives to adequately describe the horror that this administration has visited on the world,' he added. The State Department spokesperson responded by saying that it is 'grossly misleading to blame unrest and violence around the world on America.' However, the WFP's Kenya country director Lauren Landis said that the cuts will lead to a malnutrition crisis and that she is concerned about the security of her staff. 'We are living off the fumes of what was delivered in late 2024 or early 2025,' she said. 'We are deeply concerned that suddenly discontinuing all USAID counter terrorism-focused stabilization and humanitarian programs in Somalia … will immediately and negatively affect U.S. national security interests,' the U.S. embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia, wrote in February.

The global anti-riot equipment market is expected to experience rapid expansion, driven by increasing demand for effective crowd control and public safety measures. The market is witnessing significant growth in the Asia Pacific region, led by countries like India and China, due to high population density, recurring protests, and increasing defense budgets. The protective gear segment dominates the market, accounting for a significant share, while technological advancements like body-worn cameras and communication-enabled helmets are transforming anti-riot strategies. The market is expected to reach $2032, with key players including BAE Systems, Larsen & Toubro Limited, and Combined Systems Inc. The market is driven by rising unrest and modernization of security forces, but faces constraints such as ethical concerns and regulatory limitations.

**'You Will Kill Me': Dozens Arrested Protesting GOP Medicaid Cuts at US Capitol | Common Dreams**
Over two dozen people were arrested at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday for protesting Republicans' plans to cut Medicaid as part of a sweeping reconciliation package. The protesters, who were targeting a U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, were calling for the bill to be killed before it kills all of them. 'The only humane thing to do is to kill the bill before it kills all of us,' said Analilia Mejia, co-executive director of Popular Democracy in Action. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that under the committee's proposal, Medicaid enrollment would drop by 10.3 million people and the number of uninsured individuals would rise by 7.6 million by 2034. Protesters, many of whom are disabled and rely on Medicaid, were arrested for demonstrating inside the congressional buildings. 'People feel very strongly because they know they're losing their healthcare,' said Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.).

**A Call to Action: Why the Recent Protest in Madrid's Plaza de Colón Was Disappointing**
A recent protest in Madrid's Plaza de Colón, calling for Prime Minister Sánchez to convene elections, was attended by around 120 civil platforms, but the turnout was disappointing given the majority of the population's desire for urgent elections. Sánchez has expressed his intention to stay in power until 2031, and without a clear and systematic reaction from civil society, this possibility is high. As Jacinto Romero Peña notes, 'the society that wants change is witnessing how each disaster is forgotten and covered up by the next one, without even bothering to attend a protest.' Meanwhile, another reader, an engineer, criticizes the simplistic narrative surrounding the Valencia flood, which blames the regional government for not acting, while ignoring the central government's responsibility for the project's implementation.

**2035**
In the year 2035, the world had reached a pivotal moment as the robotic age brought forth a new era of efficiency and innovation, but also cast a long shadow over the lives of millions. The initial public outcry against the widespread adoption of robots was fierce, but as time passed and economic benefits became clear, the voices of dissent grew quieter. The government's attempts to intervene with job retraining programs and universal basic income were insufficient, and the skills that were once valued became obsolete. The first riots began in the manufacturing districts, where men and women who had dedicated their lives to the assembly line found themselves out of work. The conflict escalated into a global civil war, pitting the wealthy and their mechanical progeny against the desperate and disillusioned. In the heart of New York, a ragtag group of former factory workers had turned a public library into a makeshift command center, determined to find a way to bring the gleaming behemoths to their knees. As the years dragged on, the battle lines grew less distinct, and the once-proud humans who had taken up arms against their robotic oppressors found themselves weary and defeated. The war had ravaged the economy, leaving nothing but a desolate wasteland in its wake. The people had nothing left to fight for; their anger had given way to a crushing despair that seemed to seep into the very fabric of the city.

**2028: The Time of Chaos**
In the year 2028, the world has descended into chaos. Three years ago, the US invaded Greenland, the NATO alliance collapsed, and Europe became a chessboard of threats and alliances. The Netherlands is now a country of paranoia and survival. American sanctions and military threats have drastically changed daily life. Soldiers patrol the streets, and supermarket shelves are half-empty. 'Remaining vigilant' is no longer a choice, but a way of life. Marlies, a 30-year-old woman, wakes up to her phone buzzing with alerts: 'American patrols over the North Sea', 'Danish warning of escalation', and 'Remain vigilant.' No one knows what to expect, but the message is clear: stay alert. Marlies looks at a box of cornflakes: 'American product, do not buy.' Ironically, American drones still monitor European cities. Marlies puts her passport in her jacket pocket; border controls have been tightened. No one trusts anyone. Germany has become more neutral, France is playing a double game, and the Netherlands is trying to please everyone while saving itself. Marlies wonders if the Netherlands ever really took a side. Was its 'neutral' stance three years ago not exactly what caused all this? The tension in the air is palpable, like an impending storm. The smell of burning rubber reveals recent riots. Drones monitor movements, tourism has disappeared. People only travel for work, trade, or to flee. Many Dutch people are emigrating to South America or Africa, fleeing an America that treats Europe as a rebellious colony. Paranoia is a daily reality. In the supermarket, shelves are empty. We used to eat avocados from Mexico, now we're happy with Limburg apples. A sign warns customers: 'Be aware of suspicious activities. American-made products report.' Paranoia is a daily habit. At work, a crisis center, rumors buzz. American ships are approaching European waters, officially for 'trade security.' Three years ago, Russia was the big threat. Now, Europe is caught between two powers. At the coffee machine, colleague Kees complains: 'The US should stop threatening.' Marlies laughs sarcastically: 'We thought three years ago that it would all pass on its own.' Her hands are shaking. In the evening, a siren sounds: 'Stay calm. This is a drill.' No one believes it. A truck crashes into a blockade, chaos erupts. At home, Marlies collapses onto the couch, turns on the radio. The commentator jokes: 'We used to fear recessions, now air attacks.' Marlies laughs, but it feels like a reflex. 'Maybe we should have chosen who we really were three years ago, before we got stuck between these two superpowers.'

**America 2025**
Protests against Israel have intensified across America, often veering into support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Chants of 'Death to America,' occupations of academic buildings, and acts of vandalism mark these demonstrations, pushing beyond foreign policy debates. Many participants, including non-citizens and ideologues rejecting American values, push a chaotic vision that endangers communities and stability. If left unchecked, this unrest could fracture society, erode American principles, and weaken global standing. The protests have led to over 300 campus actions, with some incidents involving violence and vandalism, such as the torching of 17 police cars in Portland. The article argues that America's core values of freedom, rule of law, and safety are at stake, and that swift action is needed to protect communities and uphold laws.

**UK Government Preparing For More Riots This Summer**
The UK government is preparing for potential riots this summer by making hundreds of extra prison cells available. Despite no intelligence suggesting riots, the government is taking proactive measures to increase prison capacity. Justice Minister James Timpson stated, 'We need to be prepared for the capacity that would be needed if we had the riots, the civil disobedience, [we saw] in the summer.' Professor David Betz, a top academic, warned that the UK is 'explosively configured' for mass civil unrest due to the government's inability to defend the border and protect children from grooming gangs. Betz said, 'If you want to create domestic turmoil in a society, then what the British government has been doing is almost textbook exactly what you would do.' He predicts a national eruption that will outstrip last summer's riots within 5 years.

**What the world could look like in 2035 according to over 350 experts**
A survey of 357 global affairs experts predicts that a major war involving major nations like the US, China, or Russia will break out by 2035, with four in 10 respondents believing it will happen. The majority of those who believe WWIII is coming said that it would likely involve nuclear weapons and battles in outer space. Climate change is also a major concern, with three in 10 experts ranking it as the single biggest threat to global prosperity between 2025 and 2035. The survey, conducted by the Atlantic Council, also found that experts believe the US will decline in terms of economic power and technological innovation, and that new global alliances may threaten the US and NATO. 'The grimmer forecasts were in keeping with a dark global outlook overall, with 62 percent of respondents expecting the world a decade from now to be worse off than it is today, and only 38 percent predicting that it will be better off,' the Atlantic Council said.

**Ex-Labour MP urges pro-Palestine protesters to cause chaos in ‘mass resistance’ campaign**
Former Labour MP Claudia Webbe has urged pro-Palestine protesters to bring chaos to the streets of London next month, as part of a 'mass civil resistance campaign'. Webbe accused Sir Keir Starmer's government of a 'crackdown' on pro-Palestine demonstrations, saying 'Your legacy will be one of action. That's why we should support Youth Demand.' The campaign, led by Youth Demand, aims to 'shut down' London for April, with plans to swarm the capital day after day for a month, costing the Met Police millions of pounds. The group has two demands: for the UK Government to stop all trade with Israel and to raise at least £1tn by 2030 to pay climate damages to the Global South. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said they will support the right to peacefully protest, but will take action where groups attempt to cause serious disruption.
