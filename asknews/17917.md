**Colombian 'UFO Sphere' Goes Viral  --  Experts Split On Whether It's Alien Artifact Or Elaborate Art Project**
A mysterious metallic sphere that reportedly fell from the sky in Colombia in March has sparked debate over whether it's an alien artifact or an elaborate art project. Researchers in Mexico are studying the object, which has three distinct layers with different densities, according to X-ray scans. However, physicist Julia Mossbridge suggests it could be a 'really cool art project,' advising against jumping to conclusions. This comes as a NASA report in 2023 concluded that most unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) are likely attributable to natural causes, rather than extraterrestrial life. A Pentagon report in 2024 also stated that there is no evidence of reverse-engineered alien technology or confirmed sightings of UFOs with alien origin.

**Mysterious sphere in Colombia sparks UFO talk**
A metal orb, marked with decorative etchings, was recovered in Colombia in March and is being studied by scientists in Mexico, who believe it could have extraterrestrial origins. The sphere, dubbed the 'Buga sphere,' was filmed floating erratically through the sky before it crashed near Buga, Colombia. According to researcher Jose Luis Velazquez, an X-ray found the three layers of the sphere to be of different densities, with 'no welds or joints' that would be expected of a man-made object. However, Julia Mossbridge, founder of the Mossbridge Institute, doubts the sphere's alien origins, calling it 'a really cool art project.' The Pentagon's report last year found no confirmed sightings of UFOs with alien origin or human interactions with extraterrestrial beings.

**World Leaders React to Imminent Alien Invasion**
As the world prepares for an imminent alien invasion, various countries have taken different approaches to deal with the situation. Israel's Ministry of Defense has marketed 'Earth's finest communication devices' to the extraterrestrial fleet, while the United States created a new government bureaucracy, the Department of Extraterrestrial Affairs and Defense (DEAD), to tackle the invasion. DEAD's first act was to commission a $500 million logo featuring a bald eagle strangling an alien, but its funding request was rejected by Congress. Meanwhile, other countries have taken more creative approaches, such as Ukraine's plan to beam its national anthem into space via satellite, and China's incremental upgrade to existing tech to block alien hacking attempts. The aliens have since departed, leaving behind a message that 'this planet has a terrible public relations department' and that they will return after humans have evolved.

**Europa's Ice Crust: A Potential Sign of Life**
Scientists have discovered that the ice crust of Jupiter's moon Europa must be at least 20 kilometers thick, with only the top 6-8 kilometers being solid and immobile. This allows for a potential exchange of water with the ocean beneath, which could be a sign of life. A team of researchers from the US and Germany has also found that a small part of a bacterium could be detected by the upcoming NASA mission 'Europa Clipper', which is set to launch in October 2024. The mission will study the moon's subsurface ocean, which is believed to be twice as large as Earth's. The researchers used computer simulations to analyze the formation of ring-shaped ice walls and craters on Europa's surface, which could be indicative of a subsurface ocean. Additionally, the Saturn moon Enceladus is believed to have a subsurface ocean, which is being studied by another team of researchers. The 'Europa Clipper' mission will also study the composition of small ice particles ejected by Europa, which could potentially contain biological material. 'Even if only one percent of a bacterium is present in a micrometer-sized ice particle, its biological components are clearly visible in the data,' said Fabian Klenner, a researcher from the University of Washington and the Free University of Berlin. The mission's success depends on the detection of a rare 'geyser' on Europa's surface, which could provide a sample of the subsurface ocean. 'Our recommendation for you: Search for aliens. Are we humans alone in the universe?'

**Film Premiere: The Hidden Hand Behind UFOs Ep. 4 (Roswell and the Birth of a New Legend)**
The fourth installment of the documentary series 'The Hidden Hand Behind UFOs' explores the mysterious events surrounding the alleged UFO crash in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. The documentary, titled 'Roswell and the Birth of a New Legend', examines the claims of an alien spacecraft crashing and President Harry Truman signing a peace treaty with the aliens. The author, Matthew Ehret, questions the validity of these claims and suggests that they may be part of a larger myth created by secret societies and government initiatives. Ehret invites viewers to watch the documentary and participate in a live Q&A session on May 30. Previous episodes of the series can be found on the author's website.

**Before Steven Spielberg's Next UFO Movie, It's Time To Rewatch His 1st Sci-Fi Masterpiece With 90% On Rotten Tomatoes**
Steven Spielberg's upcoming UFO movie has a lot to live up to, considering his first sci-fi masterpiece, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, released in 1977. The film, which has a 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, introduced a level of realism and panoramic scope to the UFO subgenre, making it a groundbreaking achievement in cinematic innovation. The movie's success was not limited to its technical achievements, as it also explored the feelings of people when they discover there is more to the universe than they knew and believed. Close Encounters of the Third Kind served as the main inspiration for Spielberg's 1982 movie E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, which was also a box-office smash. Spielberg has reunited with Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp for his new alien sci-fi film, which is slated for a 2026 release date. While no specifics have been shared about the movie's story or characters, it's expected to be comparable in scope to Jurassic Park. Spielberg's new venture will likely contain the kernel of inspiration that saw him create two alien-themed classics in his early years as a director.

**Alien: Earth Series Reveals Details About Main Character and New Images**
The creators of the 'Alien: Earth' series have revealed details about the main character and shown new images. Sydney Chandler, who plays the lead role, said, 'My character, Wendy, is a unique being - a hybrid of a child's brain and a robot's body.' The series takes place in 2120, two years before the events of the original 'Alien' film. The world is dominated by five large corporations: Weyland-Yutani, Lynch, Dynamic, Threshold, and Prodigy. Some of them produce androids (synthetic humans with AI), while others maintain cyborgs (people with artificial body parts). Wendy, a creation of Prodigy, is a hybrid - a child's brain in a robot's body. She and others like her play a role in the struggle between corporations, and a strange catastrophe occurs: a spaceship carrying alien specimens from Weyland-Yutani crashes on Prodigy City. Wendy and other hybrids go to investigate the crash site and encounter terrifying aliens, including a Xenomorph. According to showrunner Noah Hawley, the 'Alien' franchise has a feminine identity, expressed not only in the characters but also in the nature of the Xenomorphs, which are controlled by matriarchal queens. 'Alien: Earth' will follow this concept: Wendy, with her childlike innocence, will face two types of monsters - Xenomorphs and humans. She will have to answer the question, 'Is humanity worthy of survival?' The series is set to premiere on August 12, 2025. The main cast includes Sydney Chandler, Essie Davis, Timothy Olyphant, Alex Lawther, Babu Antony, and others. Ridley Scott, who directed the original 'Alien' and 'Prometheus,' is a producer.

**Alien Civilization Possibly Observing Humanity from Our Own Solar System**
A scientist from Harvard suggests that an alien civilization could be observing humanity from our own Solar System, sparking both skepticism and fascination. This theory began with 'Oumuamua, a long, unusual, and tail-less comet that some believe could be an artificial solar sail. Additionally, underwater 'rings' in the Pacific Ocean, known as IM1, have been found to have possible artificial origins. However, some scientists argue that both 'Oumuamua and IM1 can be explained by natural phenomena that are not yet fully understood. For example, the metal spheres could be the result of extreme geological processes rather than alien technology. The question remains: are we prepared to find intelligent life?

**US Government Recovered at Least Nine UFOs, Former CIA Scientist Reveals**
A former CIA scientist, Dr. Hal Puthoff, revealed in a recent interview on the Joe Rogan podcast that the US government has recovered at least nine UFOs that have crashed on Earth. According to Puthoff, some of these objects are in perfect condition, while others are damaged. Many of these incidents occurred decades ago, but have been kept secret. This testimony is not new, but what makes it particularly striking is the level of detail and apparent credibility of the witness, who claims to have been directly involved or had privileged access to this information within the framework of highly classified programs. Puthoff's statements coincide with those of former intelligence officer David Grusch, who has already publicly stated that the US government has been running a reverse engineering program of non-human technology for years. The Global Access Office (OGA), a specialized division within the CIA's Science and Technology Directorate, has been responsible for the recovery operations, leading missions to recover the UFOs since at least 2003. Once the objects were recovered, they became government property, but in many cases were handed over to private contractors who collaborated secretly with US agencies. The goal of this transfer was to avoid the information entering official records, making it difficult for any attempt to demand transparency through laws like the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). By moving these materials to private hands, the government achieves absolute secrecy around the phenomenon, without even members of Congress having complete access to the details. This practice has sparked criticism even within the state apparatus. Some lawmakers have begun to demand greater clarity and are pushing for the declassification of information on unidentified aerial phenomena, especially if they include biological remains or objects that clearly were not made with terrestrial technology. Another point of contention revealed in this wave of testimonies is the existence of non-human biological remains recovered along with the star-shaped UFOs. According to David Grusch, these remains were stored along with the recovered technology, suggesting that the vehicles were crewed or controlled by intelligent beings that do not belong to our planet. These revelations have increased public and political pressure to investigate what is happening within intelligence and defense agencies. Senator Chuck Schumer and other lawmakers have proposed laws that would require agencies to disclose everything they know about unknown technology and to share any evidence of non-human life they have collected. However, the official response has been lukewarm. The Anomaly Resolution Office in All Domains (AARO), an entity created precisely to investigate this type of phenomenon, has stated that it has no conclusive evidence of alien technology or non-human biological remains. This contrast between the testimony of the whistleblowers and the official version has generated strong skepticism among the population, but also a renewed interest in the subject. What was once the exclusive domain of conspiracy theories and science fiction now seems to be taking a much more serious turn. While the government continues to keep silent or downplay the issue, leaks and testimonies continue to emerge. And if one thing is clear, it's that the truth, whatever it may be, is much closer to being known than ever before.

**UFO congressional hearing bombshells as ex-NASA boss shares possible UAP not investigated - Daily Star**
A congressional hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) was held on May 1, where experts shared evidence and concerns about the possibility of alien life. Key speakers included Luis Elizondo, a former Pentagon official, and Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist. They emphasized the need for a bigger role in investigating UAPs and other unexplained phenomena. Some bombshells from the meeting include: Luis Elizondo showing an unvetted photo of a UAP taken by a civilian pilot, Dr. Anna Brady-Estevez claiming that private sector firms are building new inventions based on alien systems, Mike Gold revealing uninvestigated photos of potential UAPs in NASA's archives, Dr. Eric Davis claiming that the US government has been operating a secret program recovering crashed UFOs since the 1950s, and retired US Navy rear admiral Tim Gallaudet blasting the US intelligence community for a 'disinformation' campaign in covering up alleged military sightings of UAPs. 'Do they report it to the FAA? Do they report it to NORAD? Maybe the air force? Once again, you would think this information would be important for somebody to look at,' Elizondo said. Dr. Brady-Estevez said, 'They were working on advanced energy. They were working on advanced communications. I funded companies working on what the entrepreneurs later described as UAP-adjacent or UAP-inspired technologies.' Mike Gold asked, 'Why are we not investigating this? It's certainly worth the effort to investigate and we're not doing it!' Dr. Davis said, 'we couldn't make it ourselves' after seeing some of the recovered materials. Gallaudet called on the White House to share the information with the public and noted that he had just received reports from Navy members who had seen UAPs.

**US Government Accused of Hiding Extraterrestrial Life and Technology for 80 Years**
A documentary film called 'The Age of Disclosure' has sparked controversy by claiming that the US government has been hiding the existence of extraterrestrial life and technology for 80 years. The film, directed by Dan Farah, features 34 high-ranking officials from the US military and intelligence community who claim to have seen or interacted with alien life. Luis Elizondo, a former high-ranking intelligence official, said, 'This is the most successful deception operation in American history, an 80-year lie and deception.' The film also reveals that the US government has been involved in a secret competition with China and Russia to reverse-engineer alien technology. Many participants claim that some high-ranking officials believe that the first country to unlock alien technology will have a decisive advantage in global competition. The documentary cites several high-profile witnesses, including former US government officials and a current US Secretary of State, Mark Rubio, who has called for the government to acknowledge the UFO issue. The film also discusses the 'Tic Tac' UFO incident, in which a mysterious object was seen moving at incredible speeds and performing impossible maneuvers. The documentary also reveals a secret 'UAP recovery program' that has been in operation for decades, aimed at recovering crashed alien spacecraft and biological remains. The US Congress held a hearing on the issue in 2023, and a former intelligence official testified that the government has indeed obtained 'non-human origin aircraft and biological remains.' The documentary has sparked a heated debate, with some critics arguing that it lacks sufficient evidence, while others see it as a credible and compelling argument for the existence of extraterrestrial life.

**Truth and Cooperation for Humanity's Future**
Extraterrestrial visitations have been documented, and evidence suggests that advanced civilizations have been visiting Earth, despite being shrouded in government secrecy. According to former President Eisenhower, these projects have grown beyond legal oversight and have not been checked by democratic institutions since the middle of the 20th century. The study of recovered crashed extraterrestrial vehicles has led to revolutionary developments in energy generation and propulsion technologies, inspired by visionaries like Nikola Tesla, which could potentially end poverty and environmental degradation, and power a world civilization with clean, limitless energy sources.

**Central Florida aviation experts provide insight after collision between plane, helicopter in DC**
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has recovered two black boxes from the plane and helicopter involved in a deadly collision near Washington D.C.'s Reagan National Airport. The investigation will use evidence such as air traffic control recordings, witness interviews, and aircraft altitudes to determine the cause of the crash. Dr. Michael McCormick, an associate professor of Air Traffic Management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said, 'This is a rare event, a tragic event, but it is a confluence of factors that go into something like this.' Former Republican congressman John Mica believes outdated aircraft control technology may have played a role in the crash, saying, 'We need to move to the next generation of technology.' The FAA says NextGen capabilities are active and expanding across the country, with a 2024 report touting $12.3 billion worth of benefits from about 20 NextGen capabilities.

**UFO Expert Dr. Steven Greer Claims Mysterious Drone Sightings are Part of a Staged Operation**
Dr. Steven Greer, a UFO expert, claims that recent sightings of mysterious drones in the US are part of a staged operation to make the public believe that an alien invasion is imminent. Greer believes that US weapons manufacturers have obtained extraterrestrial technology and are using it to create a false narrative about an alien threat. He predicts that the situation will escalate in the next 30 days. Other experts, such as Ross Coulthart, also predict that 2025 will be a significant year for UFO revelations. A Connecticut police officer, Robert Klein, claims to have had a close encounter with a UFO in April 2022, describing it as a 'perfect sphere' that hovered near his police car. Greer's claims are not supported by concrete evidence, and the true nature of the drone sightings remains unclear.
