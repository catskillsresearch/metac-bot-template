**9 top new movies to stream this week on Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu and more (June 3-9)**
Several new movies are arriving on streaming services this week, including 'Sinners', 'Predator: Killer of Killers', and 'The Alto Knights'. 'Sinners' is a horror-thriller that follows twin brothers who return to their hometown to open a juke joint, but things take a dark turn when a group of vampires arrive. The movie has received critical acclaim and is a must-watch. 'Predator: Killer of Killers' is an animated anthology movie that presents three 'Predator' stories unlike any seen before. 'The Alto Knights' is a crime drama starring Robert De Niro as two 1950s mob bosses, but the movie fails to build up steam and peters out. Other movies arriving this week include 'Presence', a supernatural thriller shot from the entity's perspective, and 'The Ballad of Wallis Island', a charming British comedy with a tender musical soul.
