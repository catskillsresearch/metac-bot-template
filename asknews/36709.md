**TPS for Afghans in US Set to Expire as Trump Administration Reverses Policy**
The Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Afghan immigrants in the US, which provides protection against deportation, is set to expire on July 12, according to plans by the Trump administration. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that it will end the TPS for Afghan citizens who have been granted this benefit, which allows them to obtain work permits and temporarily suspend their deportations. Over 8,000 Afghans have received TPS approval, according to federal statistics. The program was extended for Afghanistan last year and was set to expire this month, unless the Trump administration decided to extend it again. When the Biden administration extended the program in 2021, it cited the humanitarian crisis following the Taliban's takeover, including the collapse of the Afghan economy, human rights violations, and the threat of terrorist attacks by a local branch of the Islamic State. 'This government is returning the TPS to its original temporary purpose,' said Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, in a statement, considering that 'Afghanistan has improved its security situation, and the stabilization of its economy no longer prevents them from returning to their country of origin.' The TPS program for Afghanistan is separate from the 'special immigrant visas' issued to Afghans who worked with the US military during the 20-year war in that country, which ended in August 2021 with the Taliban's return to power. The Trump administration also plans to revoke the TPS for Venezuela, which applies to over 300,000 people, but a judge has blocked the measure in March. The White House is asking the Supreme Court to intervene.

**CBP One Parole Program Work Permits to be Revoked**
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced that the work permit for beneficiaries of the CBP One parole program will be revoked starting May 13, 2025. This affects individuals who entered the country under this program and do not have another valid immigration status or work permit. According to a notification sent by the DHS and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), those who only have a work permit based on the parole received at the border and did not provide evidence of an alternative legal status, will have their work permit revoked. The notification states, 'Your employment authorization based on parole will be revoked on May 13, 2025, unless you present evidence that you continue to be in the United States under the parole granted in accordance with Section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.' The revocation of the work permit will leave many people in a vulnerable situation, as they will no longer be able to work legally in the US. Employers who continue to hire individuals without a valid immigration status may face significant penalties, including fines and loss of business licenses.

**US Revokes Romania's Visa Waiver Program Designation**
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced that Romania will no longer be part of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), which allows citizens of participating countries to travel to the US without a visa for business or tourism purposes. The decision was made in consultation with the US Department of State and is based on the Trump administration's focus on border security and immigration. According to the DHS, Romania could be reconsidered for the VWP in the future if it meets the legal eligibility criteria. DHS Under Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated, 'Maintaining high standards for the Visa Waiver Program is essential to our national security.' The decision to revoke Romania's designation in the VWP is effective immediately. The VWP allows citizens of participating countries to travel to the US for up to 90 days without a visa, but they must still obtain an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) prior to their trip. The ESTA determines the visitor's eligibility to enter the US.

**US Announces Review of Visas Issued in 2025: What You Need to Know**
The US authorities have announced that they will review all visas issued in 2025, which could affect millions of foreign travelers. The visa is a document that allows legal access to the United States, and its issuance also permits some citizens to participate in academic exchange programs, work experiences, or business connections. According to the US immigration law, the visa can be revoked for various reasons, including: traveling with weapons, explosives, or drugs; not declaring sums of money over $10,000; claiming to be a US citizen without being one; lending the visa to another person to enter the US; or using a tourist visa for profitable purposes such as working or buying merchandise to resell in Mexico. The US embassy has stated that having a visa does not guarantee automatic entry into the US, as authorities have the power to re-examine the applicant's history. The Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security can revoke visas if the user has not demonstrated good behavior or is involved in factors such as: committing immigration offenses; having a criminal record; or making inappropriate posts on social media. 'The issuance of a visa does not guarantee entry into the US,' said the US embassy. 'We will review all visas issued in 2025 to ensure that they meet the necessary requirements.'

**U.S. Citizen Receives DHS Notification to Leave Country**
Adam Peña, a California-born and -raised lawyer, received a notification from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asking him to leave the United States, despite being a U.S. citizen. Peña, who has dedicated his career to defending vulnerable communities, including immigrants and Latino workers, was confused and distraught by the request, saying, 'I don't have anywhere to go. This is my country.' The DHS notification was sent through the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), a department that handles international students, but Peña has no connection to the program and has never applied for a student visa. The Constitution protects the right of all citizens to remain in the country, but errors in federal databases and administrative mistakes have led to similar cases where U.S. citizens have received incorrect notifications. Peña's colleagues and civil rights organizations have expressed support and concern for the precedent set by this case, and he has filed a formal complaint with the DHS and is considering taking legal action.

**DHS terminates Temporary Protected Status for 9,000 from Afghanistan living in  U.S. - UPI.com**
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has terminated the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Afghanistan, affecting over 9,000 nationals residing in the US. Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the program will expire on May 20 and be eliminated on July 12, citing that the conditions in Afghanistan no longer meet the requirements for a TPS designation. Noem stated, 'This administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent.' Refugee rights groups have blasted the decision, saying it is 'rooted in politics' and will 'tear families apart, destabilize them, and shred what's left of our moral credibility.' The groups plan to fight the decision in the courts, Congress, and the public square. This move aligns with the Trump administration's efforts to root out fraud in the immigration system, according to Noem. However, the decision has been met with criticism, with some arguing that Afghanistan remains under the control of the Taliban and that there is no functioning asylum system.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced that it will revoke the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghan nationals living in the United States, citing improved conditions in the country. According to DHS Secretary Noem, 'We've reviewed the conditions in Afghanistan with our interagency partners, and they do not meet the requirements for a TPS designation.' The TPS designation will expire on May 20, and the termination will go into effect starting July 12. Noem added that Afghanistan's security situation has improved and the economy is stabilizing, making it 'no longer' preventing Afghan nationals from 'returning to their home country.' However, an immigrant advocacy group, CASA Inc., has filed a lawsuit against the DHS and the Trump administration, arguing that the way in which the termination was handled is improper.

**Harvard provides information about international students to US authorities**
Harvard University has provided information to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) about the criminal activity and disciplinary records of overseas students, as requested in a letter threatening to revoke Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification. University Executive Vice President Meredith L. Weenick said that Harvard had replied to the DHS' request 'to provide information required by law,' but declined to clarify which documents had been supplied. The DHS had given Harvard until Wednesday to respond to the demands, and Weenick wrote that Harvard 'reiterated our steadfast commitment to sponsor the visas that facilitate our international students' study' and 'made clear' that it does not intend to withdraw from SEVP. However, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had previously announced the cancellation of two DHS grants totaling over $2.7 million to Harvard University, and threatened to revoke Harvard's SEVP certification unless comprehensive information on the violent and unlawful actions of foreign student visa holders was submitted by April 30, 2025.

**Harvard Faces Ultimatum Over Foreign Student Records**
The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Kristi Noem, has given Harvard University until the end of April to comply with a demand for detailed records of the 'illegal and violent activities' of its foreign student body. Noem threatened to revoke the university's certification of the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) if the records are not provided. According to a DHS press release, Noem 'wrote a scathing letter demanding detailed records of the illegal and violent activities of foreign student visa holders at Harvard'; if the university does not comply by April 30, 2025, it will be stripped of its ability to admit international students. Noem stated that this measure is taken due to the existence of 'agitators and professors at Harvard with foreign visas who have launched anti-Semitic hate against Jewish students.' She added that 'Harvard's arrogance in the face of anti-Semitism, fueled by its weak leadership, feeds a black hole of extremist disturbances and threatens our national security. With anti-American and pro-Hamas ideology contaminating its campus and classrooms, Harvard's position as a top-tier institution of higher education is a distant memory. The United States demands more from universities that rely on taxpayer dollars.' Noem issued an ultimatum that must be met by the end of April; if Harvard does not verify that it is fully complying with its information requirements, the university will lose the right to enroll international students. It is worth noting that over 6,700 students at Harvard are international, representing 27.2% of its enrollment in the 2024-25 academic year.

**Harvard Faces Threat of Losing International Student Certification**
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has formally notified Harvard University that it may lose its certification to enroll international students if it does not comply with a request to provide detailed information about alleged 'illegal and violent activities' committed by foreign students during recent protests on campus. The university has been asked to submit a report by April 30, and if it fails to comply, the government threatens to revoke its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), which would effectively prevent Harvard from issuing essential documents for international students' visas. Currently, 27.2% of Harvard's students are international, totaling 6,793 students, according to data from the 2024-2025 academic year. The move is part of a broader escalation by the Trump administration against institutions of higher education accused of promoting a 'hostile' environment for Jewish students. The DHS has also announced the cancellation of two federal grants worth $2.7 million. The letter sent by Noem accuses Harvard of negligence in the face of anti-Semitic acts and demands information about students with visas who allegedly threatened classmates, disrupted the academic environment, or participated in violent protests. According to The Harvard Crimson, the measure is based on the assessment that 'attending Harvard is a privilege, not a guaranteed right.' Harvard responded that it will not give up its institutional independence or constitutional rights. 'We will continue to comply with the law and hope that the Administration will do the same,' says a excerpt from the official note, which also reiterates the demand that any eventual sanction follow legal procedures. The action occurs in the midst of a broader campaign by the Trump administration to reconfigure university policies in the US. Besides Harvard, other institutions have been pressured to eliminate diversity programs, ban the use of masks in protests, and adopt more restrictive admission criteria based solely on academic merit.

**Noem threatens Harvard's ability to enroll international students**

Noem ordered the university to submit records by April 30, or face the 'immediate loss of Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification.' Harvard spokesperson Jason Newton stated that the university will continue to comply with the law and stand by its independence, despite the Trump administration's recent punitive actions. International students make up roughly 27 percent of Harvard's total enrollment. This is the latest broadside from the Trump administration against the Ivy League school, following the revocation of two department grants worth over $2.7 million and the canceling of $2.2 billion of the institution's federal funding.

**DHS threatens to revoke Harvard's eligibility to host foreign students amid broader battle over universities' autonomy**
The Trump administration has threatened to revoke Harvard University's eligibility to host international students after the school refused to make policy changes demanded by the White House. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent a 'scathing letter' to Harvard, demanding detailed records on foreign student visa holders' 'illegal and violent activities' by April 30, 2025, or face immediate loss of Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification. Harvard has stood by its previous statement that it 'will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.' The university has been at odds with the administration over issues such as diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and the power of faculty and administrators. The Trump administration has also moved to revoke the visas of hundreds of students, faculty, and researchers at dozens of US universities and colleges. Harvard's 6,793 international students comprise 27.2% of its enrollment, and it is unclear how many would be directly affected by the loss of SEVP certification.

US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has threatened to revoke Harvard University's ability to host international students if it does not provide detailed records on some international students.

Harvard has 6,793 international students, making up 27.2% of its enrollment for the 2024-25 academic year. This move comes after the Trump administration withdrew $2.2 billion in federal funding from Harvard and threatened to remove its tax-exempt status.

**Harvard University Faces Threats Over Palestinian Solidarity Protests**
US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has threatened to revoke Harvard University's ability to accept international students if they do not comply with a request to provide detailed records of international students' involvement in 'unlawful and violent activities'. The university has been given 30 April 2025 to comply with the request, or risk having its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification revoked. This certification allows universities to issue visa application documents to international students. Harvard University has a total of 6,793 international students, making up 27.2% of the total student body. The university has stated that it will not compromise its independence and will not abandon its constitutional rights. Noem's threat comes after the university refused to comply with Trump administration's demands to implement certain policies, including a ban on Palestinian solidarity protests.
