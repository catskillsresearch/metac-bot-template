**Ibex 35 Index Trades Flat, German Economy Shows Growth**
The Ibex 35 index traded flat at midday on Friday, with a minimal 0.01% increase, reaching 14,273.6 points. The market is in a transitional phase, with investors focusing on US debt and trade negotiations. The Spanish stock market started the day with a rise, but later deflated and returned to yesterday's closing levels. The German economy's GDP grew 0.4% in the first three months of 2025, compared to a 0.2% contraction in the fourth quarter of 2024. In Japan, inflation rose to 3.5% in April, the highest since January 2023, which could support a more hawkish Bank of Japan. The US Supreme Court has accepted the Trump administration's request to fire members of independent federal agencies, but this decision does not apply to the Federal Reserve or its chairman, Jerome Powell. The European Central Bank members, Philip Lane and Isabel Schnabel, will make statements that will be closely watched by investors. In the Spanish business sector, OHLA's new shares, worth 50 million euros, began trading on the stock market on Friday, after being admitted to the Madrid and Barcelona stock exchanges yesterday.

**Ibex 35 Poised for Record High as Week Closes on a Positive Note**
European stock futures are indicating a bullish opening to end a week with a positive balance. As a result, the Ibex 35 is expected to close at a record high, despite disappointing European PMIs and concerns over US debt following Donald Trump's fiscal plan and Moody's downgrade of the US credit rating, which has led to increased bond yields. According to the article, 'despite these concerns, the Ibex 35 is poised to reach new heights.'

**Ibex 35 Faces Resistance at 14,500-14,600 Points**
The positive tone in the US stock market after the approval of Donald Trump's fiscal plan has spread to other global markets. However, the Ibex 35 index is facing resistance at 14,500-14,600 points, which is the upper limit of the bullish trend channel since 2022. According to Joan Cabrero, technical analyst and strategist at Ecotrader, 'the top of a channel is a zone where overbuying is very high from a technical point of view.' Cabrero advises waiting for a partial correction of the recent rally before buying the European market. He believes that a potential fall has low chances of going below 4,545 points, which is the trend stop. 'I doubt that Europe will correct in a significant way without first reaching the highs of the year,' Cabrero said.

**Ibex 35 Opens Largest Annual Return Gap Against Wall Street Since 1996**
The Ibex 35 has been one of the top-performing indices globally in 2025, with a 20% increase since Donald Trump announced a trade truce. This has led to a historic gap between the Ibex and other major references in Europe and the US. 'Spain is succeeding, not only because of the Ibex 35's strong performance, but also because the growth forecast for 2025 and 2026 has been revised upwards, with Spain being the only European power to grow above 2%,' says Juan José del Valle, analyst at Activotrade SV. The European Commission estimates that Spain's GDP will expand by 2.6% this year, significantly above the eurozone and EU averages. José Manuel Marín Cebrián, economist and founder of Fortuna SFP, notes that the Ibex is taking advantage of the favorable wind and moving with a firm step, driven by cyclical sectors such as banking, energy, and tourism. The Ibex has accumulated 12 sessions of gains in the last 13 sessions it has traded.

**Ibex 35 Closes Week with Positive Gain Amid US Trade War Tensions**
The Ibex 35 index closed the week with a positive gain of 0.2%, despite a 1.18% drop in the session. The index was affected by the banking sector, with BBVA, CaixaBank, and Santander experiencing losses of 3.03%, 2.61%, and 1.47%, respectively. However, nine stocks ended the day in the 'green', including Indra, Enagás, and Iberdrola. The move comes after US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 50% tariff on EU products, citing a lack of progress in trade negotiations. Trump accused the EU of exploiting the US in the commercial sphere and generating an 'unacceptable' trade deficit. Analyst Manuel Pinto noted that the move is part of a week in which debt markets have been the 'main protagonists', with the US trade war and concerns over the country's growing deficit eroding the attractiveness of the world's largest market, driving up bond yields. Pinto warned of potential consequences, including 'strong increases' in mortgages, credit card loans, and car loans.

**Ibex 35 Plummets 2.5% as Trump Threatens 50% Tariff on EU Products**
The Ibex 35 index plummeted 2.5% to 13,920.4 points by 14:00 hours, following a calm session, after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on EU products starting June 1. The Spanish banking sector was the most affected, with CaixaBank, Banco Sabadell, BBVA, Unicaja, Bankinter, and Banco Santander experiencing losses of 4.56%, 4.43%, 4.35%, 4.24%, 3.75%, and 3.4%, respectively. Inditex, the largest listed company in the stock exchange, also fell 3.32%. Trump announced on Truth Social, 'Our conversations with them are not bearing fruit! Therefore, I recommend a direct tariff of 50% for the European Union starting June 1, 2025.' He accused the EU of creating barriers to trade, including high taxes, corporate sanctions, and manipulation of the currency, which have led to an 'unacceptable' trade deficit with the US.

**Ibex 35 Falls 0.11% but Maintains 14,300 Points**
The Ibex 35 index closed at 14,307.6 points, down 0.11% on Tuesday. However, the company's shares, such as PharmaMar, saw a 9.4% increase at 11:30 am, reaching a price of 91.95 euros per unit. Despite this, the value later relaxed to a 4% increase. In macroeconomic news, the UK's inflation rate for April was 3.5%, significantly higher than the 2.6% increase in March, mainly due to the sharp rise in the cost of household supplies. The top gainers in the Ibex 35 were Grifols, Indra, Enagás, Bankinter, Puig, Unicaja, Telefónica, while the biggest losers were Solaria, ACS, Banco Sabadell, IAG, Cellnex, Acerinox. In international markets, the Brent oil price fell to $65.22, down 0.24%, while the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reached $61.87, down 0.27%. The Spanish 10-year bond yield rose to 3.264%, from 3.220% at the close of Tuesday, with the risk premium over German debt at 61.8 basis points. The euro appreciated 0.60% against the dollar, reaching $1.1351 per euro at the close of the European session.

**Mixed Session for European Indices Amid US Deficit Concerns**
European stock indices had a mixed session, with concerns over whether the US will be able to curb its large deficit, which threatens its status as a global safe haven. The Ibex 35 closed with a 0.1% decline, the DAX 40 was the top performer in Europe, rising 0.4%, and the Euro Stoxx 50 remained flat. In the US, House Speaker Mike Johnson said that the Republican Party has reached an agreement to increase the state and local tax deduction to $40,000, which suggests a resolution to one of the last issues holding up President Donald Trump's economic bill. On trade agreements, it is expected that the EU will share a revised commercial proposal with the US. In the UK, inflation rose more than expected to its highest rate in over a year, with increases in energy, water, and other product prices pushing inflation to 3.5% in April, up from 2.6% the previous month. This has led investors to cut bets on interest rate cuts by the Bank of England. Palo Alto Networks, a company that provides online security solutions for networks, has published disappointing outlooks for its infrastructure software, expecting a next-generation security ARR of $5.545 million for the quarter, below the consensus of $5.570 million. Meanwhile, it has been revealed that UnitedHealth was paying secret bonuses to nursing homes to reduce hospital transfers.

**Ibex 35 Reaches Record High, Driven by Optimism in Asian Markets**
The Ibex 35 index has closed at a record high of 14,323.4 points, a 1.59% increase, driven by the optimism in the Asian markets after China's announcement of a 10-point reduction in interest rates. This is the highest level since January 2008, following a nine-session winning streak. The Spanish stock market is leading the European markets with a 23.53% increase in 2025, followed by Frankfurt and Milan. The top performers in the Ibex 35 were Solaria (+4.89%) and Indra (+4.72%). The banks, including CaixaBank, have also seen significant gains, while Inditex and Puig have seen losses. The European markets have also seen gains, with Frankfurt, Paris, Milan, and London up 0.42%, 0.75%, 0.89%, and 0.94%, respectively. The Wall Street indices have seen slight declines. Analysts from Renta 4 have noted that the upcoming meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors may yield significant announcements, particularly regarding currency markets. The negotiations for a ceasefire in Ukraine are ongoing, with experts indicating that the positions of Russia and Ukraine are 'very far apart'.

**Ibex 35 Reactivates Upswing as Wall Street Closes on a High Note**
The Ibex 35 has started the week on a positive note, driven by the closure of Wall Street on a high note on Friday and the exemption from tariffs applied to the technology sector. The dollar has put a brake on its falls, and the Ibex is heading towards levels close to 12,500 points. The revaluation of 1.8% achieved by the S&P 500 last Friday has given investors more confidence. Wall Street has opted for rises at the start of its earnings season. The US Federal Reserve has also shown a willingness to intervene if the effects of the commercial war require an emergency response. Donald Trump's commercial offensive includes an additional truce, with the exemption from tariffs on electronic devices now being applied. This exemption will be temporary, according to Trump, but opens the door to significant rises in sensitive values such as Apple, whose actions have risen by up to 7% in Wall Street futures. In Japan, the Nikkei index has also benefited from this exemption, with advances of 1.5%.

**Ibex 35 and European Stock Exchanges Recover Positions Amid Trade War Uncertainty**
The Ibex 35 and major European stock exchanges have started the day of April 8, 2025 with a notable recovery, leaving behind recent falls and retaking positions upwards. This optimism is supported by the strong impulse of Wall Street futures, which record rises above 1.5%. The recovery comes after weeks of high volatility caused by the trade war between the US and China. The IBEX 35, which closed yesterday with a 5.12% drop, is trying to recover the 12,000-point level after touching unseen lows since the beginning of the year. Analysts suggest maintaining a defensive strategy, as the market is digesting the consequences of the new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and China's reciprocal response. The Spanish index has been one of the most affected recently due to its strong exposure to cyclical sectors such as banking, infrastructure, and energy. However, some analysts consider that the recent falls could open up buying opportunities in certain stocks. According to recent estimates, nearly a third of the companies in the index have a bullish potential above 20% for the next 12 months, including names like Iberdrola and Cellnex, which benefit from their focus on defensive sectors.

**Ibex 35 Closes First Quarter with 13.29% Increase Amid US Tariff Tensions**
The Ibex 35 index closed the first quarter of 2025 with a 13.29% increase, reaching 13,135.4 points. However, the session on Monday caused a 1.31% drop due to the tension caused by the US tariffs led by President Donald Trump. The index had reached a high of over 13,500 points earlier in the month, marking a new record since 2008. Analysts from Renta 4 have highlighted that the upcoming announcement of the tariffs on April 2nd, which they call the 'Day of Liberation' in the US, will be a critical moment for the markets. Trump has already announced a 25% tariff on non-US made cars and has threatened to impose secondary tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil if President Vladimir Putin does not support a ceasefire in Ukraine. The president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has stated that the change in relationship with the US under Trump's presidency is a 'moment of existential' for Europe, which should take control of its destiny and move towards independence. 'He calls it the 'Day of Liberation' in the US, but I consider it a moment where we should decide together to take a better control of our destiny and I believe it's a step towards independence,' she said in an interview with France Inter Radio. The best performing stocks in the Ibex 35 index have been Indra (+56.44%) and the six banking stocks (Santander, Sabadell, CaixaBank, Bankinter, Unicaja, and BBVA) with returns ranging from 30% to 38% so far this year. The worst performing stocks have been Rovi (-18.19%), IAG (-14%), Solaria (-12%), Puig (-11.75%), and Grifols (-10.38%).

**Ibex 35 Falls Short of Expectations, Closing Week with 0.3% Decline**
The Ibex 35 index closed the week with a 0.3% decline, despite initial expectations of a gain. The index fell 0.8% on Friday, which was the key factor in its weekly decline. The energy sector, led by Acciona Energías Renovables, Endesa, Acciona, and Iberdrola, attempted to lift the index, but ultimately failed. According to Renta 4, investors are currently focused on several key events, including Trump's trade policy and the negotiations for peace in Ukraine. As explained by Renta 4's analysts, 'President Xi Jinping has met with 40 global business leaders from the US, Europe, Japan, and South Korea to attract investments to China, aiming to counter the negative impact of US tariffs and China's economic slowdown, which has led to a 30-year low in foreign direct investment in China in 2024.' Meanwhile, gold has reached new highs (3,085 USD/oz), with a 17% increase in 2025, following a 27% rise in 2024. Other European markets, such as the DAX40 and CAC40, also experienced declines, with the FTSE100 remaining relatively stable.

**Ibex 35 Closes February at Highest Level Since 2008**
The Ibex 35 index has ended February at its highest level since June 2008, reaching 11,347.3 points, with a 15.11% increase since the start of 2025. The index has risen 3.05% in the week and 7.91% in the month, driven by the presentation of company results and despite the threats of tariffs by US President Donald Trump to Mexico, Canada, China, and Europe. Manuel Pinto, an analyst at XTB, notes that the Ibex 35 has led the advances of the main global indices. He highlights the rise of Grifols, which has improved two key indicators, as mentioned in the Gotham report in January 2024, such as the reduction of its leverage ratio and the increase in its cash flow. Indra and IAG have also risen strongly, driven by their sales and projects, and the expected increase in European defense spending. However, Puig has fallen in the stock market due to its disappointing forecasts for 2025, as well as Telefónica, which is concerned about the 'poor cash generation' expected in the coming months. Trump's tariffs have weighed on the market in recent days, with the S&P 500 falling almost 3% this month due to the threats of tariffs and the possibility of a 'global commercial war'.

**IBEX 35 Closes Thursday with 0.29% Increase, Led by Repsol and Naturgy**
