**UK Announces Nuclear Submarine and Ammunition Factory Plans in Response to 'Russian Threat'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive rearmament plan for the UK, including the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and six new ammunition factories. The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate £15 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional £6 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.

**UK Announces Construction of 12 New Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarines 'A Message to Moscow'**
The UK has announced the construction of 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines as part of its Defense Review, which Prime Minister Starmer said will give the British army more power against hostile states like Russia and China. According to Starmer, 'The threat is more serious, more immediate, more unpredictable than ever since the Cold War.' The new defense strategy is 'a message to Moscow,' said Defense Minister John Healey, referring to the 'growing' threat posed by Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Starmer has also committed to building at least six new ammunition factories in the UK, creating a hybrid Royal Navy combining drones with warships, submarines, and aircraft, improving living conditions and equipment for military personnel, and investing £15 billion in a nuclear program. The UK is preparing for war at a 'war footing' because Russia is showing it does not want peace, and the best way to deter aggressors is to be ready. Starmer has promised to create a stronger and fully trained reserve, strengthen NATO by making the largest contribution to the alliance since its creation, and invest in innovation. The UK's defense spending will increase to 2.5% by 2027 and 3% by 2030.

**UK to Build New Attack Submarines and Boost Nuclear Arsenal Amid Russian Threat**
The UK's Labour leader has outlined a plan to make the country a 'war-ready' nation, equipped for 'decades to come', in the face of the Russian threat. 'The threat we face today is more grave, more immediate, and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,' he said. He added, 'We are facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyberattacks, and an increasing Russian aggression in our waters, which also threatens our airspace.' Key measures include the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered submarines armed with conventional weapons, as part of the Aukus military alliance with the US and Australia. These new submarines will replace the current UK fleet by the end of the 2030s, which currently consists of seven such vessels.

**UK to build up to 12 new attack submarines**
The UK will build 'up to' 12 new attack submarines to replace the Astute class from the late 2030s onwards, according to the prime minister's announcement. The new submarines will be conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered, and will keep 'Britain and Nato safe for decades', as stated by Sir Keir. The government will also spend £15bn on its nuclear warhead program and commit to increasing UK defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027. The review will make 62 recommendations, which the government is expected to accept in full. The Labour party has committed to increasing defence spending to 3% of national income by 2034, but the Conservatives say this should be met by the end of the decade. The review will also include other announcements, such as £1.5bn to build six new factories for 'always on' munitions production capacity, building up to 7,000 long-range weapons, and setting up a 'cyber and electromagnetic command' to boost the military's defensive and offensive capabilities in cyberspace.

**New twist in Russia-Ukraine war as Britain asks for US nuclear-capable fighter jets to..., Starmer govt accuses Putin of...**
The UK is reportedly in talks with the US to acquire a fleet of nuclear-capable fighter jets to enhance its nuclear deterrence against Russia. According to reports, the UK plans to equip US-made fighter jets with nuclear missiles, which could be the largest expansion in UK's nuclear deterrence capabilities. The move has the support of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who believes the world faces its worst nuclear threat since the Cold War era. The UK currently lacks the capability to launch nuclear strikes from the air, but acquiring the US-made F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter jets would allow it to do so. The deal would also enable the UK to launch nuclear strikes from air, vastly enhancing its deterrence capabilities. Additionally, the Starmer government plans to manufacture 7,000 long-range weapons and increase its defense spending to 3% of the country's GDP by 2034.

**One Wrong Decision and Everything Turns to Dust**
The world is on the brink of disaster due to the threat of nuclear war. The Doomsday Clock is fast approaching midnight, and the major powers are keeping their nuclear programs closely guarded. The US has 5,044 nuclear warheads, including 400 Minutemen III ICBMs, while Russia has developed a large and diverse nuclear arsenal, including the RS-28 Sarmat or Satan II ICBM, which can launch a maximum payload with a yield of roughly 50 megatons of TNT. Annie Jacobsen describes the effects of a 1-megaton thermonuclear weapon detonation, which would be 'impossible for the human mind to comprehend.' The decision to use nuclear weapons is in the hands of a few people, and the consequences of such a decision would be catastrophic. The article references the heroism of Stanislav Petrov, who prevented a nuclear war in 1983 by deciding that a false alarm was not a real attack. The article concludes that as long as we have states, we will have state coercion, which leads to the threats we're facing now.

**China Accelerates Nuclear Development: Arsenal Approaching 1,000 Warheads**
According to a recent report by the Federation of American Scientists, China currently possesses around 600 nuclear warheads, with many more in production. The study highlights that China is developing its nuclear arsenal at the fastest rate among the nine nuclear-armed states, despite having signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The report, published by the Nuclear Information Project, reveals that since May 2024, China has continued to develop three new missile silo fields for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with solid fuel, as well as proceeding with the construction of new silos for its ICBMs DF-5 with liquid fuel. China is also advancing the development of new ICBM variants and advanced strategic launch systems. The report suggests that Beijing has produced excess warheads for these systems, ready to be used once the launchers are operational. The study also notes the Pentagon's projections, which indicate that China's arsenal will surpass 1,000 warheads by 2030. The 2024 report presented to the US Congress by the Department of Defense revealed that China could have around 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. However, the Nuclear Notebook notes that the growth of the arsenal will depend on China's stockpiles of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and tritium. In 2023, the International Panel on Fissile Materials estimated that China possessed approximately 14 tons of HEU and around 2.9 tons of separated plutonium available for nuclear weapons.

**China's Nuclear Ambitions: Aiming for 1,000 Warheads by 2030**
China is rapidly increasing its nuclear arsenal, aiming to reach 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030, according to a new study. The country is investing heavily in nuclear weapons, the pinnacle of mass destruction systems, to surpass the United States and become a global superpower. China currently has 600 nuclear warheads and is producing more without pause. The goal is to increase its military deterrence and become a major player in the international order. Analysts note that China's nuclear program will continue to intensify to reach its target, with no end in sight. This development is a cause for concern, as it may lead to increased international tensions, particularly with Russia's recent withdrawal from strategic agreements on nuclear production and use. As one analyst noted, 'The mere presence of nuclear weapons is relevant, regardless of their size or lethality.'

**North Korea could have more nuclear weapons than the UK by 2035**
Analysts have warned that North Korea could have more nuclear warheads than the UK by 2035, thanks to Russian assistance. Ankit Panda, an expert on North Korea's nuclear development, said that with Russian help, North Korea's arsenal of 50 nuclear warheads could rise to 300 in a decade. This would surpass the UK's estimated 225 nuclear warheads. Panda also stated that North Korea may already have the ability to detonate a warhead over an American city. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Director General, Rafael Grossi, accused North Korea of violating UN resolutions by continuing to develop nuclear weapons. Grossi also expressed concern over Iran's increased stockpile of 60% U-235, an isotope often used in nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, experts warned that Europe would need to dramatically increase its nuclear weapons stockpile should the US withdraw from NATO and cease to provide security guarantees to the continent.

**US Nuclear Arsenal: A Legacy of Toxic Waste and a Growing Risk of Accidental War**
For 40 years, the United States produced four nuclear bombs per day, leaving a vast legacy of toxic radioactive waste. The plants in South Carolina, Washington, Ohio, and Idaho that helped produce the 60,000 atomic bombs have tons of waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years. The production of plutonium and bombs stopped in 1989, but with technological improvements, the country plans to reach a production capacity of at least 80 plutonium cores per year by the mid-2030s. Dr. Carlos Umaña, co-president of the International Association of Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, warns that a large-scale nuclear war would not only be quick but also extremely destructive: 'According to the Federation of American Scientists, there are currently 12,000 nuclear warheads in the world, of which 2,000 are at maximum alert, ready to be detonated in just 60 seconds,' he said. Umaña also explains that the detonation of these types of arms in the context of a large-scale nuclear war could destroy the planet in just 72 minutes. Umaña also highlights the risk of cyberattacks or human errors that could trigger a nuclear explosion accidentally, 'As technology advances, so does the risk of cyberterrorism and human error,' he said.

**'Nuclear carbon emission bomb': 2b tonne greenhouse gas surge forecast under Coalition**
According to new modelling by the Climate Change Authority, Australia's greenhouse gas emissions would surge by more than 2 billion tonnes under the Coalition's plan for nuclear energy. This would lead to Australia missing its 2030 climate target and struggling to reach the bipartisan pledge for net zero emissions by 2050. Climate Change Authority chairman Matt Kean described the results as a 'nuclear carbon emission bomb' due to the extended use of fossil fuels while waiting for nuclear power. The modelling highlights the cost of running coal-fired power stations for years longer than expected. The Coalition's plan to build seven nuclear power stations at a cost of about $331 billion by 2050 has been disputed by the findings.

**Towards a WW III Scenario. The Privatization of Nuclear War. - LewRockwell**
The world is closer than ever to a nuclear holocaust, with the US nuclear weapons program set to increase to 2 trillion dollars by 2030. The doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) has been scrapped, and 'offensive' military actions using nuclear warheads are now described as acts of 'self-defense'. The development of tactical nuclear weapons, also known as 'mini-nukes', has been accelerated, with the goal of making nuclear war more 'usable'. The privatization of nuclear war has led to corporations having a direct voice in setting the agenda regarding the use and deployment of nuclear weapons. The US public is not aware that the Truman administration had a secret plan to bomb 66 Soviet cities with 204 atomic bombs in 1945, and those who speak out against the use of nuclear weapons are branded as 'conspiracy theorists'.
