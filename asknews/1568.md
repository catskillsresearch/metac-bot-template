**James Webb Space Telescope Reveals Secrets of the Exoplanet WASP-121b**
The James Webb Space Telescope has revealed new information about the origin of the exoplanet WASP-121b and the mysterious disk of gas and dust surrounding its star. The key lies in two surprising molecules found in its atmosphere: methane and silicon monoxide. According to EFE, this revelation is the main conclusion of two international studies led by astronomers from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) in Heidelberg, Germany. Thomas Evans-Soma and Cyril Gapp are the authors of the details published in the prestigious journals Nature Astronomy and The Astronomical Journal. The team identified essential molecules: water vapor, carbon monoxide, and silicon monoxide. With these data, they created an inventory of carbon, oxygen, and silicon in the exoplanet. WASP-121b is a gas giant that orbits perilously close to its star, completing a rotation in just 30.5 hours. Its thermal duality is astonishing: a daytime hemisphere where temperatures exceed 3000°C, and a perpetual night side where they drop to a 'cool' 1500°C. The scientists investigate the abundance of compounds that evaporate at different temperatures, providing crucial clues about the formation and evolution of the planet. They conclude that WASP-121b accumulated most of its gas in a cold region, where water remains frozen, but methane evaporates. These conditions occur in protoplanetary disks, where stellar radiation creates the ideal temperatures. In our own solar system, this region is located between the orbits of Jupiter and Uranus. A notable detail, as WASP-121b now orbits very close to its star, suggesting a long journey from the cold outskirts to the heart of the system. The detection of silicon in the form of silicon monoxide indicates a contribution of rocky material during planetary formation. Planets are born from frozen dust particles that grow, attract gas, and become the 'seeds' of worlds like WASP-121b. The study suggests that the forming planet cleared its distant orbit of 'solid boulders' rich in frozen water, preventing them from arriving. The presence of methane is the great surprise. At the extremely high daytime temperatures of WASP-121b, methane is unstable and, therefore, undetectable. It is expected that the gas from the daytime hemisphere would mix with that of the night side, which is colder. In this scenario, the abundance of methane should be insignificant on both sides. Therefore, finding abundant methane on the night side of WASP-121b is an unexpected turn. The team proposes a mechanism: the methane gas must be replenished rapidly on the night side. This occurs through strong vertical currents that lift methane from lower atmospheric layers, rich in this compound due to the cold night temperatures and the high proportion of carbon and oxygen in the atmosphere. 'This challenges dynamic models of exoplanets,' acknowledges Thomas Evans-Soma, researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and co-author of the studies. The models, now, must adapt to reproduce the intense vertical mixing discovered on the night side of WASP-121b.

**James Webb Space Telescope Reveals Origin of Ultra-Hot Exoplanet WASP-121b**
The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered new data that could indicate how the ultra-hot exoplanet WASP-121b formed and how the gas and dust disk around its star emerged. The key lies in molecules found in its atmosphere: methane and silicon monoxide. According to Thomas Evans-Soma and Cyril Gapp, astronomers from the Max Planck Institute of Astronomy, the presence of these molecules suggests that the planet accumulated most of its gas in a region cool enough for water to remain frozen, but warm enough for methane to evaporate and exist in a gaseous form. The study suggests that the planet in formation had cleared its distant orbit of solid rocks, which stored water in the form of ice, preventing other rocks from reaching the planet. As the temperature of an atmosphere changes, the amounts of different molecules, such as methane and carbon monoxide, are expected to vary. At the ultra-high temperatures of WASP-121b's daytime side, methane is very unstable and not present in detectable quantities. Evans-Soma notes, 'This challenges dynamic models of exoplanets, which will likely have to adapt to reproduce the strong vertical mixing we've discovered in the nighttime side of WASP-121b.'

**James Webb Telescope Reveals Origin of Ultra-Hot Exoplanet WASP-121b**
A team of astronomers led by Thomas Evans-Soma and Cyril Gapp used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to study the exoplanet WASP-121b. They detected several key molecules, including water vapor, carbon monoxide, silicon monoxide, and methane, which helped them create an inventory of carbon, oxygen, and silicon in the planet's atmosphere. The presence of methane suggests the existence of strong vertical winds on the planet's night side, a phenomenon often overlooked in current models. The team found that WASP-121b accumulated most of its gas in a region cold enough to keep water frozen but warm enough to evaporate methane. This suggests that the planet formed far from its star and then migrated to its current extremely close orbit. 'The ratio of carbon, oxygen, and silicon tells us a lot about how this planet formed and how it acquired its materials,' says Evans-Soma. The team's findings challenge current models of atmospheric dynamics in exoplanets and suggest that WASP-121b's atmosphere is more complex than previously thought.

**Discovery of Potentially Habitable Exoplanet K2-18 b**
Scientists have discovered a potentially habitable exoplanet, K2-18 b, which orbits a small star 120 light-years from Earth. According to NASA, the exoplanet has a thick atmosphere rich in hydrogen, and a surface covered in oceans of water. The discovery was made using the James Webb Space Telescope, which detected the presence of methane and carbon dioxide in the exoplanet's atmosphere. The team also found a possible detection of a molecule called sulfuro de dimetilo (DMS), which is only produced by living organisms on Earth. 'Our findings highlight the importance of considering diverse habitable environments in the search for life beyond our planet,' said Nikku Madhusudhan, astronomer at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. 'Traditionally, the search for life in exoplanets has focused mainly on smaller rocky planets, but the larger Hycean worlds are much more conducive to atmospheric observations.' The team plans to conduct further research using the MIRI instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope to validate their findings and gain new insights into the conditions on K2-18 b.

**WASP-121b: A Planet with a Rich Atmosphere and a Possible Origin in the Outer Reaches of the Solar System**
Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have discovered that the exoplanet WASP-121b, located 858 light-years away, has a atmosphere rich in carbon and oxygen, suggesting that it formed in a region similar to the outer reaches of the Solar System. The team, led by Thomas Evans-Soma and Cyril Gapp, detected multiple key molecules, including water vapor, carbon monoxide, silicon monoxide, and methane, which provided clues about the planet's formation and evolution. The detection of methane also suggests strong vertical winds on the cooler, night side of the planet, a process often overlooked in current models. 'The temperatures of the day side are high enough for refractory materials (solid compounds resistant to intense heat) to exist as gaseous components of the planet's atmosphere,' explained Thomas Evans-Soma. The team concluded that WASP-121b likely accumulated most of its gas in a region cold enough for water to remain frozen, but warm enough for methane to evaporate and exist as a gas. This scenario suggests that the planet underwent a long journey from the outer reaches of the system to its current close orbit around its star.

**SiO and a super-stellar C/O ratio in the atmosphere of the giant exoplanet WASP-121 b - Nature Astronomy**
A team of researchers used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to study the atmosphere of the exoplanet WASP-121b. They analyzed the planet's emission spectra, which were obtained by observing the planet's brightness as it orbited its star. The researchers found that the planet's atmosphere is composed of a mixture of gases, including hydrogen, helium, and methane. They also detected the presence of clouds in the planet's atmosphere, which are thought to be composed of silicate particles. The researchers used five independent retrieval codes to analyze the data and found that the planet's atmosphere is consistent with a hot Jupiter atmosphere. The team's findings provide new insights into the composition and properties of exoplanet atmospheres and have implications for the search for life beyond our solar system. The researchers also noted that the planet's atmosphere is consistent with a high C/O ratio, which is a key factor in the formation of complex organic molecules. This suggests that the planet's atmosphere may be capable of supporting life. The team's results are consistent with previous studies of the planet's atmosphere, but provide new and more detailed information about its composition and properties.

**Space pebbles and rocks play pivotal role in giant planet's formation**
Scientists using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have made groundbreaking discoveries about the ultra-hot giant planet WASP-121b. They detected water, carbon monoxide, and silicon monoxide on the side of the planet facing its star, and methane on the 'nightside' atmosphere. The findings, published in Nature Astronomy, mark the first conclusive identification of silicon monoxide in any planetary atmosphere. The researchers believe that the planet's atmosphere was formed by absorbing lightweight gases from tiny space pebbles and being bombarded with large rocky objects. Dr. Anjali Piette commented, 'Detecting SiO in WASP-121b's atmosphere is groundbreaking -- the first conclusive identification of this molecule in any planetary atmosphere.' The measured atmospheric ratios suggest that the planet's atmosphere was enriched by inward-drifting pebbles and refractory material. Dr. Thomas Evans-Soma explained, 'Dayside temperatures are high enough for refractory materials to exist as gaseous components of the planet's atmosphere.' The successful use of JWST demonstrates the telescope's capabilities and sets a precedent for future exoplanet studies, according to Dr. Piette.

**Planet K2-18B: How a Hint of Alien Life Fizzled**
Astronomers detected a faint chemical signal from the exoplanet K2-18b, which sparked excitement about the possibility of alien life. Led by Nikku Madhusudhan from Cambridge University, the team used the James Webb Space Telescope to find what they believed could be dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the planet's atmosphere. DMS is primarily produced by ocean-dwelling microbes on Earth, and its presence on K2-18b could indicate life. However, the team was cautious, noting that the signal was not strong enough to be conclusive, with a 0.3% chance of being a statistical fluke. Despite this, the discovery reignited hope for finding life beyond Earth.

**An Extreme Drop in Oxygen Will Eventually Suffocate Most Life on Earth**
Scientists predict that Earth's atmosphere will eventually revert back to a state rich in methane and low in oxygen, similar to the planet's state before the Great Oxidation Event 2.4 billion years ago. This shift is expected to happen in about a billion years and will occur rapidly. According to environmental scientist Kazumi Ozaki, 'For many years, the lifespan of Earth's biosphere has been discussed based on scientific knowledge about the steadily brightening of the sun and global carbonate-silicate geochemical cycle.' The researchers say that atmospheric oxygen is unlikely to be a permanent feature of habitable worlds, which has implications for our efforts to detect signs of life further out in the Universe. 'The model projects that a deoxygenation of the atmosphere, with atmospheric O dropping sharply to levels reminiscent of the Archaean Earth, will most probably be triggered before the inception of moist greenhouse conditions in Earth's climate system and before the extensive loss of surface water from the atmosphere,' the team explained in their paper. This would be the end of the road for human beings and most other life forms that rely on oxygen to get through the day. 'The drop in oxygen is very, very extreme,' Earth scientist Chris Reinhard said. 'We're talking around a million times less oxygen than there is today.' The study suggests that we may need to be hunting for other biosignatures besides oxygen to have the best chance of spotting life on other planets.

**New Approach to Detecting Life in Space: Analyzing Chemical Reaction Networks**
Scientists have found a new way to distinguish between living and non-living matter in space by analyzing the networks of chemical reactions in a planet's atmosphere. This approach, developed by researchers such as Theresa Fisher, Estelle Ginin, and Sara Imari Walker, involves studying the complex web of chemical interactions, rather than just looking for individual 'biomarkers' like oxygen or methane. By analyzing the structure and dynamics of these networks, scientists can gain a better understanding of the underlying chemistry and potentially identify signs of life. This method has been tested on simulated atmospheres and has shown promising results, including the ability to distinguish between biological and non-biological sources of methane and to identify anomalies in the chemical interactions. The researchers believe that this approach could be a game-changer in the search for life beyond Earth, allowing us to identify complex, self-sustaining chemical processes that may be indicative of life, even if they don't produce familiar biomarkers like oxygen or methane. As the James Webb Space Telescope and future observatories provide increasingly detailed information about the composition of exoplanet atmospheres, this method could help us navigate the vast amounts of data and identify the most promising candidates for further study.

**Venus' Ozone: A False Signal for Life?**
A team of international scientists, led by Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy graduate student Robb Colder, has found that the ozone in Venus' atmosphere is not a reliable biomarker for habitability. The team analyzed data from the Venus Express mission, which detected ozone (O3) in the planet's mesosphere in 2011. On Earth, ozone is a sign of life, formed from oxygen produced by photosynthetic organisms. However, Venus, with surface temperatures reaching 460°C and pressures 92 times that of Earth, shows O3 concentrations comparable to those on Earth, ranging from 0.1 to 1 parts per million (ppm). The scientists modeled atmospheric processes to understand the source of this gas. Using a photochemical model, they tested the hypothesis of atomic oxygen (O) transfer from the day side to the night side. According to calculations, to explain the observed O3 levels at 100 km altitude, a concentration of O on the day side of at least 1% is required, but real measurements show only 0.001%. Moreover, such a scenario would lead to an overestimation of the observed limit of molecular oxygen (O2) by 10-100 times. 'Our models exclude known chemical reactions as the primary source of ozone. It is likely that an unknown mechanism is producing O3 in the Venusian mesosphere at a rate of 105-107 cm-3/s,' said Colder. This finding is crucial for interpreting data from the James Webb telescope, which is searching for biomarkers in exoplanet atmospheres. For example, on planets around M-type stars, ozone formed at night can persist in the terminator zone (the boundary between day and night) for up to 10 minutes, allowing detection by transit spectroscopy. Venus, as a 'hot rocky planet' benchmark, helps scientists distinguish between lifeless and potentially habitable planets. Its CO2-rich atmosphere serves as an analog for exoplanets closer to the inner edge of the habitable zone. If the unknown O3 generation mechanism is widespread, it will complicate the search for life, requiring additional parameters to be considered in missions like Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) and LIFE. The key to solving the mystery may lie in the future NASA DAVINCI mission, scheduled for 2031, which will measure the composition of Venus' atmosphere from 70 km to the surface, including direct measurements of O3 and O2. 'Understanding the chemistry of Venus is not only a scientific interest, but a necessity for correctly deciphering data on distant exoplanets,' emphasized the authors of the study.

**La Tierra will lose its oxygen-rich atmosphere in one billion years, NASA study predicts**
A NASA study, in collaboration with Japanese scientists, has predicted that the Earth will lose its oxygen-rich atmosphere in approximately one billion years. This study, published recently, presents a scenario in which our planet will return to conditions similar to those that existed before the emergence of complex life. The main culprit behind this transformation will be the gradual warming of the Sun, which will increase the planet's temperature over time. As a result, the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO₂) will decrease, leading to a chain reaction that will ultimately cause the levels of oxygen in the atmosphere to drop to levels that make life as we know it impossible. The study suggests that only microorganisms that thrive in oxygen-free conditions will be able to survive on the future planet. This research has a practical purpose: to help astronomers interpret atmospheric data from exoplanets. By understanding how and when a planet like Earth can lose its oxygen, we can refine our instruments to detect signs of life in other parts of the universe. As it stands, many telescopes are searching for oxygen as an indicator of extraterrestrial life. However, this study suggests that life can exist even without oxygen, and that planets with complex life may be in a phase where they have not yet generated oxygen or have already lost it.

**New Telescope to Help Search for Life Beyond Earth**
Although the James Webb Space Telescope has limitations, such as being unable to detect planets similar in size to Earth or those close to their host stars due to overwhelming starlight, a new project called the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is planned to be launched in the 2030s. The HWO will be capable of observing and analyzing the atmospheres of exoplanets similar in size to Earth. This technology involves using a high-tech 'sunshade' to reduce the intense light from the host star. As the US space agency notes, 'The HWO will be a game-changer in the search for life beyond Earth.'

**ELT Telescope to Detect Extraterrestrial Life in 10 Hours**
A Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), currently under construction in Chile, will be able to detect extraterrestrial life in just 10 hours of observation of an exoplanet. According to a study by the University of Washington, the ELT will be able to characterize the atmospheric conditions of exoplanets, such as Proxima Centauri b, with a reasonable observation time. The study, which is still in review, explores the feasibility of detecting signs of habitability and life in exoplanets through detailed simulations. The results indicate that the detection of water (H2O), oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) is possible, but may require longer observation times. Ammonia (NH3) detection is considered crucial for distinguishing between terrestrial and sub-Neptune atmospheres. The ELT, with a 39m mirror, will be the largest telescope in the world for visible and infrared light, and will help answer three major questions in astronomy: 'According to the researchers, the detection of water (H2O) may be possible in just a few hours of observation, especially in the 0.9 µm band for planets like Proxima Centauri b.'

**Extremely Large Telescope May Detect Life on Proxima Centauri in Just 10 Hours**
The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) is nearing completion and will be one of the most powerful tools for studying exoplanets. It is possible that it will quickly find life on one of them. The ELT's primary mirror will have an effective diameter of 39 meters, collecting an order of magnitude more light than previous telescopes, and giving us images 16 times sharper than the Hubble Space Telescope. The launch of the telescope is scheduled for 2028, and the results may start coming in as early as one night, as shown by a recent study published on the arXiv server. The study analyzed the spectra of exoplanets. One of the most powerful capabilities of ELT will be the capture of weak atmospheric spectra from exoplanet atmospheres. Usually, this happens when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of observation. A small part of the starlight passes through the planet's atmosphere to reach us, and by analyzing the absorption spectra, we can determine the molecules present in the atmosphere, such as water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. The James Webb Space Telescope, for example, has collected data on several exoplanet atmospheres. However, sometimes the data from transit can be unconvincing. For example, when James Webb searched for atmospheres on the planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system, it seemed that planets b and c were airless, but there was not enough data to rule out the presence of an atmosphere. There may be thin atmospheres with spectral lines too weak to be observed by JWST. The greater sensitivity of ELT will help to resolve this issue. Even more interestingly, the new telescope will be able to collect spectra not only of exoplanets passing in front of their stars, but also of exoplanets not passing in front of them, using reflected starlight. To determine how powerful ELT will be, a new study modeled the results for several scenarios. The search for life around red dwarfs Scientists focused on planets orbiting red dwarfs, as this is the most common type of exoplanet, and considered four test cases: a non-industrial Earth, rich in water and photosynthetic plants, an Earth of the early Archean era, where life is just beginning to thrive, a terrestrial world where oceans have evaporated, similar to Mars or Venus, and a biotic Earth, capable of life but without it. For comparison, the team also considered worlds the size of Neptune, which should have a much thicker atmosphere. The idea was to see if ELT can distinguish between different terrestrial worlds, and, more importantly, whether the data can deceive us, giving a false-positive or false-negative result. That is, whether a lifeless world will seem to have life, or a living world will seem barren. Based on their simulations, the authors concluded that we should be able to clearly and accurately distinguish between adjacent star systems. For the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, we could detect life in a world similar to Earth in just 10 hours of observation. For a world the size of Neptune, ELT could capture the spectra of planets in about an hour. So, it seems that if life exists in the neighboring star system, ELT should be able to detect it. The answer to perhaps the biggest question in human history may be found in just a few years.

**ELT to Detect Signs of Life in Proxima Centauri's Atmosphere within 10 Hours**
The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will be able to detect signs of life in the atmosphere of a planet similar to Earth orbiting Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Sun, within 10 hours of observation. According to a study, the 39-meter telescope, scheduled to be launched in 2028, will be able to analyze the spectra of exoplanets, even those that are not transiting their stars, using the reflected light from their atmospheres. The ELT's unique sensitivity will be a breakthrough in studying exoplanet atmospheres. Unlike the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which has already detected molecules in the atmospheres of several exoplanets, the ELT will be able to register even thin gas envelopes that are not detectable with current instruments. For example, data on the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system, where JWST was unable to confirm the presence of atmospheres on objects b and c, can be rechecked with unprecedented accuracy. The main goal of the ELT is to search for specific chemical markers, such as oxygen, methane, or carbon dioxide, which may indicate biological processes. To test the telescope's capabilities, scientists simulated observations of four types of Earth-like planets: a modern Earth with an active biosphere, an early version of our planet during the Archaea era, a lifeless world with evaporated oceans, and a 'prebiotic' Earth, theoretically capable of supporting life but lacking it. Excluding false positives, such as geological processes that mimic biosignals, was an important part of the modeling. The results showed that for an Earth-like exoplanet, Proxima Centauri b, located just 4.24 light-years from the Sun, the ELT would require less than a day to confirm or rule out the presence of life. For planets the size of Neptune, where dense atmospheres amplify spectral signals, the observation time would be reduced to one hour. This makes the ELT the first instrument capable of systematically searching for signs of habitability around the nearest stars. If life exists in the vicinity of the Solar System, the ELT will provide evidence within the next decade. The success of the mission could not only rewrite the textbooks of astrobiology but also answer the question that has been haunting humanity for millennia: are we alone in the universe?

**New Telescope Could Detect Life on Proxima b in Just 10 Hours**
The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), currently under construction in northern Chile, will provide a greater capacity for observing the Milky Way than any previous terrestrial telescope. The ELT could detect signs of life on Proxima b, the closest exoplanet to Earth, in just 10 hours. The telescope's primary mirror will have an effective diameter of 39 meters, collecting ten times more light than previous telescopes and providing images 16 times sharper than the Hubble Space Telescope. It is expected to be operational by 2028, and the results could begin to arrive as early as tomorrow, according to a recent study. The ELT will be able to capture weak atmospheric spectra of exoplanet atmospheres, which can be used to determine the presence of essential molecules for life, such as water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. Using this method, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has collected data on the atmospheres of several exoplanets, but the data is sometimes inconclusive. The ELT's greater sensitivity should be able to perform these analyses without problems. The telescope could also collect spectra from exoplanets that are not in transit, by observing the reflected light from the star. Researchers Miles Currie and Victoria Meadows simulated the results of the ELT for several scenarios, including a Earth-like planet with a rich atmosphere and abundant plant life, a planet where life is just beginning to thrive, a planet with evaporated oceans, and a prebiotic planet capable of supporting life but without it. The results showed that the ELT should be able to distinguish between these different worlds and detect signs of life in just 10 hours of observation. 'We should be able to make clear and precise distinctions between nearby star systems,' the researchers said. 'If there is life in a nearby star system, the ELT should be able to detect it.'

**New Method for Detecting Life on Exoplanets Using James Webb Telescope**
Researchers from the University of California, Riverside, have developed a new method to detect signs of life on exoplanets using the James Webb telescope, focusing on the detection of biomarkers such as halogenated methanes in the atmospheres of gas giants. According to the study, published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, this approach is based on the idea that 'life can be found in worlds that are nothing like Earth and in gases that are rarely considered in the search for extraterrestrial life.' The researchers believe that the presence of halogenated methanes in the atmospheres of exoplanets, known as 'hazy worlds,' could be a sign of life. These gases are produced by plants, fungi, and marine algae on Earth and are essential for human life. The study suggests that the James Webb telescope could detect these gases in the atmospheres of exoplanets in just 13 hours, making it a more efficient and cost-effective method than searching for other gases like oxygen or methane. Michaela Leung, a planetary scientist at the UCR, said, 'This offers a unique opportunity for detection with existing technology... Currently, detecting oxygen in a planet similar to Earth is difficult or impossible.' Eddie Schwieterman, an astrobiologist at the UCR, added, 'These gases are a plausible result of their metabolism.' The study is based on previous research that investigated different biomarkers, including dimethyl sulfide. The researchers believe that the detection of halogenated methanes in the atmospheres of exoplanets could be a sign of anaerobic microorganisms that are adapted to a very different environment.
