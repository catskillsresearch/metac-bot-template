**Powerful Dahlonega state Sen. Steve Gooch jumps into 2026 Georgia lieutenant governor race • Georgia Recorder**
Georgia Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch has announced his candidacy for the 2026 lieutenant governor race. Gooch stated, 'I'm running for Lieutenant Governor because Georgia deserves bold leadership that will stand up to the insanity of the Democrat Party, protect our families from the invasion of criminal illegal aliens and keep our economy vibrant and strong.' He aims to make Georgia a 'gold standard' for the country, securing borders, stopping violent crime, and abolishing the state income tax. Gooch has served in the Senate since 2010 and is a 'die-hard MAGA supporter' and 'MAGA champion.' He faces a potentially crowded GOP primary, with several powerful Senate Republicans reportedly considering runs. Democratic rival Sen. Josh McLaurin stated, 'The Majority Leader appears to have made his MAGA license plate bill the centerpiece of his campaign launch. I think that choice makes the point about how the GOP primary is going to go: it's going to be about who can suck up the most to Trump.'

Former lieutenant governor candidate Carl Eggleston has endorsed Levar Stoney in the Democratic primary. Eggleston cited Stoney's executive experience and commitment to serving all Virginians as key reasons for his endorsement.

He understands the challenges our communities face, and he has the leadership skills to bring people together and deliver meaningful progress.' Stoney praised Eggleston, saying, 'Carl Eggleston is a deeply respected leader whose service has helped shape Virginia for the better.' Eggleston's endorsement is significant, given his experience as the first African American to be elected to the Farmville Town Council and his continued influence in civic life across the Commonwealth.

**6 Democrats want to be Va.'s lieutenant governor. Here's what to know.**
Six Democrats are running in the June 17 primary to become the party's nominee for Virginia lieutenant governor. The candidates agree on many issues, including repealing Virginia's right-to-work law, increasing the minimum wage, and protecting abortion access. However, they differ on specific policies and issues, such as gaming and education. Alex Bastani, a retired economist and lawyer, is running to the left of the other candidates, proposing a slate of pro-worker policies, including raising the minimum wage to $20 an hour and providing free college to all Virginians. State Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, a former literature professor and community college administrator, touts her six years of experience in the Senate and has already carried legislation to advance many shared Democratic priorities. Babur B. Lateef, a prominent Northern Virginia eye surgeon, has made opposition to a Northern Virginia casino a prominent issue and calls for eliminating skill games. State Sen. Aaron R. Rouse, a former Virginia Beach City Council member, has sponsored high-profile legislation to strengthen protections for renters and to create a regulatory framework for the state's recreational cannabis market. Victor Salgado, a former federal prosecutor, opposes the Northern Virginia casino and skill games, saying they would feed crime and addiction. Levar Stoney, the former mayor of Richmond, positions himself as both business-friendly and committed to helping families and people in need.

**Arlington Dems: “The Republican Lt. Governor nominee in Virginia is justifying the murder of George Floyd” (who was asphyxiated to death in cold blood 5 years ago)**
The Arlington Democrats have criticized the Republican Lt. Governor nominee in Virginia for justifying the murder of George Floyd. The nominee's argument is seen as insensitive and unjustified, as Derek Chauvin, the police officer who killed Floyd, was found guilty of all three murder and manslaughter charges. Sen. Tim Kaine expressed concern that the DOJ's decision to halt ongoing investigations and drop police agreements put in place after Floyd's death is 'dangerous.' The Arlington Democrats also pointed out that the nominee's comments are reminiscent of Donald Trump's own history of serious crimes, and that the use of the term 'urban society' is code for the African-American community.

**Who Will Succeed Trump? 7 Names in the Running**
As the 2024 US presidential election approaches, speculation is growing about who will succeed Donald Trump. Trump has hinted that he may not run for re-election in 2028, and has mentioned potential successors, including his vice president Mike Pence and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., has also hinted that he may run for president in the future. Meanwhile, some governors are taking steps that have sparked speculation about their presidential ambitions. According to an article by 'The Hill', seven potential successors to Trump have been identified. These include Mike Pence, who has been a loyal supporter of Trump's economic and isolationist policies, and Marco Rubio, who has been a key player in Trump's administration. Other potential successors include Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, who has been a vocal critic of Trump's policies, and Glenn Youngkin, the governor of Virginia, who has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the Republican nomination in 2028. Christie Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, has also been mentioned as a potential successor to Trump, although her chances may have been damaged by her recent comments about shooting her dog during a hunting trip. Brian Kemp, the governor of Georgia, has also sparked speculation about his presidential ambitions, although he has denied any plans to run in 2028.

**Ohio's Jim Tressel still considering run for governor; GOP endorsement of Ramaswamy isn't a factor • Ohio Capital Journal**
Ohio Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel is still considering a run for governor, despite the Ohio Republican Party's endorsement of Vivek Ramaswamy. Tressel said that the endorsement won't affect his decision, and that he decided to speak out about a possible run because he's been getting 'so many questions' from supporters. He emphasized that his top priorities as governor would be the livelihood of Ohioans, education, and supporting veterans. When asked about the infighting for the primary nomination, Tressel said that he isn't experienced enough to have an opinion, but that every voter deserves a chance to decide what they'd like to vote for. Tressel didn't have an answer on when he would officially announce his candidacy, if he decides to run. 'I don't think an endorsement would impact, at least in my opinion, whether I would be interested in getting in the race or not,' Tressel said. 'Every voter deserves a chance to decide what they'd like to vote for.'

**Early Voting For June Democratic Primary Begins: What To Know**
The Virginia Republican Party has canceled its primary for lieutenant governor due to Pat Herrity's withdrawal from the race. As a result, former conservative radio host Reid is the sole GOP candidate. Attorney General Miyares is the party's nominee for attorney general. In the City of Manassas, Delegate Michelle Maldonado does not face a Democratic primary challenger, so her race will not be on the June 17 ballot. Early voting for the June Democratic primary begins on May 2 and ends on June 14. Voters can cast their ballots in person at the Voter Registration office, by mail, or at their assigned polling place on Election Day. An acceptable form of ID is required for in-person voting.

**Lieutenant Governor candidates set. No more Republican primary**
Pat Herrity, a Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor, has dropped out of the race due to health complications following heart surgery. In a statement, Herrity said he is not recovering as quickly as needed and cannot give the 150% effort required for a statewide campaign without risking his health. Herrity's opponent, John Reid, has expressed gratitude for Herrity's decision and is now the sole Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor. Reid said he will continue to work hard to be worthy of the opportunity and earn every vote. The Republican Party of Virginia now has an early opportunity to unify, and Reid is looking forward to the challenge. Meanwhile, there is still one statewide primary scheduled for June, with six Democratic candidates competing for the lieutenant governor nomination.

**Candidate's withdrawal from Virginia Republican primary means registrars must redo ballots**
Fairfax County Supervisor Patrick Herrity has withdrawn from the Virginia lieutenant governor race due to health complications following recent heart surgery. Herrity's withdrawal leaves former radio host John Reid as the presumptive Republican nominee. Virginia voter registrars must now reprint ballots for the June 17 primary, causing logistical challenges and added costs. Petersburg registrar Dawn Wilmoth expressed frustration over the timing of the withdrawal, saying, 'I wish the candidates would give forethought on their campaigns, as this aspect has already cost the offices whose ballot printing and envelope prep has been taking place for weeks.' Wilmoth stated that her office cannot wait until two weeks prior to start getting ready and that Herrity's withdrawal means all the work they had done for naught. Herrity, 64, confirmed to WJLA that he was pulling out of the nomination race due to health reasons, saying, 'You've got to be at 150%, and I was at 150% until my surgery. But with the complications that I've had, I don't see myself being able to be at that 150% that it's going to take to win in November.' Reid's campaign issued a statement saying they were 'praying' for Herrity's health and calling Herrity a 'gentleman' throughout the primary process.

**Herrity drops out of lieutenant governor race, sets GOP ticket**
Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity has dropped out of the 2025 Republican lieutenant governor race due to ongoing health complications following heart surgery. Herrity's withdrawal clears the path for conservative talk show host John Reid to become the Republican nominee, finalizing the party's 2025 statewide ticket alongside Winsome Earl-Sears and Jason Miyares. Herrity emphasized that his priority was helping Republicans win in November and highlighted that his campaign was 'less about me and the lieutenant governor position and more about doing well in Northern Virginia so we could elect Winsome Sears as our Governor and reelect Attorney General Jason Miyares.' Reid said the GOP now has 'an early opportunity to unify behind a historic, solidly conservative, reasonable, and responsible GOP ticket' alongside Sears and Miyares.

**Pat Herrity drops out of Virginia GOP lieutenant governors' race**

Herrity, who was leading in fundraising, underwent heart surgery in mid-March to repair a genetic defect and is experiencing complications. He stated, 'I have come to the realization that my ability to get back to me the 150 percent that I was giving to a statewide race and that will be necessary to win in November is not possible at the near future.' This move clears the way for conservative talk-radio host John Reid to become the GOP nominee, effectively setting the GOP ticket for statewide elections this fall.

As I hope my travels across the state and work ethic have demonstrated, I take my new responsibility as the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor seriously.' The GOP ticket is now set, with Lt.

**With Pat Herrity Dropping Out of the Lt. Gov. Primary, the 2025 VA GOP Ticket Is Now Set, and It’s Quite Possibly the Most Far-Right/Extreme Ever**
With Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity dropping out of the VA GOP's 2025 Lt. Governor primary for health reasons, the Republican ticket is now set with Winsome Earle-Sears for governor, John Reid for Lt. Governor, and Jason Miyares for reelection as Attorney General. This ticket is considered far-right and extreme, with Winsome Earle-Sears making several controversial comments, including comparing Brown v. Board to the quest for taxpayer-funded segregated academies, and stating that the mother is not having a lizard, she's having a human being. Democrats are calling on Republicans to disavow Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears' comments on the Richmond shooting, and EMILY's List has criticized her for spewing misinformation about reproductive rights. Former VA Lt. Governor Bill Bolling has also stated that none of the prospective Republican candidates will be able to compete with Spanberger. 'It's the guns Ms. Sears…IT'S THE GUNS! !'; 'Enough is enough. Do your damn job.'

John Reid, a former Richmond radio host and Republican candidate for Virginia's lieutenant governor, stated that Governor Glenn Youngkin paved the way for Republicans to 'step up' and prevent Democrats from regaining control in 2025. Reid cited the 2020 riots, COVID-19 response, and election protests as reasons for his decision to enter politics. He praised Youngkin's efforts to veto 'horrible leftist bills' and expressed gratitude for Youngkin, Winsome Sears, and Jason Miyares' conservative leadership. Reid emphasized the need for Republicans to stand up for their values and push policies through the General Assembly, rather than trying to appease Democrats. He is running in the Republican primary on June 17 against Pat Herrity and John Curran.
