**Iran Ready to Accept New Nuclear Deal in Exchange for Lifting of Sanctions**
Iran's Supreme Leader's advisor, Ali Shamkhani, announced on Wednesday that Iran is ready to accept a new agreement with the United States regarding its nuclear program in exchange for the immediate lifting of sanctions. Shamkhani stated that Iran will commit to never producing nuclear weapons, eliminating its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and only enriching uranium to civilian levels, allowing international inspectors to oversee these actions in exchange for the immediate lifting of all economic sanctions. When asked if Iran would agree to sign an agreement today if these conditions are met, Shamkhani replied, 'Yes. It's still possible, if the Americans keep their word, we can build better relations, which will improve the situation in the near future.' US President Donald Trump has imposed new sanctions on Iran, while expressing hope for a nuclear agreement. Iran is currently enriching uranium to 60%, exceeding the 3.67% limit set by the 2015 nuclear agreement, and approaching the 90% level needed for military use, causing concern among Western powers.

**Iran Proposes New Nuclear Deal with US, Involving Joint Enrichment Company**
Iran has proposed a new plan to reach a nuclear agreement with the US, involving the creation of a joint nuclear enrichment company with Arab countries and US investments. The plan was presented by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to a US envoy, Steve Witkoff, during a meeting in Oman. According to four Iranian officials, the company would enrich uranium to a low level, below the threshold for nuclear weapons, and then send it to other Arab countries for civilian use. This would be a permanent agreement, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, which had a 15-year deadline. Ali Vaez, director for Iran at the International Crisis Group, said that while the idea of a joint company was new and untested, negotiators should try a different approach. 'Basically, they are at a point where they need to go beyond zero-sum demands to save face for both sides,' he said. The US has been seeking to dismantle Iran's nuclear program, but Iranian officials have said that closing the program would be a 'red line.' After three hours of talks, both sides adopted a conciliatory tone, describing the negotiations as 'productive and encouraging.' The next step would be to involve technical teams of experts to negotiate details on nuclear facilities and financial issues related to sanctions relief. Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat and member of the 2015 nuclear negotiating team, wrote about the idea of a regional nuclear consortium in 2023. He said that if the proposal is approved, it would address several US concerns, including reducing the immediate threat of Iran's nuclear program and addressing long-term concerns about a change of direction by Iran.

**Iran Proposes Regional Nuclear Cooperation with US**
Iran has proposed a new deal to the United States regarding its nuclear program, which includes cooperation with other countries in the region and American investors, according to Iranian sources. Iran wants to continue producing low-enriched uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons but can be used for civilian purposes, and is willing to export it to other countries in the region. This proposal is an alternative to the US demand that Iran dismantle its entire nuclear program. Iran hopes that cooperation with other countries will increase international involvement and therefore more oversight. It is still unclear whether other countries in the region are open to this proposal. 'Iran wants to offer an alternative to the US demand,' said an Iranian source. 'We want to show that we are willing to cooperate with other countries in the region and with the US, but we also want to maintain our right to develop our nuclear program for civilian purposes.'

**Iran Proposes Novel Path to Nuclear Deal With U.S.**
Iran has proposed a novel path to a nuclear deal with the US, involving a joint nuclear enrichment venture with regional Arab countries and American investments. The plan would allow Iran to keep producing civilian-grade fuel, but with more monitoring. Iranian officials said this would be a permanent agreement, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, which had a 15-year expiration date. The US has been demanding that Iran dismantle its nuclear program, but President Trump said he wants to make a deal with Iran to make the region and the world a safer place. Iranian leaders need to make a decision soon, or else they will face still more economic pressure from sanctions. Ali Vaez, the Iran director of the International Crisis Group, said that while the venture idea was new and untested, the negotiators needed to try a different approach. 'They basically are at a point where they must move beyond the maximum zero sum demands in order for both sides to save face,' he said. Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat, said that if the proposal moves forward, it would address several of America's concerns and remove the immediate threat of Iran's nuclear program. 'If Trump announces a regional nuclear deal, it will be big victory,' he said. 'It removes the immediate and future threat from Iran and contains enrichment ambitions in the region and brings new deals for Americans.'

**Iran and 'Euratrium' to Hold Talks on Nuclear Program**
Iran and the 'Euratrium' (UK, France, and Germany) will meet in Istanbul on May 16 for talks on Iran's nuclear program, according to Reuters, citing European and Iranian diplomatic sources. The meeting was originally scheduled for May 2, but was postponed due to the US side's decision to delay the fourth round of talks with Iran. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot stated that the meeting would not take place, as 'these technical consultations were planned before the meeting at the high level between the US and Iran'. He added that 'since this meeting did not take place, the consultations are no longer relevant, at least for now'. Iran's Foreign Ministry said that Tehran is ready to hold talks with the 'Euratrium' after the fourth round of consultations with the US. 'Iran will hold talks in Istanbul on Friday with European parties involved in... the 2015 nuclear deal... Diplomats said they decided to continue because ultimately it was in their interests to maintain dialogue with Iran and confirm how they see the parameters of a new nuclear deal', the statement said. The fourth round of talks between Iran and the US took place on May 11. Iran's Foreign Ministry official described the round as 'difficult but complex'. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Arakchi said that 'the positions of the parties in this round have converged', and that 'progress has been made' in the talks. However, he emphasized that Iran is not willing to completely give up uranium enrichment. The first and third rounds of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington took place in Oman on April 12 and 26, respectively, and the second round took place in Rome on April 19. Iran is represented by Abbas Arakchi, while the US is represented by Special Envoy Steve Wietkoff. In 2015, the UK, Germany, China, Russia, the US, France, and Iran signed the nuclear deal, which aimed to lift sanctions in exchange for limiting Iran's nuclear program. The US withdrew from the deal in May 2018 and reimposed sanctions on the Iranian leadership. In response, Iran announced a phased reduction of its commitments under the agreement, including restrictions on nuclear research and uranium enrichment levels.

**Iran Ready to Sign Nuclear Deal with US in Exchange for Sanctions Relief**
Iran has expressed its willingness to reduce uranium enrichment levels and eliminate high-enriched uranium reserves in exchange for the lifting of US sanctions. According to Ali Shamkhani, advisor to the Iranian Supreme Leader, Iran will also allow inspectors access to its nuclear facilities and use enrichment only for peaceful purposes. Shamkhani called on the US to 'match its declared intentions' and expressed hope for the normalization of bilateral relations. He also criticized the rhetoric of former US President Donald Trump, saying that he spoke of an olive branch but did not demonstrate it, threatening Iran with 'maximum pressure.' Shamkhani also suggested that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may attempt to sabotage a potential agreement. The negotiations, mediated by Oman, included four rounds: April 12 and 26, 2025, in Muscat, April 19 in Rome, and May 11 in Muscat again. The Iranian delegation was led by Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Aragchi, while the US delegation was led by Special Envoy Stephen Whitewolf. The parties are discussing the conditions for the revival of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), from which the US withdrew in 2018.

**Before We Make a Deal with Iran**
As negotiations between the United States and Iran over Iran's nuclear program continue, President Trump has made it clear that Iran must never acquire nuclear weapons. He has offered Iran a choice: either peacefully dismantle its nuclear weapons capacity or it will be dismantled with overwhelming force by the United States. The Trump administration has laid out 14 non-negotiable red lines for any Iran nuclear deal, including the removal of all enriched uranium, dismantling of centrifuges, and no sunset clauses. Iran must choose peace and commit to a good and enforceable deal, or face the consequences. Vice President J.D. Vance said that Iran getting a nuclear weapon is 'completely off the table, no ifs, ands, or buts.'

**Iran Calls US Sanctions 'Unacceptable' Amid Ongoing Nuclear Deal Negotiations**
Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the new US sanctions 'unacceptable' amid ongoing negotiations between Tehran and Washington over the Iranian nuclear deal. According to Ismael Bagai, the official representative of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'It is impossible to predict the course of negotiations. Our position will not change. The introduction of a new package of sanctions by the US at the same time as the ongoing negotiations is unacceptable and will affect our approach to the negotiations with Washington... Our goal in the negotiations with the US is to protect our rights and put an end to the sanctions against Iran... Washington must change its opinion about Iran and refrain from making controversial statements about the Islamic Republic,' Bagai said, as reported by the Iranian state news agency SNN. The fourth round of negotiations between Iran and the US took place on May 11. The talks have been ongoing since March, with the first and third rounds held in Oman on April 12 and 26, respectively, and the second round in Rome on April 19. Iran is represented by Foreign Minister Abbas Arakchi, while the US is represented by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. The negotiations were initiated after US President Donald Trump wrote a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in March, offering a new deal on Iran's nuclear program and threatening military action if diplomatic efforts fail. Iran has rejected direct talks with the US but agreed to indirect negotiations. The 2015 nuclear deal between Iran, the UK, Germany, China, Russia, the US, France, and Iran lifted sanctions in exchange for Iran's nuclear program restrictions. The US withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions, prompting Iran to gradually reduce its commitments under the agreement, including restrictions on nuclear research and uranium enrichment levels. The deal's deadline is October 18, 2024, when the UN Security Council resolution 2231 expires.

**Talks still breathing**
Iran and the United States have avoided an impasse in their indirect nuclear talks, with Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei describing the talks as 'difficult but useful'. The two sides have agreed to hold a fifth round of negotiations, with the timing and location to be announced by the mediator, Oman. Iran's stance remains unchanged, and the agreement to hold a new round of talks indicates the U.S. continues to acknowledge that position. Iran's Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi condemned the U.S.'s contradictory stances, saying 'If the U.S.' contradictory stances are repeated, Iran will have to act accordingly.' Araghchi added that the two sides now understand each other better, and that the negotiations were more direct and serious than previous rounds. The talks are the second time in two decades that Iran is negotiating a deal on its nuclear program, following the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015. However, doubts remain about the feasibility of a deal due to the U.S.'s own fickleness and attempts by other actors to sabotage the talks.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Arakchi announced that the next round of indirect negotiations with the US will take place in Rome on May 1. According to Arakchi, before the negotiations, Iran will hold a meeting with the 'Euratriple' (Germany, UK, and France). The US and Iran have been engaged in negotiations to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, with the first round taking place on April 12 and the second on April 19. Arakchi led the Iranian delegation, while US Special Envoy for the Middle East, Stephen Whitlock, represented the US. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated on April 18 that Moscow could act as a mediator in the negotiations between Washington and Tehran, as Iran is willing to accept joint decisions within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

**US and Iran Begin New Round of Nuclear Talks in Oman**
The United States and Iran have begun a new round of negotiations on Iran's nuclear program in Oman, after previous indirect talks were described as 'constructive' by both sides. The discussions, mediated by Oman, started just before 08:30 GMT, according to several Iranian media outlets, including the state television. This is the first time the two countries have held talks at this level since the US withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal in 2018. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff will lead the negotiations. A technical session between experts is planned before the high-level talks. 'For the negotiations to progress, there must be a demonstration of good faith, seriousness, and realism from the other side,' said Esmaïl Baghaï, the Iranian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson. The US and its allies, as well as Israel, suspect Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, while Tehran denies these allegations and claims a right to nuclear technology for civilian purposes, such as energy production. Iran plans to build 19 new reactors, according to a speech by Araghchi published on his official X account. The US has reimposed sanctions on Iran, and the country has gradually distanced itself from the 2015 agreement, enriching uranium to high levels. Araghchi expressed 'prudent optimism' about the current process. The US has announced new sanctions on Iran's oil sector, which Tehran has denounced as 'hostile.' The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has asked Iran to explain the presence of tunnels around the Natanz site, which houses centrifuges used to enrich uranium. 'The right of Iran to enrich uranium is non-negotiable,' said Araghchi. The country is currently enriching uranium to a high level (60%), below the 90% needed for nuclear weapons but far from the 3.67% cap set by the 2015 agreement.

He added, 'As the Supreme Leader (Ayatollah Ali Hamaney) said, we are neither optimistic nor pessimistic. We are not here to fight, but we will not accept bullying either.' The US and Iran have been engaged in indirect talks through Oman, with the latest round taking place in Rome on April 19. Iran announced that technical talks would be held in Oman on April 23, followed by further indirect talks on April 26.

**US and Iran Continue Nuclear Deal Talks in Rome**
The second round of negotiations between the US and Iran took place in Rome, with the two sides continuing to discuss the issues raised in Muscat last week, but with a greater emphasis on specific points of a hypothetical agreement. Iran and the US brought 'instructions' from their partners to the Rome meeting, some of which were involved in the conclusion of the first nuclear deal. However, while Iran's position remains 'monolithic', there are still internal debates within the US negotiating team, sparked by external advice. The US continues to emphasize that it is seeking a 'strong agreement' that would prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, in exchange for easing sanctions and military pressure on Tehran. Iran, on the other hand, reiterates that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful and demands stricter guarantees, including the ratification of a new agreement by the US Congress. Russia has expressed its readiness to play any role in the agreements between Iran and the US that would be beneficial to Tehran, in order to strengthen the guarantees and maximize the effect of the Oman's mediating work. China's position is also being taken into account by Iran, which is relying on the 'Five Points of Settlement' formulated by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in a trilateral meeting in Beijing in March 2025. The US has also held consultations with European partners, including France, Germany, and the UK, but the European side has expressed skepticism about the prospects of a new agreement. Israel has also expressed its concerns about the US and Iran moving towards the same contours of the nuclear deal signed by the Obama administration in 2015, even with some symbolic concessions. The Russian Foreign Ministry has revealed details of the negotiations on Iran's nuclear dossier, which took place in Moscow on April 8. The next meeting is scheduled for April 26, but additional contacts between the countries on related issues are not ruled out.

**Iran and US Agree on Third Round of Nuclear Talks**
Iran and the US have agreed on a third round of nuclear talks. According to Arakchi, key representatives from both sides will meet in Oman to discuss the results prepared by experts. He also clarified that expert-level consultations will begin on Wednesday, April 23. 'It's only natural that experts will have more time to delve into the details and develop the framework for an agreement', Arakchi said, without specifying the location of the technical talks. Meanwhile, Arakchi added that representatives from the IAEA should not be involved in the dialogue yet. The second round of indirect talks between the US and Iran on restoring the nuclear deal took place in Rome on April 19. In 2018, during his first presidential term, Donald Trump announced the US withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, citing evidence of Iran's development of nuclear weapons. On January 13, 2025, The Times reported, citing sources in Western intelligence, that Iran was conducting secret diplomatic talks with Russia aimed at expanding military cooperation and receiving support for its nuclear program. On March 7, Trump said he had written a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offering to negotiate a new nuclear deal. According to Axios, Trump gave Iran a two-month deadline to reach an agreement. On March 13, Ayatollah Khamenei refused to engage in direct talks with the US on a nuclear deal. On April 11, it was reported that Iran was considering offering the US a temporary nuclear deal. On April 12, indirect talks between Iranian and US delegations on nuclear issues took place in Muscat, Oman. On April 18, Reuters reported, citing sources, that Iran believed a deal with the US was possible if they 'demonstrate seriousness of intent and do not put forward unrealistic demands'. Iran also demands guarantees from the US that Donald Trump will not withdraw from a new nuclear deal.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Arakchi announced that Iran and the US have agreed to hold expert consultations on the Iranian nuclear deal.

According to Arakchi, the experts will have the opportunity to thoroughly examine the issue and develop parameters for a possible agreement. Arakchi described the recent talks with Witkoff in Rome as 'very productive', stating that both sides have achieved greater understanding on several goals and principles. However, he emphasized that there is no reason for excessive optimism or pessimism at this point.

**Iran Confirms Negotiations with US in Muscat, Oman**
The Iranian government announced on Tuesday (15) that the next round of indirect negotiations with the United States on Iran's nuclear program, scheduled for Saturday (19), will take place in Muscat, Oman, and not in Rome, Italy. 'The decision was made after consultations', said Esmail Baghai, the spokesperson for the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited by the state news agency Irna. The first round of talks was held on Saturday (12) in Muscat, at the residence of the Omani Foreign Minister. To avoid direct contact, the US and Iranian delegations remained in separate rooms and communicated through written messages. 'It was a positive and constructive meeting', assured Steve Witkoff, the US Special Envoy for the Middle East, in an interview with Fox News. Meanwhile, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei expressed 'great pessimism' about the US stance. The US and Iran had previously signed a nuclear agreement in July 2015, but Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018. The US and Israel accuse Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, while Tehran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

**Can Iran secure a nuclear deal before Donald Trump's deadline expires?**
The deadline for a new Iran nuclear deal is approaching, with US President Donald Trump giving Iran two months to reach a deal or face military force. European countries, Germany, France, and England, have set June as a deadline for Tehran to reach a nuclear deal or face global sanctions. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that if their nuclear program is struck, they will retaliate by attacking every US base in the region. However, Khamenei is signaling that he is willing to consider indirect negotiations at a time when Trump is threatening Iran with bombing and tougher sanctions. The increased pressure on Iran's nuclear program makes negotiations more likely, and real negotiations between the US and Iran are expected to begin next month. Reaching an interim deal could take longer, until September, but the clock is ticking.

**Donald Trump gives Ali Khamenei, Iran, nuclear deal deadline**
President Donald Trump has given Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei a two-month deadline to reach a new nuclear deal, according to US officials. The deadline was included in a letter sent by Trump to Khamenei, which proposed direct negotiations on a new deal. If no agreement is reached by June-July, 'a significant wave of sanctions will be imposed on Iran,' a source told The Jerusalem Post. The Europeans have also warned Iran that if there is no agreement by June-July, they will reinstate sanctions through a mechanism known as SnapBack. Iran has denied any intentions to pursue nuclear weapons, but its nuclear program has advanced, bringing it closer to producing a nuclear weapon. Trump has warned that if Iran rejects his proposal and fails to negotiate, the likelihood of US or Israeli military action against Iran's nuclear facilities would significantly increase.

**The Art of a New Iranian Nuclear Deal in 2025**
The US and Iran are at a critical juncture in nuclear negotiations. The Trump administration must clearly articulate realistic US objectives for a nuclear deal, distance itself from calls for the complete dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program, and articulate how Tehran will benefit from an agreement. The administration should also refrain from making counterproductive threats of military force against Iranian nuclear sites and press for immediate, direct talks. Failure to take advantage of the limited window for diplomacy risks escalating an already precarious situation. An effective deal could increase the current breakout time to a half-dozen bombs' worth of weapons-grade uranium by combining restrictions and limitations on enrichment levels, centrifuge capacity, and uranium stockpiles. The agreement should also include a plan for Iran to work with the IAEA to close gaps in the agency's knowledge about Iran's nuclear history. The US should prioritize retaining US nonproliferation expertise within the government and consult with the E3 about the technical parameters of an effective deal. The region could also play a role in reducing nuclear tensions by supporting US-Iran nuclear negotiations and providing economic incentives to Iran as part of a nuclear deal.
