**The 'Magnificent Seven' Stocks: A Mixed Performance in 2025**
The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, have a combined market capitalization of over $14.6 trillion, representing more than 30% of the S&P 500. However, their group performance fell 14% in 2025. While these highly valued stocks have dominated the market in recent years, their high returns have not been seen in 2025, with the group's performance decreasing by 14%, while the rest of the S&P 500 increased by 0.8%. Despite this, the group's historical performance shows that they have significantly outperformed the rest of the market in the long term. However, some of the seven have had a more volatile price trajectory than others, with Nvidia performing well due to its innovative chip development, while Tesla's stock price fluctuated due to concerns about its growth prospects. Analysts recommend using momentum indicators to decide whether to invest in these stocks, as well as fundamental data such as sales, costs, and earnings. The growth of income is expected to continue, driven by the expansion of artificial intelligence. It is essential to remember the high volatility of most of these stocks, as well as the high correlation between their returns, which can have a significant impact on portfolios in both bullish and bearish markets. The future of these companies in investors' portfolios depends on the current technological boom and their ability to adapt to changing environments. When investing in these types of assets, it is crucial to consider the risks and challenges they represent, such as cybersecurity threats, economic crises, and market saturation. A careful and balanced analysis is required to include these assets in a portfolio, considering their strengths and the different factors that can impact their future performance.

**US-China tariff agreement may add fuel to 'Magnificent 7' stock rally**
The US-China tariff agreement may boost the 'Magnificent 7' stock rally. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) surged 6% in premarket trading after the news. Analysts are optimistic about the Mag 7's ability to monetize AI capex and increase capex guidance. 'I think given that [Mag 7] are showing that they can still monetize AI capex and some of them are increasing capex guidance as well is quite positive,' said eToro global markets analyst Lale Akoner. The US and China agreed to reduce tariffs for 90 days, and traders believe this may lead to new highs for the market and tech stocks in 2025. The Mag 7 companies have delivered impressive earnings growth, with an average of 28% growth in the first quarter, compared to 9% growth for the S&P 500. 'With US/China clearly on an accelerated path for a broader deal we believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table in 2025 as investors will likely focus on the next steps in these trade discussions which will happen over the coming months,' said Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.

**Amazon stock leads 'Magnificent Seven' surge after US-China temporary trade truce**
Amazon led the 'Magnificent Seven' Big Tech stocks in a surge early Monday after the US and China announced a temporary trade war truce. The US agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will lower its retaliatory duties on US goods from 125% to 10%. The temporary reduction in rates will run for 90 days. Analysts believe this news is bullish for the tech trade, as supply chain concerns will be significantly reduced. For Amazon, this is particularly significant, as 30% of its total value of goods sold comes from China, and Chinese advertisers account for 14% of total spending on Amazon advertising in 2024. Other 'Magnificent Seven' firms, including Apple and Nvidia, also stand to benefit from the trade truce, as they have significant ties to China. According to analyst Dan Ives, 'there is more wood to chop around chip restrictions (H20/Nvidia) and other issues in the AI trade that need to be addressed as part of a broader deal with US/China.'

Tesla's stock also soared, reclaiming a market valuation above $1 trillion, as investors are optimistic about the company's planned rollout of its robotaxi service and its continued investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure.

**Tesla Leads 'Magnificent Seven' Rally After U.S.-China Tariff Breakthrough**
Tesla shares surged 7% on Monday after the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day deal to ease trade tensions through mutual tariff reductions. The U.S. will lower its tariffs on most Chinese imports from 145% to 30% starting May 14, while China will reduce its tariffs on American goods from 125% to 10%. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the rollback is meant to give both sides space to resolve outstanding trade concerns. The agreement sparked a broad rally in tech stocks, with Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Nvidia also seeing significant gains. This marks the first major de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade dispute since tensions began escalating again in late 2024.

**Is Meta Platforms a Better "Magnificent Seven" Stock to Buy Right Now Than Apple?**
Meta Platforms appears to be a better 'Magnificent Seven' stock to buy right now than Apple, according to recent performance and growth projections. Meta's share price has rebounded and is now in positive territory year to date, with revenue jumping 16% year over year in Q1 to $42.3 billion and profits soaring 35%. In contrast, Apple's revenue and earnings rose around 5% year over year in its latest quarter. Wall Street expects Meta to deliver revenue growth of more than 13% in 2025 and 2026, while Apple's revenue is projected to increase by roughly 4% in 2025 and 6% in 2026. Despite these growth disparities, the two stocks' valuations are relatively close, with Meta's forward price-to-earnings ratio at 23.8 and Apple's at 27.1.

**Anatomy Of A Correction: Magnificent 7 Fall Mirrors 2022 Pattern But It's Comparable To 2018: Caused By Repricing Of 'Animal Spirits' Explains Expert - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)**
The current Nasdaq correction closely mirrors the 2022 correction, but according to Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, the underlying causes differ. The Magnificent 7 stocks, including Apple and Amazon, are the common factor driving the index lower. Timmer notes that the 2022 correction was driven by rising rates, while the current correction is driven by a repricing of the 'animal spirits' playbook. He believes that apart from this common factor, the correction is more comparable with 2018, when robust earnings growth was offset by contracting P/E multiples. Timmer also notes that 1998 and 1968 were similar to 2025 in terms of 'speed and depth'. As of Wednesday, the Nasdaq 100 remains in correction territory, having fallen 11.19% from its prior peak. John Murillo attributes the current technology stock sell-off to a confluence of factors, including interest rate sensitivity and trade tensions. Edward Yardeni believes that China's development of affordable AI chips and open-source large language models could burst the 'AI bubble', ultimately reducing AI investment and impacting the profitability of the Magnificent 7 stocks.

**🔒 FT: How do you know when a bubble has popped? - Brooke Masters**
The current market turmoil may be reminiscent of the dotcom bubble in 2000, where investors were throwing money at unprofitable internet companies. Despite regulators' warnings, the Financial Times was optimistic about the 'phenomenal Nasdaq' reaching 'dizzying heights' even five weeks after the index began to tumble. Today, the S&P 500 has given up all its post-presidential election gains, and the Magnificent Seven big tech stocks are in correction territory, down 12% from their highs. Investors are starting to ask questions about the billions of dollars being spent on artificial intelligence and when it will translate into increased growth. Jim Grant, a financial journalist, says 'all the signs of a classic bubble are upon us,' but warns that 'the timing is unknowable and contrived to torture the earliest adopting bear.'

**Improving Investor Behavior: Safety in numbers**
A social psychology experiment by Solomon Asch showed that people tend to follow the herd, even when it makes no logical sense. This phenomenon is also seen in investor behavior, where the 'Magnificent Seven' companies in the S&P 500 have accounted for half of the index's 2024 gain, despite being only 33% of the total weighting. Historically, we've had our share of bubbles, and the fear of missing out can drive irrational optimism. However, the valuation metric price-to-earnings ratio of the Magnificent Seven reveals an average of about 32, which is roughly 33% above the market's average of 24. The author argues that this is not outrageous, given the companies' unique position and revenue generation. It's essential to understand your 'why' and 'why now' for owning a particular asset and to avoid the herd mentality by staying objective and grounded in solid fundamentals.

**The Coming Financial Crash: A Warning from History**
The author warns of an impending financial crisis, citing the current stock market bubble and the similarities to past crashes. The Magnificent-7 stocks have increased by a factor of 30, with Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla leading the way. The author notes that the number of stocks driving the bubble is decreasing, and the margin debt is at an all-time high. The author also mentions the current housing market bubble, with the national Case-Shiller home price index at an all-time high, 85% higher than the previous bubble high in 2007 and 130% higher than the post-bubble low in 2012. The author believes that the crash will be severe and swift, and that the government's attempts to manipulate the market will only make things worse. The author also mentions the potential for a global economic collapse, citing the high levels of debt and the increasing wealth gap. The author concludes that the current situation is unsustainable and that a crash is inevitable.

**Is This Time Different?**
The article argues that this time is not different, and that the current stock market bubble will eventually pop. The author cites historical examples of market bubbles, including the 1929 crash, and notes that the current bubble is even larger, with the 'Magnificent 7' stocks (Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla) up by a factor of 30. The author also notes that the housing market is overvalued, with the Case-Shiller national home price index at an all-time high. The article suggests that a recession or investors regaining common sense will trigger the collapse, and that the 'greed is good' mantra of Wall Street shysters will not save them. The author also mentions the possibility of a 'Great Taking' and the implementation of CBDCs as part of the 'Great Reset'. The article concludes that the crash will come sooner rather than later, but notes that the timing is uncertain.

**IS THIS TIME DIFFERENT?**
The author argues that 'this time is different' is a myth, and that the current stock market bubble will eventually pop. They cite historical examples of previous bubbles, including the 1929 crash, and note that the current Magnificent 7 stocks (Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla) have seen a 30-fold increase in value, with 75% of the S&P 500's gain in the last two years attributed to these seven stocks. The author also criticizes the 'experts' on Wall Street for their role in inflating the bubble and warns that the 'greed is good' mantra drives their decisions. They predict a big, bad, and fast crash, potentially triggered by a recession or investors regaining common sense, and note that the national debt is four times as large as it was during the 2007 bubble. The author also speculates that the Deep State may be able to 'pull it' and crash the economy to neuter Trump for his final two years or pave the way for the implementation of CBDCs and a Great Reset.

**Where might growth emerge as the Magnificent Seven’s dominance fades?**
Bai, a market expert, warns that the current market is overconcentrated, similar to the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the Nifty Fifty in the early 1970s. However, he expects the aftermath of this period to be different from past bubble periods. The Magnificent Seven, a group of high-performing stocks, will continue to be steady due to their strong earnings growth, but the rest of the market will catch up, creating a positive environment. Bai suggests that investors can capitalize on cheaper stocks with solid growth potential in sectors like financials, healthcare, and energy. He also expects the new Trump administration's pro-business policy tilt to support broad U.S. market performance. Bai emphasizes the importance of active management in this environment, citing the NEI Select RS Portfolios as a solution. He also highlights the importance of re-optimization, a process that involves revisiting capital market assumptions to ensure portfolio allocations are optimized for long-term returns.

**The Ninety One Outlook for 2025**
Ninety One, a South African asset manager, presented their outlook for 2025 at a recent webinar. They highlighted the remarkable growth of the US market, particularly the 'Magnificent 7' companies, which have delivered 107% and 67% returns in 2023 and 2024, respectively. However, this growth raises concerns about whether these companies are in bubble territory and whether their investments in AI will be successful. Ninety One's return expectations for the next five years show a 2% real return for US equities, but they anticipate higher returns from global equities and South African-listed global equity companies. The presentation also discussed market concentration and the risks associated with it, as well as the impact of sentiment and valuations on the market. As Matthew Matthee, a wealth management expert, noted, 'We will likely find out in the next couple of years whether these companies can genuinely monetize AI or are simply pursuing it out of fear of missing out.'

**Is the U.S. stock market in a bubble? It depends on who you ask**
The U.S. stock market has seen a two-year run, defying even the most optimistic forecasts, with the S&P 500 gaining 24% in 2023 and 23% in 2024. The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, NVIDIA, and Tesla, have been major contributors, accounting for 53% of the S&P's returns last year and now making up over one-third of the S&P's total market capitalization. According to the article, the market's performance can be attributed to falling inflation, lower interest rates, healthy corporate earnings, and a strong economy.
