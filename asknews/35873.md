**New Republican Tax Bill Could Devastate EV Sales by Removing Incentives**
The Republican House has passed a bill that could devastate electric vehicle (EV) sales by removing incentives for automakers and EV customers. The bill would phase out the Clean Vehicle Credit, which currently offers $7500 off qualified new vehicles, and add new registration fees for hybrid and electric vehicles. According to a Princeton University study, if the incentives are repealed, EV sales will make up only 24% of new car sales in 2030, down from the projected 40% if the incentives remain in place. As one expert notes, 'The new bill would effectively kill the clean-vehicle credit program for nearly all established automakers at the end of this year.'

**California Says 'See You In Court' After EV Rules Rolled Back**
California's decades-long crusade against air pollution and its ambitious plan to fully electrify its roads took a hit this week. The Republican-led Senate voted to overturn the state's landmark plan to end sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state is fighting back, marking its 23rd lawsuit against the Trump administration this year. Bonta stated, 'The federal government's overreach is illogical, it's politically motivated, and it comes at the expense of Californians' lives and livelihoods.' The rollback of California's emissions waiver threatens to stall the country's broader climate goals. EV sales in the U.S. reached record highs last year and the first quarter of this year, but House Republicans dealt an untimely blow to the EV industry by passing a bill to end the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for consumers and for local EV factories. If the bill passes in the Senate, it would effectively mean that the U.S. is surrendering to China's technological lead in EVs, setting the country back after years of progress.

**So long, EV tax credits**
The US House of Representatives has passed a bill to end the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for clean energy, including the $7,500 EV tax credit. The bill would also eliminate the $4,000 tax credit for used EV purchases and kill incentives for companies building solar, wind, and battery storage projects. Additionally, EV owners would be subject to an annual $250 tax, while hybrid owners would pay $100. This move is seen as a blow to the EV industry, which was expecting to benefit from the federal incentives. As Matthew Zeitlin notes, 'the clean energy supporters were always the weakest faction amid a fractious GOP.' The bill now heads to the Senate for reconciliation, where its fate remains uncertain. However, the move is seen as a step backward for the US in its efforts to transition to clean energy, and it may fall further behind other developed nations like China.

**House republicans vote to send US EV jobs to China, give trillions to US elites**
House Republicans have passed a tax proposal that eliminates tax credits for working families to become more energy efficient, improve US air quality, and boost US manufacturing. The credits, established under President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, drove a boost in American manufacturing and created hundreds of thousands of jobs. However, the Republican bill channels the money to wealthy elites, increasing the deficit by trillions of dollars. The bill eliminates the US EV tax credit, which had driven investment in US manufacturing, and repeals EPA pollution rules that would save thousands of American lives and $100 billion per year. The bill will now go to the Senate, where Republicans have shown they will do anything to harm Americans. Democrats voted against the job-killing measure, while only two Republicans, Davidson and Massie, voted to support American jobs.

**IRA's Section 6418 Transferable Credits: Will They Be Expanded to Other Industries?**
Elected representatives are pushing to expand transferable tax credits to various industries, as seen in recent proposed legislation. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) introduced Section 6418, allowing for the transfer of federal tax credits, which has been successful in the clean energy, investment, and production sectors. The market for tax credit transfers has grown significantly, with $25 billion in current-year credits changing hands in 2024. However, House Republicans are considering a bill that would repeal most clean energy tax credits and eliminate tax credit transferability after 2027. Despite this, proposals are being made to expand transferable credits to industries such as advanced agricultural technologies, shipbuilding, and the production of baby formula and electric bicycles. Senator Mark Kelly's proposed Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security for America Act of 2025 (SHIPS Act) aims to increase U.S. shipbuilding and shipyard investment through transferable tax credits. Enterprises in agricultural technology, mining and processing of natural resources, and community development and revitalization could benefit from Washington's renewed appetite for salable tax credits.

**Climate dollars gushed to red states. Now senators are in a bind.**
The House has passed a tax bill that would eliminate hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy subsidies, which are overwhelmingly flowing to red states. This move has put Republican senators in a bind, as they must choose between supporting the party line or maintaining support for government programs that are creating economic activity in their states. The bill would rapidly phase out tax incentives contained in the Inflation Reduction Act, which Congress passed in 2022, and would eliminate a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles. Analysts and advocates warn that the cuts would threaten the stability of the power grid, lead to energy shortages, and cede the United States' leadership role in global efforts to combat climate change. 'If this bill becomes law, America will effectively surrender the AI race to China and communities nationwide will face blackouts,' said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. 'The majority of the government spending is creating jobs and manufacturing capacity in red states,' said Jason Bordoff, the founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. 'So this puts Republicans, generally and now in the Senate, in the position of having to choose whether to support the party line or maintain support for government programs that are creating a lot of economic activity in their states.'

**What’s in Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ bill that passed the House**
The House has passed a sweeping tax and spending cuts package, which includes several key provisions from President Trump's campaign promises. The package would add $3.8 trillion to the nation's debt over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It includes a $2,500 child tax credit, a new 'Trump account' for children, and a deduction for car loan interest. The package would also raise the standard deduction by $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married couples. Additionally, it would make permanent the larger estate tax exemption and beef up the deduction for pass-through businesses. The bill would also hike the current limit on state and local tax deductions to $40,000 annually, up from $10,000. However, the full amount would be limited to those making $500,000 or less. The package would also provide $45 billion to build new immigration detention facilities, including family detention centers, and support hiring 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. It would also provide $46.5 billion to expand and modernize the border barrier system. Furthermore, it would eliminate seven green programs authorized by the Democrats' 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and levy an annual registration fee of $250 on electric vehicles and $100 on hybrid vehicles. The bill would also limit the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's authority to draw funds from the Federal Reserve and essentially eliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

**Tesla (TSLA) is badly affected by Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' the GOP just passed**
The 'Big Beautiful Bill' passed by the US Congress is expected to negatively impact Tesla's business in the long term. The bill eliminates the EV tax credit, introduces a $250 annual fee for electric vehicles and a $100 fee for hybrids, and terminates credits for most clean energy initiatives. However, the author believes that the bill may help Tesla's demand in the short term, as it will make electric vehicles more expensive for consumers, potentially increasing demand for Tesla's products. The author notes that Tesla investors are 'delusional' and believe that the company will solve self-driving within the next year and become unstoppable, but warns that the bill's effects will be felt in 2026.

**This Is What The House-Passed Trump Tax Bill Means For Tesla And EVs**
The U.S. House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump's tax bill, which repeals several Biden-era tax credits and policies aimed at supporting EV adoption. The bill eliminates the tax credit of up to $7,500 for EV purchases, but includes a 'special rule' to keep IRA tax credits in place through 'taxable year' 2026 for automakers that haven't yet sold 200,000 EV units by the end of 2025. This would give extra runway for Rivian, Lucid, and other EV startups. Tesla, General Motors, Ford, and others would not be able to take advantage of the tax credit. The bill also restricts and phases out the IRA's 'advanced manufacturing production credit' and eliminates the tax credit for wind energy components sold after the end of 2027 and for all other components at the end of 2031. Tesla stock is up 18.6% in May, but is still down about 17% this year as of Wednesday's stock market close.

**US House Republicans Propose Repeal of Electric Vehicle Tax Credit**
The US House of Representatives' Republican majority has proposed a bill to repeal the electric vehicle tax credit (30D) under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) by 2027. The original deadline for the tax credit was December 31, 2032, but the new bill advances it to December 31, 2026. Additionally, if a company sells more than 20,000 electric vehicles in the US between 2009 and 2025, their vehicles will no longer be eligible for the tax credit. The IRA allows taxpayers to claim up to $7,500 in tax credits for electric vehicles assembled in North America with key minerals and battery requirements met. However, to fund Trump's tax cuts, the Republican majority plans to repeal the electric vehicle tax credit and other clean energy initiatives from the previous Biden administration. The bill also proposes to repeal the '45W tax credit' for commercial electric vehicles after December 31, 2025. The '45W tax credit' is an exception that allows commercial electric vehicles to receive tax credits even if they do not meet the origin requirements. This decision is seen as a response to the Korean government and industry's requests, but some Republicans have criticized it as a 'loophole.' The tax credit for used electric vehicle buyers will also be repealed. The advanced manufacturing production tax credit (45X) for Korean battery companies will be phased out by 2031. The original plan was to gradually reduce the tax credit amount and phase it out by 2033, but the Republican bill will maintain it until the end of 2031. Additionally, products from prohibited foreign entities will no longer be eligible for tax credits, which is seen as a measure to prevent Chinese companies from benefiting from the tax credit.

**Here's every used EV that qualifies for a $4,000 tax credit as of May 2025**
As of May 2025, you can still claim up to $4,000 in federal tax credits for purchasing a used EV, thanks to revised terms in the Inflation Reduction Act. To qualify, the used EV must be purchased from a licensed dealer for $25,000 or less and meet certain criteria, including being a 'qualified previously owned electric vehicle' or 'fuel cell vehicle'. The credit is equal to 30% of the sale price, up to $4,000. It's essential to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult a tax professional and EV dealer to confirm eligibility. Currently, the following all-electric models qualify for the tax credit:

**Trump Wants To End the EV Tax Credit  --  Should You Buy One Before It Expires?**
The Trump Administration has targeted the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles (EVs), which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Experts weigh in on whether to buy an EV now or wait. Melanie Musson, an auto industry expert, advises against buying a new car if you don't need one, even with the tax credit. However, Alex Black of EpicVIN suggests taking advantage of the tax credit before it expires, as EV inventory levels have increased and waiting lists have decreased. Pragathi Darapaneni, an engineer at Schaeffler Asia, cautions against holding out for short-term gains, as the next generation of battery technology is still in development. 'The next generation of battery technology is still in development,' Darapaneni said. 'If you're waiting for major leaps in range, charging time or cost, you're better off capitalizing on today's incentives and upgrading in five to seven years when solid-state and other advanced chemistries mature.'

**Tax Credit of $7,500 for New Electric Vehicles: What You Need to Know**
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offers a tax credit of up to $7,500 for purchasing a new electric or fuel cell vehicle. To qualify, the vehicle must be assembled in North America and meet certain requirements related to critical minerals and battery components. The credit amount depends on the date of purchase, with a maximum of $7,500 for vehicles purchased between January 1 and April 17, 2023, and a maximum of $3,750 for vehicles purchased after April 18, 2023, if they meet only one of the criteria. The vehicle must have an external charging system and a battery of at least 7 kilowatt-hours, weigh less than 14,000 pounds, and be manufactured by a company that has sold fewer than 200,000 electric vehicles in the US. Some eligible manufacturers include Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Ford, Jeep, Lincoln, Mercedes, Nissan, Rivian, Tesla, Volvo, and Volkswagen. The credit can be transferred directly to the dealer at the time of purchase, starting in 2024. To verify if a vehicle meets the requirements, use the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) decoder available on the US Department of Energy's website.

**Shocker: Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act Led To A Lot More EV Sales**
According to J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Electric Vehicle Experience (EVX) Ownership Study, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) led to a significant increase in EV sales. The study found that updates to the IRA more than doubled the number of owners who received a federal tax credit, with over half of BEV buyers citing tax credits as a reason for purchasing their vehicle. J.D. Power noted that the growing number of mass market BEV models and improving EV charging infrastructure also contributed to the growth in EV sales. The study also found that public charging satisfaction among mass market BEV owners increased by 86 points year over year, as infrastructure buildout continues. As J.D. Power wrote, 'Notably, updates to the Inflation Reduction Act more than doubled the amount of owners who indicated they received a federal tax credit/rebate, and more than half of BEV buyers cited tax credits as a reason for purchasing their vehicle, which is among the most influential purchase drivers.'

**Cox: EVs are America's future, but policy will set the pace**
According to Cox Automotive's Q4 data, the US EV market closed 2024 with a record 365,824 EVs sold, a 15.2% increase from the previous quarter, and annual EV sales of 1.3 million, a 7% increase from 2023. Stephanie Valdez Streaty, strategic planning director at Cox Automotive, attributes the growth to leasing, which has fewer restrictions than purchase incentives, and the current federal tax structure. She notes that Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y continue to lead the pack, but other models like Honda's Prologue and Chevrolet's Equinox and Blazer EVs are gaining ground. Price remains the biggest barrier for would-be EV buyers, but manufacturers are working to broaden consumer choice at more affordable price points. If the $7,500 federal Inflation Reduction Act EV tax credit is canceled, states like Colorado and California may step in with their own subsidies. Streaty predicts a 10% EV market share by 2025, but growth will slow compared to the initial surge, and hinge on consumer confidence, price parity with gas-powered cars, and the reliability of fast-charging infrastructure.

**Do you think the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles is a good thing or a bad thing?**
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles (EVs) in the USA. Some argue that the government should not interfere in the free market economy by offering incentives, while others claim that the incentives improve the economy and lower emissions. The IRA has led to billions being poured into the economy, with automakers investing in US-based battery plants and creating thousands of new jobs. For example, Hyundai is building a massive battery plant in Georgia, Scout will build everything in the USA, and Panasonic is building the world's largest battery plant in Kansas. As impartial outsiders, the question remains: is the IRA a good thing or a bad thing?

**Do You Qualify for the Electric Vehicle Tax Credit? Here's What to Know for 2025**
The clean vehicle tax credit offers up to $7,500 for qualifying new vehicles and up to $4,000 for qualifying used vehicles. To qualify, you must meet income requirements and purchase a vehicle that meets specific criteria, such as assembly and battery component requirements. The Inflation Reduction Act has made changes to the program, including removing the cap on manufacturers and expanding the definition of clean vehicles. You can claim the credit on your tax return or transfer it to the dealer at the point of sale. It's essential to confirm your eligibility before making a purchase and to understand the changes introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act.
