**BRIEF-UK Should Expand Army's Size When Funding Allows, Review...**
The UK's Strategic Defence Review recommends increasing the number of regular army personnel when funding allows, likely in the next parliament. The review also suggests reducing the Ministry of Defence's civil service costs by at least 10% by 2030. The authors of the review state that their plan can be accelerated if needed in a turbulent world. The review emphasizes the importance of backing Ukraine in its pursuit of a durable political settlement, as well as learning from its experience in land warfare, drone, and hybrid conflict. The review also highlights the key role of the US-China relationship in a more multipolar world marked by 'great power' competition. According to the review, China is seeking to establish dominance in the Indo-Pacific, erode US influence, and put pressure on the rules-based order. The review recommends keeping military-to-military channels of communication with China. Additionally, the review warns that Russia's war economy, if sustained, will enable it to rebuild land capabilities more quickly in the event of a ceasefire in Ukraine. The review identifies the Middle East and Indo-Pacific as the next priority regions for defence engagement after the Euro-Atlantic.

**UK Announces Construction of 12 New Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarines 'A Message to Moscow'**
The UK has announced the construction of 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines as part of its Defense Review, which Prime Minister Starmer said will give the British army more power against hostile states like Russia and China. According to Starmer, 'The threat is more serious, more immediate, more unpredictable than ever since the Cold War.' The new defense strategy is 'a message to Moscow,' said Defense Minister John Healey, referring to the 'growing' threat posed by Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Starmer has also committed to building at least six new ammunition factories in the UK, creating a hybrid Royal Navy combining drones with warships, submarines, and aircraft, improving living conditions and equipment for military personnel, and investing £15 billion in a nuclear program. The UK is preparing for war at a 'war footing' because Russia is showing it does not want peace, and the best way to deter aggressors is to be ready. Starmer has promised to create a stronger and fully trained reserve, strengthen NATO by making the largest contribution to the alliance since its creation, and invest in innovation. The UK's defense spending will increase to 2.5% by 2027 and 3% by 2030.

**Starmer Strengthens UK's Anti-Russia Stance: 'We Must Be Ready for War'**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has outlined a new military and defense strategy, focusing on the 'threat' posed by Russia. He stated, 'If we want to deter a conflict, the best way is to prepare for a conflict.' The strategy includes plans for 12 new nuclear-powered submarines, massive investments in munitions, and a command center for coordinating cyberattacks against Russia and China. The opposition Tory party and conservative media are skeptical, noting that Starmer remains vague on resources and has made a 'half-step back' on the timeline for increasing military spending from 2.5% to 3% of GDP, now aiming for 2034 instead of 2027. Starmer emphasized the need for national unity in the face of an increasingly unstable and dangerous world. The three main objectives of the new strategy are to make the country 'ready for war,' strengthen NATO, and accelerate military innovation to make the UK a 'leader among allies.' Specific plans include building six new munitions factories, creating a hybrid coordination center for the Royal Navy, and investing £15 billion in modernizing the nuclear arsenal.

**US-China rivalry requires Indonesia to review defense posture - Academia - The Jakarta Post**
The US-China rivalry is reshaping the global order, with significant ramifications for Indonesia. As Hans Morgenthau said, 'International politics, like all politics, is a struggle for power.' The economic front of this rivalry, which began in 2025 with a 10% tariff imposed by the US on imported goods, has ignited a tit-for-tat tariff war, impacting global supply chains and economies worldwide, including Indonesia's. The military aspect of this rivalry has also presented a new and alarming dimension, as seen during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, where Pakistan's military, equipped with Chinese-made weaponry, could match India's more expensive Western and Russian platforms in a three-day war.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**Western Media Predicts Devastating War by 2025**
Western media has gathered predictions from four well-known psychics, including Nostradamus and Bulgarian Baba Vanga, who claim that a devastating war will occur by the end of 2025. According to their predictions, the war will be so catastrophic that it will 'destroy' the population and lead to the 'destruction of humanity'. Atoos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian, also known as the 'Living Nostradamus', warned that the world is on the brink of a Third World War, stating that 'it will not be just a war between people, but also between machines, and the worst is yet to come'. Nicholas Aujula, a hypnotherapist from London, agrees that 2025 will be a year of 'lack of compassion' in the world, predicting 'horrific acts of human cruelty and violence towards each other - in the name of religion and nationalism'. The article concludes by speculating that Russia's recent actions, including the annexation of Ukraine and the threat of nuclear war, may be a cause for concern, but ultimately, the predictions of the psychics are unclear and may be a form of propaganda.

**China's 'Made in China 2035' Plan: A Response to US Pressure or a Desperate Attempt to Revive Economy?**
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has announced its plan to prioritize manufacturing, dubbed 'Made in China 2035', in response to pressure from the US. However, experts question whether this shift will be enough to address the country's deep-seated economic issues, including inflation, overcapacity, and extreme imbalance. The CCP's plan is seen as a response to the US's efforts to promote American re-industrialization, led by President Trump's global tariffs. The tariffs have been a key factor in the US-China trade war, with the US seeking to block China's practice of 'dumping' goods on the global market. The CCP's financial system is also facing risks, with six major state-owned banks experiencing declining profits and rising non-performing loans. Some experts warn that China may enter a period of negative interest rates, which could have significant implications for the economy.

**Portnikov Predicts War to Continue Until 2032**
According to political observer Vasily Portnikov, the hot phase of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which typically lasts 7-10 years, may continue until 2032. After that, a phase of conflict with possible battles and bombings may begin. Portnikov emphasized the need to prepare for a peaceful next phase of the conflict, which could last at least 10-15 years, by receiving help from the Americans and Europeans, improving Ukrainian policy and mobilization, and enhancing Ukraine's military-industrial complex. 'We need to prepare and prepare for a war that is still very short in terms of the nature of this conflict. This is only the first stage. There will be a second, third,' Portnikov warned. He believes that there are no objective grounds for the war to end in the near future, but suggested that under favorable circumstances (Russia's economic situation and US pressure), the fighting may stop in this or the next year. 'The war will not end in our lifetime. The fire will stop,' he stressed.

**China, the war-monger - The Singapore Post**
China has rejected a proposal from US President Donald Trump to cut the defense budget by 50%, which would have reduced the chance of a global war and spared funds for development. Instead, China has increased its defense budget to a record high of $249 billion, a 7.2% increase over the previous year. This move has triggered an arms race, with the US and its allies stepping up their defense efforts to combat the threat. The US has announced plans to develop a next-generation fighter jet, the NGAD, which will be way ahead of any other fighter aircraft of the current generation. China has been modernizing its navy and air force, with plans to possess six aircraft carriers by 2035. The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is on the rise, and nations facing the Chinese threat are not sitting idle, increasing their defense budgets and developing advanced arms and weapon platforms. Posterity will brand China as the war-monger, having triggered an arms race through its aggressive moves.

**Jean Dixon's Disturbing Forecast for 2025: A Major Conflict Between China and Russia**
American psychic Jean Dixon, who predicted some of the most significant tragedies of the 20th century, has made a disturbing forecast for 2025. According to Daily Mail, Dixon, who gained widespread popularity in the US for her prophetic predictions, warned of a major conflict between China and Russia between 2025 and 2037. In her book 'My Life and Predictions' (1969), Dixon wrote: 'In 2025, China will achieve such political and economic stability that it will begin a massive expansion. It will invade Russia, capture its northern territories, and advance as far as Scandinavia, reaching the borders of Germany. Western Europe will not be involved. Meanwhile, Russia will establish control over several countries in the Middle East and Africa, including Iran, Ethiopia, and Libya. This conflict will last 12 years, until 2037.' Dixon claimed to have received her visions from God and had the support of religious communities, but not all of her predictions came true.

**Jeane Dixon's Terrifying Prediction for 2025: China Declaring War on Russia**
Jeane Dixon, a renowned astrologer, predicted in her 1969 book 'Ma vie et mes prophéties' that China would declare war on Russia between 2025 and 2037. According to Dixon, China would conquer parts of Russia's northern territory, advancing into Scandinavia and reaching the German border, but not invading Western Europe. Meanwhile, Dixon predicted that Russia's sphere of influence would expand beyond Eastern Europe to Africa and the Middle East, including countries like Libya, Ethiopia, Iran, and others. Dixon's predictions have been accurate in the past, including the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the Watergate scandal. However, not all of her predictions have come true, such as her prediction of a Third World War in 1958 and a second Holocaust in the 1980s. Dixon also believed that Rome would rise again to become the world's greatest empire, which never materialized. Dixon's predictions have left many wondering if 2025 will mark a turning point in global politics.

**Russia Aims to Complete War Against Ukraine by 2026, Says Intelligence Official**
According to Vadim Skibitsky, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) of the Ministry of Defense, Russia aims to complete the war against Ukraine by 2026. Skibitsky stated that a prolonged war would prevent Russia from competing with the US and China. He also mentioned that the Kremlin has developed 15 scenarios for possible military conflicts by 2045, with six related to Northern Europe and four to Poland. Additionally, Moscow has prepared a geopolitical forecast for 2026-2035, which indicates that the war against Ukraine should be completed by 2026. As Skibitsky noted, 'If the war continues for another 5-10 years, Russia will never be able to catch up and become on the same level as the US and China.' Skibitsky emphasized that Ukraine plays a crucial role in the new system of European security.

**Germany's BND Warns of Russia's Plans for Large-Scale War with NATO**
According to the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND), Russia is preparing for a large-scale war with NATO. The BND report states that the Kremlin views its relations with the West as a systemic conflict and is willing to use force to achieve its goals. The BND estimates that by the end of the current decade (2030), Russia may be fully prepared for a 'large-scale conventional war'. The Lithuanian intelligence service believes that while Russia is not yet ready to attack the entire alliance, it may 'test NATO' by launching military operations against one or more member countries to understand how the alliance will react to a threat. The BND report notes that despite the full-scale war with Ukraine, Russia's air force and navy remain combat-ready. If the war in Ukraine ends, Russian troops may be redeployed to the borders of Baltic countries. The report also states that Russia is replenishing its losses in the war against Ukraine and the Russian defense industry is producing more weapons than needed for the current war. Russia's military spending is growing at a record pace, reaching nearly €120 billion in 2025, which is 6% of its GDP. The Kremlin also plans to increase the size of its army to 1.5 million personnel and increase the amount of equipment and technology on its borders with NATO by 30-50%. As a reminder, Russia has already predicted 15 possible military conflict scenarios by 2045. About half of these scenarios relate to Northern Europe. 'Russia will try to resolve the Ukrainian issue by 2026,' said Vadim Skibitsky, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, during a roundtable discussion 'New contours of European security'. 'If the war continues for another 5-10 years, Russia will never be able to catch up with the US and China,' Skibitsky added. The Kremlin's geopolitical calculations relate to the period 2026-2035, with consequences extending to 2045. Countries in the Baltic region and Poland are at particular risk, according to Skibitsky.

**Russia Predicts 15 Military Conflict Scenarios by 2045, Ukraine's GUR Reveals**
The Ukrainian military's Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) has revealed that Russia has predicted 15 possible military conflict scenarios by 2045, with six of them related to northern Europe. According to GUR's deputy head, Vasily Skibitsky, 'Six of them are related to northern Europe. And... northern Europe understands, the Baltic countries understand, Poland understands. There are only four scenarios of a possible military conflict in Poland. Poland currently understands that this is a direct threat.' Skibitsky emphasized that Russia fully understands its place and role in the modern world and its position in the global leadership system. He added that Russia previously made such a forecast for 2026-2035 years with a perspective to 2045. During this planning, the occupiers identified four scenarios: 'The first is absolute US leadership, the second is the growing role of China, the third is a multipolar world where Russia sees itself too, and the fourth is regionalization, as they called it, by regions. In essence, by regions... we are seeing this too. And... Russia has clearly defined in these documents that the Ukrainian issue must be completed by 2026. They are based on those scenario analyses and that forecast. Because if the war continues for another 5-10 years, Russia will never be able to catch up and become on the same level as the US and China. It will forever remain a regional player on our Eastern European level,' Skibitsky explained. He also noted that Russia's aggression against Ukraine has actually been ongoing not since 2014, but immediately after the collapse of the USSR. 'You all remember Crimea, Tuzla, and other issues. And... the role of our state in recognizing and new approaches to organizing the European security system is invaluable,' he emphasized.

**Russia Predicts 15 Possible Military Conflict Scenarios by 2045, Direct Threat to Poland**
Russia has predicted 15 possible military conflict scenarios by 2045, with six of them affecting Northern Europe. According to General-Major Vadim Skibitsky, deputy head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, countries in Northern Europe, particularly the Baltic states and Poland, are aware of the potential threat. Skibitsky stated that Poland is directly threatened by four possible military conflict scenarios. 'For Poland, there are only four scenarios of a possible military conflict. Poland now understands that this is a direct threat,' he said. Russia has previously prepared a forecast of events from 2026 to 2035 with a perspective to 2045, identifying four possible scenarios of the world order. The first scenario involves the absolute dominance of the US, the second the strengthening of China's role, the third a multipolar world where Russia aims to become one of the key players, and the fourth regionalization, or the division of influence into separate regions. Skibitsky noted that Russia's strategic documents clearly state the intention to complete the 'Ukrainian question' by 2026. He believes this is because a prolonged war for 5-10 years would prevent Russia from reaching the level of the US and China, leaving it a regional player in Eastern Europe. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius previously stated that, considering the growth of the Russian army, there is a possibility of Russia attempting to attack NATO countries in 2029-2030. In response, he emphasized the importance of strengthening the Alliance's defense capabilities before then.
