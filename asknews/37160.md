**Senate urged: Pass universal social pension for seniors**
Outgoing Albay Rep. Joey Salceda urged the Senate to pass the universal social pension for senior citizens bill when Congress reconvenes on June 2. Salceda said, 'We are down to the last two session weeks. If there is a time to do this, it's now. This is a legacy we can afford to leave the Filipino people.' He estimated the measure would cost P88.2 billion this year, covering 10.1 million seniors nationwide, but noted that it can be funded through P41 billion in rationalized cash aid and P47 billion in fiscal management mechanisms. Salceda said, 'We're consolidating scattered and politicized cash doles into a clear, rights-based entitlement. It's more efficient, more humane and more just.' He added, 'This is the logic behind taxing foreign digital giants. As technology replaces labor, we must capture productivity and return it to people in the form of social dividends. A universal pension for the elderly is where we start.'

**Trump's 'Massive Tax Cuts' Plan Passes House with Single Vote**
US President Donald Trump's 'massive tax cuts' plan, dubbed 'THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL', has passed the House of Representatives with a single vote, 215-214. The bill promises 'massive tax cuts' in a country with no public healthcare and limited federal social services, and would benefit 71 million low-income Americans who receive Medicaid. The bill also includes funding for Trump's 'strong border security measures' and 'funding for the Golden Dome'. The bill has been criticized for its impact on the national debt, which is already at 124% of GDP, and for its potential to reduce the income of the 10% poorest households while increasing that of the 10% richest. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill now goes to the Senate, where it is expected to pass before Trump can sign it into law. Trump tweeted, 'Great work by House Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican leadership, and thanks to all the Republicans who voted YES on this historic bill. Now it's time for our friends in the US Senate to get to work and send this bill to my desk ASAP! No time to waste.' However, it is not expected to reach the Senate before early June. Democratic Congresswoman Teresa Leger Fern√°ndez said, 'The worst thing they did with this bill is that, to win over the most radical Republicans, they kicked out 300,000 people from their health insurance. And then they established that, even if you have private insurance, that insurer can no longer offer abortion services. This is getting close to a ban on abortion.'

**US House of Representatives Approves 'Grand' Tax Cut and Military Spending Bill**
The US House of Representatives has approved a bill to cut taxes and increase military and border spending, a measure that President Donald Trump has called the 'most important law signed in history'. The bill, which will now go to the Senate, was passed with 215 votes in favor and 214 against. Two Republicans, Thomas Massie and Warren Davidson, voted with Democrats against the measure. The legislation extends the 2017 tax cuts, eliminates taxes on tips and overtime, and reduces Medicaid funding. It also rescinds tax credits for clean energy approved by Democrats in 2022. Trump has described the law as 'unique, great, and beautiful', and has promised 'strong border security measures and salary increases' for immigration agents. He has urged the Senate to pass the bill 'as soon as possible', saying that Democrats have 'lost control and are wandering aimlessly without confidence, courage, or determination'.

**Keir Starmer bracing for crunch figures on immigration**
The UK's net migration figures are expected to be released on Thursday, showing a significant drop of up to 250,000 people. The current estimate stands at 728,000, down from a record 906,000 in June 2023. The Prime Minister has promised that the Government's new immigration measures will lead to a 'significant' fall in net migration over the next four years. The measures include banning the recruitment of care workers from overseas, tightening access to skilled worker visas, and increasing English language requirements for spouses coming to the UK.

**U.S. Congressional leaders call for streamlined visa process ahead of World Cup, LA Olympics**
A bipartisan group of Congressional representatives is urging Secretary of State Marco Rubio to simplify the visa processing system to ensure international visitors can attend the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. The World Cup is expected to generate $3.75 billion in economic activity in the US, with a significant impact on Southern California. However, Rubio's proposed cost-cutting measures, including reducing staff and closing embassies, could increase visa wait times and threaten the economic benefits of the event, potentially keeping tens of thousands of fans at home, as noted by the Los Angeles Times. 'That could keep tens of thousands of fans at home,' the report said. The 2026 World Cup will be the largest in history, with a record 48 countries participating, and will be played in 11 US cities between June 11 and July 19, 2026.

**Enjoying a junket: Subramanian Swamy's quip as MPs embark on global outreach**
Former Union Minister Subramanian Swamy has described the Centre's diplomatic initiative to send all-party delegations to 32 countries to isolate Pakistan on terrorism as a 'junket'. Swamy said the delegations will have no impact and that the members are 'enjoying a junket'. He also suggested that Pakistan should have been 'thrashed more' during Operation Sindoor. Congress's communications in-charge Jairam Ramesh called the initiative 'domestic optics' and 'meaningless', saying it is part of the Narendra Modi government's 'WMD' or 'weapons of mass distraction'. The delegations, comprising 59 leaders across party lines, will travel to around 32 nations between May 22 and June 5 to brief foreign governments on how India has been a victim of terror emanating from Pakistan.

**US House of Representatives Passes Trump Tax Cut Extension Bill**
The US House of Representatives passed a large-scale bill on May 22, 2025, which includes the extension of Trump's tax cuts. However, the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate as is. The Republican Party's congressional leadership aims to pass the bill through negotiations and is targeting a July passage. The bill was passed with 215 votes in favor and 214 against, with some Republicans also voting against it. The opposition Democratic Party and conservative hardliners within the Republican Party, who are concerned about the bill's impact on the budget, were persuaded to support the bill after it was revised just before the vote to secure a majority.

**2025 U.S. Open picks, odds, field: Surprising predictions from same golf model that's nailed 15 majors - CBSSports.com**
A computer model has simulated the 2025 U.S. Open 10,000 times and made some surprising predictions. According to the model, Jon Rahm, a former U.S. Open champion, will struggle and barely crack the top 10. On the other hand, Collin Morikawa, a 22-1 longshot, is expected to make a strong run at the title. The model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of 20-1 or longer who will make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. The model has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020, nailing 15 majors, including the 2025 Masters and the 2025 PGA Championship.

**FIFA Allows Clubs to Make Squad Changes During 2025 Club World Cup**
FIFA has granted participating clubs in the 2025 Club World Cup the ability to make changes to their squads during the tournament, within a limited registration period from June 27 to July 3, 2025. This move aims to provide clubs with more flexibility in replacing or adding players, especially those whose contracts expire at the end of the season. According to FIFA, this measure is intended to encourage clubs to find contractual solutions that enable them to participate in the tournament with their top stars. In line with the 2025 Club World Cup regulations, all 20 member associations participating in the tournament have announced the opening of an exceptional registration window from June 1 to 10, 2025, during which new players can be registered and added to the final squads, which must be submitted by June 10. This step is part of the tournament's regulations, which were approved in October 2024, and aims to reduce the disparities between the participating clubs' seasons and official registration periods, through flexible measures that promote fairness and ensure team readiness.

**Healthcare Preview for the Week of: April 7, 2025 [Podcast]**
This week on Capitol Hill, focus will remain on reconciliation as Republicans aim to pass the unified budget resolution in the House before the Easter recess. The resolution includes instructions to save at least $880 billion, likely from Medicaid reforms. With a narrow House margin of 220-213, Speaker Johnson can only lose three votes to pass the resolution, which may be challenging. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce will mark up 26 bills, including six bipartisan healthcare bills. The Senate will mark up S. 932, the Give Kids a Chance Act, and hold hearings on lowering biosimilar costs and restoring trust in the US Food and Drug Administration. US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kennedy will tour Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico to discuss healthy eating initiatives and banning fluoride in drinking water. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) and Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) will hold their final meetings of the 2024-2025 cycle, voting on recommendations including reforming the physician fee schedule and recommendations for the June report to Congress.

**Spanish Congress Approves Omnibus Decree with Key Measures**
The Spanish Congress has finally approved the omnibus decree, which was rejected by PP, Vox, and Junts two weeks ago. The decision led to a split and ongoing accusations between the parties, particularly towards Junts, a government partner that sided with the opposition. After a 'long negotiation', the government and Junts reached an agreement. The PP initially opposed the decree, but later announced that they would vote in favor of the revised version, which now includes 29 measures. The decree includes several key measures, such as: a 2.8% increase in pensions for contributory pensioners, a 9% increase for non-contributory pensioners, and a 6% increase for minimum pensions; free train travel for frequent passengers; a 50% discount on public transportation; and aid for the promotion of public bike-sharing services. Additionally, the decree maintains the suspension of evictions until December 31, 2025, and extends the social bonus for vulnerable households until the end of 2025.

**Battle for the narrative of the agreement: from the saved dishes of the Government to 'piece by piece' of Junts and the 'submission' of PP**
The Spanish government and Junts have reached an agreement on a new package of measures, including the revaluation of pensions and social benefits. However, the opposition parties, PP and Vox, have criticized the deal, accusing the government of 'surrendering' to Junts' demands. The PP's secretary general, Cuca Gamarra, said that 'S√°nchez has passed from being proud to saying that he couldn't trocear the decree as requested to arrodillarse and humillarse ante Puigdemont at any price to maintain power.' The government's minister for press, Pilar Alegr√≠a, denied any 'surrender' to Junts and attributed the negotiations to 'a complex parliamentary situation.' She added that 'we have to talk, dialogue, and agree with the different parliamentary forces.' The PSOE is satisfied with having overcome a 'critical moment' and 'reconducted' relations with Junts, and believes that this agreement will give an impulse to the negotiations for the new general budgets. Junts' leader, Carles Puigdemont, said that the government has finally 'understood that it couldn't govern in this way' and that they have maintained their position despite the pressures. He added that they have always been 'in favor of pensions, the SMI, and transportation aid, etc.' but did not want to be 'dragged' into approving measures they disagreed with. 'It has not been comfortable for us. We have suffered furious, unbridled, and false attacks on our position in these matters,' he said. The secretary general of Junts, Jordi Turull, said that the question of confidence will have 'political value' and that the president of the government, S√°nchez, will have to 'earn' the confidence of the Congress. 'If the whole parliament or a majority tells him that he has to submit to a question of confidence and everyone expresses their confidence, it will be valued. And a president of the government who, beyond the legal aspect, knows that he is governing without the majority of the confidence of the Congress and that he has to earn it, well, that's his democratic conviction. Politically, and that will serve him,' he said.

**Spanish Government Publishes New Decree with 29 Social Measures**
The Spanish Government, led by Pedro S√°nchez, has published a new decree with 29 social measures, including the prohibition of evictions and maintaining bonuses for public transportation, after reaching an agreement with the party Junts. The decree, which was approved by the Council of Ministers on Tuesday, contains 'the vast majority' of the law that was rejected by the Congress of Deputies last week, according to S√°nchez. The measures include the suspension of eviction procedures until December 31, 2025, and financial aid for public transportation. Additionally, the decree extends financial aid for the reconstruction of La Palma until the end of June and includes aid for those affected by the Dana virus in Valencia and other areas. The decree also maintains the transfer of the Paris palace to the PNV, a measure that was criticized by the PP, who called it a 'gift' to their partners. The decree does not include tax measures, aid to electro-intensive companies, or subsidies to companies without a relevant balance sheet. S√°nchez stated, 'This decree contains the practical totality of the law that was rejected by Congress.'

**Government Reaches Agreement with Junts, But Delay Raises Questions**
The Spanish Government has reached an agreement with Junts to pass 29 measures of the social shield, including pension increases and transportation aid. However, the agreement comes a week after the original deadline, and some government partners, such as ERC, have questioned the need for the delay. In exchange for the agreement, the Government has accepted to put Junts' proposal of no-confidence to a vote in the Congress. According to Francino, the presenter of 'La Ventana', the delay and the agreement demonstrate that politicians are more concerned with their own interests than with those of the citizens. He criticized the Government, the PP, and Junts for their actions, saying 'We will wonder later why the far-right continues to gain ground'.

The agreement between the Government and Junts includes 29 out of the 80 measures from the previous 'omnibus' decree, which was rejected by the Congress of Deputies last week. The new decree includes the revaluation of pensions, bonuses for public transportation, and aid for damage. Additionally, measures are added to combat illegal occupation of housing, ensure payment of damages, and collect rent from landlords after a missed payment. However, all tax measures are excluded and will be negotiated later, as well as aid for electro-intensive companies and subsidies for companies without a relevant balance sheet. As stated by Junts, 'the main keys are: the recovery of pension revaluation, bonuses for public transportation, and aid for damage, as well as measures to combat illegal occupation of housing and ensure payment of damages.'

**Spanish Government Approves New Decree with 29 Social Measures**
The Spanish government, led by President Pedro S√°nchez, has approved a new decree with 29 social measures, including the revaluation of pensions and aid for transportation, after reaching an agreement with the Junts party.

The decree also includes aid for municipalities, businesses, and individuals affected by the crisis, as well as a bonus for free public transportation until June 30. S√°nchez said, 'This decree contains the vast majority of the law that was rejected by Congress last week.' The decree will now be sent back to Congress for approval.

**PSOE and Junts Reach Agreement on Omnibus Decree Law**
The Spanish government, led by Pedro S√°nchez, has reached an agreement with the Catalan party Junts to pass the omnibus decree law, which was previously rejected by the Congress of Deputies. The decree law includes 29 measures, down from the initial 80, and 'contains the practical totality of the social shield measures', according to S√°nchez. One of the new measures is the creation of a public guarantee system for homeowners and tenants. S√°nchez has invited all groups to vote in favor of the measures, which have 'abundant support from society'. The government aims to pass the decree law 'in a matter of weeks'. S√°nchez has also criticized the opposition, accusing them of 'enormous capacity to tell lies', and denied claims that the decree law would increase electricity prices or raise the VAT on food. Junts has agreed to support the measures in exchange for S√°nchez's agreement to debate their proposal for a future confidence motion in the government, which would take place in early March.

**Spanish Government Revives Omnibus Decree with Junts Agreement**
The Spanish Government has reached an agreement with Junts to revive the omnibus decree that failed to pass in Congress last week. The decree includes measures such as the Ingreso M√≠nimo Vital (Minimum Vital Income), which was approved in May 2020 to combat poverty and social exclusion. The decree also maintains aid for public transportation, as agreed upon in the pact between socialists and posconvergentes. Additionally, measures will be taken to protect vulnerable families and ensure that landlords receive rent and compensation for damages caused by tenants or delinquent renters. However, some measures such as those related to tax reform, aid for electro-intensive companies, and subventions for companies without a relevant balance sheet will be negotiated separately.

**PSOE and Junts Reach Agreement on Social Measures**
The PSOE and Junts have reached an agreement to pass social measures that were blocked by the 'no' vote in Congress on the 'decreto √≥mnibus' bill. The measures include a 2.8% increase in pensions, aid for those affected by the DANA, and subsidies for transportation. The agreement will allow the government to pass a new decree to implement these measures. However, it is unclear whether the measure to prevent the eviction of vulnerable tenants will be included in the new decree. The government had previously implemented this measure to protect tenants during the pandemic, but it has become a problem for landlords who are unable to evict tenants who are not paying rent. The agreement also leaves uncertain the fate of measures such as the extension of the anti-takeover shield, which prevents foreign investors from acquiring strategic companies in Spain. Additionally, the aid for the electrification of vehicles and the purchase of electric cars will no longer be available, as the Plan MOVES has ended.
