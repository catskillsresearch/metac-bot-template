**Judge Rules Google Has To Pay Out $1.4 Billion After Illegally Tracking Users**
Google has been ordered to pay $1.375 billion to Texas for unauthorized data collection, marking the largest settlement the company has paid out to a state. This is not the first time Google has faced penalties for its behavior surrounding user privacy, having previously paid $93 million to California and $391 million to a group of 40 states. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said, 'In Texas, Big Tech is not above the law. For years, Google secretly tracked people's movements, private searches, and even their voiceprints and facial geometry through their products and services. I fought back and won.' Paxton also secured a $1.4 billion settlement with Meta in July 2024 for 'unlawfully collecting and using facial recognition data.' Despite these expensive settlements, Google's behavior has not changed, suggesting that the company finds it too lucrative to continue business as usual.

**Criticism of Police System for Facial Recognition - WELT**
The authorities expect that the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will bring further risks of data misuse. Since the beginning of 2025, there have been increased complaints from citizens about the use of AI in companies. According to data protection officials, it can be problematic when data is not anonymized for training AI models and individuals are not informed about the data processing. The data protection officer, Hartge, pointed out that a specific data protection violation occurred at an optician's company, which will have to pay a fine of 30,000 euros. The company had sent 63 advertising emails to a customer over a period of nine months despite a withdrawal. The police have also been criticized by data protection officials. A police officer stored thousands of police records on a private hard drive, including information about suspects, witnesses, and official evaluations. The officer was fined an amount equivalent to one month's salary, according to Hartge. The data protection authority also sees a procedure for using payment cards for asylum seekers critically. The procedure aims to prevent transfers abroad, but allows certain payments, such as lawyer's fees, mobile phone contracts, or subscription to the Deutschland-Ticket, by creating lists of authorized recipients, known as whitelists. Data protection officials have criticized this practice and plan to review it in some districts this year. Video surveillance is another frequent case for hundreds of data protection complaints. A particularly complex case involved over 40 cameras in a hotel, which were used to monitor the lobby, corridors, elevators, and outdoor areas. The surveillance was prohibited. In Brandenburg, data protection officials checked a total of 786 video cameras last year.

**Wealthy Businesswoman Demands Exorbitant Compensation from Working-Class Woman after Car Accident**
A wealthy businesswoman, Ms. Wong, was involved in a car accident with a working-class woman, Ms. B, in 2023. Despite being injured, Ms. Wong demanded a compensation of NT$600 million (approximately US$18 million) from Ms. B, claiming that she was unable to work and had suffered significant losses. Ms. B, who earns around NT$50,000 (approximately US$1,500) per month, was unable to afford the compensation and proposed alternative solutions, including donating NT$50,000 per month to a charity for two years. However, Ms. Wong refused and threatened to sue Ms. B, saying 'I won't pay, and I'll sue you to death.' The case went to court, and the judge ruled in favor of Ms. B, citing that Ms. Wong had not provided any medical records to support her claims and had been unreasonable in her demands. The court also found that Ms. Wong had 30% of the responsibility for the accident, but had ignored this fact and was trying to take advantage of Ms. B's financial situation. The judge sentenced Ms. B to 30 days in prison, but allowed her to pay a fine instead. Ms. Wong appealed the decision, but the appeal was rejected. The civil case is still ongoing.

**Company Must Pay Fine for Breaching Agreement with Employee**
A company in São Paulo, Brazil, was ordered to pay a fine for breaching an agreement made with an employee in a labor lawsuit. The agreement, signed in February 2019, required the company to pay R$ 480,000 in 40 monthly installments by May 30, 2022, and included a 50% penalty for non-payment or unjustified delay. The employee reported the company's failure to pay the 9th installment, and the court ordered the company to pay the penalty. The company had filed for bankruptcy on October 14, 2019, but the bankruptcy was only approved on November 4, 2019. The court of appeals (TRT-15) overturned the lower court's decision, stating that the competence to proceed with the execution of the labor claims against the company lies with the bankruptcy court. However, the court's decision was based on the fact that the company was in bankruptcy, and the agreement was a transaction between the parties without any evidence of coercion. The court's decision was made by a majority vote, with the dissenting vote of the minister Alexandre Ramos. As stated by the minister Delaíde Miranda Arantes, 'it is not reasonable to exclude the freely agreed-upon penalty clause, as the agreement was breached before the bankruptcy was approved, which reinforces the conclusion that the penalty cannot be excluded.'

**Google Fined $1.375 Billion for Tracking Users Without Consent**
Google has been ordered to pay a record $1.375 billion fine for tracking users without their consent, in a case filed by the state of Texas in 2022. The ruling is the largest settlement between a US state and Google in privacy cases, surpassing the $391.5 million fine the company paid in 2022 to settle similar lawsuits with 40 states. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton described the settlement as 'a major victory for Texans' privacy', adding: 'This ruling sends a clear message that tech companies will be held accountable if they betray users' trust.' Google responded by saying, 'This settlement closes old files on policies we've already updated for a long time, we're happy to put this page behind us, and we'll continue to improve our users' privacy tools.' The settlement also includes allegations that Google continued to track search history even when users enabled incognito mode. Google agreed to modify its privacy policy to clarify how it uses data. It's worth noting that Texas had previously filed a similar lawsuit against Meta, and received a $1.4 billion settlement in 2023 over the use of biometric data without consent on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. A new report by Surfshark highlights that Google Chrome is the most privacy-intrusive browser, collecting a vast amount of data such as contacts, images, videos, location, and browsing history. The pressure on Google is increasing, as it faces a major lawsuit from the US Department of Justice, which accuses the company of monopolistic practices and is investigating measures that could force Google to sell Chrome, its dominant search engine, which controls 35% of the global search market. Other proposals include requiring Google to share its search database with smaller competitors. Google denies these allegations, describing them as 'dangerous and illogical', and insisting that its success is due to innovation, not monopolistic behavior. The US government is expected to make a final decision on this case by the end of this summer.

**Investors back start-ups aiding copyright deals to AI groups**
Investors are backing start-ups that help creative industries license their content to AI groups, as OpenAI, Meta, and Google face scrutiny over the use of copyrighted material to train AI models. These start-ups, such as Pip Labs, Vermillio, and Human Native, have secured $215mn in funding since 2022 and are building tools and marketplaces where writers, publishers, and artists can be paid for allowing their content to be used for AI training purposes. The AI licensing market is projected to expand from $10bn in 2025 to $67.5bn by 2030, with companies like OpenAI and Perplexity making over 20 deals with media groups since 2023. However, the start-ups face challenges in finding high-quality data, convincing artists to sell their content, and avoiding reputational harm. As one expert said, 'It feels like a really bad trade off to them.'

**Google Fined $1.375 Billion for Violating Users' Privacy**
Google has been fined $1.375 billion by the state of Texas for violating users' privacy by tracking their locations and identifying their faces without consent. This is the largest settlement of its kind between a tech company and a US state in a privacy case. Dr. Walid Hajaj, a cybersecurity expert and advisor to the Supreme Council for Cybersecurity and Information Technology, described the fine as 'a victory for privacy... and a reminder of the cost of betrayal'. The court found Google guilty of collecting geolocation and biometric data without permission, a clear violation of data protection laws. Google responded by saying that the policies in question had been updated years ago and that the company is committed to improving its privacy tools. However, the settlement requires Google to revise its privacy policy to make it clearer. The settlement also revealed that Google had been tracking users' search history even in 'incognito mode', which was considered a misleading practice. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, was also fined $1.4 billion in 2023 for similar violations. Google Chrome is also under scrutiny for its data collection practices, with a 2024 report by Surfshark finding that it collects the most data among all browsers. The US Department of Justice is also investigating Google for antitrust practices due to its dominance in the search market. The company is facing calls to sell Chrome or share its database with smaller competitors. Google has described these proposals as 'dangerous and unrealistic'. A final decision from the US government is expected by summer 2025, which could change the dynamics of the relationship between users and tech companies. The fines on Google and Meta reflect a fundamental shift: privacy is now a legally enforceable right, and companies are being held accountable for their actions.

**Texas Receives $1.375 Billion Fine from Google for Privacy Violations**
The state of Texas has been awarded a $1.375 billion fine from Google for violating user privacy. In 2022, Texas filed two lawsuits against Google, one regarding Google Photos and the other concerning Chrome's incognito mode. The prosecution claimed that Google collected biometric data, such as facial features, without user notification, violating Texas's biometric identifier law. Google's representative, Jose Castaneda, stated that the company does not acknowledge guilt, as many of the allegations are outdated, given Google's changes to its data handling policies. Castaneda said that the settlement with Texas simply helps to resolve old disputes, without requiring Google to alter its products or services. This fine is the largest ever received by a US state from Google. Ken Paxton emphasized that large tech companies must comply with laws, and Texas is actively fighting against tech company violations, including a $1.4 billion settlement with Meta in 2024, which also involved allegations of unlawful use of social media users' biometric data.

**Qatari Court Orders Real Estate Company to Pay 12 Million Riyals**
A court in Qatar has ordered a real estate company to pay 12 million Qatari riyals (approximately 12,019,570 QAR) to a contracting company due to a legal dispute over a large-scale housing project. The contracting company had filed a lawsuit against the real estate company, claiming that they were owed 45 million QAR for additional work done outside of the original contract, as well as 39 million QAR for a 98-day extension of the project timeline. The court ruled in favor of the contracting company, stating that they had completed over 95% of the project and that the real estate company was responsible for the remaining 5%. The court also rejected the real estate company's request to impose penalties for delays, citing that the project was completed on time. The contracting company's lawyer, Hamad Nasser Al-Ahmad, presented evidence and documents to support their claim, including a copy of the original contract and a series of letters exchanged between the two companies. The court's decision was based on the evidence presented and the fact that the contracting company had fulfilled their obligations under the contract.

**Elon Musk's X Company Faces Investigation Over Use of European User Data**
The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) has launched an investigation into Elon Musk's X company, citing the use of European user data to train its AI chatbot Grok without explicit consent. According to Reuters, the DPC will examine how X handles personal data from European users in public posts to train generative AI models. As a prominent data protection authority in the EU, the DPC has previously fined companies like Microsoft, TikTok, and Meta, with a total fine of nearly €30 billion (approximately ¥248.12 billion) imposed on Meta. In 2024, X shared user data with Musk's AI company xAI, which was used to train Grok without users' knowledge. Musk announced the acquisition of X by xAI last month. Under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), companies must have a lawful basis for processing personal data, and the DPC can impose fines of up to 4% of a company's global revenue for non-compliance. This investigation follows the DPC's attempt to restrict X's handling of European user data for AI training purposes through a court order last year.

**Irish Data Protection Commission Launches Investigation into X's AI Model Training**
The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) has launched an investigation into the use of personal data from EU users to train a model of artificial intelligence (AI) on Elon Musk's controlled platform X. The investigation will focus on 'the processing of personal data contained in publicly available posts published on the X social media platform by users from the EU and the European Economic Area for the purpose of training generative AI models.' Specifically, it concerns the Grok model used in the chatbot on the X platform. The DPC wants to check if the company complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including transparency in data processing. According to Politico, the actions against the platform owned by a close associate of US President Donald Trump's may escalate tensions between the EU and the US over European regulations for tech companies. In 2023, the X company agreed to stop using EU users' data to train the Grok model without their consent. The DPC is based in Ireland, where the main EU representation of Musk's controlled company is located. Under the GDPR, the commission can fine the company up to 4% of its global turnover. The DPC has already imposed financial penalties on companies such as Microsoft, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Meta, with the latter being fined a total of almost 3 billion euros. X, then known as Twitter, was fined 450,000 euros in 2020.

**London Court Orders Trump to Pay £626,000 to Orbis Business Intelligence**
A London court has ruled that Donald Trump must pay £626,000 (approximately $821,500) in legal costs to Orbis Business Intelligence, the company behind the 'Steele Dossier', which alleged connections between Trump and Russia. The High Court of London had previously dismissed Trump's lawsuit against Orbis, which claimed the company had breached data protection laws. The case concerned the dossier created by Christopher Steele, a former MI-6 agent and co-founder of Orbis. The compensation consists of two parts: £530,615 for the main case and £95,000 for court costs. Trump was warned that if he fails to pay £290,000 of this amount within 28 days, his representatives will not be allowed to participate in further hearings on the compensation issue scheduled for April. In 2017, documents were published on the BuzzFeed website alleging Trump's connections to Russia during the 2016 election campaign and containing compromising information allegedly held by Russian authorities. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called these claims 'absolute fabrication and fabrication'. Trump filed a lawsuit against Orbis in October 2023, which was dismissed by the court in February 2024, citing a lack of grounds for the case. Orbis' defense lawyers argued that the publication of the dossier on BuzzFeed, which Trump linked to his reputational damage, was not part of their client's plans and therefore they could not be held responsible.

**Texas Attorney Fined $15,000 for Using AI-Generated Fake Citations**
A Texas attorney, Rafael Ramírez, has been fined $15,000 for using AI-generated fake citations in court filings. In October 2024, Ramírez submitted three briefs in a lawsuit over a company's retirement benefits, but one of the briefs included a non-existent case. When the court asked Ramírez to explain, he admitted to using an AI tool to generate the documents and apologized, stating that he was unaware of the AI's potential to produce false information and thought the generated text was reliable. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 requires attorneys to guarantee the authenticity of the information they submit, and U.S. District Judge Mark J. Dinsmore found that Ramírez was negligent. 'It is a fundamental responsibility of lawyers to properly cite cases in their briefs, and failing to do so is not justifiable,' Dinsmore wrote. He ordered Ramírez to pay a fine of $5,000 per brief, totaling $15,000. This fine is based on a similar case in 2023, where attorney Stephen Schwartz was fined $5,000 for using ChatGPT to generate documents without reviewing them. Dinsmore noted that the $15,000 fine is high, but necessary given Ramírez's lack of knowledge about AI. 'This amount is high, but it is necessary given the attorney's lack of knowledge about AI,' Dinsmore said. 'AI is not inherently bad, and using AI is not prohibited. Just like a chainsaw can be useful but also dangerous, people must understand the tools they use and use them carefully. AI must be used in accordance with the ethical and professional obligations of attorneys.'

**US Lawyer Fined $14 Million for Using AI to Write Court Documents with False Citations**
A lawyer in the US state of Indiana was sentenced to pay $14 million after using AI to write court documents with false citations. Rafael Ramírez cited a non-existent court ruling in a filing, admitted to relying on AI programs to write them, and more documents with invented references were discovered. The judge imposed fines and referred the case to the disciplinary committee, putting his professional future at risk. The case highlights the importance of verifying information presented and following ethical rules in legal practice, showing the implications of blindly trusting AI technology for legal tasks. Ramírez was fined $5,000 for each document with false information and referred to the disciplinary committee. His professional future is now in the hands of the committee, which could impose even harsher penalties. According to Sean Griffin, an expert in commercial law and cybersecurity, it is essential to provide a clear and specific context to obtain accurate responses from ChatGPT. Griffin recommends using a precise prompt, setting limits, and verifying information to avoid generating fictional information.

**US Courts Impose Fines on Lawyers for Citing Non-Existent Precedents Generated by AI**
Courts in the United States are imposing fines on lawyers who cite non-existent precedents in their petitions, generated by artificial intelligence. The latest case involves Morgan & Morgan, one of the largest law firms in the US, which was fined $3,000 and lost its 'status pro hac vice' in a case after three of its lawyers cited eight non-existent precedents in a petition. The lawyers, Rudwin Ayala, T. Michael Morgan, and Taly Goody, were fined $1,000 each. The judge, Kelly Rankin, wrote, 'Advocates have an ethical duty to check the citations used in their petitions and to read the case to ensure that the excerpt is from an existing law, to justify statements and arguments.' The judge also noted that the lawyers 'violated the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure by presenting a petition in which they certified that their arguments are supported by existing law or a non-frivolous argument to change the law.' However, the firm was not sanctioned due to its immediate corrective action. In another case, a lawyer was fined $15,000 for citing three non-existent precedents generated by AI. The lawyer, Rafael Ramirez, admitted to using AI tools to draft agreements and other legal documents, but claimed he did not know that the AI generated false citations. The judge, Mark Dinsmore, found him 'guilty of failing to verify the authenticity of the three precedents cited in his petition, which were entirely fabricated by the AI.' In a similar case, an attorney was fined $2,000 for filing a petition with non-existent precedents generated by AI, and was ordered to attend a course on the use of AI in the legal field.

**Gigantene skjelver: AI-selskaper risikerer milliarder i erstatning**
A judge has set a potential legal precedent that could force large AI companies to pay billions of dollars in damages. The judge ruled in favor of Thomson Reuters, concluding that a law firm's use of their legal content to train an AI model was in violation of US copyright law. The lawsuit dates back to 2020, when Reuters sued Ross Intelligence, a legal research firm, for using their Westlaw platform to train their own AI model without permission. Reuters argued that the firm had copied their content without fair use. 'We are pleased that the court granted a summary judgment in our favor,' said Reuters. 'The copying of our content was not fair use.' If this precedent stands, AI companies could be forced to pay damages in the millions to content owners like Thomson Reuters if they use copyrighted material without permission to train their models. For example, the Reuters case showed that using Westlaw content without a license was considered unlawful. Large AI companies, which often train models on massive datasets sourced from the internet or other sources, risk similar lawsuits from other content producers.

**Why Tech Giants are Kneeling Before Trump**
Steve Bannon, a former Trump advisor, has argued that tech moguls in Silicon Valley are approaching Trump because 'basically, they want a bailout'. Bannon's statement may be motivated by his own agenda, but it highlights a real issue. Tech companies are caught between increasing global regulatory costs and the astronomical costs of AI dominance. As a result, they may be seeking help from the Trump government to secure their advantages. This could explain why Elon Musk invested heavily in Trump's campaign and now acts as a shadow president. It may also explain why top tech executives attended Trump's inauguration, and why OpenAI's Sam Altman participated in a press conference at the White House the next day. Additionally, it could be the reason why investor Marc Andreessen said in December that he spent half his time at Mar-a-Lago. Silicon Valley faces numerous regulatory threats as governments worldwide respond to the damage caused by big tech companies. Google has been fined $8.6 billion in the EU in the last decade, Apple has to pay a $13.5 billion tax bill in Ireland, and Meta received a $830 million fine from the EU. The EU is set to impose a multi-million dollar fine on X soon. In the US, antitrust actions against the biggest tech titans are making their way through the courts, and states are intervening in the federal regulatory vacuum with dozens of new protections for young people, workers, and our data. This year, eight new state privacy laws will come into effect, and the California Privacy Protection Agency has already begun enforcing its regulations, allowing it to impose fines of nearly $8,000 per intentional infringement. This could reach millions or even billions of dollars. The supposed AI advantage of Silicon Valley, often touted as the future of technology worth investing a billion dollars in, seemed to evaporate recently when a Chinese emerging company claimed to have produced a product of equivalent quality at a fraction of the price. Microsoft and OpenAI's subsequent price cuts did not inspire confidence. Altman even speculated about giving away his models, putting at risk the billions the industry expects to earn from sales to customers. It's no surprise that tech titans are asking for more help from the US government. In 2023, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz asked the copyright office to reduce the barriers to entry for AI with the argument that AI training data is a 'productive and non-exploitative' use of protected material. Meta pressured for TikTok to be banned, which was the biggest threat to its social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. It's likely that Silicon Valley was behind the generous gift the Biden government gave them recently: an executive order granting access to federal land to build AI data centers. Additionally, there's the possibility of securing lucrative military contracts. Last year, OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic changed their policies to facilitate the sale of their AI with military purposes. A few years ago, Google changed its stance on defense contracts despite employee objections. This week, Google also abandoned its promise not to use AI for arms or surveillance. And SpaceX, led by Musk, has over $11 billion in contracts with NASA. Before, Silicon Valley didn't need favors from the US government. Their innovations, like the iPhone and Google's search engine, were so astonishing that they could succeed in the market as long as the government didn't intervene. But now, after decades of digital revolution, tech titans are more fragile than ever. They seem like formidable bullies, with Musk interfering in government systems and threatening to shut down federal agencies, Congress investigating Andreessen's whistleblower complaints against big banks, and Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting to EU regulators that Trump will help him roll back onerous regulations. But, as my mother used to say in elementary school, most bullies are cowards.
