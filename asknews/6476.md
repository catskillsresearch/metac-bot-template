**Musk: Chances of Starship Flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50**
Elon Musk said that the chances of Starship flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50. The spacecraft has already completed nine test flights, with the last one taking place on May 27. However, the mission ended in an emergency due to a fuel leak. The previous flights in January and March also ended in failure, with the spacecraft exploding within the first 10 minutes of flight. Despite this, Musk is optimistic about the progress made and believes that the data collected will help improve the spacecraft. The next version of Starship, Version 3, is expected to be 124.4 meters tall and will be capable of flying to Mars. The spacecraft will be reusable and will have a refueling system on orbit, which is necessary for long-distance space travel. The first flight of this version is planned for the end of this year, and if successful, Starship may fly to Mars as early as next year. SpaceX plans to send five Starship Version 3 spacecraft to Mars in 2026 to test the spacecraft and its technologies. However, Musk believes that it will be challenging to achieve this goal, citing the need to master the refueling of Starship in space as the main problem. He estimates the chances of success as 50/50. If successful, SpaceX plans to send around 20 spacecraft to Mars in 2028-2029, which may be crewed. However, Musk also suggests that two robotic landings may be conducted before sending humans. The final decision will be made later. In the third launch window (2030-2031), up to 100 Starship spacecraft may be sent to Mars, and in the next window (2033), up to 500. SpaceX is currently searching for a suitable location for a Martian city, which should be relatively far from the poles, have access to water ice, and have a flat surface for landings and takeoffs. The main candidate is the Arcadia Planitia region. The ultimate goal is to create a self-sufficient settlement on Mars with a population of over a million people, which will require transporting millions of tons of cargo. According to Musk, the construction and maintenance of such a city will be carried out using Starship, possibly its future 142-meter version. During periods of Earth-Mars alignment, thousands of upper stages of the spacecraft will be able to arrive and depart.

**Elon Musk's Plan to Colonize Mars: 2026 the Key Year**
Elon Musk has revealed his plan to colonize Mars, with the first unmanned flight of the Starship spacecraft to the red planet expected to take place in late 2026. The mission will transport robots humanoides Optimus, developed by Tesla, to Mars. Musk aims to send the first human missions to Mars in the second or third landing, with the goal of establishing a permanent and self-sufficient human settlement on the planet. To achieve this, SpaceX estimates that it will require between 1,000 and 2,000 launches of Starship every 26 months, coinciding with the optimal alignment between Earth and Mars. Musk has calculated that there is a 50% chance that Starship will be ready for the 2026 window. If not, the company will wait until the next window in 2028. Musk has been interested in colonizing Mars since the 1990s and has invested billions of dollars in developing space technology to make humanity a multi-planetary species.

**From Earth to Mars: SpaceX Continues its Quest for the Big Dream**
Despite a series of rocket tests that ended in explosions, SpaceX is still planning to send its Starship to Mars by next year. During a presentation on May 29 on the X platform, Elon Musk emphasized that true progress is measured by how close humanity is to creating a self-sustaining civilization on the red planet. He said, 'Every new Starship launch is a step towards making life multi-planetary'. The Starship consists of two stages: the booster 'Super Heavy' and the upper stage known as 'Ship', which is 121 meters long, making it the largest and most powerful rocket ever built. The third version of the Starship is planned to be 124.4 meters long, with advanced capabilities including in-orbit refueling, a crucial step for long-distance travel. The Starship has undergone nine test flights, with the last one on May 27 reaching space but losing control and crashing into the Indian Ocean due to a fuel leak. However, Musk sees each attempt as providing a vast amount of data to improve the spacecraft, saying that the performance in the last test was better than its predecessors. According to Musk, the third version of the Starship will be ready for launch by the end of 2025. If things go as planned, the first uncrewed missions to Mars could be launched as early as 2026. This will include sending five 'Ship' uncrewed spacecraft, equipped with Tesla-developed Optimus robots. Musk commented, 'It will be thrilling to see Optimus robots walking on Mars'. The ultimate goal of SpaceX is to build a self-sustaining city on Mars, capable of supporting over a million people and surviving even if contact with Earth is lost. Hundreds of spacecraft will transport thousands of tons of cargo and people through space during each future launch window. Musk mentioned that the potential site for the city is 'Arcadia Planitia' in the northern hemisphere of Mars, due to its flat surface and potential sources of frozen water. Musk concluded his speech by saying, 'It's a monumental project. A new city on a new planet, it's a chance to reimagine civilization, and we'll do it'.

**Trump Withdraws Nomination of Isaacman as NASA Head, Deal Blow to Elon Musk**
A surprise turn of events has dealt a setback to Elon Musk. Trump had nominated a close friend of the tech billionaire, Isaacman, as the new head of NASA, but Trump has now withdrawn his nomination. Trump did not comment on the reasons for his decision, but it is believed that Isaacman's past donations to the Democratic Party and his close ties to Musk may have been factors. Musk is stepping down as a special envoy to the US government. This comes at a bad time for Musk, as the US government plans to cut NASA's budget by a quarter and reduce its staff by a third. The government also plans to redefine NASA's mission, with a focus on missions to the moon and Mars. This is important for SpaceX, which is developing the Starship rocket, capable of carrying up to 100 tons of cargo and potentially enabling a manned mission to Mars in a few years. Musk aims to send a million people to Mars by 2050. However, SpaceX has faced repeated setbacks in the development of the Starship, including a recent test flight that ended in a crash in the Indian Ocean. Musk remains undeterred, and has outlined an ambitious plan for a Mars mission, including a unmanned flight in 2026, a crewed flight in 2027, and the establishment of a Mars station in 2029, with the help of Optimus robots built by Tesla.

**Elon Musk targets 2026 for first space mission to Mars**
Elon Musk aims to launch the first space mission to Mars by the end of 2026, but acknowledges that overcoming technological hurdles, particularly in-orbit refueling, is crucial for the mission's success. A favorable planetary alignment in late 2026 provides a unique opportunity for a relatively short transit between Earth and Mars. If Starship is not ready by then, Musk would target a new mission in 2028. The first mission would consist of -built Optimus humanoid robots. Despite failed test flights, including the ninth test flight which failed due to a fuel leak and uncontrolled spinning, Musk remains optimistic, emphasizing that each failure provides valuable data and paves the way for accelerated testing. Musk's ultimate vision is to launch up to 2,000 Starships every two years to establish a permanent and self-sustaining human settlement on Mars.

**Musk's Ambitious Plan to Send Starship to Mars by 2026**
Elon Musk's SpaceX aims to send the first Starship to Mars without a crew by the end of 2026. This ambitious goal is feasible due to a favorable astronomical window, but it is still dependent on overcoming several technical challenges. The success of the mission will depend on the outcome of the next Starship testing campaigns, particularly the orbital refueling operation, which is still a work in progress. If the tests are delayed, SpaceX will have to wait until at least 2028 to try again, slowing down the decade-long colonization plan. Musk has stated that Tesla will send between 1,000 and 2,000 Starships every two years, and the recent test flight of Starship provided valuable data for SpaceX. NASA will need to ensure the full reliability of each stage of the flight before the mission can proceed. As Musk often does, his vision anticipates the technical feasibility by several years, but it is not to be underestimated. The 2026 deadline is not far off, and if SpaceX succeeds in sending its first Starship to Mars that year, it will be a historic event that will change the narrative of space exploration forever. Otherwise, we will have to wait until 2028.

**Musk Announces Starship Launch to Mars in 2026, Human Descent Possible by 2029**
Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, announced that the company's massive Starship rocket will launch to Mars at the end of 2026, carrying a Tesla robot called Optimus. Musk stated on his X account that 'Starship will launch towards Mars at the end of next year, carrying the Optimus robot. If the landing operations go smoothly, human 'descent' on Mars could begin as early as 2029, although 2031 is more likely.' The Starship rocket, the largest in the world, is a key part of Musk's long-term vision for Mars colonization. NASA is also waiting for a modified version of Starship to be used as a lunar lander in the Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon in the current decade. However, before SpaceX can accomplish these tasks, it must prove that the spacecraft is reliable and safe for transporting crews and capable of completing the complex task of refueling in orbit, which is crucial for future deep space missions. SpaceX faced a setback this month when its latest test of the Starship prototype ended in a powerful explosion, despite the success in recovering the boosters in the orbital test. This was a repeat of what happened in the previous attempt. After a few minutes of launch and separation of the boosters, a live video broadcast showed the upper stage falling out of control before the signal suddenly cut off. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) stated that SpaceX will be required to conduct an investigation before it can launch the spacecraft again.

**Elon Musk Reveals Starship Launch Date to Mars**
Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, announced that the Starship spacecraft will launch to Mars by the end of next year, carrying the Tesla-like robot Optimus. Musk, a former advisor to US President Donald Trump, stated that if the initial landing operations of the spacecraft go smoothly, human landings could begin as early as 2029, or more likely in 2031. Musk previously expected the robot to perform tasks in factories by the end of last year. However, before SpaceX can implement these tasks, the company must prove that the spacecraft is reliable and safe for transporting crews and capable of completing the complex mission of refueling in orbit - a crucial aspect for future deep space missions. SpaceX faced a setback this month when its latest test of the Starship prototype ended in a powerful explosion, despite successfully recovering the boosters. The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered SpaceX to conduct an investigation before launching the spacecraft again. Musk's dream of colonizing Mars is a priority for the Trump administration, according to Reuters sources in November. This change indicates significant shifts in NASA's lunar program and a boost for SpaceX. The Starship is crucial for SpaceX's future in launching satellites, a sector it currently dominates with its partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket, as well as Musk's ambitions to settle Mars. Musk aims to make the Starship fully reusable, which would greatly reduce costs and resources, and in a later phase, the company plans to recover the second stage of the Starship rocket. This massive rocket would allow Musk to reach Mars, which he wants to 'settle'.

**Elon Musk Launched His Tesla Roadster Into Space 7 Years Ago -- It Was Just Seen Again**
On this day seven years ago, SpaceX launched the maiden flight of Falcon Heavy with a cherry red 2008 Tesla Roadster owned by Elon Musk as a special payload. The car, with a spacesuit-clad dummy named 'Starman' in its driver's seat, disappeared from telescopes about a month after its launch. However, it was recently spotted again by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. According to SpaceX's calculation, the Roadster completed its first orbit around the Sun in August 2019 and made its first close approach to Mars on Oct. 7, 2020. The vehicle is currently moving away from Earth and toward Mars, and unless it crashes into Earth or Mars, it will float around in the solar system for several million years. Elon Musk tweeted in 2019 that SpaceX might one day launch a small spacecraft to catch up with the Roadster and take photographs or even bring it back to Earth for research.

Elon Musk tweeted in 2019 that SpaceX might one day launch a small spacecraft to catch up with the Roadster and take photographs or even bring it back to Earth for research. The Roadster will likely float around in the solar system for several million years, but solar and cosmic radiation and micrometeoroid impacts will likely destroy the vehicle over time. As Musk set Starman to listen to endless loops of David Bowie's Space Oddity and Life On Mars? during the journey, the dummy would have listened to these two songs almost a million times by now if its battery were still working.
