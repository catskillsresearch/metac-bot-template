**House Passes 2025 Reconciliation Bill - Further Restricting IRA Tax Benefits**
The House has passed the Reconciliation Bill, which makes significant revisions to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provisions. The bill terminates technology neutral credits under Sections 45Y and 48E, and the zero-emission nuclear power production credit under Section 45U in the near term. This will have a 'tremendous and damaging impact' on future renewable development, affecting manufacturers, developers, innovators, financiers, and customers. The bill also includes 'prohibited foreign entities' provisions, which are 'extremely broad' and 'almost impossible to comply with'. The clean energy industry is urged to mobilize and express their views on this proposed legislation.

**Amended House Bill Would Eliminate ITC and PTC for New Renewable Projects**
The House passed an amended version of the 'One, Big, Beautiful Bill' on May 22, 2025, which would eliminate the investment tax credit (ITC) under Section 48E and production tax credit (PTC) under Section 45Y for new renewable projects that begin construction 60 days after the bill is enacted. The bill also imposes a placed-in-service deadline of Dec. 31, 2028, to receive any credit. However, the amended bill extends the zero-emission nuclear production credit of Section 45U to provide a full credit through the end of 2031 and allows advanced nuclear facilities to claim the ITC and PTC if they begin construction prior to Dec. 31, 2028. The bill also includes restrictions on the ITC and PTC, requiring taxpayers to begin construction on most energy projects prior to 60 days after the enactment of the bill and place in service on or before Dec. 31, 2028. 'Developers should consider whether to begin construction for tax purposes as soon as possible for planned projects that could foreseeably be placed in service on or before Dec. 31, 2028,' according to the bill. The permanent ITC for solar would still be available under Section 48(a) after the Section 48E credit is eliminated with a 10% level with PWA compliance and can be increased up to a 30% ITC if the energy community and domestic content adders are applicable.

**US House budget bill ends clean energy tax credits**
The US House of Representatives has passed a reconciliation bill that ends clean energy tax credits earlier than anticipated, potentially curbing the clean energy production boom fueled by subsidies enacted in 2022. The bill advances the expiry date for clean electricity tax credits to 2028 and imposes a 60-day construction commencement deadline. Industry stakeholders warn of factory closures, job losses, and increased electricity costs for US households. President Trump is set to sign executive orders to revitalise the nuclear energy sector. Clean energy groups have expressed disappointment, with Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition executive director Michael Carr stating, 'Despite many reassurances that members support domestic manufacturing, a vote for this bill was a vote to close US factories and concede manufacturing jobs of the most important energy resource of the 21st century to China.' Advanced Energy United president Heather O'Neill lamented the bill's approach, saying, 'This isn't a scalpel, it's a meat cleaver, and it will hurt us all.' Solar Energy Industries Association president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper stated, 'If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered an historic American manufacturing renaissance, lower electric bills, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of billions of dollars of investments primarily to states that voted for President Trump.'

**IRA's Section 6418 Transferable Credits: Will They Be Expanded to Other Industries?**
Elected representatives are pushing to expand transferable tax credits to various industries, as seen in recent proposed legislation. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) introduced Section 6418, allowing for the transfer of federal tax credits, which has been successful in the clean energy, investment, and production sectors. The market for tax credit transfers has grown significantly, with $25 billion in current-year credits changing hands in 2024. However, House Republicans are considering a bill that would repeal most clean energy tax credits and eliminate tax credit transferability after 2027. Despite this, proposals are being made to expand transferable credits to industries such as advanced agricultural technologies, shipbuilding, and the production of baby formula and electric bicycles. Senator Mark Kelly's proposed Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security for America Act of 2025 (SHIPS Act) aims to increase U.S. shipbuilding and shipyard investment through transferable tax credits. Enterprises in agricultural technology, mining and processing of natural resources, and community development and revitalization could benefit from Washington's renewed appetite for salable tax credits.

**House budget bill effectively kills US clean energy boom**
The House budget bill, which passed in an early morning vote on Thursday, would effectively end the clean energy production boom in the United States by killing Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for clean energy projects years earlier than initially planned. The bill would also eliminate the 'transferability' of tax credits, strengthen restrictions on tax credits for projects associated with 'foreign entities of concern,' and require projects to begin construction within 60 days of the final bill's passage. Advocates for the clean energy industry have blasted the bill, saying it will destroy billions in investments and kill tens of thousands of jobs. Heather O'Neill, president of Advanced Energy United, said, 'If enacted as written, this bill will weaken our power system and send shockwaves throughout the U.S. economy by raising electricity prices, killing tens of thousands of jobs, and ceding energy dominance to China.' Energy analysts at the Rhodium Group said the changes could raise household energy costs by 7%.

**Republican solar cuts raise your electric bill, threaten US energy/AI dominance**
The House Republicans' tax bill aims to cut solar credits, which will inflate electricity costs for Americans and threaten the US energy and AI dominance. The bill eliminates the 30% residential solar tax credit, known as the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which helps homeowners save thousands of dollars on their electricity bills. According to a report by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, repealing the solar credit will raise the average American's electricity bills by 7% by 2026, equivalent to a $110 yearly increase. This will also hinder the growth of domestic energy production and data centers for AI. The US needs to add more electrical generation capacity to meet the increasing demand from AI and electric cars. China is rapidly advancing its own AI tech and transforming its car industry to confront the transition to EVs. The tax bill will only serve to choke the industry compared to its international competitors. The Senate can modify the bill to remove these 'poison pills' that inflate costs for Americans and threaten US competitiveness globally.

**Final House GOP megabill accelerates clean energy cuts**
The House of Representatives has passed a revised reconciliation bill that accelerates cuts to clean energy subsidies created or expanded through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The bill, which is now headed to the Senate, cancels technology-neutral tax credits for all projects unless they start construction within 60 days of the bill's enactment and are placed in service by the end of 2028. Republicans have long vowed to roll back President Biden's climate bill, despite concerns from lawmakers in their own party and industry players who have said the tax credits are key for domestic energy development. Energy Secretary Chris Wright pleaded with Congress to protect support for nuclear energy, which was facing strict phase-outs of related subsidies by 2031. The bill would extend a tax credit for existing nuclear reactors until 2031 and only allow transferability for nuclear energy.

**House Budget Committee approved bill poses challenges to renewable energy industry**
The U.S. House of Representatives' Budget Committee has approved a proposed budget reconciliation bill that could deter the development of renewable energy projects in the U.S. and cause a downturn in domestic manufacturing, according to Wood Mackenzie analyst Sylvia Leyva Martinez. The bill sunsets the 48E Investment Tax Credit and the 45Y Production Tax Credit for clean energy projects several years ahead of schedule, phasing them out completely by 2032. Leyva Martinez emphasized that the early phaseout of tax credits, the removal of transferability, and the 'foreign entities of concern' restrictions will affect the vast majority of clean energy projects in the U.S. 'The proposed changes would have far-reaching implications across the clean energy sector,' she said. 'While the bill maintains some elements like domestic content and energy community adders, the overall outlook for the industry appears challenging.' The proposed bill could lead to a downward revision of Wood Mackenzie's Q1 2025 forecast and may close the U.S. market to Chinese companies due to the FEOC provisions.

**House passes "One Big, Beautiful Bill"- Impact on energy**
The House passed the 'One Big, Beautiful Bill,' which includes significant cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) energy incentives. The bill terminates or shortens 17 IRA 'green' energy incentives, including clean vehicle and residential incentives, and curtails clean fuel, CO sequestration, nuclear, hydrogen, and advanced manufacturing incentives. The renewable energy industry is concerned about the denial of credits based on a new rule that prohibits components or subcomponents from being acquired from a Foreign Entity Of Concern (FEAC), such as a China-based entity. The industry is also concerned about the termination of the Section 45Y and 48E credits through a new placed in service deadline of 2028, and the termination of the Section 6418 transferability rules. 'The changes shorten the duration of or eliminate 17 IRA 'green' energy incentives,' according to the bill. The industry is worried about the impact of these changes on the renewable energy sector.

**The Future of IRA Clean Energy Production and Investment Tax Credits Under Draft GOP Tax Legislation**
The Ways & Means Committee of the House of Representatives released a draft tax legislation that aims to make permanent some provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, while also upending popular industry initiatives from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The bill would wind down clean energy tax credits, including the Investment and Production Tax Credits, and repeal credit transferability for projects that begin construction two years after the bill is enacted. The phaseouts would follow a 'placed in service' standard, while transferability repeals would be tied to the beginning of facility or equipment construction. The bill also introduces new restrictions to certain IRA credits related to Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOCs), which could result in total credit disallowance. Tax credit investors should be aware of these changes and plan to account for them through astute drafting and robust due diligence. 'Adept buyers and sellers must be prepared to consummate these transactions in advance of any future phase out periods or transferability repeals,' according to the legislation. 'Its potential congressional foreclosure, so soon after the market's establishment, would certainly frustrate any longer-term growth projections but may simultaneously provide valuable opportunities for accelerated credit dealings in the interim period.'

**Tax Bill Proposes Phasedowns in ITC and PTC, Limits on Transferability**
The House Ways and Means Committee has released a draft of the 2025 tax bill, which proposes phase-downs in the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) and limits on transferability. The bill would repeal transferability for projects that 'begin construction' two years after the date the bill is enacted, affecting credits generated under Sections 45Y, 48E, 45Q, 45U and Section 48(a)(3)(vii). The bill also adopts a regime to stop certain credits from being generated when a project is 'controlled' or 'influenced' by certain prohibited foreign entities. Taxpayers should prioritize a 'begin construction' strategy before Q3 2027 to help lock in their ability to transfer ITCs and PTCs to third parties. The bill does not limit or restrict direct pay eligibility for non-applicable entities generating credits under Section 45Q and 45X.

**High-Level Overview of certain Provisions Impacting Renewable Energy Incentives in "The One, Big, Beautiful Bill" Draft Legislation**
The House Ways and Means Committee has released a draft tax package, known as 'The One, Big, Beautiful Bill', which includes provisions that would impact renewable energy incentives. The Bill proposes accelerated phaseouts for the clean electricity investment credit, clean electricity production credit, and advanced manufacturing production tax credit. These credits would phase down to 80% of the current credit level in 2029, 60% in 2030, 40% in 2031, and 0% in 2032 and beyond. The Bill would also repeal transferability for these credits, but the repeal would not take effect for several years. Additionally, the Bill contains new restrictions on energy tax credits aimed at limiting foreign entities from taking advantage of the credits. As the Bill is a draft only, the provisions are subject to change and may not become law.

**Moment of truth nears on green credits, climate cuts**
A group of Republican lawmakers, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.) and Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), have introduced the 'Certainty for Our Energy Future Act' to phase out solar and wind incentives, disqualify companies tied to foreign adversaries, and continue the practice of 'transferability.' The bill aims to 'safeguard both our energy independence and our taxpayers' by responsibly phasing out subsidies for technologies like wind and solar. However, the issue remains unsettled, with some lawmakers calling for the preservation of certain Inflation Reduction Act provisions, including the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (48E), the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (45Y), and the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit (45X). Others, like Rep. Julie Fedorchak, are lobbying to phase out wind and solar investment and production credits in favor of technologies like nuclear, carbon capture for fossil fuels, and geothermal.

**Treasury Issues Final Regulations on Technology Neutral Clean Energy Projects**
The US Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service have issued final regulations for technology-neutral tax credits for clean energy projects under Sections 45Y and 48E of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The regulations provide additional rules and guidelines for calculating a facility's greenhouse gas emissions rate and boundaries for performing lifecycle analysis. The technology-neutral production tax credit (45Y PTC) and technology-neutral investment tax credit (48E ITC) will replace many existing credits under Sections 45 and 48, and are available for facilities placed in service after December 31, 2024. The regulations also clarify the definition of 'alternative fate' and prohibit the use of book-and-claim accounting systems to establish or claim the energy attributes of fuels and feedstocks. Additionally, the regulations provide guidance on the One-Megawatt Exception, incremental cost, ownership, hydrogen energy storage property, and the 80/20 and Incremental Production Rules.
