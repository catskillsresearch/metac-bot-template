**The BAASS Ten-Month Report: A Window into the U.S.**
The BAASS Ten-Month Report, a 494-page document compiled in 2009 by Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS) for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), reveals the U.S. government's serious commitment to studying Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). The report explores global UAP sightings, advanced aerospace technologies, biological effects, and phenomena that hint at non-human intelligences or interdimensional interactions. Key findings include: 1) Global UAP sightings and analysis, 2) Advanced technologies and reverse engineering, 3) Biological and psychological effects, and 4) Skinwalker Ranch, a unique laboratory for studying other intelligences and possible interdimensional phenomena. The report demonstrates that the Pentagon not only acknowledged the existence of unexplained phenomena but invested significant resources to understand their nature, exploring possibilities that challenge mainstream scientific paradigms. The report's significance lies in its emphasis on advanced technologies, biological effects, and interdimensional phenomena, suggesting that UAP may not be merely extraterrestrial craft but represent a more complex phenomenon that challenges our understanding of reality.

**Astronomers Detect Anomalous Expansion of the Universe**
Astronomers have detected an anomalous expansion of the universe, previously unknown. This discovery highlights the importance of developing new observation technologies and using modern telescopes to study cosmic mysteries. It also shows that even the most bold assumptions can be correct - or require a reevaluation in the future. Astronomers have solved a long-standing puzzle related to the different results of measuring the speed of the universe's expansion - the Hubble constant. For decades, data from the cosmic microwave background and supernovae observations did not match, casting doubts on the standard cosmological model. Now, new data from the Webb telescope has narrowed the gap between these values to a statistical error. Previous measurements from the Hubble telescope showed a value of 72.8 km/s/Mpc, while data from the cosmic microwave background showed 67.4 km/s/Mpc. New observations from the Webb telescope gave a value of 70.4 km/s/Mpc, which is much closer to other results. This means that cosmologists no longer see these discrepancies as a serious threat to the standard model. Researchers say that this does not rule out possible future discoveries that could change our understanding of the universe's evolution. However, for now, all indications point to the universe expanding as predicted by the current theory, which helps to better explain the evolution of galaxies and the structure of the universe. Scientists plan to continue observing to more accurately measure the Hubble constant. They are confident that further data will help to narrow the error and finally confirm the results. 'This discovery emphasizes the importance of developing new observation technologies and using modern telescopes to study cosmic mysteries,' said scientists. 'It also shows that even the most bold assumptions can be correct - or require a reevaluation in the future.'

**Bizarre Phenomena in China: Fish Jump Out of Water, Rare Lightning Appears**
A bizarre phenomenon was observed in Kunming, China, where hundreds of fish jumped out of the water in the Dianchi Lake on June 1st. In the same day, a photographer in Tibet captured a rare 'red sprite' lightning. Some netizens expressed concern that these events might be a sign of an impending earthquake, citing the fact that animals often exhibit unusual behavior before a disaster strikes. A 3.6-magnitude earthquake did occur in Xishuangbanna on the same day. The China Meteorological Administration has predicted a geomagnetic storm and possible aurora borealis in northern China on June 2nd. Additionally, unidentified flying objects with long tails were spotted in the skies of several provinces on May 30th.

**Ufologist Nikolai Subbotin on the Existence of Alien Life and the Power of Human Imagination**
Ufologist Nikolai Subbotin discussed the recent surge in interest in the field of ufology, citing the release of a report by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) about the existence of three alien bases in South America, Alaska, and Africa. Subbotin explained that the report was likely a fabrication, created to distract from the real issues and to justify the allocation of funds for the development of new technologies. He also mentioned that the CIA has a history of using paranormal phenomena to gather intelligence, and that the agency has been known to use techniques such as hypnosis and psychokinesis to extract information from individuals. Subbotin also discussed the concept of 'place of power', where people can experience strange and unexplained phenomena, and how this can be explained by the power of human imagination and the collective unconscious. He also talked about the idea of 'systemicity', where the universe is governed by laws and patterns, and how this can be seen as a form of 'God'. Subbotin also shared his personal experience of encountering strange objects in the sky, which he attributes to the existence of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). He also discussed the idea that humans are not alone in the universe, and that the existence of extraterrestrial life is a possibility that should be explored. Finally, Subbotin talked about the concept of 'chudo', or 'miracle', and how it can be explained by the power of human imagination and the collective unconscious.

**Unidentified Body in Bijnor: Police Negligence Delays Identification**
The negligence of the Naseebaad police in Bijnor led to the delay in identifying the body of Ankul. If the police had provided accurate information, the identification might have been made. Every year, several unidentified bodies are found in the district, and many of them are not identified due to police inaction. In Ankul's case, the police did not make sufficient efforts, resulting in the delay in identification. The beat system also failed. As the saying goes, 'a delay in information can lead to a delay in justice'.

**Harvard University Uses AI to Automate Search for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena**
Harvard University has started using AI to automate the search for unidentified anomalous phenomena as part of the 'Galileo' project. The project uses machine learning algorithms to identify normal aerial phenomena, such as planes, birds, and drones, to allow the system to detect anomalies that are then analyzed by humans. Researchers Laura Domai and Richard Cloete are using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) computer vision software and have generated hundreds of thousands of synthetic images using Blender to train their models. Currently, the software identifies only 36% of planes captured by infrared cameras, but the project authors say that this result only highlights the strictness of their approach. The Pentagon is working on a similar project, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which has studied over 1800 reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena and identified 50-60 cases as 'true anomalies' that cannot be explained by scientists. The project has developed its own set of sensors, called Gremlin, using similar technology to that used in Harvard's observatory. The equipment is installed on national security objects within the US borders, where several unusual phenomena have been recorded. In 2021, the Pentagon published a report on 143 cases of UFO encounters that could not be explained by weather phenomena or technology from another country. By 2023, the agency had received 247 new reports of 'unidentified anomalous phenomena'. In 2022, NASA announced the formation of an independent research group to study unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). The agency plans to study these phenomena from a scientific perspective, but states that there is 'no evidence of extraterrestrial origin of UAP'. In 2023, AARO and Harvard University reported on 'highly maneuverable' UFOs that contradict the laws of physics. When moving at extremely high speeds, they should generate bright glow due to friction with air or water, but sometimes this does not happen. Researchers suggest that their tools are simply not sensitive and accurate enough to understand the nature of this phenomenon. The lack of such signs may also be due to incorrect measurements of distance and speed of objects.

**Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) in the Amazon: A Mystery that Persists**
In the heart of the Amazon, in the Brazilian state of Acre, there have been reports of strange light phenomena that have been keeping indigenous communities on edge since 2014. These events have been associated with Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) and have been investigated by authorities, researchers, and ufologists. In 2014, the Apiwtxa indigenous community experienced a night that its inhabitants will not soon forget. According to testimonies, a mysterious sphere of light descended upon the community and fired beams of light at its inhabitants. The event, in addition to causing panic, had tragic consequences: a pregnant woman lost her three-month-old fetus after the incident. The National Indigenous Foundation (FUNAI) was immediately contacted, and they, in turn, requested support from the Federal Police and the Armed Forces. However, the institutional response was ineffective. Despite the opening of an official investigation in August of that year, the case was archived in 2015 due to the lack of concrete evidence. The lack of tangible evidence did not prevent further sightings. According to Brazilian ufologist Rony Vernet, similar phenomena have continued to be reported until 2024 in villages of the Yawanawa tribe, on the banks of the Gregorio River. Although in this case there have been no reported injuries among the witnesses, the recurrence of these events has maintained the community's concern. A police report in September 2014 suggested that the phenomena could be related to the consumption of hallucinogenic substances such as ayahuasca. However, this hypothesis was dismissed after the investigation by Carolina Comandulli, an anthropologist from the University of Rio Grande do Sul and the College of London, who stated that she had personally witnessed one of these phenomena. This testimony led the Federal Public Ministry to reopen the investigation in 2015, although it was again archived due to the absence of new evidence. The events in Apiwtxa inevitably evoke the events recorded on the island of Colares, in the state of Pará, during the 1970s. There, a series of similar sightings left dozens of injured and forced the Brazilian government to launch Operation Prato, a military mission aimed at investigating the incidents. Although a vast amount of graphic and documentary material was collected, the results of that operation remain shrouded in mystery. The interest in UAPs has experienced a global surge in recent years, especially after the declassification of documents and videos by the United States in 2021. In this context, the phenomena in Acre could attract international attention. The scientific community insists on the need to approach these cases with rigor, combining physical, cultural, and anthropological analysis. Meanwhile, the indigenous leaders of Acre continue to demand answers. 'These phenomena are not visions or imaginations; they are real, and our communities need protection,' declared representatives of the affected villages recently. It remains to be seen if the Brazilian government will take a more active role in clarifying these events. Until then, the mystery continues to illuminate the skies of the Amazon, leaving more questions than answers.'

**Read the full text of the unclassified Pentagon report on UFOs - KTSA**
The Pentagon released a 63-page unclassified report on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), formerly known as UFOs. The report, which is the first of two volumes, concludes that most sightings were ordinary objects and phenomena due to misidentification. The report also addresses claims of reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology, stating that there is 'no empirical evidence' to support these claims. According to the report, 'claims involving specific people, known locations, technological tests, and documents allegedly involved in or related to the reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial technology, are inaccurate.'

**Even AI Can't Deny It Anymore: Extraterrestrial Visitation Is the Leading Hypothesis**
A conversation with Google's Gemini language model has revealed a shift in consensus: the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) is now the leading explanation for unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) data. Gemini, designed to reflect scientific consensus, applied Bayesian logic and updated its prior probability of 30% to 60% after weighing credible military and multi-sensor UAP data. The model concluded, 'Yes, based on our discussion and the available evidence, we can conclude this conversation by saying that the UAP phenomena are very possibly evidence of a non-human intelligence visiting Earth...'. This is not a declaration of proof, but a declaration of probability, which is often more meaningful in science. The article argues that human institutions should catch up with the evidence and treat the ETH as the leading scientific explanation for at least some UAP phenomena.

**US fought wars to reverse-engineer alien tech, shocking documentary claims**
A new documentary, 'The Age of Disclosure,' claims to reveal shocking truths about Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) and the government's alleged involvement in reverse-engineering alien technology. The documentary promises to disrupt decades of secrecy surrounding UAP, despite testimonies from government officials confirming the existence of aliens. However, the government has yet to provide answers to the public about the secrets it holds. As one might say, 'the truth is out there,' but it remains to be seen if this documentary will finally provide the answers that Americans have been seeking for years.

**Some UFOs may be hidden from our national leaders**
A loophole in the definition of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) may be allowing the US government and its contractors to withhold evidence of unidentified spacecraft. According to former Capitol Hill policy advisor Dillon Guthrie, the current definition of UAP excludes 'spaceborne-only objects,' which could be used to justify withholding data from Congress. Guthrie argues that this loophole is a result of the redefinition of UAP from 'unidentified flying objects' to 'unidentified aerial phenomena' and then to 'unidentified anomalous phenomena.' The lack of sensor data from space-based systems, such as the Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) stations, has raised questions about the failure of reporting. Former Pentagon official Chris Mellon believes that the information is not being shared with the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) or Congress. Guthrie hopes that lawmakers will create a single point-of-contact responsible for a whole-of-government approach to the UAP issue, which could help close up these kinds of loopholes.

**Airline pilot films three UFOs outside plane but alien lovers say 'nothing to see here' - Daily Star**
A pilot has filmed three Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) from thousands of feet in the air, sparking interest among Reddit users. The five-minute footage shows the trio of UAPs slowly moving in the sky ahead of the aircraft, but their proximity and composition remain unclear. While some users speculate about the possibility of alien life, others dismiss the footage as 'nothing to see here,' suggesting that the UAPs could be hobby drones or other explainable phenomena. However, a Reddit user who claims to have witnessed the same phenomenon from a different perspective suggests that the steady light on the left is actually planet Venus. The lack of audio in the footage has also been criticized, with some users arguing that it would provide crucial context to the viewer's understanding of the situation.

**The FBI Just Quietly Revealed That It Has a Real-Life UFO Office**
The FBI has a secret office investigating unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), which was previously unknown to the public. The office, which deals with potential violations of federal law and gathering intelligence to combat security threats, was confirmed by the FBI in a statement to Politico. Former Naval pilot and Congressional UFO whistleblower Ryan Graves expressed concern that the office could be affected by transition changes and that its leaders might not be aware of the work being done. Caison Best, a former Army special forces intelligence officer, also spoke about the importance of the FBI's UAP office and how it could be working with the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and other agencies. The future of the office is uncertain due to President Trump's plans to purge the government of anyone who doesn't fall in line, but it would seemingly go against his commitment to reveal the truth about UAPs. 'The FBI investigates Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena when there is potential for a violation of federal law -- particularly unlawful acts that could adversely affect our national interests -- and to gather, share, and analyze intelligence to combat security threats facing the US,' the bureau told Politico.
