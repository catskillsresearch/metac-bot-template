**U.S. Job Growth Crashes--Is a Fed Rate Cut Now Inevitable?**
U.S. private-sector hiring has slowed significantly, with only 37,000 jobs added in May, the slowest pace in over two years, according to ADP data. This is below every economist's estimate and job losses were seen in various sectors, including business services, manufacturing, and education. However, leisure, hospitality, and finance saw job gains. Treasury yields slipped and the S&P 500 nudged higher, while Donald Trump called for a Fed rate cut. Labor markets are softening, with hiring delays and longer unemployment spells, and the pressure is mounting on the Fed to cut rates. Wage growth remains strong, with a 7% pay bump for job switchers and a 4.5% raise for those staying put, but a University of Michigan survey shows consumers expect business conditions to worsen and unemployment to climb. Some economists are downplaying the ADP numbers, but investors may want to prepare for a bumpy ride as macro uncertainty drags on.

**Last DA hike under 7th Pay Commission in July to be bigger than last one -- New inflation data raises hopes**
Central government employees and pensioners are hopeful of a better dearness allowance (DA) hike in July 2025, as the All India Consumer Price Index (AICPI-IW) has registered a rise of 0.5 point in April 2025. The AICPI-IW index rose to 143.5, indicating a possible 3% hike from July 2025, making the DA around 57.95%. However, the final decision rests with the government, and the next two months' CPI-IW numbers will decide the DA hike. 'The All-India CPI-IW for April, 2025 increased by 0.5 point and stood at 143.5 (one hundred forty-three point five),' said the Labor Bureau. The steady rise in the index in March and April has strengthened the chances of a hike in dearness allowance.

**How to Calculate the Final Grade of the PAU 2025: Media Arithmetic and Weights of the Exam and Bachillerato**
To calculate the final grade of the PAU 2025, the media arithmetic of each exercise is taken into account, resulting in a value between 0 and 10 points with three decimal places. The minimum grade is 4, as stated in Europa Press. The university access grade is calculated by adding 60% of the normalized Bachillerato average grade and 40% of the access test grade. The final grade will have a value of 0 to 10 with three decimal places and the minimum required will be 5. For example, if the student obtains 7, 9, 6, 8, and 7 in the five exams of the general phase, the average is 7.4, which applying a 40% weight gives a total of 2.96 points. If the Bachillerato average is 8, applying a 60% weight gives 4.8 points. Adding 2.96 points from the general phase and 4.8 points from Bachillerato gives a final grade of 7.76 points. The specific or voluntary phase is also important to increase the grade. In this phase, students can present up to four different subjects, but only the two highest weighted notes will be counted. The universities assign values of 0.1 or 0.2 to each subject, depending on the relationship with the career to be studied. For example, if the student chooses the subjects of Chemistry and Mathematics, both weighted with a 0.2, and obtains a grade of 7 and 8, respectively, the total would be 1.4 points and 1.6 points, which would be added to the general phase grade. The final grade would be 7.76 points (general phase) plus 1.4 points and 1.6 points (specific phase), resulting in a total of 10.76 points. Therefore, the university admission grade for this student would be 10.76 points out of a maximum of 14.

**How American consumers are feeling the squeeze, in 4 charts**
The lingering effects of high inflation and high interest rates have made it difficult for many Americans to manage their debt. The combination of higher prices, uncertainty, and pessimism has led to a decline in consumer sentiment, with many people struggling to pay their bills. Student loan borrowers, in particular, have been affected by the end of the pandemic-era payment pause, with delinquencies jumping to 7.74% from 1%. Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, said, 'Adding student loans back into the mix certainly looks like it was a bridge too far for a lot of people, when it comes to their ability to pay the bills down.' The impact of defaulting on federal student loans can be severe, with credit scores dropping by an average of 140 points for those with scores above 620. Additionally, defaulted borrowers may see their wages garnished by the Department of Education. The use of Buy Now, Pay Later installment plans has increased, but it can also lead to overspending and financial difficulties. Consumer sentiment has been declining, with the University of Michigan's index down almost 30% since January.

**Breakfast briefing: More stagnation everywhere, more inflation in the US**
The US is experiencing stagflation, with the USD falling to a three-year low, gold rising, and US benchmark interest rates increasing. The week ahead will feature central bank rate decisions from Canada, the ECB, and India. The US non-farm payrolls report is expected to show a +130,000 increase, but the trend is 'ho-hum'. Factory and service sector PMIs will be closely watched for the consequences of trade war activity. The US has doubled steel tariffs, making its steel industry less competitive globally and embedding higher producer costs for American factories and higher prices for its customers. China's official PMIs show a contraction in the factory version, but a tiny expansion in services. Inflation pressures aren't evident in China, and Beijing has resisted Trump's request for a phone call with Xi. Other countries' PMIs show little change, but the trade war seems to be embedding stagnation. Inflation doesn't seem to be a problem, except in the US. Central banks in other countries can try a rate cut remedy, but this remedy is not available to the Americans. China is applying both monetary and fiscal policies to stabilise their situation. India reported a +7.4% expansion in Q1-2025 GDP, led by the construction sector and consumer spending. Canada also reported an expanding economy in Q1-2025, gaining +0.5% in the quarter. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey recovered its early month drop, but the level is very pessimistic. Job ad growth in Australia has turned into a decline, and the regulator ASIC found widespread compliance deficiencies in managed funds plans. The UST 10yr yield is now at 4.46%, and the Australian 10 year bond yield starts today at 4.31%.

**US Economy Faces Challenges: Tariffs, Inflation, and Labor Market Uncertainties**
The US economy is facing a challenging situation, with declining headline inflation on one hand and potential supply shocks and persistent cost pressures from trade policies on the other. Recent data and global developments have reignited concerns about the impact of tariffs on price stability. According to current data, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) have been showing a stable increase, reaching $20.669.5 billion in April 2025. However, underlying vulnerabilities, such as declining household savings and increasing debt, raise questions about the sustainability of this consumption growth. The labor market is sending mixed signals, with strong employment growth in non-agricultural sectors, but a decline in job openings and unemployment claims. The average hourly earnings continue to rise, indicating that wage pressures are still present. The Federal Reserve is being cautious, maintaining a 'wait and see' policy, and adjusting interest rates based on incoming data. However, trade policy uncertainties are putting the Fed in a difficult balancing act, as tariffs can both increase inflation (supply shock) and weaken economic activity and employment (investment and consumption delay). If tariffs affect inflation like food and energy shocks, it could make it harder to achieve price stability and increase the risk of stagflation. The June FOMC meeting (17-18 June) will be critical in determining how the Fed will address these risks and provide forward guidance. A notable point is the divergence between household inflation expectations and market and professional forecasts. Household expectations, reflected in Michigan University surveys, are increasing, while market-based and professional forecasts remain relatively stable. This divergence is a source of uncertainty for future inflation outlook.

**Selectivity 2025 Exams Begin in Andalusia with New Format**
The Selectivity 2025 exams began in Andalusia on June 3, with students facing the first test of the core subjects, the Language and Literature exam. This year's exam features a new format, with a single form and no option to choose between A and B, as in previous years. The goal is to evaluate students' competencies, reasoning, and development skills, rather than just their ability to memorize. Additionally, the exam will assess students' orthographic, grammatical, and lexical skills, as well as their ability to express themselves coherently and present their ideas effectively. A total of 51,928 students from Andalusia will take the exams on June 3-5. The University of Seville has the most registered students, with 11,267, followed by the University of Málaga, the University of Cádiz, the University of Granada, and the University of Córdoba.

**Waller outlines path to rate cuts this year**
Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller believes there is a path to interest rate cuts later this year, citing his expectations that tariffs will boost unemployment and temporarily increase inflation. Waller said that assuming the effective tariff rate settles close to his lower tariff scenario, underlying inflation continues to make progress to the 2% goal, and the labour market remains solid, he would support 'good news' rate cuts later this year. Waller referenced two scenarios for how trade policy may unfold, with a 'large-tariff' scenario assuming a 25% average trade-weighted tariff and a 'smaller-tariff' scenario assuming a 10% average tariff. He now estimates a 15% trade-weighted tariff on goods imports, which is somewhere in between the two scenarios. Waller largely dismissed a 2025 surge in the University of Michigan's gauge of consumers' inflation expectations, preferring to look at market-based measures of inflation compensation and professional forecasters' expectations. He said that the 'strong' labour market and recent progress towards the Fed's 2% inflation goal offer policymakers time to see how trade negotiations unfold. Waller underscored that considerable uncertainty remains around the ultimate level of duties imposed on other countries and sectors.

**US Consumer Sentiment Index Remains at 52.2 Points**
The Consumer Sentiment Index in the US remained at 52.2 points. Analysts, polled by Trading Economics, had expected the indicator to be at 51 points. The preliminary assessment for May was 50.8 points. Additionally, the Current Economic Conditions Index in the US decreased to 58.9 points from 59.8 points in April, while the Economic Expectations Index increased to 47.9 points from 47.3 points the previous month. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is based on a monthly survey of at least 500 American households on 50 key questions aimed at identifying changes in consumers' expectations regarding the economic climate, personal income, and consumption. The indicator is published twice a month in the form of initial and final assessments and affects the dynamics of the US dollar, stock markets, and US government bonds.

**US Consumer Confidence Index Remains Unchanged in May**
The University of Michigan released the final data for the consumer confidence index for May, which remained unchanged at 52.2 compared to the previous month. The index was revised upward, with a preliminary reading of 50.8 for the month. The consumer confidence index has continued to remain at its lowest level since July 2022. The current economic conditions index, which measures Americans' assessment of their financial situation, fell 0.9 points to 58.9 in May on a monthly basis. The consumer expectations index, which reflects consumers' long-term forecasts, rose 0.6 points to 47.9 during the same period. Consumers' short-term inflation expectations rose from 6.5% to 6.6% in May, marking the smallest increase since the November 2024 presidential election in the US, and indicating the end of the significant jumps in short-term expectations seen over the past four months.

**Americans' optimism about the economy is at a near-record low**
Americans' optimism about the economy has reached a near-record low, with the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index falling 2.7% to 50.8 in May. This is the second-lowest reading on record, just above the all-time low of 50 in June 2022. The index has dropped almost 30% since January, with consumers citing uncertainty and instability caused by President Trump's tariffs as a major concern. Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers, said, 'It's very clear that consumers are bracing for the uncertainty and instability of tariff policy.' Consumers expect tariffs to be painful, with year-ahead inflation expectations jumping to 7.3% from 6.5%. The current economic conditions index also dropped to 57.6, the lowest reading since December 2022. 'Consumers are understandably feeling a bit worse about where the economy is headed,' said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet. Economists had expected sentiment to improve in May, but the survey period ended before the recent détente and de-escalation in tariffs between the US and China. 'But these initial upticks were too small to alter the overall picture -- consumers continue to express somber views about the economy,' said Hsu.

**Brainwashed Democrats Continue To See Imminent Inflation-pocalypse; But UMich Sentiment Improved Intra-Month**
The University of Michigan's (UMich) consumer sentiment survey for April showed a decline in overall sentiment, but an improvement in intra-month sentiment. The survey's inflation expectations, however, remain high, with Democrats expecting 8.0% price rises in the next year, more than twice the rate they expected in June 2021. Republicans, on the other hand, expect 0.4% inflation. Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, said, 'Consumers perceived risks to multiple aspects of the economy, in large part due to ongoing uncertainty around trade policy and the potential for a resurgence of inflation looming ahead.' The survey showed that labor market expectations remained bleak, and consumers anticipated weaker income growth for themselves in the year ahead. Goldman Sachs has previously criticized the Michigan measure for being susceptible to partisan bias, with inflation expectations boosted by about 1.3pp and long-term inflation expectations by 0.5pp since 2024Q4.

**Michigan Consumer Sentiment Drops To 57.0; SP500 Tests Session Lows**
The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment report showed a decline in current economic conditions and consumer expectations. The Current Economic Conditions index decreased from 65.7 in February to 63.8 in March, while the Index of Consumer Expectations declined from 64.0 to 52.6. Year-ahead inflation expectations increased from 4.3% to 5.0%, reaching the highest level since November 2022. The report also showed that two-thirds of consumers expect unemployment to increase in the year ahead. According to the University of Michigan, 'Consumers continue to worry about the potential for pain amid ongoing economic policy developments.' The weaker-than-expected report led to a decline in the U.S. Dollar Index, which tested session lows, and a rise in gold prices, which settled near the $3080 level. The SP500 also remained under pressure, trying to settle below the 5635 level.
