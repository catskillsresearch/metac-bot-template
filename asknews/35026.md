**The End of the IT Industry as We Know It**
By 2035, the world no longer needs people who want to 'enter' the IT industry. Automation has taken over simple tasks, and AI has become so advanced that it can create entire MVPs based on a voice message description. Companies no longer hire juniors, as AI can handle everything. Mid-level professionals have also left the industry, leaving only senior experts who are needed for complex solutions and AI management. These experts are few in number, and the rest are left watching as 'entering the IT industry' becomes a myth. Professionals who have managed to stay in the industry no longer need assistants, as they have AI assistants that are accurate, fast, and don't ask questions. Ivan, who started learning in 2025, tried to enter the industry but faced numerous obstacles, including the lack of real-world projects and the inability to compete with AI-generated projects. He eventually gave up and started working with children to help them cope with the reality of the industry. He still codes in his free time, not out of hope, but out of love.

**UST's Wang Xingxing Reveals Humanoid Robot Industry's Hot Trend and Future Prospects**
The sixth Shanghai Innovation and Entrepreneurship Youth 50 Forum was held on May 10, 2025, where Wang Xingxing, CEO of UST, revealed that the humanoid robot industry has experienced an unprecedented hot trend, with many companies accelerating the landing of downstream scenarios. Many humanoid robot manufacturers have gone out of stock, including UST, which is currently facing a shortage of personnel in various positions. Wang Xingxing believes that in the next 2-5 years, the problem of end-to-end artificial intelligence will become the core of technical research and development. Therefore, the strongest humanoid robot company must be a company with artificial intelligence capabilities. Currently, hardware issues are also hindering the development of the industry, and how to produce low-cost, long-lasting hardware is a key factor in large-scale production. UST has become a leader in product sales, with a sales volume of 23,700 units in 2024 and a market share of nearly 70%. The company has also delivered over 1,500 humanoid robots. With the continuous progress of technology, humanoid robots are expected to become the next generation of large-scale deployment of intelligent terminals, bringing about a wide range of market opportunities. The 2025 World Robot Competition - the first Humanoid Robot Sports Festival will be held on August 15-17, 2025, with a comprehensive competition including football, track and field, and pharmaceutical sorting. The festival will also include a theme conference and a carnival. The festival is organized by the China Electronics Society, the Wuhan Investment Holding Group, and the China Humanoid Robot Association. The event will showcase the comprehensive capabilities of humanoid robots. Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, has been a focus in the industry. In June 2024, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would perform a major hardware upgrade on Optimus in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, and would enter the limited production stage in 2025. On March 21, 2025, Musk announced that Tesla had completed the manufacturing of Optimus on the production line in Fremont, California. Tesla plans to produce 5,000 units of Optimus in 2025 and 50,000 units in 2026. To accelerate the mass production of Optimus, Tesla has published multiple job postings on its website, mostly for engineers, including machine learning engineers, deep learning operation engineers, and reinforcement learning engineers. This indicates that Tesla is still investing heavily in artificial intelligence to improve the overall capabilities of Optimus. On April 19, 2025, the Beijing Humanoid Robot Half Marathon was held, which attracted widespread attention and discussion. It was found that multiple companies' humanoid robots had shown impressive performance. Figure is another focus humanoid robot manufacturer. On February 21, 2025, Figure released the Helix end-to-end humanoid model, which first applied the 'visual-language-action (VLA)' to humanoid robots, enhancing the robot's learning ability and limb control ability. The Helix is composed of two AI modules, playing the roles of 'brain' and 'little brain'. The 'brain' module is a 70 billion-parameter multimodal model that can process multimodal information at a frequency of 7-9 Hz. The 'little brain' module is an 8 million-parameter AI that converts the 'brain' module's instructions into actions at a frequency of 200 Hz. As the humanoid robot industry develops, AI chips (realizing robot brain and small brain intelligence), reducers, dexterous hands, PEEK materials, motors, lithium batteries, and silk rods (transmission devices) will also have development opportunities. According to iFinD financial data terminal, the concept stocks of humanoid robots include: Huaan Technology, Bluesky Technology, iFlytek, Three Flowers Intelligent Control, Shanghai Electric, Guangqi Technology, Billion Energy, Rui Xing Micro, Peng Ding Holdings, Sheng Hong Technology, Guangqi Group, Li Yi Intelligent Manufacturing, and Zhonglian Heavy Industry.
