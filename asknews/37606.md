**Stem Stock: A High-Stakes Decision Day**
Today, Stem's future is at stake as shareholders vote on a drastic reverse split, a last-ditch effort to save the company's listing on the NYSE. The proposed 1:10 to 1:20 reverse split aims to artificially boost the stock price, meeting the New York Stock Exchange's minimum requirements. However, this radical measure may not be enough to stabilize the struggling company. Analysts are divided, with some still recommending a buy, while others are uncertain about the company's turnaround prospects. A shareholder approval could bring short-term relief, but a rejection would raise existential questions about the company's future on the stock exchange. For investors, it's a high-risk game with an uncertain outcome.

**Wind opponents sue Trump administration to block New York wind project**
Fishing companies and offshore wind opponents have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the Empire Wind project, a $5 billion wind farm off New York's coast. The lawsuit challenges the administration's decision to reverse a stop work order and allow construction to resume. The plaintiffs argue that the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management did not follow the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to provide a basis for restoring the work permits. Bruce Afran, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said, 'The administration correctly pulled the Empire Wind work permit because of these concerns and had no basis to reinstate the work orders a month later.' The project is expected to provide power for half a million homes from 2027 onward. Equinor, the developer of the project, said it has undergone years of rigorous permitting and studies and secured all necessary approvals to begin construction in 2024.

**Mexico Saves 12 Billion Pesos in Purchase of Medicines and Medical Supplies**
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo announced on Tuesday that the government has saved 12 billion pesos (mdp) in the purchase of medicines and medical supplies through the innovative reverse auction mechanism. The reverse auction allowed the acquisition of 399 lots and 988 million pieces as part of the Consolidated Purchase of Medicines and Medical Supplies 2025-2026. According to Sheinbaum, 'the goal is to maintain quality, and whoever offers the lowest price can acquire the medicine.' The new model of purchase implemented by the Mexican government will enable the administration to acquire medical equipment and supplies needed for the sector's operation, while avoiding overpriced purchases. The government's new authority is possible thanks to the modification of the Law of Acquisitions, Leases and Services of the Public Sector of Mexico, which came into effect on April 16. The change aims to improve transparency, efficiency, and rationality in public purchases, as well as promote the participation of Mexican companies and improve prices. The federal government acted in coordination with the Ministry of Health, Laboratories of Biological and Reactives of Mexico (Birmex), and the Ministry of Anticorruption and Good Government to make this procedure an institutional practice that avoids corruption and private benefit at the expense of the Mexican state, as happened in previous administrations. The Undersecretary of Integration and Development of the Health Sector, Eduardo Clark García Dobarganes, added that the reverse auctions 'allowed us to acquire the medicines for 23 billion pesos, which meant a saving of 12 billion pesos, equivalent to building five hospitals of 120 beds or the annual salary of 30,000 specialist doctors.' The savings achieved represented a significant reduction, as the initial cost of the materials acquired was 35 billion pesos.

**Effect of Altisource 1-for-8 Share Consolidation on Publicly Tra**
Altisource Portfolio Solutions (ASPS) has announced the impact of its 1-for-8 reverse stock split on its publicly traded warrants, effective May 28, 2025. The Warrant Exercise Rate has decreased from 1.625 to 0.20313, requiring warrant holders to exercise at least five warrants to receive one share of common stock. The Implied Per Share Exercise Price has risen significantly, from $1.20 to $9.5998, making the price per share eight times higher than before the reverse split. This could impact the willingness or ability of warrant holders to exercise their warrants. The company's warrants will become exercisable starting July 2, 2025, or once the stock's VWAP meets or exceeds the $9.5998 level for 15 consecutive trading days.

**Federal Reserve Reports Second Year of Negative Net Income Amid High Interest Rates | PYMNTS.com**
The Federal Reserve's System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported a second consecutive year of negative net income in 2024, with losses totaling $74.7 billion. According to the New York Federal Reserve, the decline in net income was due to a 'sharp reduction' in overnight reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, partially offset by lower interest income from SOMA securities holdings. The report projects that total SOMA net income could remain negative in 2025, driven by the cost of interest-bearing Federal Reserve liabilities, before returning to positive levels in subsequent years. The Fed's operating losses began in late 2022 as policymakers raised rates to fight inflation, leaving the central bank paying out more in interest on its liabilities than it earns on its bond holdings. However, lower short-term rates and higher interest income from higher-yielding securities are expected to turn net income positive in late 2025.

The White House is urging foreign nations to submit their best trade offers by Wednesday as it rushes to clinch deals before a July deadline. According to a report, the US is asking countries for their best offers on tariffs, quotas for purchases of US products, and plans to eliminate non-tariff barriers. The US Trade Representative's office has sent a letter to trade partners, including the European Union, Japan, India, and Vietnam, requesting their proposals. The US will evaluate the proposed offers and put forth a 'possible landing zone,' which could include tariffs. The White House has been in active trade talks with several partners, and has sent a list of demands to Vietnam, including a request for factories to slash their use of materials and components from China. Meanwhile, President Trump's tariffs are facing legal challenges after the US Court of International Trade moved to block most of them, excluding levies on steel, aluminum, and auto parts and cars. Trump has written on Truth Social that if the courts rule against him, it would allow other countries to hold the US hostage with their anti-American tariffs, leading to economic ruin for the US.

**Nigel Farage demands government reverse winter fuel cut for pensioners in ful...**
Nigel Farage, writing in the Daily Express, has promised that Reform UK would reverse the winter fuel cut for pensioners if they win the next general election. He stated that 'many pensioners, through no fault of their own, will continue to lose out if this isn't reinstated fully' and called for the Chancellor to 'set the record straight' in her upcoming Spending Review. Labour's Rachel Reeves announced the winter fuel cut last July, which was widely blamed for the party's poor local election results. The Prime Minister has since signaled a partial U-turn on the policy, and Reeves confirmed that the changes will be made in time for more people to receive the winter fuel payment this winter. However, she refused to confirm if an announcement would be made at the Spending Review or the next Autumn Budget.

**Why 2025 might be the best year yet to buy gold  --  before the next...**
According to Louise Street, Senior Market Analyst at the World Gold Council, gold has consistently outpaced inflation and preserved purchasing power over the long term. In 2022, gold climbed nearly 10% amid rising inflation, and has exceeded $3,000 per ounce as investors seek alternatives to equities and real estate. Street recommends physical gold for long-term stability and true ownership, and emphasizes the importance of transparency and trust in the gold market. The World Gold Council has established the Retail Gold Investment Principles (RGIPs) and Investor Guidance to help ensure responsible business conduct and high standards across the gold retail sector. Trusted names in the industry include American Hartford Gold, GoldCo, and Patriot Gold, which offer secure transactions, IRA rollover support, and full compliance with industry standards.

**McDonald's Snack Wrap returns to menu in July as company aims to reverse US sales slump**
McDonald's is bringing back the Snack Wrap to its menu on July 10, 2025, as part of an effort to reverse a decline in same-store sales at its US restaurants. The move comes after a 3.6% decline in US same-store sales growth in the first quarter, following a 1.4% drop in the fourth quarter. McDonald's US President Joe Erlinger said, 'The Snack Wrap is back. It's because you've sounded off. We've heard you.' The company is also launching the McValue platform to entice consumers with low prices, but so far, it has not been enough to regain momentum. Analyst Andy Barish suspects that the return of snack wraps will help McDonald's regain some lost momentum, saying, 'Snack wraps returning in 2025... [will] allow McDonald's to regain what we saw, to some extent, in October before the food-borne illness situation.' Year to date, shares of McDonald's are up more than 6.8%, outpacing the S&P 500's 1.2% gain.

**Chinese Nationals Dominate Foreign Real Estate Purchases in Korea**
Foreigners, particularly Chinese nationals, have been buying up apartments in Seoul's Gangnam district at an alarming rate. According to data from the court's registration information center, between January and May this year, 5153 foreign nationals applied to purchase or transfer ownership of collective buildings in Korea, with 66.9% of those applications coming from Chinese nationals. The majority of these purchases were made in the Seoul metropolitan area, with the highest concentration in Incheon's Bupyeong-gu. However, in the Gangnam district, where high-end apartments are concentrated, American nationals made up 55% of foreign buyers, while Chinese nationals accounted for only 13.3%. The increasing trend of foreign ownership of Korean real estate has sparked concerns about 'reverse discrimination' against Korean nationals. Chinese nationals, in particular, have been buying up Korean real estate at an alarming rate, with their share of foreign buyers increasing from 53.7% in 2022 to 56.2% last year. This has led to criticism that Chinese nationals are taking advantage of lax regulations and tax loopholes. 'It's not just a matter of reverse discrimination, but also a matter of fairness,' said an expert. 'We need to establish clear regulations and tax policies to ensure that foreign nationals are not taking advantage of our system.'

**New York Budget Law May Discourage Institutional Ownership of Single and Two-Family Homes**
The New York State budget for fiscal year 2025-2026 has introduced restrictions on institutional investors owning 10 or more single and two-family homes. Covered entities, defined as those with $50 million or more in net value or assets under management, will be subject to non-tax restrictions, including a 90-day waiting period before purchasing a property. Additionally, tax changes will prevent institutional investors from claiming depreciation and interest deductions on single-family and two-family homes when filing their New York tax returns. However, interest deductions will still be available for properties sold to individuals or nonprofit organizations focused on affordable housing. The tax provisions are effective for tax years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2025, while the 90-day restriction on purchasing one and two-family homes is effective July 1, 2025.

**Navigating Nasdaq and NYSE: Essential Insights for Companies**
In 2025, 145 companies have effectuated reverse stock splits to comply with Nasdaq and NYSE's minimum share price requirement of US $1.00. Nasdaq has introduced rule changes that make it more challenging for companies to effectuate reverse stock splits. Companies listed on Nasdaq have 180 days to regain compliance with the bid price requirement, unless they have effectuated a reverse stock split in the prior 12 months or have effected one or more reverse stock splits over the prior two-year period with a cumulative ratio of 250 shares or more to one. If a company fails to regain compliance, it will be issued a delisting letter and its securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq. Delaware requires stockholder approval to effectuate a reverse stock split, while Nevada does not require approval if the split is proportional to the authorized shares. Nasdaq has also implemented new rules requiring companies to satisfy the minimum Market Value of Unrestricted Publicly Held Shares ('MVUPHS') requirement solely from the proceeds of the initial public offering.

**Putin Orders Development of Reverse Purchase Mechanism for Foreign Companies**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the government to develop a mechanism for the reverse purchase of assets by foreign companies that have left the Russian market by May 15. According to the presidential decree, the government must introduce changes to the Russian legislation to establish the conditions for foreign investors to exercise their right to reverse purchase of shares (stakes in the charter capital) of Russian companies, which were transferred to them on non-market terms after February 22, 2022. Putin said, 'Ensure the introduction of amendments to the legislation of the Russian Federation aimed at establishing the features of the exercise by foreign investors of the right to reverse purchase of shares (stakes in the charter capital) of Russian companies, which were transferred to them on non-market terms after February 22, 2022.'

**Putin Orders Conditions for Reverse Purchase of Assets by Foreigners**
According to the New York Times Europe, Russian President Putin has instructed the government to determine the conditions for the reverse purchase of assets by foreigners. The instruction is included in the list of tasks following the meeting of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, which took place on March 18. The conditions for the reverse purchase should 'take into account the rights and legitimate interests of Russian citizens and legal entities, who are the owners of these shares (stakes in the charter capital)'. Additionally, the government must create a list of individuals from 'hostile' countries who have reduced or terminated their business in Russia since the start of the war. The basic criteria for foreign companies to return include: no funding for the Ukrainian military, 'foreign agents', 'undesirable organizations'; no debts for wages and taxes; payment of wages to employees until their departure from the market. Other conditions being discussed include: achieving a certain level of localization of production; ensuring the transfer of technologies; placing in Russia the maximum possible chain of elements, including production facilities, as well as engineering centers. As noted by The Bell, the management of 'AvtoVAZ' is particularly concerned about the guarantees for the reverse purchase, even with agreements in place, and the transfer of technologies. For example, Renault is expected to pay 112.5 billion rubles to restore its rights as an acquirer.

**NYSE Adopts New Reverse Stock Split Rules**
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has adopted an amendment to the reverse stock split rules, effective January 2025. The amendment states that a listed company will not be eligible for a compliance period if it has previously undergone a reverse stock split and meets certain criteria, such as having an average closing price of less than $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days. Additionally, a listed company may not effectuate a reverse stock split if it would result in the company falling below other continued listing requirements. The NYSE will immediately commence suspension and delisting procedures if a listed company fails to meet these requirements. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has stated that the amendment is consistent with investor protection concerns, as repeated reverse stock splits can be indicative of deep financial or operational distress.
