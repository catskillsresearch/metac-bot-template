**PitchBook: Cryptocurrency Venture Capital Operations Decline, but Funding Increases More Than Double**
According to PitchBook, the number of cryptocurrency operations in the first quarter of 2025 decreased by almost 40% compared to the same period last year, but the amount invested more than doubled. Robert Le, senior analyst of cryptocurrency research at PitchBook, said, 'Capital continued to seek the utility central channels of crypto despite macroeconomic turmoil.' Venture capital firms invested nearly $2.55 billion in 16 operations in companies such as cryptocurrency managers, exchanges, and financial services, at a rate that far exceeded any other segment. Companies in the infrastructure and cryptocurrency development sectors received the next largest amount of funding, with nearly $955 million in 30 operations. Le believes that the initial public offering (IPO) of Circle 'represents the most important price discovery event for crypto assets since Coinbase went public in 2021.' If Circle is valued above the rumored range of $4 billion to $5 billion, it could show investors that similar business models are profitable and sustainable, providing a clearer reference point for future exits. 'A strong roadshow could attract late-stage capital and restore upward expectations for valuation across the payments and infrastructure stack,' Le said.

**The Significance of Adding Encryption to a Narrow Bank**
Todd H Baker, a managing partner at Broadmoor Consulting, questioned the significance of adding an extra layer of encryption on a narrow bank. Circle Internet, the issuer of USDC, a leading fiat-backed stablecoin with a circulating supply of around $43 billion, has filed an S-1 with the SEC to go public through an IPO. Despite having underwriters Morgan Stanley and Citi, and a valuation of $5 billion, the process is still challenging. This is Circle's second attempt at going public, after a failed SPAC deal in 2021 valued at $9 billion.

**Crypto VC deals drop in Q1, but funding more than doubles: PitchBook**
According to PitchBook, the number of crypto venture deals in Q1 2025 dropped by 39.5% from the same quarter last year, but the total value of deals more than doubled to $6 billion. Robert Le, senior crypto research analyst at PitchBook, said that 'capital continued to seek crypto's core utility rails' despite macroeconomic turmoil. The largest venture funding went to businesses like crypto asset managers, exchanges, and financial services, with $2.55 billion across 16 deals. Looking ahead, Le believes that Circle's pending IPO 'represents the most important price-discovery event for crypto equity since Coinbase listed in 2021.' He estimates a 64% chance that Circle will go public in the future and notes that the market value of stablecoins grew 12% over the first quarter, from $202.3 billion to $227.1 billion.

**Wall Street: Several Companies Put IPO Plans on Hold Amid 'Trump Effect'**
Several companies, including CoreWeave, Chime, Cerebras, eToro, SailPoint, Klarna, Circle, StubHub, Discord, and Figma, had planned to go public on Wall Street this year, but the 'Trump effect' has put their plans on hold. CoreWeave, valued at around $23 billion, is the only one that has successfully gone public so far. Chime, a digital banking company, has postponed its IPO due to market volatility. eToro, a trading platform, is still planning to go public, with a valuation of around $4 billion and a price range of $46 to $50 per share. Other companies, such as Klarna and Circle, have delayed their IPOs, while Discord and Figma are still negotiating with banks and do not expect to debut until 2025.

**Venture Capital Funding for Cryptocurrency Projects Doubles in Q1 2025**
According to PitchBook, the volume of venture capital funding for cryptocurrency projects has doubled since the end of 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, 405 deals were made, a 39.5% decrease from the same period last year (670 deals), but an 8.2% increase from the fourth quarter of last year (372 deals). The total value of deals in the first quarter increased more than twice compared to last year, reaching $6 billion, compared to $2.6 billion and $3 billion in the first and fourth quarters of 2024, respectively. Robert Le, a senior cryptocurrency analyst at PitchBook, noted that capital continued to flow towards cryptocurrency projects with real use cases, despite macroeconomic shocks during the quarter. Venture capitalists invested nearly $2.55 billion in 16 deals in cryptocurrency management and financial services companies, as well as cryptocurrency exchanges. This segment accounted for the largest share of funding. Next are companies in the cryptocurrency infrastructure and development sector, which received nearly $955 million in 30 deals. Le noted that the upcoming listing of Circle's USDC stablecoin on an exchange through an initial public offering (IPO) will be the most significant event for cryptocurrency stocks since Coinbase's listing on the Nasdaq in 2021. If Circle is valued above the expected range of $4-5 billion, it may show venture investors that similar business models are profitable and sustainable, and provide a clearer benchmark for future listings. According to PitchBook, Circle has attracted venture capital funding of $1.18 billion to date, and the probability of its listing is 64%. Le also noted that the market value of stablecoins grew by 12% in the first quarter (from $202.3 to $227.1 billion), while other cryptocurrencies faced a decline or stagnation in value. The company believes that 'this divergence highlights the growing consensus: dollar-denominated calculations remain a killer feature of cryptocurrencies.' PitchBook expects venture investments to increase 'in payment startups, transfers, and treasury management, which directly monetize the speed of stablecoins.' Le added that the Bybit cryptocurrency exchange hack in February, which was the largest in history, may accelerate institutional demand for real-time reserve confirmation tools, improved storage solutions, and software that simplifies key management.

**Circle Plans to Go Public Through IPO with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Others**
Circle has announced plans to go public through an initial public offering (IPO) with the help of banks JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and SG Americas. The exact parameters of the IPO, including the number of shares and target price, are not specified. If approved by the SEC, the company's shares will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CRCL. This is Circle's second attempt to go public in the US, following a failed SPAC merger in 2021 and a registration statement filed in January 2024. Circle's valuation on private secondary markets is estimated at $5 billion, down from $9 billion in 2022 when it attempted to go public through a SPAC. According to Circle, the company's reserve assets, which provide liquidity for its stablecoins USDC, generated $1.7 billion in revenue by the end of 2024, accounting for 99.1% of the company's total revenue. The company's financials have been volatile, with a net loss of $768.8 million in 2022, followed by a net income of $267.6 million in 2023 and $155.7 million in 2024. As of the end of last year, the company's liquidity was valued at $1.05 billion, including $751 million in cash and cash equivalents. Previously, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) approved Circle's stablecoins USDC and EURC as official cryptocurrencies of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).

**Circle Files for IPO, Plans to List on NYSE**
Circle, the stablecoin issuer, has filed a public application for an initial public offering (IPO) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Boston-based fintech company plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker 'CRCL'. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are serving as the lead underwriters for the IPO. Circle reported a revenue of $1.68 billion for 2024, a 16% increase from $1.45 billion in the previous year, while the net income was $156 million, a 42% decline from $268 million in 2023. This marks Circle's second attempt to go public, after a planned SPAC merger in 2022 failed. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of around $60 billion, is pegged to the US dollar and secured by liquid assets and short-term government bonds. The IPO comes at a volatile time for tech stocks, but could signal further crypto IPOs in 2025, such as from Kraken or Gemini. Circle emphasizes its growing enterprise business with over 500 partners. However, the numbers are intriguing, with revenue growing 16% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, while EBITDA declined 29% to $285 million and net income fell 42% to $155 million. This suggests rising costs or margin problems. A provocative analyst notes that Coinbase earns more from USDC than Circle itself, and also more from Ethereum than the Ethereum Foundation, highlighting the dominant role of central platforms in the crypto ecosystem. Circle's President, Heath Tarbert, sees a critical moment where the US can take the lead in international regulation of digital dollars, promoting innovation and fairness in payments. For 2025, this opens up the chance for stronger growth and broader acceptance of stablecoins in the US and globally. The plans are clearly focused on growth, making the ICO an important part of Circle's expansion and USDC's growth. For risk-tolerant investors, crypto presales offer the chance for high returns before a coin is publicly listed. The entry at favorable prices and the potential for viral projects make them attractive. Unlike the stock market, where it is hardly possible for private investors to currently invest in Circle, the crypto market is fairer and more decentralized. A completely new approach is taken by the BTCBULL token, which has already collected over $4.35 million in its presale. More information about BTCBULL can be found.

**Circle Files for IPO, Seeking to List on NYSE**
Circle, the issuer of the stablecoin USDC, has filed a request for an initial public offering (IPO) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If approved, the company's shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol CRCL. The IPO could be the largest in the crypto industry since Coinbase's listing in 2021. 'Going public as a US company demonstrates our unwavering commitment to transparency and accountability, as we will be required to comply with the requirements applicable to registered public companies listed on the NYSE,' said Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a specific asset, such as the US dollar, euro, or ounce of gold. To secure the peg, companies use securities, national currencies, or other cryptocurrencies. The largest stablecoins are USDT from Tether and USDC from Circle, with market capitalizations of $144 billion and $60 billion, respectively. Circle's business model involves buying securities, primarily US government bonds, to form reserves that support the issuance of USDC and its peg to the US dollar. According to the company's 2024 financials, Circle earned $1.7 billion from managing these reserves, which accounted for 99.1% of its total revenue. The largest expenses were payments to the exchange Coinbase, which partnered with Circle to distribute USDC. In 2024, Coinbase received $907.9 million from Circle, according to the documents. This will be Circle's second attempt to go public: in 2021, the company planned a merger with SPAC Concord, but the deal was delayed due to SEC approval and was canceled in 2022 amid the FTX collapse. In January 2024, Circle re-filed documents for a traditional IPO in a confidential manner. 'We believe that being a public company in the US will provide us with the necessary transparency and accountability to operate in a highly regulated environment,' said Jeremy Allaire. The company has estimated that its valuation could be between $4-5 billion, while in 2022, it stated that its worth was $9 billion. JPMorgan Chase will serve as the lead organizer of the IPO in collaboration with Citigroup, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and Societe Generale. The regulatory framework for stablecoins was one of the key promises made by US President Donald Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign. After taking office, Trump tasked lawmakers with developing a ready-to-sign bill by mid-summer. However, the question of whether dollar-pegged stablecoin issuers must register in the US remains unanswered. 'It's about protecting consumer rights and financial integrity,' said Jeremy Allaire, emphasizing that issuers should be based in the US. However, Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin USDT, is registered in El Salvador. Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino suggested that his competitors are trying to influence the passage of the stablecoin law in their favor. 'You can't sue us,' he said.

**Stablecoin giant Circle files for IPO after $1.7B stablecoin reserve windfall**
Circle, the US-based stablecoin issuer, has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company's stock will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol 'CRCL' if approved. Circle's reserve income from managing its stablecoin-related reserves was $1.7 billion at the end of 2024, representing 99.1% of its total revenue. The company's IPO has been highly anticipated, partly due to its previous failed attempt in 2021. Circle's CEO, Jeremy Allaire, said that the company didn't complete the SEC's 'qualification in time' for the previous attempt. The company has now hired investment banks JPMorgan Chase and Citi to help with its IPO, potentially valuing the company at $4 billion to $5 billion.

**Circle Files for IPO, Aiming for $4-5 Billion Valuation**
Circle, the US-based company behind the USDC stablecoin, has officially filed a prospectus with the SEC to go public on the New York Stock Exchange. If successful, it will be the first major cryptocurrency player to list on a major exchange since Coinbase in 2021. Circle, founded in 2013 by Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville, is a major player in the sector, with its USDC stablecoin being the second largest by market capitalization, with around $60 billion in circulation. The company is expected to be valued between $4 and $5 billion. Circle had previously attempted to go public via a SPAC merger, but abandoned the plan in 2022 due to market volatility. Other tech and financial companies, such as Klarna and StubHub, are also preparing their IPOs.

**Circle hires banks for long-awaited IPO, stablecoin giant expected to publicly file late April**
Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is moving forward with its long-awaited IPO. The fintech is working with JPMorgan Chase and Citi on the listing, aiming to publicly file paperwork in late April. This would be Circle's second attempt at listing its shares, following a failed SPAC arrangement in 2021. The public filing would provide a deep look at Circle's financials and mark a final step towards a public listing of its shares. The Circle IPO would be the biggest crypto IPO since Coinbase went public in 2021, with JPMorgan and Citi also serving as financial advisors for the Coinbase listing. Circle has raised $1.1 billion in funding from investors including BlackRock and Coinbase, and the market for new public listings has improved significantly from 2024's dismal showing.

**Circle IPO: How to Buy Circle Stock in 2025?**
Circle, a digital currency company, is not yet publicly traded, but it has filed for a US IPO in early 2024. The company's USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin has a market capitalization of $56.5 billion, making it the 7th largest cryptocurrency. Circle offers a range of products and services, including trading services through its platform, and has a focus on institutional clients through its Circle Invest services. According to valuations from previous funding rounds, Circle's potential IPO valuation could be in the range of $7-9 billion. A Circle representative noted, 'Becoming a U.S.-listed public company has long been part of Circle’s strategic aspirations,' but declined to comment on rumors. It is possible that Circle will go public sometime in 2025, and investors can gain indirect exposure to the company by investing in companies with an equity stake in it, such as Coinbase.
