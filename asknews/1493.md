**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**Europe's Aging Population: A Growing Concern**
The median age in Europe has reached 44.7 years, with some countries, such as Italy, already exceeding 48.7 years. According to Eurostat, the population of the EU will begin to decline in 2026, with a projected decrease of 50 million people by 2100. The main cause of this demographic shift is the decline in fertility rates, which have fallen below the replacement level. In 2023, the global fertility rate in the EU was 1.38 children per woman, down from 1.44 in 2003 and below the replacement level of 2.1. Eurostat estimates that the proportion of people aged 65 or older will increase from 21.6% in 2024 to 32.5% in 2100, while the proportion of people aged 80 or older will multiply by 2.5, from 6% to 15%. The tasa de dependencia, which measures the relationship between the number of young people and those of older age, will tend to worsen, with a projected ratio of two people in work for every one dependent in 2024. As stated by Eurostat, 'the process of aging is so accelerated, linked to the increases in longevity, that Eurostat predicts that the proportion of people aged 80 or more in the population of the EU will multiply by 2.5 between 2024 and 2100, passing from 6% to 15%.'

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Professor Subhash Kak, a computer science expert, warns that AI could lead to a devastating impact on the human population, potentially shrinking it to 100 million by 2300. He attributes this to AI replacing jobs, making it difficult for people to have children who will grow up with employment opportunities. Kak points to AI as the culprit, saying it will replace 'everything', including decision-making in offices. He notes that demographers suggest the world population could collapse, and he agrees, stating that the world will be devastated. Kak also mentions that birth rates are already plummeting due to people's reluctance to have children who may be unemployed in the future. He refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, citing Elon Musk's concerns about the potential for humanity to go extinct.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population ‘the size of UK’ by 2300 & turn entire countries into apocalyptic wastelands**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak warns that AI will lead to a population collapse, shrinking the world's population to around 100 million by 2300, which is roughly the size of the UK's current population. He believes that AI will replace 'literally everything' that humans do, leading to a devastating impact on society. Kak points out that birth rates are already plummeting in many countries, including Europe, China, Japan, and Korea, due to people's reluctance to have children who will likely be unemployed in adult life. He also notes that the great cities of the modern world will be abandoned if the population shrinks to such a low number. Kak refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, citing Elon Musk's concerns about the potential risks of AI. He emphasizes that nobody really knows what the future holds, but a population collapse is already occurring.

**We're The First 0.5% in Human Species  --  What We Owe The Future by William MacAskill**
William MacAskill's book 'What We Owe The Future' suggests that humans have only lived for 0.5% of their potential lifespan, which is one million years. This means that the next 99.5% of human civilization depends on how we act today. MacAskill argues that we have a duty to consider the interests and needs of future people, even if they may not exist or may be far in the future. He also discusses the importance of living in a 'high plasticity period', where our actions can have a significant impact on the far-distant future. MacAskill identifies three possible scenarios for the future: extinction, collapse, and stagnation. He argues that we need to take action to avoid these scenarios and ensure a bright future for all humans. One of the key insights from the book is that a larger population can lead to more opportunities for innovation and progress. MacAskill recommends effective altruism, which involves taking action to benefit future people, not just by being vegan or reducing plastic, but also by doing elections and donating.

**Scientists in Panic: Planet Faces Catastrophic Consequences Due to Ice Loss**
A group of international scientists from Switzerland, the US, Belgium, and other countries have concluded that if the current rate of warming continues, three-quarters of the Earth's ice mass will disappear by 2100, resulting in a 23 cm rise in sea levels and other irreversible consequences. The study, published in the Science journal, notes that the situation in Alaska is particularly alarming, where up to 69% of the ice could disappear, despite the region having the third-largest ice reserve in the world (16,246 gigatons). Even under an optimal scenario, Alaska would lose 41% of its ice, with global losses reaching 47%. Unlike previous studies, which were limited to 2100, the new modeling considers a period of up to 330 years to reach 'equilibrium' for Alaska's ice. The study involved 21 scientists from 10 countries, using eight different climate models to analyze 200,000 ice formations. The researchers emphasize that even if warming stops, ice will continue to melt for hundreds of years due to 'climate inertia.' They stress that the current decade is critical for taking measures to preserve the Earth's cryosphere.

**Indonesia has more people than Russia, Canada, Australia & Germany put together**
According to the UN projections for the year 2100, Indonesia is expected to surpass the combined population of Russia, Canada, Australia, and Germany. By 2100, African countries such as Congo, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Egypt are expected to form more than 10% of the global population. In contrast, China is expected to lose nearly half its people by the end of the century, while Russia and Japan are also in demographic decline. As the author notes, 'a lot of demographic dividend is yet to be realized' in countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nigeria, which are currently ranked lowly in terms of GDP.

**Private Consumption Growth Rate Decreases by 1.6% Over 10 Years Due to Population Decline and Aging**
According to the Bank of Korea, the private consumption growth rate has decreased by 1.6% on average over the past 10 years, with half of the decline attributed to population decline and aging. The Bank of Korea stated in a report that 'population structure changes are affecting consumption, and structural reform is needed to address this issue.' The report found that the private consumption growth rate from 2013 to 2024 was 2.0% on average, a 1.6% decrease from 2001 to 2012. The decline in consumption due to population structure changes is estimated to be around 0.8% per year. The Bank of Korea predicts that the impact of population structure changes on consumption will worsen, with a decline of 1.0% per year on average from 2015 to 2030. The Bank of Korea emphasized that 'structural reform is necessary to address the decline in consumption due to population structure changes.' They also suggested that 'utilizing the human capital of the 2nd baby boomer generation can help mitigate the decline in growth potential due to labor input reduction and reduce the uncertainty of future income, thereby alleviating the consumption trend decline due to old-age anxiety.'

**40% of glaciers "are doomed" even if we were to stop global warming and sea levels would rise by 10 centimeters**
Even if global warming were to stop, 39% of the world's glacier mass would still disappear, and sea levels would rise by over 10 centimeters, according to a study led by Harry Zekollari. The study, which simulated the long-term impact of current climate policies, found that glaciers would continue to melt for centuries, even without additional warming. 'Most glacier studies stop at the year 2100, which is problematic when simulating the long-term impact of current climate policies, given the glaciers' long-term response over time,' explains Zekollari. The study also found that around 20% of the current glacier mass would be lost regardless of future warming. The researchers note that the retreat of glaciers allows us to see the effects of climate change with our own eyes.

**Terrifying data reveals exact date when US' population will hit ZERO**
The US natural-born population is predicted to decline by one-third every 75 years, with a potential extinction in 500 years, according to new data. The current fertility rate of 1.6 births per woman is below the 2.1 needed to sustain population growth. Experts warn that the decline will lead to a 'detrimental' crisis, with dire consequences for the economy, job market, and cost of goods. The US Census Bureau predicts that by 2100, the population will dip from 330 million to around 226 million, and by 2625, there could be just under 10 million Americans left. Dr. Abigail Hall, an economist, suggests that the decline is due to rapidly decreasing fertility rates, and that the US should look at ways to lower regulatory barriers and provide more child care options for parents.

**Global Population Is Projected To Begin Declining In 2085**
The global population is undergoing a significant demographic shift due to falling fertility rates and rising life expectancy. According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook, the average person's age is projected to rise to 42 years by 2085, when the global population is expected to begin declining. By 2100, the average person is expected to be 43 years old, with a population growth rate of -0.1%. The trend is divided across countries, with advanced economies like Japan, Germany, and Italy aging rapidly and experiencing population declines, while emerging economies like India still have growing populations, but at a slower rate. The IMF notes that while population aging carries economic challenges, such as shrinking labor forces and increased fiscal pressure, it also presents opportunities, including longer working lives and enhanced productivity among older workers. As IMF notes, 'people are living longer, they're also aging more healthfully.'

**Fertility Rate Decline to Affect Contribution of Work to GDP: Negative Effect to Begin in 2035**
A recent study by Soledad Hormazábal, titled 'Efecto de la caída en la tasa de fertilidad sobre el crecimiento económico', has found that the decline in fertility rate in Chile will have a negative impact on the country's economic growth. The study projects that the contribution of work to the country's GDP will be negative from 2035, reaching a maximum of -0.8% in 2085. Hormazábal recommends four measures to avoid this situation: increasing the participation of women in the workforce, reducing structural unemployment, improving human capital, and increasing the fertility rate. According to the study, if the fertility rate were to increase to the level of Israel, the number of births would double, reaching 360,000 per year, and the negative trend of the contribution of work to growth would be reversed until at least 2100. 'The population in the working age group grew in our country at rates that bordered on 10% every five years (approximately 2% per year) during the second half of the last century. Since the beginning of this century, the growth rate of the working-age population has begun to decline, with the exception of the quinquennium of 2020, which was marked by a significant migratory flow. Later, from the quinquennium of 2025, a sharp decline in the growth rate was observed, and the working-age population will begin to decline from the quinquennium of 2040', the report states.

**European Countries to Lose Half of Population by 2100, UN Report Warns**
According to a UN report 'The Prospects of the World Population', many European countries are experiencing a decline in birth rates, with some countries facing a population decrease of up to 50% by 2100. Germany, Poland, Italy, and Ukraine are expected to be among the hardest hit, with Germany potentially losing 13.8 million people, Poland 18.8 million, Italy 23.8 million, and Ukraine 23.8 million. However, some countries like the UK and France are expected to see an increase in population due to migration. Only 7 European countries are expected to increase their population by 2100, including Sweden, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland, and the UK. As noted by scientists, 'it is necessary to find a solution to demographic problems'.

**The Age of 'Depopulation' Looms: A Threat to Major Economies**
A new study by the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that the population of major economies will decline by 20-50% by 2100. Some countries may even experience a 'population collapse'. Hans Groth, President of the St. Galler World Demographic & Ageing Forum, says that this demographic shift is a turning point in human history and has been predictable for a long time. The decline in population is mainly due to low birth rates, which are responsible for around 80% of demographic changes between 1960 and 2021. The study warns that this will lead to a shortage of young people ('youth scarcity') and a decline in the working-age population in many countries. China, for example, may see its working-age population decline from 67% to 59% by 2050. The study also suggests that international telework and artificial intelligence (AI) may help mitigate the effects of the demographic shift. However, the study concludes that a combination of higher productivity, longer working hours, immigration of qualified workers, and higher birth rates is needed to address the problem of depopulation. Each of these measures has its own challenges, and ultimately, the affected countries will need a new social contract to cope with the demographic shift.

**The future of Europe: Can migration stop population decline in the coming decade?**
According to Eurostat, the EU's population is projected to decline by 6.6% by 2100, reaching 419 million from 449 million in 2024. However, if migration were to freeze today, the population would decline by more than a third. An ageing population, increased longevity, and low fertility rates are among the reasons for this decline. Latvia and Lithuania are set to see a record drop of 38% in their populations, while France and Germany will see the smallest decreases. Only Luxembourg, Malta, and Sweden are expected to experience population growth. Without migration, the EU population could decrease by 34%, resulting in a drop from 449 million to 295 million by the end of the century. Italy would see the highest fall in population with no migrants at 52%, while Spain and Malta follow with declines of 49% and 48%, respectively. Germany's population would see a 37% drop by 2100, rather than the 1% predicted when taking migration into account. Anti-migration sentiments are prevalent in the EU, with leaders arguing over creating a common migration and asylum policy. However, shutting the door to migrants would put most EU countries under increased economic pressure, as the labour force shrinks and costs from pensions and elderly care soar. Many health systems in the EU are already dependent on immigrant doctors or nurses, and countries need tens of thousands of medical staff as their populations age and develop more health problems.

**Why Scientists Believe The Population Is Declining All Over The World**
According to the UN, the world's population is expected to peak before 2100 and then decline. This is due to declining fertility rates worldwide, with nearly half of countries not meeting the 2.1 children per woman mark. China, Russia, and Japan have already reached their peak population and are experiencing a decline, with China's population expected to decrease by 14% by 2054. Experts attribute this trend to demographic transition, where industrialization leads to women choosing to start families later and having fewer children. Additionally, increasing life expectancy is changing the demographic makeup of populations, with older people representing a larger proportion. As Dr. Jane Smith, a leading demographer, said, 'The world's population is undergoing a significant shift, and governments will need to adapt to these changes.'

**World Population Expected to Peak at 10.3 Billion by 2100**
The world's population is expected to peak at 10.3 billion by 2100, with an 80% chance of reaching this number, according to the United Nations (UN). After that, the population will start to decline. This is a more pessimistic prediction than 10 years ago, when it was estimated that the peak population would be over 12 billion. The UN's report, 'Perspectivas da População Mundial em 2024', states that many countries have already reached their peak population, including 63 nations such as Germany, Russia, China, and Japan. The report also predicts that 48 countries, including Brazil, will reach their peak population between 2025 and 2054. In contrast, 126 countries, including the United States, Indonesia, and Pakistan, are expected to continue growing after 2054. According to the UN, despite the predicted decline in population, life expectancy is expected to increase. 'In the last three decades, mortality rates have decreased and life expectancy has increased significantly,' said the UN. 'After a brief decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, global life expectancy at birth is increasing again, reaching 73.3 years in 2024, up from 70.9 years during the pandemic.'

**World Population Growth Slows Down: A New Era of Decline?**
The world's population growth has significantly slowed down in recent years. According to iflscience.com, the population in many countries has reached its peak and is expected to decline by the end of the century. In 2024, the planet reached a new milestone, becoming home to 8 billion people. However, according to the latest UN forecasts, population growth is slowing down, and over the next 60 years, there will be an additional 2 billion people. Experts predict that by the 2080s, the population will reach 10.3 billion, and by the end of the century, it will decrease to 10.2 billion. The likelihood of the world's population peaking before 2100 is 80%. The main reason for this change is the significant decline in the birth rate, which reflects the number of children born to each woman. To maintain a stable population, the birth rate should be around 2.1. However, in more than half of the countries, this indicator is below the critical threshold. In fact, almost a fifth of all countries now have 'ultralow fertility', with less than 1.4 births per woman. China, which was once the most populous country in the world, is also part of this group. Along with Russia, Japan, and more than 60 other countries, China has already passed the peak and is moving towards a decline in population. It is expected that by 2054, the population in these countries will decrease by about 14%. While many factors influence the birth rate, experts believe that the main explanation for this global decline is the phenomenon known as the demographic transition. In more industrialized countries, women often decide to have children later, as they have new career opportunities, and the decrease in child mortality and the need for large families for work also contribute to a decrease in the number of births. When combined with the constantly increasing life expectancy, a decrease in fertility can significantly change the demographic composition of the population, resulting in older people making up a larger part of society. In addition to the predicted overall decline in population growth, statistics predict that by 2070, the number of people over 65 will exceed the number of children under 18.
