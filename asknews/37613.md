**US Jobless Claims Reach 8-Month High, Labor Market Weakness Looms**
Initial jobless claims in the US reached 247,000, the highest level in eight months, indicating potential labor market weakness. According to the Department of Labor, 247,000 people filed for benefits for the first time in the week ending May 31. This number represents an increase of 8,000 claims from the previous week. The number was adjusted seasonally and exceeded both the average of the past four weeks, now at 235,000, and the projections of many financial analysts, who expected a decline or stability. Despite the increase, the overall level of people continuing to receive unemployment aid decreased slightly. For the week ending May 24, there were 1,904,000 beneficiaries, a decrease of 3,000 from the previous week. However, the four-week moving average reached 1,895,250, the highest since November 2021. Some states reported notable increases in claims. Michigan led the list with 3,259 new cases, followed by Nebraska, California, Florida, and Virginia. In contrast, states like Massachusetts, Illinois, Texas, and New York showed slight reductions. The adjusted seasonally unemployment rate decreased by a tenth and stood at 1.2%. The highest unemployment rates were recorded in New Jersey (2.2%), California and Washington (2.1%), and Massachusetts and Rhode Island (1.9%). From a business perspective, the situation also generates concern. Although the total number of layoffs decreased slightly in May compared to April, layoffs are still 47% higher than in the same month in 2024, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Companies like Walmart, Procter & Gamble, Meta, Microsoft, and Disney have announced thousands of layoffs this year. A relevant cause behind many federal layoffs has been the personnel reduction policy driven by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has led to the termination of over 280,000 public employees so far in 2025. Additionally, the ADP employment report reveals that in May, only 37,000 jobs were created in the private sector, the lowest in a year. 'After a strong start to the year, hiring is losing momentum,' said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. All this occurs in a context of economic uncertainty. The combination of tariffs, budget cuts, consumer spending decline, and low financial expectations is causing many companies to reevaluate their hiring decisions. The signs of a slowdown in the labor market are becoming increasingly strong. Another signal is the decrease in the number of workers who quit in April, while layoffs increased, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). However, job vacancies increased to 7.4 million in April.

**US weekly jobless claims rise for second straight week**
The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits rose for the second straight week, reaching 247,000 for the week ended May 31. Economists had forecast 235,000 claims. The Labor Department noted that companies are generally hoarding workers, but uncertainty due to President Trump's tariffs is forcing some to lay off workers. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report and an Institute for Supply Management survey also pointed to softening labor market conditions, with widespread comments about uncertainty delaying hiring and lower labor demand. Economists expect claims this month to break above their 205,000-243,000 range for 2025. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid slipped to 1.904 million, but the elevation in continuing claims aligns with consumers' ebbing confidence in the labor market. A separate report showed U.S-based employers announced 93,816 job cuts in May, down 12% from April, but 47% higher from a year ago.

**Weekly jobless claims at 7-month high; trade deficit posts record contraction**
The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased to a seven-month high last week, pointing to softening labor market conditions. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000 for the week ended May 31. Economists said technical difficulties adjusting the data at the start of summer could have contributed to the second straight weekly increase in unemployment claims. However, they also noted that the data offered some evidence of labor market strains, particularly in the motor vehicle industry. Meanwhile, the trade deficit narrowed sharply in April, with imports decreasing by the most on record as the front-running of goods ahead of tariffs ebbed. The trade gap contracted by a record 55.5% to $61.6 billion, the lowest level since September 2023. 'A gradual but genuine slackening of the labor market is underway,' said Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. 'The collapse in the trade gap in April, although unlikely to be sustained, points to a massive trade addition to GDP growth and, if the offset to the import swing is not measured in inventories, second-quarter measured GDP growth could be eye-popping, possibly in the area of 5%,' said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital.

**Unemployment claims rise to highest level in 8 months, signaling slowdown in job market**
Initial claims for U.S. unemployment benefits rose to 247,000 in the week ending May 31, the highest level in eight months, according to the Labor Department. This increase is a sign that the labor market may be slowing down due to concerns over tariffs. Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said, 'The uptick in initial jobless claims last week is hard to dismiss, as the climb could point to broader shifts in the workforce ahead of the May jobs report.' Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, noted that jobless claims are rising at a slow pace, but it's a trend worth watching. The U.S. economy added 37,000 jobs in May, the lowest pace of hiring since May 2023, according to ADP. Several major companies have announced layoffs this year, including Walmart, Procter & Gamble, and Workday, citing the need to increase efficiency in an 'increasingly challenging environment.'

**US Unemployment Claims Reach 8-Month High Amid Tariff Uncertainty**
Initial unemployment benefit claims in the US reached their highest level in eight months last week, despite remaining at historically low levels, amidst growing uncertainty about the effects of tariffs on the economy. The 8,000 increase in initial claims brought the total to 247,000 for the week ending May 31, according to the Labor Department's report. This is the highest level since October, exceeding analysts' projections of 237,000 claims. The weekly benefit claims are an indicator of the level of layoffs in the country. Since the COVID-19 pandemic affected the economy five years ago, they have remained in a healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000. Many companies have adjusted their 2025 forecast downward or have not provided any outlook, citing the impact of tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump. Despite Trump's suspension or reduction of some of his tariff threats, concern persists that a global economic slowdown induced by these levies could destabilize the US labor market, which has shown strength so far. This week, the administration announced that job offers in the US unexpectedly increased in April. However, other data suggests that labor market confidence has decreased, reflected in a lower number of workers quitting their jobs and an increase in layoffs. Currently, there is one job available for every unemployed person, compared to two vacancies for every jobless person in December 2022. The most comprehensive employment report will be published on Friday, where it is estimated that 130,000 new jobs will have been added in May, less than the 177,000 in April. The US economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, a slight improvement from initial estimates. This decline was due to an increase in imports while companies rushed to obtain products before new tariffs took effect. Trump has tried to revitalize the economy through a drastic increase in taxes on imports, focusing on strengthening the manufacturing sector. However, some of his employment cuts are still under litigation. Recently, Procter & Gamble announced a restructuring plan that will involve the reduction of 7,000 jobs, approximately 15% of its non-manufacturing staff. Other companies such as Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Microsoft, and Meta have also announced layoffs. The four-week average of unemployment benefit claims, which adjusts for typical fluctuations in the most volatile weeks, increased by 4,500 to 235,000, the highest level since October. Meanwhile, 1.9 million people continue to receive unemployment benefits as of the second week of May.

**US Unemployment Benefit Claims Rise to 8-Month High**
The number of initial unemployment benefit claims in the US has risen to its highest level in 8 months, according to the US Department of Labor. The claims rose by 8,000 to 247,000 after seasonal adjustment for the week ending May 31. Economists had expected a decline to 235,000. The uncertainty caused by the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump has led some companies to lay off workers. A report by the Federal Reserve's 'Book of Big Macs' noted a 'widespread spread of uncertainty that is delaying hiring'. All economic regions reported a decline in labor demand, with a decrease in overtime and temporary work, as well as a halt in hiring and plans to reduce the number of employees. Despite reports of layoffs in some sectors, the report noted that they were not widespread. A survey by the Institute for Supply Management also showed stability in employment in the services sector in May, with 'a closer look at all jobs that need to be filled'. Economists expect unemployment benefit claims to exceed the range of 205,000 to 243,000 for 2025, due to difficulties in adjusting data for seasonal fluctuations, as well as the fact that this pattern has repeated in recent years. The report on claims showed that the number of beneficiaries of continued unemployment benefits after the first week of assistance - a measure of labor market strength - decreased by 3,000 to 1.904 million seasonally adjusted for the week ending May 24. This increase in continued claims is consistent with a decline in consumer confidence in the labor market. A separate report by Challenger Gray & Christmas showed that employers in the US announced layoffs of 93,816 workers in May, a decline of 12% compared to April, but an increase of 47% compared to the same period last year.

**Jobless Claims Dip to 227K, But Rising Continuing Claims Signal Labor Market Strain**
Continuing claims for unemployment benefits rose to 1.903 million for the week ending May 10, a multi-year high, indicating that unemployed individuals are remaining out of work longer. Initial claims fell to 202,088, but still remain higher than the same week last year. Insured unemployment rates are highest in New Jersey, California, and Washington. While the initial claims figure is a short-term relief, the continued rise in insured unemployment signals underlying labor market fragility, which could lead to bearish pressure on consumer discretionary and small-cap equities, and potentially prompt the Fed to lean more dovish.

**US Jobless Claims Rise to 219,000, Exceeding Market Projections**
Initial jobless claims in the United States rose to 219,000 in the last week, exceeding market projections of 215,000. This indicates a slight warming of the number of layoffs, but still suggests a resilient labor market. The recent reading shows that the number of jobless claims exceeded analyst projections, with 214,000 claims in the previous period (revised from 213,000), indicating an increase in the US. The four-week moving average was 215,250, while the previous four-week average was revised to 216,250. This number helps to smooth out weekly variations and provide a broader view of the US labor market trend. Continuous claims, which reflect the number of workers still receiving benefits, also rose to 1.869 million, up from the previous revised figure of 1.850 million. This may indicate a slight difficulty in re-employment of workers who lost their jobs in the US. Despite the one-time increase in claims, the US labor market remains strong, with unemployment rates at historically low levels, reflecting a heated economy. However, the growth in jobless claims may be a first sign of gradual cooling, which could influence the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions in the US. Experts closely monitor these numbers to evaluate the next steps of the US economy, especially in a scenario of high interest rates and possible adjustments to US monetary policy.
