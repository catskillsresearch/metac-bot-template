**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**Xi Jinping could save America with a simple ad | Notice**
Matt Robison suggests that Xi Jinping could save America by announcing that China will be the first nation to win a human on Mars within the next ten years. This would spark a new space race and motivate the US to invest in space exploration, potentially leading to a boost in the US economy and a renewed sense of national pride. Robison argues that this kind of competition is exactly what America needs, and that China needs it too. He notes that two-thirds of Americans, including 80% of Republicans, already support the idea of maintaining a technological edge over China in artificial intelligence. Robison concludes that a simple announcement from Xi Jinping could be the kick that America needs to get back on track.

**Advancing deep space travel with nuclear propulsion**
A recent study presented at the 56th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC 2025) explored the potential of fission-powered propulsion for deep space travel, specifically to the outer planets like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. According to Malaya Kumar Biswal, Founder & CEO of Acceleron Aerospace, the primary motivation for the study was the need for more reliable and sustained energy for long-duration missions. The researchers evaluated various characteristics of fission-powered propulsion systems, including power systems, key advantages, notable developments, potential applications, and limitations. They concluded that fission power propulsion is a 'game-changer' offering a myriad of benefits and advances beyond current propulsion technologies, with very few limitations. The study also discussed the potential use of fission propulsion to explore the entire solar system, including the Kuiper Belt, and even interstellar space, such as Proxima Centauri. Biswal stated, 'Exploring another star system like Proxima Centauri is a monumental challenge, but nuclear propulsion is one of the few technologies that could make it conceivable within this century.' The study builds on previous research and proposes the use of a Human-Crewed Interplanetary Transport Architecture (HUCITAR) for exploring Mars and the dwarf planet Ceres. Biswal emphasized that nuclear-powered systems are not just a distant dream, but rapidly becoming a necessity for meaningful exploration beyond low Earth orbit.

**Time, Not Speed: A Human Limitation in Interstellar Exploration Title: Time, Not Speed: A Human...**
The author, Orkhan Ismayilov, proposes that the real barrier to interstellar exploration is not speed, but time. He argues that if humans could live for billions of years or learn to suspend their sense of time, even slow travel would become viable. The author identifies several challenges, including boredom and human limits, that must be addressed in order to make long-duration space travel possible. He suggests four potential paths forward: biological longevity, suspended animation, psychological adaptation, and time perception manipulation. According to the author, 'the frontier is not only out there in the stars. It is also within us.'

**AI on Humanity: Indian Professor Warns of a Bleak Future**
Indian-origin computer science professor Subhash Kak has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) could replace humans in almost all jobs in the future. According to him, 'even if robots are not fully conscious, they will be able to perform most of our roles, from office decisions to everyday tasks.' Professor Kak predicts that AI will lead to such high unemployment that people will be reluctant to have children, resulting in a population decline to 100 million by 2300 or 2380, which is roughly the same as the current population of the UK. He also believes that cities like New York and London will become ghost towns. Professor Kak's warning is in line with Tesla CEO Elon Musk's previous statements about AI and declining birth rates being a threat to humanity. Musk has suggested that humans should colonize space to ensure the survival of the human species in case of a crisis on Earth. Professor Kak has also discussed these dangers in his book The Age of Artificial Intelligence, where he explains how AI is no longer limited to business but is being used by ordinary people, which could impact job opportunities in the future. However, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has downplayed these fears, saying that technology does not eliminate jobs but changes their nature. History has shown that every technological revolution has created new types of employment.

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Will AI Wipe Out Humanity? Indian-Origin Expert Issues Apocalyptic Warning**
Indian-origin computer science professor Subhash Kak has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to a dystopian future where the world population shrinks to 100 million by 2300 or 2380. Kak, who works at Oklahoma State University, predicts that AI will replace most jobs, making it difficult for people to raise children due to a shortage of employment opportunities. 'Computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will be doing literally all that we do because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced. Literally everything, even decision-making in offices, will be replaced,' he said. This could lead to a collapse in birth rates, with people reluctant to have children who would grow up to be unemployed. Kak's prediction echoes that of tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has long warned about the dangers of AI and declining birth rates. However, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reassured global leaders that history has shown that work does not disappear due to technology, but its nature changes and new types of jobs are created.

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak predicts a dystopian future for humanity, with the global population shrinking to 100 million by 2300 due to AI replacing jobs and causing a collapse in birth rates. According to Prof. Kak, 'Computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will be doing literally all that we do because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He warns that major cities like New York and London will become ghost towns, and that the world will be devastated. Prof. Kak, author of 'The Age of Artificial Intelligence', says that people are unaware of the consequences of AI and that it's likely that the world population will collapse. He also mentions that billionaire Elon Musk has expressed similar concerns, suggesting that humans should consider colonizing space to avoid extinction. Prof. Kak states, 'It's likely. I have all the data in the book. This is not just my personal opinion.'

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**The Hunt for Mysterious Interstellar Objects**
Astronomers are working on new technologies to catch up with interstellar objects (ISOs) that come from other stars and study their unknown properties. In 2017, a mysterious object, 'Oumuamua, passed through our solar system at a high speed. It was 400 meters long and 10 times longer than wide. Researchers called it 'Oumuamua, which means 'explorer' in Hawaiian. Later, it was confirmed that 'Oumuamua was the first ISO known to visit our solar system. ISOs originate around a star, but end up as cosmic nomads, wandering through space. They are essentially planetary debris that has been expelled from their original star systems by catastrophic events, such as giant collisions between planetary objects. Astronomers say that 'Oumuamua could have been traveling through the Milky Way for hundreds of millions of years before its encounter with our solar system. Recently, a second ISO, the Borisov comet, was discovered, this time by an amateur astronomer in Crimea. These celestial intruders have given us suggestive glimpses of material from far beyond our solar system. However, if we could do more than just watch them pass by, we could learn more about distant star systems, which are too far away to send missions to. There may be over 10 septillion ISOs in the Milky Way. However, if they are so numerous, why have we only seen two? In short, we cannot predict with precision when they will arrive. Large ISOs like 'Oumuamua, which are easier to detect, do not seem to visit our solar system as often and travel incredibly fast. Ground-based and space-based telescopes have difficulty responding quickly to the arrival of ISOs, which means we are mainly seeing them after they have passed through our cosmic neighborhood. However, new space missions could bring us closer to objects like 'Oumuamua, using advances in artificial intelligence to guide spacecraft safely towards future visitors. Getting closer means we can gain a better understanding of their composition, geology, and activity, obtaining information about the conditions around other stars. New technologies used to approach space debris could help us catch other unpredictable objects, transforming these fleeting encounters into deep scientific opportunities. To get closer, we need to move much faster and think more intelligently. Future missions may rely on cutting-edge AI and related fields like deep learning - which seeks to emulate the power of human decision-making - to identify and respond to incoming objects in real-time. Researchers are already testing small spacecraft that operate in coordinated 'swarms,' allowing them to take images of targets from multiple angles and adapt in flight. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile will soon begin a 10-year study of the night sky. It is expected to find dozens of ISOs each year. Simulations suggest that we may be at the peak of a detection boom. Any spacecraft would need to reach high speeds once an object is detected and ensure that its power source does not degrade, potentially after years of waiting in a 'storage orbit.' Several missions have already used a form of propulsion called solar sails. These systems use sunlight on a lightweight and reflective sail to push the spacecraft through space. The system would dispense engineers from the need to include heavy fuel tanks in the spacecraft. The next generation of spacecraft with solar sails could use lasers on the sails to reach even higher speeds, offering a quick and low-cost solution compared to other futuristic fuels, such as nuclear propulsion. A spacecraft approaching an ISO would also need to withstand high temperatures and potentially the erosion caused by the dust expelled by the object as it moves. While traditional armor materials can protect spacecraft, they add weight and may slow them down. To solve this problem, researchers are exploring new technologies to obtain lightweight, more durable, and resistant materials, such as advanced carbon fibers. Some could even be 3D printed. They are also studying new uses for traditional materials like cork and ceramics. A range of approaches involving ground-based telescopes and space missions working together are needed to anticipate, pursue, and observe ISOs. This new technology could allow the spacecraft itself to identify and predict the trajectories of incoming objects. However, potential cuts to space science in the US, including observatories like the James Webb Space Telescope, threaten this progress. Emerging technologies must be adopted to make approaching and encountering an ISO a real possibility. Otherwise, we will be left searching, taking photos from afar while another cosmic wanderer speeds away.

**Revolutionary Mission to Search for Anomalous Cosmic Objects**
Astronomers have announced a revolutionary mission to search for anomalous cosmic objects. In 2017, astronomers detected a mysterious object, 'Oumuamua, which traveled through the Solar System at a speed of over 90,000 km/h. Its unusual shape and trajectory sparked intense interest among scientists. Interstellar objects like 'Oumuamua or Comet Borisov are thought to have formed around other stars but were ejected from their parent systems due to massive collisions. They can travel through the galaxy for hundreds of millions of years. However, due to their high speed and rare appearance, it is challenging to detect and study them from close range. To address this issue, scientists propose new missions, such as NASA's Bridge concept, which involves capturing interstellar objects immediately after detection. The European Space Agency is also preparing to launch the Comet Interceptor mission in 2029, which will wait for a possible encounter with ISO in a special 'storage orbit.' These projects could make detailed studies of the chemical composition, geology, and activity of interstellar bodies possible, revealing new information about other star systems. However, due to the high speed of objects, the time for reaction is very short - less than a year from detection. Scientists consider using artificial intelligence, deep learning, and coordination of 'swarm' microsatellites that can quickly adapt to the target and collect data from different angles. New telescopes, such as the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, will significantly increase the number of detected objects. In the future, a new propulsion system will be crucial. Solar sails, which use light pressure for propulsion, have already demonstrated their effectiveness. Future plans include the use of laser sails or even nuclear propulsion. Researchers are also exploring new materials - lightweight, strong, and heat-resistant - such as carbon fiber composites or special ceramics. Realizing such interstellar interceptions requires coordinated work between ground-based telescopes, automatic satellites, and breakthrough engineering solutions. Without this, we risk continuing to only observe potential messengers from other worlds as they quickly disappear into the depths of space.

**Scientists Develop Plans to Catch Interstellar Objects Like Oumuamua**
Astronomers have been studying the mysterious object Oumuamua, which passed through our solar system in 2017. The object is believed to be the first interstellar visitor to our solar system, and its passage has sparked interest in the possibility of other interstellar objects visiting our solar system. Researchers are now exploring ways to catch these objects, which are often too fast to be detected until they have already passed through our solar system. New technologies, such as artificial intelligence and deep learning, may help to identify and track these objects in real-time. Missions like NASA's Bridge and the European Space Agency's Comet Interceptor are being developed to catch these objects, but they face significant challenges, including the need to reach high speeds and withstand the harsh conditions of space. Researchers are also exploring new materials and technologies to protect the spacecraft from the extreme temperatures and radiation of space. The study of interstellar objects is a complex and challenging field, but it has the potential to reveal new insights into the universe and its many mysteries.

**Mysterious Objects from Other Worlds Enter the Solar System**
Scientists believe that many mysterious objects from other worlds are entering the Solar System. These objects, such as Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov, are thought to have originated from other star systems or interstellar space. Researchers estimate that there are over 10 septillion (10 to the power of 24) interstellar objects in the Milky Way galaxy, and many of them enter the Solar System, but are difficult to detect using current technology. However, with the help of artificial intelligence, it may be possible to predict the appearance of interstellar objects in the Solar System and send spacecraft to study them. This would allow scientists to learn more about distant star systems and the objects that come from them. NASA is developing a spacecraft called Bridge, while the European Space Agency is working on the Comet Interceptor mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2029. The Comet Interceptor mission consists of three spacecraft that will remain in space, waiting for the arrival of an interstellar object. Scientists believe that new technologies, such as solar sails and laser propulsion, may enable spacecraft to travel faster and more efficiently, allowing them to detect and study interstellar objects more effectively. As Dr. Andriy Kuduk said, 'It's a great opportunity to learn more about the universe and the objects that come from it.'

**Expert Kuznetsov Predicts Interstellar Travel by 2050**
According to futurist and director of Digital Evolution Ventures, Evgeny Kuznetsov, practical understanding of interstellar travel may be achieved by 2040-2050. Kuznetsov stated that current physics does not provide clear answers on how to travel beyond the Solar System, but with advancements in artificial intelligence and knowledge, he believes that the necessary breakthroughs will occur around 2050. 'There are theoretical ideas, but they look unattainable for our civilization's technological capabilities. But taking into account artificial intelligence and a breakthrough in knowledge, I think these trends will converge around the 2050 horizon. So, by 2040, we still have nothing to talk about, but around 2040-2050, it may become clear how this step can be made,' said Kuznetsov. He emphasized that by that time, human civilization should have a necessary and self-sufficient space infrastructure. 'Until 2040-2045, the main focus will be on lunar exploration and the 'sublunar economy' (space around the Moon up to its orbit - ed. TASS),' he noted, adding that the prospective Russian orbital station will be an important part of this process. According to Kuznetsov, from 2050 to 2070, the main focus of human activity in space will be on the boundaries of the Solar System - asteroids, planetary moons, and more distant objects. 'This is already a real attempt to touch the entire Solar System and study what can be extracted from it, and prepare for the next leap,' said the expert.

**Chapter 5: A Blueprint for Humanity's Survival**
The article discusses the potential catastrophic events that could lead to the end of the world and the extinction of humanity. It highlights the importance of preparing for these scenarios and provides a multifaceted strategy to ensure the long-term survival of humanity. The strategy includes advanced technology, off-world colonization, artificial intelligence, and biological evolution. The article identifies four key strategies: colonization beyond Earth, evolving beyond biological limitations, leveraging advanced artificial intelligence, and ultimately transcending the limitations of our current universe. It also proposes a structured timeline for implementation, with Phase 2 (2050-2100) focusing on becoming an interplanetary civilization and Phase 5 (beyond 3000) focusing on transcendence. The article concludes that the end of the world is not an unsolvable problem and that humanity has the potential to evolve into a civilization that outlasts planets, stars, and even the cosmos itself.

**The Possibility of an Advanced Non-Human Civilization on Earth Millions of Years Ago**
The possibility of an advanced non-human civilization on Earth millions of years ago is a topic of interest. According to Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence, there are unidentified phenomena (FANI) whose nature is unclear, some of which can move through any medium, from air to water and vice versa. These FANI could be evidence of a civilization that preceded us on Earth 252 million years ago. The stability of satellites in orbit around the Earth depends on their propulsion method. Vehicles capable of moving through water and air, like those reported by US Navy pilots in 2004, could have been designed to refuel by collecting water and breaking its molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using solar-powered electrolysis. The Project Galileo, led by Avi Loeb, aims to clarify the nature of FANI through the collection of new scientific data. The project's first observatory at Harvard University is currently monitoring the entire sky in video and audio, and the data collected is being analyzed using artificial intelligence software. The team will report any FANI captured in their data openly, complementing the secret data collected by military and intelligence agencies working for national security. A proposed law, the FANI Disclosure Act of 2023, aims to increase transparency and encourage scientific research on FANI, as pursued by the Project Galileo. 'For decades, many Americans have been fascinated by mysterious and inexplicable objects, and it's time they get some answers,' said Chuck Schumer. 'The American public has the right to learn about technologies of unknown origin, non-human intelligence, and inexplicable phenomena.' The legislation has bipartisan support, with Senator Kristen Gillibrand stating, 'Understanding FANI is fundamental to our national security and maintaining control over all domains [land, air, and sea].'
