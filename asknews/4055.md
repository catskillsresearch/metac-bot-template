**Real-time multiple people gait recognition in the edge - Scientific Reports**
Researchers have developed a framework for real-time multiple people gait recognition in edge devices. They used two NVIDIA Jetson platforms, the Jetson Orin Nano and the Jetson AGX Orin, to optimize deep learning models for gait recognition. The team used the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) assessment test results to evaluate the performance of the models. The results showed that the 2D model outperformed the 3D model in terms of throughput, with the 2D40int model recognizing nearly 98 people on the Nano and the 2D30best model recognizing about 190 on the Orin. Energy-wise, 2D models consumed less due to lower computational complexity. The team also explored the use of batch processing and concurrent execution to speed up inferences, and found that some concurrency is essential to achieve high throughput. The optimal configuration was found to be c = 8 and b = 16, which achieved a throughput of 1063 inferences per second on the Nano device.

**What is AGI? The Concept of Artificial General Intelligence**
AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) refers to artificial intelligence that can perform a wide range of tasks like humans. The concept of AGI was popularized by computer scientists Ben Goertzel and others around 2005. According to OpenAI, AGI is defined as 'a highly autonomous system that can surpass human capabilities in economically valuable work.' Researchers and entrepreneurs have differing opinions on when AGI will be achieved, with Demis Hassabis, founder of DeepMind, predicting it will be achieved by 2058, and Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, predicting it could be achieved as early as 2031. If AGI is achieved, it is expected to develop new AI systems, take over human tasks in various fields such as material development, pharmaceuticals, and climate change mitigation, and potentially replace human jobs. There is also a concern that AGI could be used for military purposes.

**Anthropic CEO Predicts Technological Singularity in Six Months**
According to the CEO of Anthropic, the human race is only six months away from reaching technological singularity, a concept where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. This prediction contrasts with the most conservative scientific estimates, but reflects the unprecedented acceleration in the development of artificial intelligence since the emergence of models like ChatGPT. The study by AIMultiple, which examines 8,590 predictions from scientists, business leaders, and the tech community, reveals that expectations about the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and singularity have changed dramatically in recent years. While scientists predict AGI around 2040, business leaders are more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The study documents how predictions vary over a nearly 50-year spectrum, from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to estimates that extend several decades. However, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, with industry leaders consistently more optimistic in their predictions than the scientific community in general. The study examines different thresholds of AI, including AGI and superintelligence, providing a comprehensive view of expectations in the field. The research tracks changes in these predictions over time, especially after the emergence of large language models that have transformed the landscape. The analysis offers several perspectives on why many experts consider the arrival of AGI inevitable, including the lack of apparent limits to machine intelligence, the Law of Moore, and the potential of quantum computing to compensate for engineering barriers. Not all experts consider AGI a certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is more multifaceted than the current definition of AGI. Yann LeCun, a pioneer of deep learning, suggests that AGI should be rebranded as 'advanced machine intelligence' and argues that human intelligence is too specialized to be replicable. The report also notes that, although AI can be a valuable tool for making new discoveries, it cannot make these discoveries on its own. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, allowing for more discoveries per experiment,' the analysis details. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer,' the document obtained by AIMultiple states. While individual predictions from experts and scientists about AGI vary over a period of approximately half a century, the message is clear: human society will inevitably face incredible changes as a result of these algorithms. Whether these changes will be good or bad, according to the research, depends on us.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment,' the report reads. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer.'

**Deep learning driven interpretable and informed decision making model for brain tumour prediction using explainable AI - Scientific Reports**
A new deep learning model has been proposed for brain tumour prediction using explainable AI. The model combines advanced deep learning techniques, robust data augmentation, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to deliver a reliable, interpretable, and adaptable solution for brain tumour diagnosis. The model begins with data collection from diverse sources, including hospitals, mobile medical devices, patients, and satellites. The collected data is then processed through three key stages: pre-processing, processing, and post-processing. The post-processing outcomes are then sent to cloud computing, which ensures efficient storage, analysis, and real-time accessibility. The model then culminates in a validation phase to ensure the accuracy and reliability of predictions. The proposed model uses NASNet Large, a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, which outperformed other algorithms in a comprehensive evaluation. The model's performance was considered satisfactory, allowing the system to proceed to the next phase: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). LIME and Grad-CAM were employed as the XAI approaches to make the model's decisions transparent and interpretable. The insights provided by XAI are used to evaluate the model further, and if the explanations are satisfactory, the trained model proceeds to the cloud computing stage ready for deployment in clinical or research settings.

**Google Deepmind says AGI might outthink humans by 2030, and it's planning for the risks**
Google Deepmind has published a strategy paper outlining its approach to developing safe artificial general intelligence (AGI). The company expects current machine learning methods, particularly neural networks, to remain the main path toward AGI. Deepmind predicts that future AGI systems could surpass human performance and operate with significant autonomy in planning and decision-making. The company identifies four key risk areas: Abuse, misalignment, accidents, and structural risks. To mitigate these risks, Deepmind is developing a multi-layered strategy, including training AI systems to recognize their own uncertainty, blocking questionable actions, and escalating decisions when appropriate. The company also examines the infrastructure constraints that could impede the continued scaling of compute needed for advanced AI training, including power supply, hardware availability, data scarcity, and the 'latency wall.' Deepmind concludes that while these factors are not hard limits, continued scaling will ultimately depend on whether developers are willing to invest. They estimate that frontier training runs could cost hundreds of billions of dollars, but note that the economic incentive for automation is strong.
