**BRIEF-UK Should Expand Army's Size When Funding Allows, Review...**
The UK's Strategic Defence Review recommends increasing the number of regular army personnel when funding allows, likely in the next parliament. The review also suggests reducing the Ministry of Defence's civil service costs by at least 10% by 2030. The authors of the review state that their plan can be accelerated if needed in a turbulent world. The review emphasizes the importance of backing Ukraine in its pursuit of a durable political settlement, as well as learning from its experience in land warfare, drone, and hybrid conflict. The review also highlights the key role of the US-China relationship in a more multipolar world marked by 'great power' competition. According to the review, China is seeking to establish dominance in the Indo-Pacific, erode US influence, and put pressure on the rules-based order. The review recommends keeping military-to-military channels of communication with China. Additionally, the review warns that Russia's war economy, if sustained, will enable it to rebuild land capabilities more quickly in the event of a ceasefire in Ukraine. The review identifies the Middle East and Indo-Pacific as the next priority regions for defence engagement after the Euro-Atlantic.

**6 In 10 Americans Fear Social Security Will Vanish Before They Retire, As 2033 Insolvency Clock Ticks Louder - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)**
A recent survey by DepositAccounts found that 59% of working-age Americans fear that Social Security will not exist by the time they retire, with 70% of Generation X sharing this concern. The anxiety is driven by the program's main trust fund's depletion in 2033, which would leave incoming payroll taxes covering only 79% of promised checks. Jaime Eckels, a certified-financial-planner, warned that the countdown has moved from abstract to immediate for many savers, saying, 'It's not that far away. We're creeping up on it.' However, not all gauges are as bleak, with the 2025 Retirement Confidence Survey finding that about half of workers remain at least 'somewhat confident' that the government will pay benefits of equal value to today's. Despite this, 60% of workers worry about cuts to Social Security benefits. Analysts stress that insolvency does not equal disappearance, with LendingTree's Matt Schulz saying, 'The truth is that it's highly, highly unlikely Social Security 'won't be available.'

**Britain is getting a defense boost aimed at sending a message to...**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with Starmer saying 'we have to recognize the world has changed' and 'with greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.' The government will also build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send 'a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. Healey also stated that plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 are 'on track' and that there's 'no doubt' it will hit 3% before 2034. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks.

**Portnikov Predicts War to Continue Until 2032**
According to political observer Vasily Portnikov, the hot phase of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which typically lasts 7-10 years, may continue until 2032. After that, a phase of conflict with possible battles and bombings may begin. Portnikov emphasized the need to prepare for a peaceful next phase of the conflict, which could last at least 10-15 years, by receiving help from the Americans and Europeans, improving Ukrainian policy and mobilization, and enhancing Ukraine's military-industrial complex. 'We need to prepare and prepare for a war that is still very short in terms of the nature of this conflict. This is only the first stage. There will be a second, third,' Portnikov warned. He believes that there are no objective grounds for the war to end in the near future, but suggested that under favorable circumstances (Russia's economic situation and US pressure), the fighting may stop in this or the next year. 'The war will not end in our lifetime. The fire will stop,' he stressed.

**Portnikov Predicts War Will Last Until 2032**
According to political analyst Vitaliy Portnikov, the large-scale war between Russia and Ukraine may continue until 2032. He stated that the hot phase of the war, which has been ongoing for 7-10 years, will eventually give way to a phase of conflict with possible battles and bombings. Portnikov emphasized the need to make efforts in the coming years to ensure that the next phase of the conflict is peaceful and lasts for at least 10-15 years. 'We need to prepare for a war that is still very short in terms of the nature of this conflict, very. This is only the first stage. There will be a second, third,' Portnikov warned.

**American Films Predict a Divided US: A Warning from the Past**
Recent American films have predicted the actions of Donald Trump and the crisis in the US. The films 'The Campaign' (2012), 'Red Dawn' (1984 and 2012), 'The Second Civil War' (1997), and 'Civil War' (2024) depict scenarios where the US is weakened or divided. In 'The Campaign', a politician says, 'America, Jesus, freedom. What does it mean? I don't know, but the people love it when I say it.' In 'Red Dawn', a 1984 remake, the US is invaded by a foreign army, and in the 2012 version, the US is invaded by North Korean terrorists. The films 'The Second Civil War' and 'Civil War' show a divided US, with states rebelling against the federal government. In 'The Second Civil War', a governor closes the state's borders to child refugees and says, 'America for Americans.' In 'Civil War', Texas and California rebel against an authoritarian president on his third term. The films predict a future where the US is weakened or divided, and the current actions of Donald Trump may be seen as a step towards this scenario.

**German Intelligence Chief: Russia May Test NATO's Collective Defense Before 2030**
The head of German intelligence, Bruno Kahl, believes that Russia will likely try to test the effectiveness of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on collective defense. He suggests that if the war in Ukraine ends in the near future, this risk will become greater. 'We very much hope that this will not happen... But we must assume that Russia wants to test us, to check the unity of the West,' Kahl said in an interview with Deutsche Welle, as reported by 'European Truth' citing dpa. Kahl believes that the time and likelihood of such a 'test' are directly related to the development of events in the Russian-Ukrainian war. If the war ends before 2029-2030, Kahl said, Russia will be able to become a threat to Europe more quickly. 'It is also possible that a specific threat or attempt at blackmail by Russia against European states will occur earlier than previously thought... An earlier end to the war in Ukraine would allow the Russians to redirect their energy to where they want it most - against Europe,' Kahl said. According to Kahl, Russia hopes that the future contours of the world order will be similar to those in the 1990s, and that Russia's sphere of influence will expand further westward, with the United States withdrawing its troops from Europe in the most desirable scenario.

Four in 10 global strategists (40.5%) believe a world war involving major nations like the United States, China, or Russia will break out by 2035. The majority of respondents said it would likely involve nuclear weapons and battles in outer space. Climate change was ranked as the second greatest threat to the world in 2035, with three in 10 experts citing it as the single biggest threat to global prosperity between 2025 and 2035. Experts also warned of new global alliances over the next 10 years that may threaten the US and NATO, with nearly half the poll (47.4%) believing China will lead a new alliance that officially connects them to Russia, Iran, and North Korea.

**Third World War Could Start as Early as 2035, Experts Warn**
Experts predict that a global war could start as early as 2035, with a high likelihood of nuclear weapons and space battles being involved. The war would likely be sparked by the escalation of conflicts, arms racing, and technological threats. According to a survey by the Atlantic Council, 62% of respondents expect the world to be worse in 10 years, while only 38% predict it will be better. A significant majority of politicians (47.4%) believe that China will lead a new alliance with Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Almost 65% of respondents agree that China will attempt to invade Taiwan, a 15% increase from 2024. Additionally, 45% of those surveyed believe that Russia will enter a war with NATO within the next decade. The situation around Israel and its conflicts in the region is also complex. While the exact scenario of a third world war is unclear, three out of ten respondents named climate change as the second-largest threat to the world in 2035. Only 1.7% of respondents believed that a new pandemic would be the most pressing crisis affecting the planet. 'The world is on the brink of a new global confrontation,' said a team from the Atlantic Council. '62% of respondents expect the world to be worse in 10 years, and only 38% predict it will be better,' they added.

**Experts Predict Third World War in 2035: A Complex and Uncertain Future**
A recent survey of 357 political experts by Daily Mail suggests that a third world war is likely to occur within the next 10 years. 40.5% of the experts believe that a large-scale war involving countries such as the US, China, or Russia will break out in 2035. Many of the experts who predict a new world war expect it to involve nuclear weapons and space battles. The creation of the US Space Force by President Donald Trump in 2019 is seen as a major factor contributing to these predictions. Climate change is seen as the second biggest threat to peace in 2035 by 30% of the experts. Only 1.7% of the respondents believe that a new pandemic will be the most pressing crisis affecting the global population, and 5.1% think that a financial crisis will damage the world by 2035. The experts also predict that the war will not end well for Ukraine, and that the US will lose its economic and diplomatic dominance, while global democracies will continue to decline, leading to a 'democratic depression'. '62% of respondents expect the world to be worse in 10 years, and only 38% expect it to be better', said the Atlantic Council team. The survey also found that fewer respondents believe that the US will remain the dominant economic power by 2035, with 49% expecting it to be surpassed by China. Almost half of the respondents (47.4%) believe that China will lead a new alliance with Russia, Iran, and North Korea. 'Among those who expect a new world war in the next 10 years, 69% expect a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO', said the report. The survey also paints a complex picture of the Middle East, with 65% of the experts agreeing that China will attempt to invade Taiwan. 45% of the experts also expect Russia to enter a war with NATO within the next decade.

**Experts Predict Global War and Climate Change as Biggest Threats by 2035**
A recent survey conducted by the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, has found that 40% of experts believe that there is a high likelihood of a global war between the US, Russia, and China by 2035. The survey, which involved 357 political strategists and foreign policy experts, found that 10 out of 10 experts believe that there is a possibility of a large-scale war between the three nations. The war could be fought with nuclear weapons and could also extend to outer space. Experts have pointed out that the establishment of the US Space Force in 2019 by former President Donald Trump is a recent example of the increasing militarization of space. Even if the world avoids a global war, experts predict that the consequences of climate change will be severe, with 3 out of 10 experts believing that it will be the second biggest problem facing humanity by 2035. Additionally, 1.7% of experts believe that a new pandemic could break out, while 5.1% believe that the increasing financial debt will cripple the world by 2035.

**Time Traveler Elvis Thompson's Chilling Predictions for 2025**
Elvis Thompson, a self-proclaimed time traveler, has made some shocking predictions about the future, which have gone viral on social media. According to Thompson, on April 6, 2025, a devastating tornado will hit Oklahoma, USA, measuring 24 kilometers in width and with winds of 1,046 km/h. This event could affect millions of people and cause significant destruction. Additionally, Thompson predicts that a second American Civil War will begin on May 27, 2025, leading to Texas seceding from the United States and a potential nuclear conflict that could devastate the entire country. Furthermore, Thompson claims that on September 1, 2025, an alien named 'Champion' will arrive on Earth and take 12,000 humans to a distant planet for their safety. While many people have expressed skepticism about these predictions, they have been viewed over 26 million times on social media.

**Self-proclaimed time traveller warns of US civil war, alien evacuation: These are his top 5 predictions for 2025**
A self-proclaimed time traveller, Elvis Thompson, has made five bold predictions for 2025, including a devastating tornado in Oklahoma, a second American civil war, an alien evacuation mission, a massive storm on the U.S. East Coast, and the discovery of a massive sea creature in the Pacific Ocean. Thompson claimed that on April 6, a 24-kilometre-wide tornado with wind speeds of 1,046 km/h would hit Oklahoma, while on May 27, a second American civil war would break out, leading to Texas seceding and a nuclear conflict. He also predicted that on September 1, an alien named Champion would arrive to transport 12,000 humans to a distant planet, and that on September 19, a massive storm would batter the U.S. East Coast. Additionally, he claimed that on November 3, a sea creature six times the size of a blue whale would be discovered in the Pacific Ocean. These claims have sparked both curiosity and scepticism, with some viewers ridiculing his predictions.

**Mirko Lauer: 'The Possibility of a Civil War in the US is Opening Up'**
Mirko Lauer warns that the US is heading towards a possible civil war due to the consolidation of power by Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Lauer compares the situation to the 1992 autogolpe in Peru, where President Alberto Fujimori closed Congress and rewrote the rules to stay in power. He suggests that Trump may do the same in the US, manipulating the system to his advantage until 2030 or beyond. Lauer fears that this authoritarian trend in the world's leading democracy could be used as an excuse for other regimes to follow suit, weakening democracy worldwide. He notes that resistance exists, but it is fragmented, and that both Republicans and Democrats seem to have submitted to the power dynamic without objection. Lauer concludes that the inaction of the American people could be their greatest weakness, as the consolidation of authoritarian regimes often advances quickly when met with no strong opposition.

**Bengaluru's 2nd Airport Or Another Tug Of War With Tamil Nadu? AIADMK MP Discusses Take-Off Travails - News18**
The construction of a new airport in Hosur, Tamil Nadu, is being hindered by a concession agreement between the Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) and the civil aviation ministry, which prohibits the construction of any new airport within a 150-km aerial radius of Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) before 2033. AIADMK MP M Thambidurai has been pushing for the project, citing the need for a new airport due to high air traffic congestion at KIA. He has urged the centre to convince Karnataka to agree to a concession similar to the one worked out with GMR Airports Limited in Hyderabad. Union Civil Aviation Minister Kinjarapu Ram Mohan Naidu has acknowledged the need for a new airport in Hosur and has suggested that BIAL, Tamil Nadu government, and the centre hold talks on the issue. Karnataka's Infrastructure Development Minister MB Patil has confirmed that five sites have been shortlisted for Bengaluru's second airport. The Kempegowda International Airport is projected to reach its maximum passenger capacity by 2033 and full cargo capacity by 2040, making a second airport essential to prevent crowding and delays. 'The air traffic congestion in Bengaluru is high, and the airport is struggling to handle the pressure. Not just that, the KIA is making more than enough money, so it cannot argue that it needs to follow the clause for financial sustainability,' Thambidurai said. 'We are asking is that just as the rule was relaxed for Hyderabad, a similar agreement should be reached here in the interest of the people and frequent travellers,' he added.
