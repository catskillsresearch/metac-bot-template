**Miguel Ángel Rodríguez Compares Amnesty Law to Pedophilia**
Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, the chief of staff for Isabel Díaz Ayuso, has sparked controversy with a social media post. Rodríguez, also known as MAR, was responding to a draft opinion from the Constitutional Court's vice president, Inmaculada Montalbán, which argues that the law of Amnesty is constitutional because it does not explicitly prohibit slavery, mutilation, polygamy, or pedophilia. Rodríguez wrote, 'I just found out that slavery, mutilation, and polygamy are constitutional because they are not explicitly prohibited in the Constitution... what a thing... and pedophilia?' The draft opinion states that 'the legislator can do everything that the Constitution does not prohibit explicitly or implicitly. Respecting this limit, no content can be considered exempt from the possibility that Parliament may attract it.' Rodríguez's post has been widely criticized.

**Chinese Same-Sex Couple Marries in Thailand Amidst Growing Acceptance**
With the legalization of same-sex marriage in Thailand taking effect in January 2025, a Chinese same-sex couple, Wang Zengyi and Owen Zhu, have tied the knot in a ceremony in Bangkok. Wang said, 'Thailand is a more free and inclusive country for people like us.' Although China legalized same-sex relationships in 1997, same-sex marriage is still not recognized, and the couple faced difficulties in obtaining the necessary documents and dealing with social prejudices. Zhu said, 'The biggest challenge for us is to get the single status certificate required by the Thai authorities, which is difficult for us as Chinese same-sex couples.' Despite these challenges, the couple is excited about their new life together and hopes that their marriage will pave the way for others to follow their dreams. They plan to return to China after their honeymoon but expressed their desire to eventually retire in Thailand.

With the legalization of same-sex marriage in Thailand on January 1, 2025, a Chinese same-sex couple, Wang Zengyi and his partner, were able to get married in Thailand.

**Psychologist: A Man's Tendency Towards Second Marriage is Not Always a Sign of Infidelity**
According to Dr. Mona Hamdi, a psychologist, a man's tendency towards a second marriage is not always a sign of infidelity or a lack in his first marriage, but rather a complex interplay of psychological and biological factors. Hamdi explained that some studies suggest that there are differences in the neural and hormonal makeup between men and women, particularly in the 'reward system' of the brain, which is triggered by new experiences, such as falling in love or entering a new marriage. She added that the hormone 'dopamine', responsible for feelings of pleasure and euphoria, interacts differently in men, especially if they have a certain protein called 'DRD4', which is linked to repetitive behaviors and a desire for novelty. Hamdi said, 'Some men have an innate tendency to try new things, which sometimes explains polygamy, but it does not excuse the behavior without awareness or responsibility.' She emphasized that this tendency does not absolve men of their moral and social responsibility towards their first partner. Hamdi concluded that the decision ultimately remains a behavioral choice, not solely a biological one, and that many men have the ability to resist these drives with psychological awareness, emotional stability, and a understanding partner. She suggested that building a healthy dialogue within the relationship may be the key to preventing impulsive emotional decisions that lead to polygamy or divorce.

**The Experiences of LGBTQ Americans Today**
A recent Pew Research Center study surveyed 3,959 LGBTQ adults in the United States to understand their experiences 10 years after the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The study found that LGBTQ adults have mixed views on social acceptance, with 73% of gay or lesbian adults and 68% of transgender adults saying they have been subject to slurs or jokes because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Transgender adults are about twice as likely as gay or lesbian adults to say this has happened to them recently. The study also found that 70% of transgender adults say they have feared for their personal safety at some point, and 42% say they have been treated poorly by health care professionals. Many LGBTQ adults say they were first aware of their sexual orientation or gender identity at an early age but didn’t tell anyone until later. The study highlights the diversity of experiences across and within LGBTQ groups, and underscores the need for continued social progress and acceptance. 'In broad strokes, the survey finds some sense of social progress, as well as a feeling that acceptance will continue to grow,' said the study. However, it also highlights experiences with discrimination, especially among transgender adults. 'But it also highlights experiences with discrimination, especially among transgender adults,' the study noted. 'And it underscores the diversity of experiences across and within LGBTQ groups – from coming out, to navigating public spaces, to connecting with a broader LGBTQ community.'

**Tunisian Citizens Secretly Ask Lawmakers to Legalize Polygamy**
Tunisian citizens have been secretly asking lawmakers to legalize polygamy, according to Ahmed Bannour, a member of parliament from the Mahdia district. Bannour stated that some individuals have been using the current debate on mutual consent divorce as a way to bring up the topic of polygamy. Although the exact number of citizens who have made this request is unknown, it is likely that few would publicly support the idea due to the strong societal norms in place. 'Des citoyens ont pris contact avec des collègues parlementaires pour leur demander de légiférer sur la polygamie,' Bannour said, meaning that citizens have been contacting their parliamentary colleagues to ask them to legislate on polygamy.

**Canada's Polygamy Debate: A Step Towards Legalization?**
A Quebec court has made history by recognizing that children in Quebec can have more than two parents. Judge Andres Garin ruled that the provisions of the Civil Code discriminated against three polyamorous families and were unconstitutional. The court has given the legislature 12 months to update the legislation. The case was brought by two women and a man who formed a loving trio and wanted to be recognized legally as the parents of their children, born from a 'triangular' parental project. Two other polyamorous families joined the lawsuit, which was filed by several law firms. The judge estimates that limiting filiation to two people went against the right to equality enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Quebec Attorney General opposed the recognition of polyamory. If Simon Jolin-Barrette appeals the decision, it will go to the Supreme Court. Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland already recognize polyamory. In his judgment, Garin wrote that the modifications he recommends to the Civil Code could not open the door to polygamy. However, some experts believe that it would be difficult for the Supreme Court to maintain the ban on polygamy, citing the court's previous decision to legalize same-sex marriage. Professor Nick Bala of Queen's University said, 'If you redefine marriage, as we have done, you can ask: Well, if it's not necessary that it be one man and one woman, why can't it be more than two people?' Those who defend polygamy argue that its ban is an affront to the most fundamental rights: freedom of religion and freedom of association.

**Where Is Polygamy Legal? Top 10 Countries That Allow It | Pulse Nigeria**
Polygamy, specifically polygyny, where a man has multiple wives, is still legal in several countries around the world, particularly in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. While many Western nations ban polygamy, these countries recognize and regulate it under civil or religious law, often tying it to cultural identity, religion, and traditional values. As one might say, 'polygamy is more than a lifestyle; it's often tied to cultural identity, religion (especially Islam), and traditional values.'

**Research explores a proposed legalization of polygamy in Australia**
A new study by Michail Ivanov, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Adelaide, proposes a model for legalizing polygamy in Australia without disrupting the foundations of Australian marriage law. Ivanov suggests maintaining marriage as a union between two individuals while allowing a person to enter multiple legal marriages, a form of polygamy known as polyanthropy. This approach would ensure all spouses have equal rights and avoid unnecessary complications in divorce or property settlements. Ivanov argues that his proposed model would not be influenced by religious laws and would be the first society to legalize polygamy in a manner not led or motivated by religious beliefs. While there is no significant push for polygamous marriages to be legalized in Australia, Ivanov's research is still relevant to contemporary Australia and may garner more attention in the future. However, Ivanov emphasizes that further study is required to understand the potential social effects and to examine how polygamy would impact families in Australia and other areas of law, such as social security, estate law, and taxation.

**A proposed legalisation of polygamy in Australia | Newswise**
Michail Ivanov, a PhD candidate at the University of Adelaide, has proposed a model to legalise polygamy in Australia without disrupting the foundations of Australian marriage law. Ivanov's research, published in The University of Queensland Law Journal, suggests that polygamy has been documented throughout history in Australia, particularly amongst Indigenous Australian communities and Muslim migrants. He proposes a model of polyanthropy, where individuals can have multiple spouses, regardless of sex or sexuality, while maintaining marriage as a union between two individuals. Ivanov argues that this approach would ensure equal rights for all spouses and avoid unnecessary complications in divorce or property settlements. He also notes that his model would not be influenced by religious laws and would be the first society to legalise polygamy in a manner not led or motivated by religious beliefs.

**Utah Legislature cracks down on youth marriage amid polygamy lawsuits**
A bill, SB76, passed by the Utah Legislature aims to prevent underage marriages, particularly in polygamous communities. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Jen Plumb, would require a 72-hour waiting period before a juvenile court can issue authorization for a minor to marry. This is in response to a recent lawsuit against the Kingston family, who are accused of sex trafficking and abuse of underage members. Lu Ann Cooper, president of Hope After Polygamy, said, 'It is a problem within polygamy in the state of Utah... I would hope that this bill would help situations that are in that lawsuit not happen in Utah or not happen at all.' The bill does not specifically target polygamy, but Plumb said that the isolation of polygamous communities can make coercive underage marriages more likely. Since the 2019 law that outlawed marriages of 15-year-olds and required parental permission for those under 18, the number of annual youth marriages in Utah has increased, from 10 in 2019 to 39 in 2023.

**Government Rejects Bill to Ban Polygamy Promotion**
The government has not supported a bill to ban the promotion of polygamy. According to 'National Service of News', the proposal to introduce administrative responsibility for promoting multiple marriages was put forward by Nina Ostaniina, the head of the Committee for Family, Women and Children in the State Duma, in December 2024. The initiative was discussed at a government commission meeting on February 10, 2025, but the bill was asked to be significantly revised. Ostaniina's proposal was met with criticism, as the Family Code of Russia already prohibits marriage to someone who is already in a legal marriage, and the concept of 'polygamy' does not exist in Russian law. 'It is necessary to significantly revise the bill,' said Ostaniina, 'to make it more realistic and in line with our current legislation.'

Pastor Martin Ssempa, leader of Makerere Community Church, has proposed that polygamy be legalised for Christians in Uganda's Marriage Bill, 2024. He argued that the current legal framework, which recognises monogamy as the only form of Christian marriage, is out of touch with the realities of many believers. Ssempa also urged MPs to criminalise adultery and mandate a minimum frequency for conjugal relations among married couples, proposing three times per week. His proposals have sparked controversy, with MPs questioning the biblical basis for Christian polygamy and the state's role in legislating conjugal obligations.

**APWWS seeks urgent legislative action prohibiting polygamy**
The Arunachal Pradesh Women’s Welfare Society (APWWS) has called for urgent legislative action to prohibit polygamy within tribal societies in Arunachal Pradesh. In a letter to the Arunachal Pradesh State Commission for Women (APSCW), the APWWS expressed concern over the rising crimes against women and sought decisive action on the issue. The Society stated that the lack of stringent legislation has allowed polygamy to persist and proliferate, exacerbating gender inequality and social instability. They urged for immediate deliberation and enactment of a comprehensive legal framework to prohibit polygamy in government, political and public sectors, saying 'Such a legislative measure is imperative to uphold the dignity, rights, and well-being of women in Arunachal Pradesh.'

**In places where same-sex marriages are legal, how many married same-sex couples are there?**
According to a Pew Research Center analysis, in countries where same-sex marriages are legal, the percentage of married same-sex couples varies. The United Kingdom had the second-highest share of same-sex marriages at 3.3%, with 3.3% in England and Wales, 3.5% in Scotland, and 4.2% in Northern Ireland. In the United States, 3.4% of the 148,588 marriages registered in 2021 were same-sex marriages. The analysis used the most recent year for which marriage statistics were available in each country, which was 2020, 2021, or 2022. Some countries were excluded from the analysis due to lack of data or inconsistent reporting. For example, Argentina has no single nationwide repository for vital statistics on marriage, and Canada does not release separate nationwide statistics for same- and opposite-sex marriages due to inconsistent reporting in some provinces and territories.
