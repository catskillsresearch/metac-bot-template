**Nigeria needs five times growth rate to hit $1tr by 2030 - World Bank**
The World Bank has stated that Nigeria's economy needs to grow at a rate five times faster than its current pace to achieve the $1 trillion target by 2030. According to the World Bank's Nigeria Development Update (NDU) report, the country's economy needs to be rebalanced towards more productive sectors that create jobs and opportunities for the poor and economically insecure. The report proposes a growth strategy led by the private sector but facilitated by the public sector, with a focus on addressing infrastructure gaps, fostering a competitive business environment, and improving access to finance for new and existing businesses. The report noted that economic growth in the final quarter of 2024 increased by 4.6 percent year-on-year, pushing the forecasted growth rate for the full year to 3.4 percent. Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy Wale Edun emphasized the importance of transparency in the oil sector and the need to push for it to achieve economic goals. CBN Governor Olayemi Cardoso stressed the importance of financial inclusion and the CBN's commitment to supporting the fintech sector and improving access to finance for all Nigerians.

**Nigeria's 2025 budget assumptions ambitious - World Bank; FG disagrees**
The World Bank has described the key assumptions of Nigeria's 2025 budget as ambitious, citing a projected oil production of 2.1 million barrels per day and a price of $73 per barrel. The bank noted that the current production level is 1.6mbpd and the international market price is $60pb. The bank urged the Federal Government to stay on course in implementing its economic reforms, despite challenges and rising cost of living. The bank commended the government for removing subsidies on petrol and liberalizing the foreign exchange market, which has improved government revenue. However, the bank noted that NNPC Limited is currently remitting only 50 percent of the revenue gains arising from petrol subsidy removal. The bank also stated that Nigeria's fiscal outlook remains cautiously optimistic but hinges on the necessary consolidation of recent advances. The Federal Government has reacted to the report, with the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, saying that the economy has moved from a period of crisis to a period of stability which needs to be sustained. The Minister of Budget and Economic planning, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, disagreed that the assumptions made in the 2025 budgets were over ambitious, pointing out that they were based on the country's potential. The CBN Governor, Yemi Cardoso, said the economy needs a period of sustained stability for it to grow, which is what the central bank has been doing. The Governor of Plateau State, Caleb Mutfwang, argued that despite the increased revenue, purchasing power has also dropped due to the high level of insecurity across the country.

**Tight monetary policies may lower Nigeria's inflation to 22.1% -- W'Bank**
The World Bank has projected that Nigeria's inflation rate will average 22.1 per cent in 2025, down from the current rate of 24.23 per cent. The World Bank attributed the anticipated decline to the Central Bank of Nigeria's tight monetary stance aimed at restoring price stability and anchoring inflation expectations. According to the report, while macroeconomic indicators have improved significantly, particularly GDP growth, revenue mobilisation, and fiscal consolidation, headline inflation remains a pressing concern. The World Bank identified the major drivers of elevated inflation in recent years to include the removal of petrol subsidies, exchange rate unification, rising logistics and energy costs, and recurring food supply disruptions. However, it noted that the Central Bank's ongoing monetary tightening efforts are starting to show positive signs, with inflationary pressures expected to ease going into 2025. Acting World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, Taimur Samad, said, 'Nigeria has made impressive strides to restore macroeconomic stability. With the improvement in the fiscal situation, Nigeria now has a historic opportunity to improve the quantity and quality of development spending; investing more in human capital, social protection, and infrastructure.' World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria, Alex Sienaert, added, 'A useful strategy is to position the public sector to play a dual role as a provider of essential public services... and as an enabler for the private sector to invest, innovate, and grow the economy.'

**Nigeria needs five-fold growth to hit $1trn economy by 2030 - World Bank - Businessday NG**
According to the World Bank, Nigeria needs to grow five times faster than its current pace to reach a $1 trillion economy by 2030. The country's current growth rate of 3.40% in 2024 is not sufficient to achieve this target. Alex Sienaert, lead economist of the World Bank in Nigeria, stated, 'Macroeconomic reforms are necessary but insufficient on their own to achieve fast, sustained, and inclusive growth.' The World Bank projects Nigeria's economy to grow from 3.4% in 2024 to 3.8% in 2026-2027, but this is lower than the country's ambitious projected annual GDP growth of 4.6% outlined in the 2025 budget. The International Monetary Fund has also cut Nigeria's 2025 economic growth forecast to 3.0% due to weakening oil supply and escalating global trade tensions. The World Bank recommends a dual-pillar strategy to foster growth, including sustained macro policy by the public sector and large-scale private sector investment supported by competition reforms and improved infrastructure.

**Nigeria's inflation to average at 22% in 2025 if CBN holds tight monetary policy - World bank - Businessday NG**
The World Bank predicts that Nigeria's inflation rate will decline to an annual average of 22% in 2025 if the Central Bank of Nigeria maintains its current tight monetary stance. According to Taimur Samad, the World Bank's Country Director for Nigeria, Nigeria's macroeconomic situation is improving due to the commitment to sustain reforms, but warned that the war is not won yet due to many challenges including inflation. Samad stated, 'There is a lot to be positive about on Nigeria. Growth is up. The exchange rate is market reflective and more stable. Foreign reserves have increased. The fiscal position is much improved on the back of a surge in federation revenues. Now, needless to say, the war is not won.' The World Bank recommends that the Nigerian government stay the course on tough macro fiscal reforms and undertake yet more reforms to fire up and drive growth, job creation, and share an economic opportunity.

**More Nigerians To Become Poor By 2027 - World Bank**
The World Bank has projected that poverty in Nigeria will increase by 3.6 percentage points over the next five years, rising through 2027. According to the Africa's Pulse report, Nigeria, alongside other resource-rich and fragile countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, will experience a worsening poverty situation. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo stated, 'Nigerians have no business living in poverty.' The report highlights that Sub-Saharan Africa continues to have the highest extreme poverty rate globally, with 80% of the world's 695 million extreme poor living in the region. The World Bank recommends that Nigeria and similar economies focus on improving fiscal management and building a stronger fiscal contract with citizens to promote inclusive economic development and long-term poverty alleviation.

**Banks Feast on Profits, Customers Starve from Illegal Deductions**
Nigerian banks have generated N1.45 trillion in electronic-banking charges, account maintenance fees, and other charges in the first quarter of 2025, a 104.5% increase from the previous year. This has led to widespread outrage among customers, who are being hit with unjustified deductions and hidden charges. Banks are blaming the increase in telecoms tariffs for the hike in charges, but critics argue that they should absorb some of the costs instead of passing them on to customers. The Central Bank of Nigeria has guidelines on bank charges, which banks are violating, and customers can approach the courts if they observe irregular deductions from their accounts. 'Banks remain among the most profitable sectors in Nigeria, even in tough economic times. Given that, they should show more empathy and be willing to absorb some of these rising costs instead of pushing them entirely to consumers,' said Muda Yusuf, CEO of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise.

**How Nigerians will prioritise savings, investments in 2025 - Businessday NG**
According to a report by Intelpoint, Nigerians will prioritize savings and investments in 2025. Godwin Chuka, a 55-year-old civil servant, said that savings come first for him due to the volatility of the economy. Juliet Nwamiri, a 25-year-old employee, also prioritizes savings, citing the unpredictability of the economy. Ifeanyi Caleb prefers saving in dollars over naira due to rising inflation. The report found that 8 out of 10 people plan to start using a new financial product or service in 2025, with savings, investments, and other financial services dominating the market. Commercial banks remain the most trusted and widely used financial institutions in Nigeria, with 59.0% of respondents planning to keep most of their money in commercial banks. Digital banks are also gaining popularity, with 23.5% of respondents preferring them over traditional banks.

**Nigerians uninterested in stocks amid NGX’s 38% 2024 gain**
Despite the Nigerian stock market's impressive 38% gain in 2024, with a capital gain of N15.41 trillion, Nigerians remain uninterested in investing in the market. The main obstacles to participation include low income, lack of trust, and inadequate financial literacy. According to the Central Securities Clearing System (CSCS), only about 100,000 out of 5 million required accounts are active, indicating limited ongoing engagement. The culture's emphasis on quick wealth and the legacy of financial fraud, including Ponzi schemes that have defrauded Nigerians of over $1 billion, have contributed to a lack of trust in legitimate investment avenues. Additionally, economic challenges and inflation, particularly rising food inflation, have placed additional financial pressure on households, lowering consumer confidence and fueling economic instability. As a result, many Nigerians, especially those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, are hesitant to approach traditional investment firms and may lack the technological literacy to use fintech platforms. According to reports by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFInA), 36.8% of Nigerians are financially excluded due to a combination of low income, poor education, and distrust of financial service providers.

**World Bank projects 3.6% economic growth for Nigeria**
The World Bank has projected that Nigeria's economy will grow by 3.6% in 2025, up from 3.4% in 2024, driven by improved performance in non-oil sectors and a gradual rebound in oil production. The bank also expects the country's poverty rate to increase by 3.6 percentage points between 2022 and 2027, with over 106 million Nigerians living on less than $2.15 per day. The World Bank warned that poverty in resource-rich and fragile economies, such as Nigeria, would worsen unless decisive structural reforms are urgently implemented. The IMF, on the other hand, projects a slower economic growth of 3.0% in 2025 and a narrowing of the current account surplus to 6.9% in 2025 and 5.2% in 2026. The IMF also noted that the benefits of recent reforms have yet to trickle down to the wider population, with poverty and food insecurity remaining high.

**Active bank accounts in Nigeria rise to 311.6 million in December 2024 -- NIBSS**
According to the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), the number of active bank accounts in Nigeria rose to 311.6 million in December 2024, a 54.5% increase from 202.6 million at the end of 2023. This indicates that 106 million new accounts were opened or reactivated between January and December last year. The World Bank notes that access to a transaction account is the first step toward broader financial inclusion. However, there is still a wide gap between the number of active bank accounts and the number of Bank Verification Numbers (BVN), which is now a compulsory requirement for opening an account. Additionally, the number of inactive or dormant bank accounts increased by 7.9% year-on-year, standing at 19.5 million.

According to the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), the number of active bank accounts in Nigeria rose to 311.6 million in December 2024, a 54.5% increase from 202.6 million at the end of 2023. This indicates that 106 million new accounts were opened or reactivated between January and December last year. However, the number of inactive or dormant bank accounts increased by 7.9% to 19.5 million, and 25.5 million bank accounts were closed in the year. The NIBSS data also shows a gap between the number of active bank accounts and the number of Bank Verification Numbers (BVN), with 64.8 million BVNs registered as of January 2025, but 5% of banked adults do not have a BVN or National Identification Number (NIN). The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has instructed banks to place a 'Post no Debit' restriction on accounts without a BVN or NIN from April 2024. As the World Bank notes, access to a transaction account is the first step toward broader financial inclusion, allowing people to store, send, and receive money. 'Financial inclusion is a key driver of economic growth and poverty reduction,' said the World Bank. 'It enables people to participate in the economy, access credit, and build assets.'

**2025: BVN enrollment rises to 64.8m in January**
The total number of people enrolled in the Bank Verification Number (BVN) system in Nigeria has increased to 64.8 million, according to data released by the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS). This represents an additional 800,000 account owners enrolled in January, compared to 64.0 million in November. However, there is still a significant gap between the number of active bank accounts (231.1 million in July 2024) and the registered BVNs. Financial operators attribute this disparity to multiple accounts held by bank customers, who can easily link multiple accounts to a single BVN. According to the Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFInA) Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2023 Survey report, 5% (3 million) of banked adults do not have a BVN or NIN.

**CBN says 95% of bank debtors took loans from microfinance banks in 2024**
According to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), 95.66% of bank loans in 2024 originated from Microfinance banks, with a total of 6,253 loans recorded in September 2024. This marks a slight decline from the previous month and a significant decline from the same period last year. The CBN Governor, Yemi Cardoso, has consistently raised interest rates in 2024 to curb the rising inflation rate, but inflation remains unaffected. The rise in popularity of digital loan apps may also be contributing to the reduced market share of traditional Deposit Money Banks (DMBs). Within the core banking space, loans from DMBs continue to decline significantly, with only 155 loans collected in September 2024, a 68.9% drop from the same period last year. The total value of loans across all debtor types reached N118.73 billion, marking a 4.2% increase from the same period last year, but a 12.8% decrease from the previous month.

**95% bank debtors borrowed from MFBs in 2024 - CBN**
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has revealed that 95.66% of bank debtors borrowed from microfinance banks (MFBs) as of September 2024. This dominance highlights the critical role of MFBs in the country's lending ecosystem, particularly for individuals and small businesses. The data shows a slight month-on-month decline in MFB debtors, dropping from 6,573 in August 2024 to 6,253 in September 2024. The decline is even sharper year-on-year, with a 26.4% reduction from 8,500 in September 2023. The drop in the number of borrowers is largely linked to rising interest rates, which have made credit more expensive and discouraged borrowing. CBN Governor Olayemi Cardoso has overseen six consecutive increases in the Monetary Policy Rate, elevating it from 18.75% in February 2024 to 27.50% by November 2024. The elevated interest rates have led to higher borrowing costs, potentially deterring individuals and businesses from seeking loans. The total number of debtors across all creditor types stood at 6,537 in September 2024, down from 6,916 in August 2024 and 9,071 in September 2023. Microfinance banks remain the dominant creditors, accounting for about 96% of all debtors in September 2024.
