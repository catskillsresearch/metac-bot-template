**Whoâ€™s Buying American? Tracking the Surge in Demand for U.S. Goods**
A recent survey by Trace One found that interest in American-made products is rising, with 43% of Americans saying they've become more interested in buying domestic goods over the past year. The top motivator for this trend is supporting American jobs, with 39% of respondents citing it as the largest benefit. However, willingness to pay more for domestic products varies widely, with younger Americans being the most price-sensitive and Republicans being the most willing to pay a premium. Google Trends data shows that interest in American-made goods is highest in rural northern states, especially across the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, and Mountain West. The survey also found that a decline in overall consumer spending is a likely outcome if tariffs cause a 10% increase in prices for imported goods, with one-third of Americans saying they would reduce how much they buy overall.

**US Generic Drug Market is Booming and Predicted to Hit USD 126.0 Billion by 2033**
The US generic drug market size reached USD 93.6 Billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 126.0 Billion by 2033, exhibiting a growth rate (CAGR) of 3.4% during 2025-2033. The market is driven by rising healthcare costs, patent expirations, and growing demand for affordable treatments. Key trends include increased FDA approvals, strategic mergers, and a strong focus on biosimilars and cost-effective manufacturing solutions. The market is expected to continue growing, driven by several key trends that reflect evolving consumer behavior and healthcare dynamics. As the demand for affordable medications escalates, the market is witnessing an influx of generic drug approvals, particularly as numerous blockbuster drugs approach patent expiration. By 2025, a substantial number of brand-name drugs will lose their patent protection, creating lucrative opportunities for generic manufacturers to introduce alternatives. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and an aging population are contributing to higher medication consumption, further propelling the demand for generics. The market is also experiencing a shift toward online pharmacies and mail-order services, which facilitate easier access to generic medications for consumers. Additionally, collaborations between generic manufacturers and healthcare providers are becoming more prevalent, as they strive to enhance patient adherence to treatment regimens through cost-effective options. Overall, the US generic drug market is adapting to meet evolving healthcare needs, positioning itself for sustained growth in the coming years.

**GSMA Warns of Unsustainable Network Funding Model Amid Growing Mobile Traffic**
The Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) estimates that mobile data traffic in Latin America has increased 14-fold between 2016 and 2023 and will triple by 2030. The organization warns that the growing traffic puts the sustainability of the current funding model for networks at risk. According to GSMA, Meta, Google, and TikTok generated 70% of total downloads in Latin America in 2024, with Meta responsible for nearly 50%. The GSMA proposes establishing a regulatory framework to ensure efficient use of networks, suggesting that operators and large platforms could reach an agreement on compensation or technical conditions. The goal is for operators to predict and prepare for the volume of traffic, making necessary investments to deploy, update, and maintain the infrastructure that connects millions of people.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**Microsoft's AI-Generated Code: A Growing Trend**
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that between 20-30% of the company's code in its repositories has been created using artificial intelligence. He mentioned that some projects 'are probably fully written' by neural networks, and this number 'will only continue to grow' in the future. Nadella noted that the efficiency of code generation depends on the programming language, with Python showing significant progress, while C++ is less noticeable. Microsoft's Technical Director Kevin Scott added that by 2030, he predicts that up to 95% of all code will be generated by artificial intelligence. When Nadella asked Mark Zuckerberg for a similar estimate, he was unable to provide exact numbers. Meanwhile, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stated last week that AI is already writing over 30% of the company's code.

**Three Marketing Trends to Drive Your Brand's Growth Before the Competition Does**
With the digital market becoming saturated, experts suggest hybrid tactics to amplify results and engage consumers. Jillian Johnson, founder of PostcardMania, a company that generates $119 million in revenue annually, identifies three trends that can drive brand growth in 2025. The era of investing in social media to generate significant results is coming to an end. Recent data shows that consumers are becoming increasingly skeptical of digital platforms: 35% of American adults have taken a prolonged break from social media due to mental health concerns, and over half believe that these platforms have worsened in recent years. In 2024, the average cost per ad on Meta increased by 10%, while the number of impressions only grew by 6%. On Google, the increase was even more significant: 25% in the same period. In this context, simply placing ads is no longer enough - they need to be optimized with precision. Marketing professionals who excel at performance analysis and automation tools are gaining prominence. As digital becomes more expensive and less effective, print media is reappearing as a powerful alternative - and surprisingly, a relevant one. The nostalgia factor is not the point; what matters is the effectiveness and trust that tangible communication still generates. The new generation of direct mail works intelligently, triggered by specific consumer behaviors - such as abandoning a shopping cart or failing to respond to a lead. With the support of integrated automation platforms connected to CRM or company websites, it's possible to personalize each send, making the action more targeted, efficient, and measurable. Professionals who can connect these tools - combining digital automation with offline media - are better positioned in the market.

**Interest Rates to Continue Decreasing in 2025, Favorable for Long-Term Bond Fund Managers**
According to Twin Capital Gestion, the interest rates will continue to decrease in 2025 due to a favorable macroeconomic environment and a scenario of new interest rate cuts. The experts argue that the Bank Al Maghrib (BAM) will maintain its monetary easing policy, driven by inflation control and economic growth prospects. They also point to the government's financial situation, with a projected deficit of 3.5% in 2025 and a controlled public debt. As a result, the society of management expects a stability of short-term interest rates in the short term, followed by a decrease in long-term interest rates, leading to a flattening of the yield curve. This scenario is favorable for long-term bond fund managers, who have seen a significant net inflow of funds in 2024. Additionally, the stock market is expected to continue its growth in 2025, driven by a favorable macroeconomic and market context, characterized by two main trends: a continuation of the growth dynamic triggered by several major investment projects, including the organization of the 2030 World Cup and international partnerships, and a decrease in interest rates, confirmed by the decrease in the key interest rate in December 2024. 'In this context, the continuation of the growth of profits anticipated for 2024, combined with a favorable arbitrage environment (decrease in interest rates and increase in dividend yields), should consolidate investor demand for the stock market; a demand that should be reinforced by the strong injection of liquidity following the tax amnesty,' concludes the asset manager.
