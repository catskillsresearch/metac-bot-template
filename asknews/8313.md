**10 richest people in the world as Elon Musk reclaims top spot from female billionaire**
Elon Musk has reclaimed the top spot as the world's richest person, with a net worth of $423 billion as of June 1, 2025, according to the Forbes Real Time Billionaire Index. Musk's wealth increased by $36 billion in May, largely due to the success of Tesla's stocks, which rose 23% after the company announced its robot taxi launch. Mark Zuckerberg saw his fortunes surge, adding $34 billion to his wealth, and surpassed Jeff Bezos to take the second position. Bezos' net worth rose by $19 billion, while Warren Buffett lost $9 billion due to a drop in Berkshire Hathaway's stock. The combined net worth of the world's top 10 richest people increased by $140 billion in May, hitting a collective $1.9 trillion.

**Behind the Scenes of 'Mountainhead': Carell and Schwartzman Reveal Secrets**
The film 'Mountainhead' follows four wealthy friends on a unique cabin trip during an international crisis, where Hugo Van Yalk (Jason Schwartzman) invites his friends 'the Brewsters' to a poker weekend in his luxurious cabin in Utah. The film features Steve Carell, Ramy Youssef, and Cory Michael Smith in supporting roles. In an interview with TV 2, Carell and Schwartzman revealed some behind-the-scenes secrets from the filming process. Carell mentioned that the film was shot in an unusual way, with two cameras filming everything at all times, and long scenes were filmed like a one-man show. This led to some spontaneous outbursts and a lot of suppressed laughter. Schwartzman added that one of the actors, Cory Michael Smith, had to take measures to stifle his laughter, even eating lemons to avoid bursting out laughing. The film's characters can be interpreted as a satire of wealthy individuals like Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk, but Carell emphasized that he didn't intend to parody these characters. Instead, he aimed to play them as genuinely as possible, without commenting on their stereotypes. The film's director, Jesse Armstrong, also spoke to TV 2 about his experience working with Carell and Schwartzman, and how he drew inspiration from his research on Sam Bankman-Fried, a cryptocurrency founder who was arrested and convicted of fraud. Armstrong's film 'Mountainhead' is his directorial debut, and he has expressed his admiration for Norway, where he has visited on several occasions.

**Sam Bankman-Fried's Early Release, Schiff Vs Vance, Bitcoin's Fall, And Trump's Meme Coin Dinner: This Week In Crypto - Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) Common units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:BTC)**
The past week in cryptocurrency was marked by several significant events. Sam Bankman-Fried, the notorious fraudster, is set to be released from prison four years ahead of schedule due to 'good conduct time' credits. Economist Peter Schiff publicly disagreed with Vice President JD Vance's support for Bitcoin, sparking a debate over its value and impact. Bitcoin's value dropped below $105,000 after President Donald Trump's warning about the US-China trade agreement. Additionally, Google warned that RSA encryption, a key security feature in securing Bitcoin, may be vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Meanwhile, a black-tie gala hosted by Donald Trump for top TRUMP MAGA/USD meme coin holders turned into a high-net-worth crypto networking event.

**Jesse Armstrong's 'Mountainhead' Explores the World of Tech Billionaires**
Jesse Armstrong, the creator of the hit series 'Succession', has released his first film, 'Mountainhead', on HBO Max. The film, starring Steve Carrel, Jason Schwartzman, and Ramy Youssef, satirizes the world of tech billionaires. Armstrong drew inspiration from his research on Sam Bankman-Fried, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and other tech moguls. 'I wrote a book review on Sam Bankman-Fried, then I read more about technology,' he said. 'I started listening to podcasts from important people like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Sam Altman, but also from intermediate and lower levels - it's an ecosystem.' Armstrong aimed to capture the voices and vocabulary of these individuals, saying, 'I love learning the vocabulary. Once I hear them speak, it opens doors.' The film follows a weekend poker game between four tech billionaires, set against the backdrop of a global crisis caused by one of their companies' AI-related issues. Armstrong's obsession with biographies of entrepreneurs and podcasts like All-in and Lex Fridman's show is evident in the film. He explained, 'People ask, 'Why make a fiction about the rich?' It's a legitimate question... I think it's because I'm interested in power, not just wealth.' Armstrong's film, like 'Succession', explores 'why the world is the way it is and who holds the power'.

**The Cringe, Chaotic, and Current World of HBO's 'Mountainhead'**
The HBO film 'Mountainhead' is a satirical exploration of the tech and entrepreneurial world, written and directed by Jesse Armstrong. The film follows a group of billionaires, including Steve Carell, Ramy Youssef, Cory Michael Smith, and Jason Schwartzman, as they navigate the complexities of AI, cryptocurrency, and the pursuit of wealth and power. The film is a commentary on the excesses and absurdities of the tech world, and the ways in which it can lead to chaos and destruction. Armstrong's vision for the film was influenced by his research on the rise and fall of Sam Bankman-Fried and the world of effective altruism. The film's themes of utilitarianism, effective altruism, and the dangers of unchecked technological advancement are timely and thought-provoking. 'Mountainhead' is a farce that devolves into rowdy, inventive violence, but it is also a nuanced exploration of the human condition and the consequences of our actions.

**Anthony Boyle to Play Sam Bankman-Fried Opposite Julia Garner as Caroline Ellison in Netflix's FTX Series 'The Altruists'**
Anthony Boyle will play Sam Bankman-Fried in Netflix's upcoming series 'The Altruists,' opposite Julia Garner as Caroline Ellison. The series, which has been picked up for eight episodes, tells the story of the two individuals who tried to remake the global financial system and then stole $8 billion. Garner, who has previously starred in 'Ozark' and 'Inventing Anna,' will also executive produce the series. Boyle's TV credits include 'Say Nothing,' 'Manhunt,' and 'The Plot Against America.' The role of Bankman-Fried was founded in 2019 and became one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, but it imploded in 2022 with billions of dollars in customer funds missing and investigations underway. Bankman-Fried and Ellison were eventually convicted on various counts of wire and securities fraud, as well as money laundering. 'The Altruists' is executive produced by Graham Moore and Jacqueline Hoyt, and directed by James Ponsoldt.

**Fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried Set To Leave Prison Four Years Early As 'Good Conduct' Credits Trim His 25-Year Sentence**
Sam Bankman-Fried, the former cryptocurrency mogul, is now projected to be released from prison on December 14, 2044, four years earlier than his original 25-year sentence. This is due to 'good conduct time' credits that can cut up to 54 days from each year of a sentence. Bankman-Fried was convicted of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy for 'commingling money with Alameda Research' and channeling billions in customer deposits into risky bets, political donations, and luxury real estate. His defense team has appealed both his conviction and sentence, arguing that the trial moved too quickly and misinterpreted cryptocurrency practices. The entrepreneur's projected exit could change again due to serious disciplinary infractions or additional program hours, and a separate civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission seeks billions in disgorgement.

Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda and a key witness in the government's case, is also projected to be released in May 2026 after similar reductions, having been sentenced to two years.

**Sam Bankman-Fried has had more than 4 years shaved off his prison sentence**
Sam Bankman-Fried, the crypto fraudster, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in the $11 billion FTX scheme. According to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), he will be released on December 14, 2044, which is more than 4 years early. The BOP estimates that Bankman-Fried will earn 'Good Conduct Time' and participate in programs that may reduce his sentence to less than 21 years. A spokesman for the BOP explained, 'Lastly, individuals may also receive credit for time incarcerated before their date of sentencing.' Bankman-Fried's onetime girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, was sentenced to 2 years in prison and had 6 months shaved from her sentence through the same process.

**The Rise and Fall of Sam Bankman-Fried: From Cryptocurrency King to Financial Ruin**
Sam Bankman-Fried, once the king of cryptocurrencies, rapidly rose to fame and was compared to Warren Buffet. He received numerous projects and became the second youngest person to amass wealth quickly, after Mark Zuckerberg. However, his downfall was even more dramatic. In November 2022, allegations of fraudulent activities by Bankman-Fried's company, FTX, began to surface. A request by Bankman-Fried to his former CTO to change the code to allow the company to buy assets from bankrupt companies was exposed. It was claimed that client funds were used to finance Alameda and make risky investments without their knowledge. The panic spread, and investors and business partners rushed to withdraw their money, causing the company to collapse and file for bankruptcy. Bankman-Fried admitted to 'making a mistake' but denied accepting external funds and blamed his former colleagues. He was accused of fraud and conspiracy and was extradited to the US, where he was released on a $250 million bail. However, he was rearrested in August 2023 for allegedly attempting to tamper with witnesses. In March 2024, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison and fined $11 billion to compensate for the losses suffered by clients.

**Sam Altman's Tools for Humanity Launches World, an Identity Verification System Based on Eye Scanning**
Tools for Humanity, a startup co-founded by Sam Altman of OpenAI, has launched its identity verification system based on eye scanning, World, in the United States. The system focuses on Orb, a spherical accessory that reads users' irises to authenticate them on various supported platforms, including the video game Minecraft. In exchange, people receive free portions of a proprietary cryptocurrency, Worldcoin, to use wherever they want. As the Financial Times writes, Altman had slowed down the project's development due to the lack of interest from the previous Biden administration in the world of cryptocurrencies. With the arrival of Trump, the entrepreneur received a decisive push to finalize the World platform and the related Orb for iris scanning. A focus on privacy: each Orb device is provided with a private digital key, stored in a secure hardware, which authenticates and signs messages. Altman founded Tools for Humanity in 2019 with Alex Blania. To date, the organization has raised around $200 million from venture capital investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures, co-founder of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman, and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2024 for fraud. At an event in San Francisco, Altman stated that the World technology provides 'a way to ensure that humans remain central in a world increasingly based on artificial intelligence.' World was previously known as Worldcoin, until Tools of Humanity decided to focus on the aspect of the project related to digital identity rather than the cryptocurrency component. The information collected by the Orb sphere will be used to create a unique profile for each user, called World Id, which, in the company's view, will replace traditional passwords.

**The Rise of Supermillionaires: A New Era of Unprecedented Inequality?**
The world's 24 supermillionaires have built their fortunes through various industries, with six of the top 10 richest individuals attributing their wealth to the tech industry. However, this wealth is volatile and subject to fluctuations in stock values and investor confidence. The speed at which these fortunes are amassed has also changed, with entrepreneurs like Sam Bankman-Fried achieving billions in less than 10 years. The rise of supermillionaires has led to an explosion in the luxury real estate market, with each of the 24 individuals on the list owning at least $100 million in properties. This has sparked debates about economic inequality and the disproportionate power these individuals hold in society. Economist Joseph Stiglitz has warned that antitrust legislation has failed to address the concentration of power in the tech sector, with companies like Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet dominating the digital landscape with little competition. Critics also point out that supermillionaires have perfected strategies to avoid taxes, such as Elon Musk's $50 billion compensation package from Tesla, which has generated legal battles. With the current rate of wealth accumulation, some analysts consider it plausible that the first trillionaire will emerge in the next few decades. Maya Imberg of Altrata said, 'Before, we would have said no, but today everything is possible.' The rise of supermillionaires raises questions about the future of capitalism, the regulation of extreme wealth, and economic equity.

**Sam Altman vs Elon Musk: A Rivalry Born of AI and Wealth**
Elon Musk, the richest person in the world according to Forbes, has a new fixation on Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, after joining Donald Trump's cabinet. Musk, who was part of the foundation of OpenAI, left the executive board after failing to become the company's CEO, according to Altman. Altman described Musk's departure as a 'tantrum' of a 'spoiled child who wants to do what he wants.' This led to a rivalry between the two tech giants. Musk, who in 2022 claimed that OpenAI's AI is a major threat to the US, later announced his own AI to show that his criticism of Altman's company is personal. In terms of wealth, Musk far surpasses Altman, ranking 1st on the Forbes list, while Altman is at 2554. However, Altman was named the most influential person in tech in 2023 and is well-positioned in the 2024 list. Neither Musk nor Altman flaunts their wealth, a practice common among Hollywood stars. While Musk has owned extravagant homes in the past, he now lives in a 37-square-meter prefabricated house, according to Grimes, his ex-partner and mother of three. Altman, on the other hand, was recently spotted driving a Koenigsegg Regera, a $1.9 million supercar.

**FTX Founder Loses Over $65 Billion in Assets Due to Exchange's Bankruptcy**
Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, lost over $65 billion in assets due to the exchange's bankruptcy. According to Sunil Kavuri, a representative of the largest group of FTX creditors, this amount would have been enough to make Bankman-Fried one of the richest people in the world if he had not filed for bankruptcy in late 2022. FTX's bankruptcy was caused by a combination of factors, including a CoinDesk investigation into the financial state of Alameda Research, a company affiliated with FTX, and a wave of withdrawals from the exchange. The investigation revealed that Alameda had direct access to customer funds, which were used for high-risk investments, and received preferential treatment on the FTX platform. In March 2024, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud, embezzlement of customer funds, and deceiving investors. The estimated value of FTX's assets includes $11 billion in Solana tokens, a $4.2 billion stake in Anthropic, and $3.2 billion in Sui tokens and a stake in Mysten Labs. Additionally, FTX could have been valued at $40 billion, considering its annual revenue of $1 billion and net profit of $400 million.
