**Israel 'will not cooperate' with Arab ministers' meeting to recognize Palestine**
An Israeli official, speaking anonymously to Efe, stated that 'Israel will not cooperate with measures that aim to harm the country and its security.' The official was referring to a planned meeting of Arab foreign ministers in Ramallah, led by Saudi Arabia's Faisal bin Farhan, to discuss the creation of a Palestinian state. The official claimed that 'this state would undoubtedly become a terrorist state in the heart of the Land of Israel.' The meeting is part of preparations for a conference on the two-state solution, scheduled for June at the United Nations headquarters in New York, led by France and Saudi Arabia. The current Israeli government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, opposes the creation of a Palestinian state and has taken measures to deepen the occupation and annexation of the West Bank.

**Arab Group at UN urges recognition of Palestine as 'step toward**
The Arab Group at the UN has urged countries to recognize Palestine as a step toward lasting peace. Mohamed Abushahab, the UAE's permanent representative to the UN, said, 'Recognition is not just symbolic, it is a step toward lasting peace.' The group praised countries that have already recognized Palestine, including Ireland, Norway, and Spain, and called on other nations to follow suit. The UN is set to hold a high-level conference on June 17 to discuss the two-state solution and end decades of conflict between Israel and Palestinians. Palestine's deputy permanent representative to the UN, Majed Bamya, said, 'It is enough for anybody to understand the human tragedy unfolding before our eyes.' He emphasized the need for full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2735, which calls for a ceasefire, the release of hostages and prisoners, and the massive delivery of humanitarian aid. Bamya also rejected any new aid distribution mechanism proposed by Israel, insisting on the UN plan that ensures equitable aid access throughout Gaza.

The majority of UN member and observer states have expressed their full support for the efforts made by Saudi Arabia and France to prepare for the conference.

**Macron: Recognizing a Palestinian State is a Moral and Political Obligation**
French President Emmanuel Macron stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is a moral and political obligation, according to Cairo News Channel. Macron emphasized that France will strengthen its stance on Israel if there is no progress in the humanitarian field. This statement comes in the context of a series of positions Macron has expressed over the past two years. In February 2024, Macron said that recognizing a Palestinian state is not forbidden for France, emphasizing the need to find a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Macron called for the reform and strengthening of the Palestinian Authority to enable it to exercise its responsibilities across all Palestinian territories, including the Gaza Strip. In April 2025, Macron announced France's intention to launch a series of recognitions of a Palestinian state and Israel during the United Nations conference in June, stating that this recognition should come at a useful moment, not as a response to emotional pressure.'

**Palestinian Ambassador Breaks Down in Tears at UN Security Council Meeting**
Palestinian Ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, broke down in tears during a UN Security Council meeting, saying 'The images of mothers holding their children's bodies, kissing their heads, and apologizing to them... these are images that cannot be tolerated.' He emphasized that more than 14 million Palestinians worldwide are suffering, and that 'fire and hunger are consuming Palestinian children.' Mansour rejected the suffering of Palestinian children at the hands of those who claim to be fighting barbarism. Four European countries, Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and Norway, have called for full UN membership for Palestine, considering it a necessary step towards a peaceful solution. They emphasized that the recognition of a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital is no longer a moral stance, but a 'political and diplomatic necessity' to end the long-standing impasse in the peace process and achieve security for both Palestinians and Israelis. The European countries also emphasized the importance of the upcoming international peace conference in June 2025, hosted by the UN, France, and Saudi Arabia, as a real opportunity to relaunch serious negotiations. This move comes as part of a growing wave of international recognition, with 147 countries out of 193 UN members officially recognizing the State of Palestine. However, major international powers, including the US and several members of the G7, continue to refuse official recognition, hindering Palestinian progress towards full UN membership. The call by European countries reflects a shift in Western attitudes towards the Palestinian issue, amidst ongoing Israeli military escalation in Gaza and the stalemate in the peace process.

**Spain, Norway, Ireland, and Slovenia Renew Support for Two-State Solution in Palestine and Israel**
Spain, Norway, Ireland, and Slovenia have renewed their support for the creation of two states in Palestine and Israel, one year after recognizing the Palestinians. In a statement from the Spanish Foreign Ministry, they recalled that at the Madrid+ Group meeting, these four countries reaffirmed their commitment to international efforts to implement the two-state solution. The statement noted that this commitment has had an undeniable impact on the international dynamics related to the conflict in Gaza, generating momentum for the implementation of the two-state solution after many years of stagnation. The statement also mentioned the creation of the Global Alliance to Implement the Two-State Solution in September 2024 at the United Nations, and the approval of the UN General Assembly resolution A/RES/79/81 on December 10, 2024, which called for a High-Level Conference for a Peaceful Solution to the Palestinian Question and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution. The conference will be held on June 17, 2025, under the auspices of the United Nations and will be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia. The statement concluded that it is the responsibility of the parties to bring peace to the region, but the international community has the obligation to alter the current dynamics on the ground that have created an endless cycle of violence and devastation. Meanwhile, students in Senegal protested and expelled the Israeli ambassador from the University of Dakar, and personalities and organizations in Brazil have demanded the rupture of diplomatic and commercial relations with Israel. The Brazilian government has been criticized for maintaining commercial relations with Israel despite its official declarations against the Israeli aggression in Gaza. The letter, organized by the entity Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, demands the implementation of military and energy embargoes against the Israeli government and the rupture of diplomatic and commercial relations with Israel. The letter has been signed by 113 individuals, six political parties, seven trade unions, 29 Arab and Palestinian organizations, and 89 civil society organizations in Brazil.

**Israel Vows to Build 'Jewish Israeli State' in West Bank Amid International Condemnation**
Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced on Friday (30) that Israel will build a 'Jewish Israeli state' in the occupied West Bank, a day after the government announced the creation of 22 new settlements in the Palestinian territory. The settlements are considered illegal under international law and are regularly condemned by the UN. Katz stated, 'This is a decisive response to terrorist organizations seeking to harm and weaken our control over this land - and also a clear message to (French President Emmanuel) Macron and his friends: you recognize a Palestinian state on paper, but we will build the Jewish Israeli state here in practice.' He added, 'The paper will be thrown in the trash of history, and the State of Israel will flourish and prosper.' The announcement comes as Macron declared on Friday that recognizing a Palestinian state 'is not just a moral duty, but a political necessity' ahead of a UN conference on the issue in June. Several countries, including Brazil, Spain, Ireland, Norway, Slovenia, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, have already recognized the Palestinian state.

**Emmanuel Macron Reiterates Need for Palestinian State Recognition**
French President Emmanuel Macron stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is 'not just a moral duty, but also a political necessity.' He also emphasized that Europeans should 'toughen up their collective position' against Israel, unless there is a response to the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Macron warned that if Israel does not allow humanitarian aid to reach Gaza, the EU will 'apply its rules,' which means ending processes that disregard human rights and imposing sanctions. Macron expressed hope that the Israeli government will change its position and listed conditions for recognizing a Palestinian state, including the release of hostages, demilitarization of Hamas, and recognition of Israel's right to live in security. Macron will defend this position at the international conference on the two-state solution, which France will co-chair with Saudi Arabia on June 17-20 at the UN in New York.

**Macron: Recognizing a Palestinian State is a 'Political Demand'**
French President Emmanuel Macron stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is not 'just a moral obligation, but a political demand' with certain conditions. Macron emphasized the need for Europeans to 'strengthen their collective stance' towards Israel, warning that if Israel does not respond to the humanitarian situation in Gaza within the next few days, the EU will 'apply its regulations' and impose sanctions. Macron also mentioned that he still has hope that the Israeli government will change its position and provide a humanitarian response. France, along with Saudi Arabia, will host an international conference on the two-state solution from June 17 to 30 at the UN headquarters in New York. Macron stated that the establishment of a Palestinian state is a 'political demand' and not just a 'moral obligation', without specifying whether he will recognize a Palestinian state. He listed the conditions for this, including the release of hostages held in Gaza, disarming Hamas, and excluding it from governing the Palestinian state, as well as recognizing Israel's right to live in safety and establishing a security presence in the region. Macron added that these conditions will be emphasized during the conference on June 18.

**Four European Countries Call for Global Support for Two-State Solution in Israeli-Palestinian Conflict**
Four European countries - Spain, Ireland, Norway, and Slovenia - have issued a joint statement reaffirming their commitment to a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The statement, made through their foreign ministries, reads: 'We reiterate our commitment to the principle of a two-state solution, where a Palestinian state, within internationally recognized borders, including Gaza and the West Bank, with East Jerusalem as its capital, can coexist with the State of Israel, and meet the legitimate national aspirations and security needs of both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.' The countries also praised the international community's commitment to the two-state solution, saying that it has 'irreversible effects on the international dynamics surrounding the Gaza conflict.' The statement also called on the international community to recognize the State of Palestine and to support a mutual recognition agreement between Israel and Palestine. The statement was made in the context of a UN conference scheduled to take place in June 2025, which the countries believe will provide a 'unique opportunity' for the two-state solution to be implemented. 'The international community has agreed to establish a Global Partnership for Implementing the Two-State Solution in September 2024,' the statement reads. 'We believe that the High-Level Conference to be held under the auspices of the United Nations and co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia on June 17, 2025, will not only be a unique opportunity for the highest level of international legitimacy, but also a suitable framework for the ultimate implementation of the two-state solution.' The statement also called on countries that have not yet recognized Palestine to do so, and to support Palestine's bid for full membership in the UN.

**Two More European Countries May Recognize Palestine's Independence**
According to Axios, two more European countries may declare Palestine's independence this summer. This statement is expected to be made on June 20 at an international summit organized by Saudi Arabia and France, with the participation of the UN. Malta has already established diplomatic relations with Palestine and supported a UN resolution on Palestine's full membership in the organization in 2024. Experts believe that Malta's upcoming statement may serve as a catalyst for other countries considering similar steps. Hamas has previously hailed such initiatives as a 'significant achievement', while Israel's Foreign Minister has strongly condemned them, calling them 'encouraging terrorism'. There is a high probability that Saudi Arabia will establish diplomatic relations with Palestine in the near future. So far, Norway, Ireland, Spain, Slovenia, and Armenia have recognized Palestine's independence in 2024. The League of Arab States has also adopted a declaration confirming the Palestinian people's right to create their own state in March 2025. Arab countries have called on Israel to stop military actions on the West Bank and to abandon plans to build new Jewish settlements, demolish Palestinian homes, and conduct operations in the Gaza Strip. Palestine declared its independence in 1988, and its status has been recognized by over 140 UN member states, including Russia, China, India, Brazil, Turkey, and others. However, the US, France, Germany, the UK, Australia, and Japan still do not recognize the Palestinian state.

**UN conference on two-state solution to Israel-Palestinian conflict set for June - Agencies**
An international conference to revive the two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict will take place at the United Nations headquarters in New York from June 17 to 20. The conference, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, aims to pave the way for more countries to recognize a full-blown Palestinian state. Currently, nearly 150 countries recognize the Palestinian Authority as the State of Palestine, but it is not a full member of the UN. French President Emmanuel Macron said that Paris could recognize a Palestinian state in the coming months, possibly at the June conference, stating 'Paris could recognize a Palestinian state in the coming months, possibly at the June conference.'

However, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government opposes a pathway to Palestinian statehood and has accused the Palestinian Authority of inciting to terrorism.

**UN to Host Conference on Two-State Solution in June**
Israel's military has announced the start of a new large-scale operation in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, the United Nations plans to hold an international conference in June to revive the idea of a two-state solution in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. The conference, scheduled for June 17-20 at the UN headquarters in New York, aims to pave the way for more countries to recognize a fully-fledged Palestinian state. Currently, around 150 countries recognize Palestine as a state, but it has only observer status at the UN. France's President Emmanuel Macron has hinted that France may recognize a Palestinian state during the UN conference, in exchange for other countries recognizing Israel. This comes after Ireland, Norway, and Spain recognized Palestine as a state in May 2024. 'It's a step in the right direction,' said a diplomat involved in the preparations, 'but it's a long way to go before we see a fully-fledged Palestinian state recognized by the international community.'

**France and Saudi Arabia to Host UN Conference on Two-State Solution**
A conference will be held in New York from June 17 to 20, sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, to discuss a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The conference is based on a UN General Assembly resolution passed in December and will be jointly sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia. Around 150 countries recognize Palestine as a state, but its membership in the UN is still incomplete as the Security Council has not voted to accept it as a full member. In May 2024, Ireland, Norway, and Spain recognized Palestine, but other European governments, including France, have not taken this step. French President Emmanuel Macron said in April that France may recognize a Palestinian state in June.

**UN Conference Aims to Resolve Israeli-Palestinian Conflict through Two-State Solution**
The United Nations General Assembly, in a December 2024 resolution, called for a high-level international conference in New York in June to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a two-state solution. The conference will be co-chaired by Paris and Riyadh, and aims to announce 'quick actions with irreversible deadlines' to recognize Palestine as a full-fledged state. Currently, almost 150 countries recognize Palestine as a state, but not as a full member of the United Nations. The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has expressed his desire to use the conference to initiate a series of recognition processes for Palestine, as well as for Israel by countries that have not yet done so. However, many Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Lebanon, have refused to normalize relations with Israel, citing the need for a sovereign and viable Palestinian state. The Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, strongly opposes this project.

**International Conference on Two-State Solution to be Held in New York**
A conference will be held in New York next month, from June 17 to 20, to discuss the two-state solution to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The conference, which will be co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia, will be organized by the United Nations General Assembly.

French President Emmanuel Macron said in April that France may recognize a Palestinian state in June. He also expressed his desire to organize a conference in New York to encourage recognition of Palestine and to urge Arab and Islamic countries to recognize Israel. The Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, strongly opposes this move.

**France Considers Recognizing Palestine in June**
French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Wednesday that France might recognize Palestine in June. Macron stated, 'We must move towards recognition, and therefore in the coming months, we will go.' He added, 'Our goal is somewhere in June, with Saudi Arabia, to preside over this conference where we could finalize this reciprocal recognition movement.' France will co-chair the conference with Saudi Arabia, which is scheduled to take place in New York. Macron had previously stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is not a taboo for France, and it is up to the Palestinians, whose aspirations have been trampled for too long. Currently, 147 out of 193 UN member states recognize Palestine. Several countries have officially recognized Palestine in 2024, including Norway, Ireland, and Spain.

**Five Arab Countries Announce International Conference on Palestine in June 2025**
Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia have announced their intention to actively participate in organizing an international conference on Palestine, scheduled for June 2025. The announcement came after a meeting between the foreign ministers of the five countries, held in Cairo, and marks a new diplomatic attempt to revive the peace process in the Middle East. The initiative, led by Saudi Arabia and France, aims to discuss the implementation of the two-state solution. The foreign ministers, along with the secretaries-general of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Arab League, have urged the international community and the United Nations Security Council to take concrete measures to implement the creation of an independent Palestinian state, identified as the key to addressing tensions in the region. This announcement comes in the context of strong diplomatic pressure to revive the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. The organization of the conference in June represents a further step towards consolidating a diplomatic process aimed at achieving a lasting stabilization of the region, with the active involvement of the main Arab actors and the international community.
