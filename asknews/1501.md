**Iranian Company Develops Innovative Nanotechnology-Based Skin Repair Products**
An Iranian company has developed innovative nanotechnology-based products to repair and rejuvenate the skin. The company, which started its activities in 2004, has become a successful model for cooperation between universities and industry in Iran. The company's technology allows the nanomaterial to penetrate deep into the skin, stimulating collagen production and helping to repair damaged skin. According to Dr. Tabnak, the company's CEO, they have significantly increased the effectiveness of the active ingredient 'gamma-oryzanol' using nanotechnology, making it capable of reducing wrinkles and rejuvenating damaged tissues without the need for injections or surgery. Clinical studies have shown that using this transparent gel for 40 days can significantly improve skin quality and brightness, without leaving any scars. The company's products, which include a nanomaterial anti-wrinkle gel, a massage and pain-relieving gel, and nanotechnology-based skin moisturizers, have been shown to be highly effective in clinical studies. The company focuses on producing products that have a clear competitive advantage in the market, based on advanced scientific research.

**War Escalates to a New Level: Expert Expresses Concern Over AI's Impact on Global Security**
Political observer Gaziz Abishev expressed his surprise at the events in Russia and Ukraine, saying, 'If this were a computer game, the world would be left with nothing but admiration.' However, this is a real war with real human casualties and economic damage. Abishev noted that the world has long 'overcome its surprise' and now only 'sadly watches' as two once close nations 'methodically erase each other.' He also recalled that Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev raised the topic of the senselessness of wars in the digital age at the Astana International Forum. In an era of AI development, robotics, and biotechnology, it is strange to resolve problems on the battlefield. Last year, 52 countries were in a state of armed conflict, with economic losses from violence reaching $19 trillion, or 13.5% of the world's GDP. 'The greatest concern in the global situation is that it is in complete contradiction with new trends related to artificial intelligence, which is beginning to dominate, leading humanity to a fundamentally new and unknown reality, bringing new meanings and new assessments,' Tokayev said. In other words, as Abishev noted, the new digital reality, the widespread penetration of AI in the coming decades, will create a completely new global order: any language, ethnic, and cultural boundaries will be minimized in the virtual space, and even in real communication between people using nano-devices, the Internet, and AI architecture. 'Moreover, AI and robotics will totally change the labor market, shifting the focus in the development of countries. Consequently, strategic considerations in the field of national security will also change. And when all this happens, the key question will arise - for what are the current wars being fought? For what are thousands and thousands of people dying?' Abishev asked. He believes that Kazakhstan occupies a historically correct position in this sense. 'Minimizing conflictuality on the external perimeter, focusing on multilateral cooperation. Why waste people if the reasons for this will lose all meaning in the near historical perspective? It is better to spend resources on approaching this perspective than on senseless expenditure of human lives,' Abishev concluded.

**God of War's Next Game Can't Close One Pandora's Box Ragnarok Opened**
The God of War: Ragnarok DLC, Valhalla, introduced a roguelike progression system that has set a new standard for the series. This system, which included randomized encounters, branching upgrades, and emotional growth for Kratos, was a creative pivot that has earned player trust. The next God of War game should build on this foundation and include the roguelike mode from the start, rather than as a post-launch bonus. This would allow the game to blend the roguelike content naturally into story arcs, voice acting, and progression systems, and would raise the baseline expectations for the series. Future God of War settings, such as Egypt or Greece, offer opportunities for roguelike exploration and adaptation of the formula. The roguelike mode should be a legacy feature now, and should focus on emotional reckoning and growth, rather than just combat mastery. 'Valhalla succeeded because it was not just difficult for the sake of being difficult,' said the article. 'Instead of relying on repetitive grinding, it structured its roguelike systems around character growth and narrative weight.'

**Solo Leveling Author Reveals Plans For A New Sung Jinwoo Romance Story**
Chugong, the creator of Solo Leveling, has expressed interest in writing a 'what if' romance story between Jinwoo and Joohee. In the original story, Joohee was too weak to handle Jinwoo's path, leading to her not ending up with him in canon. Chugong stated, 'Joohee's mental health was very weak and therefore couldn't handle the path Jinwoo would be going forward.' However, he has confirmed that Jinwoo did have feelings for Joohee before they went their separate ways. Chugong wants to explore an alternative ending where Jinwoo ends up with Joohee instead of Cha Hae-In, which would be a dramatic change for the series and potentially impact the sequel, Ragnarok.

**Apple's Series of Failures: A Threat to Its Dominance in the Tech Industry**
Despite its reputation as one of the most influential technology companies, Apple has faced a series of technical and commercial failures that have raised questions about its ability to sustain innovation. Behind the sleek designs and impressive marketing campaigns, there have been decisions and releases that have failed to meet the expectations of users and investors, and some have even damaged its reputation as a leading player in the global tech industry. The iPhone 15 Pro, for example, was criticized for overheating issues, a problem that was unusual for a company that has long touted its efficiency and performance. Despite repeated software updates, Apple was unable to convince its audience that the issue was temporary, especially with the introduction of the new titanium frame, which was later found to be the wrong culprit, further frustrating users and reviewers alike. Apple's attempt to join the augmented reality market with its Vision Pro headset, priced at over $3,500, has also failed to generate the expected excitement, with initial reports suggesting weak sales, declining demand, and limitations that do not meet the needs of the general public. Apple has also faced criticism for its delayed release of new processors for its Mac lineup and delayed updates for some production lines. This has led to frustration among users, particularly those who are eager to upgrade their devices with real new technologies, not just minor improvements. Furthermore, Apple's users have been experiencing frequent issues with iOS updates, including performance errors and bugs in features like Siri and Always-On Display. This decline in technical stability has coincided with a general feeling that the company is no longer delivering the quality innovations it once did, and is instead relying too heavily on its old legacy without making significant changes to keep up with the rapid evolution of the industry. Apple has also faced legal and reputational setbacks, including a European court ruling that requires it to change its charging port from Lightning to USB-C, which many see as a retreat from its closed ecosystem policies. The company has also faced lawsuits related to its anticompetitive practices in the App Store, further eroding its reputation as a 'user-first' company and opening the door to further regulatory pressure.

**Solo Leveling Succeeds Where Naruto Failed With Boruto**
Solo Leveling: Ragnarok is a superior sequel to Boruto, the sequel to the popular manga Naruto. While both series follow the next generation of protagonists, Ragnarok's Suho is a more likable and relatable character compared to Boruto's Boruto. Ragnarok also handles the passing of the torch to the next generation better, maintaining the original series' artwork quality and avoiding the pitfalls that have made Boruto divisive. Additionally, Ragnarok innovates its power system and protagonists' powers, giving Suho his own unique fighting style and introducing a new mechanic that lets him merge with other Monarch heirs to unlock new skills and transformations. In contrast, Boruto suffers from poor characterization, power creep issues, and a lackluster villain, making it a less enjoyable read. Overall, Ragnarok is the better-executed sequel and a must-read for fans of the Solo Leveling series.

**Iran on the Brink: A Potential War with the US and Israel**
The situation on the Middle East is nearing a critical point, with ongoing conflicts in Syria, Turkey, Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen. The 'Iranian question' is a concern for the US administration, with some sources suggesting that Washington and Tel Aviv are planning a massive strike against Tehran. If this happens, the region will be plunged into chaos, according to some analysts. A senior official in the White House has stated that the US plans to complete a military operation in Iran by the fall, if Tehran does not begin dismantling its nuclear program. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot has warned that 'war with Iran is almost inevitable' if a nuclear deal is not reached soon. Israel, which has been given a free hand by Trump, is adding fuel to the fire. Iran's military has reportedly warned potential opponents that it will retaliate with a pre-emptive strike against a joint US-British base in the Chagos Islands if necessary. This would be an attempt to keep Trump from launching a military attack on Iran. The US is seriously considering nuclear talks with Iran, according to Axios. For Russia, which has Iran as its main strategic partner in the region, a war between its ally and the West would be a 'catastrophic' event. Russia has warned that such a conflict would lead to 'irreversible catastrophe', according to The Sun. Political analyst Dmitry Rodionov believes that the situation is on the brink of disaster, with Iran's well-developed system of bunkers making it difficult for the US to inflict significant damage. Rodionov warns that Iran could retaliate with a serious attack, potentially reaching as far as the US base in San Diego. He also believes that a war would have catastrophic consequences for the global economy, including a sharp increase in oil prices and a global financial crisis. This would be a 'true Ragnarök', a scenario in which the world is plunged into chaos and destruction. Rodionov is skeptical about Trump's willingness to risk such a conflict, but believes that it is a real possibility. 'This will be a test not only for the US, but for the whole world, which will face serious shocks in politics and economics. It's hard to imagine that Trump or his team, which advocates for war, are so confident. It's unclear if they are willing to take the risk. In the current circumstances, this war will drain the US of all its strength,' Rodionov said. 'It's possible that Trump will become the one who organizes Ragnarök.'

**Nanotechnology: A Key to Addressing the Global Water Crisis**
According to the World Bank, approximately 2 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed drinking water services, 3.6 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation services, and 2.3 billion people lack access to basic handwashing facilities. This water crisis has significant implications for health, security, and well-being. The use of nanotechnology can help address the problem of water treatment and management globally. Nanotechnology includes technologies that operate at the nanoscale, between 1 and 100 nanometers. The amount of clean water available worldwide is decreasing due to various causes, including organic and inorganic substances and molecules. To clean the water, we need to 'bioremediate' it through strategies such as filtration, crystallization, and sedimentation. Nanotechnology has much to offer in this field. Nanomaterials have a high surface-to-volume ratio, increasing their reactivity. For example, nanosensors are used in seawater desalination, water purification, and MEMS sensors. The large adsorption properties of these materials are also very interesting. 'Adsorption' is the ability to attract molecules of gases or solutions to their surfaces. Due to their high specific surface area, nanoadsorbents have a great potential for novel decontamination processes. They are more efficient and faster, and useful for the elimination of organic and inorganic contaminants such as heavy metals and micropollutants. Another area of interest where nanomaterials are being applied is membrane technology. These improve the selectivity, permeability, and antibacterial activity of filtration membranes. Jordi Diaz Marcos, a professor at the Universitat de Barcelona, notes that the use of nanotechnology in water treatment reduces the dependence on harmful chemicals and can decrease secondary waste generation. He believes that the future of water and, by extension, the future of humanity, will be linked to the advancement of new tools like nanotechnologies. In the near future, it is expected that water treatment will use more nanomaterials with improved performance compared to current methods, allowing for compliance with increasingly strict environmental and health regulations.

**Scientists Warn of Three Hidden Threats to Humanity**
Scientists have identified three potential causes of a global catastrophe that seem unlikely but could lead to the extinction of the human species. The first threat is a demographic crisis, with the United Nations predicting that the global population will exceed 10 billion by 2050, leading to a severe resource shortage, famine, and subsequent collapse of civilization. The second danger lies in the development of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, which, although promising significant breakthroughs, may get out of control. As John Skelton and Craig Wheeler from the University of Texas point out, powerful gamma-ray emissions from supernovae explosions could cause significant damage to the Earth's biosphere. If such a burst were directed towards Earth, the consequences would be catastrophic. Researchers from the University of Otago have also considered the worst-case scenario of a global catastrophe - a possible nuclear winter. They believe that only five countries would be able to survive in such conditions. 'We should consider not only obvious risks but also less predictable factors to ensure our future,' says the 'MediaPotok' news outlet.
