**Is NCAA lifting ban on pro sports betting? Closer look at latest reports**
The NCAA may lift its ban on professional sports betting, according to sources. The current rules prohibit players and coaches from betting on professional sports, but the NCAA's Division 1 legislative board voted to adopt a legislation to deregulate the prohibition on wagering on professional sports. However, the ban on betting on college sports will remain in place. The NCAA has taken action against five Iowa State staff members who allegedly placed 6,200 online bets worth over $100,000 on professional and collegiate games. Matt Banker, a college athletics consultant, believes that lifting the ban will help in the 'cultural and philosophical recalibration for college athletics.' He also notes that point shaving and prop bets pose the 'biggest risk' to college sports, not pro sports gambling by a college player or coach.

**Report: NCAA considers lifting ban on pro sports betting**
The NCAA is considering lifting its ban on professional sports betting, according to Pat Forde of SI.com. The Division I Board of Directors has taken initial steps towards lifting the ban, which is pending before the Division I Council. If lifted, the ban would allow athletes, coaches, and staff to bet on pro sports, including football. This raises concerns for the NFL, as it may lead to college players gaining inside information through relationships with NFL players. Allowing betting on pro sports would also streamline NCAA enforcement efforts, focusing solely on whether college athletes bet on college sports.

**Betting Plagues English Football: A Growing Concern**
Betting has become a major issue in English football, with over 2 million people at risk of becoming addicted, according to the National Health Service (NHS). Despite rules in place, betting remains a significant problem, with many examples of players and teams being affected. The English Football Association (FA) has banned individuals involved in football from betting on competitions or related matters, and sharing privileged information to benefit bettors. Punishments for violating these rules can be severe, with cases such as Kynan Isaac, who was banned for 10 years for taking a yellow card on purpose, and Ivan Toney, who was suspended for 8 months for betting against his own team. The FA, the Betting Commission, and bookmakers work together to detect rule-breakers. In 2023, a study found that betting logos appeared up to 3,500 times in a single Premier League match, with an average of one appearance every 16 seconds. The Premier League has decided to ban betting sponsorships from the front of jerseys starting from the 2026/2027 season, but critics argue that this is like 'putting a band-aid on a broken leg' as betting logos can still appear on sleeves or advertisements. The solution to this problem seems to be long and complex, requiring education, harsh penalties, and the responsibility of clubs and federations to address the issue.

**Pete Rose: A baseball legend and a symbol of controversy - The Cincinnati Herald**
Pete Rose, a baseball legend and a symbol of controversy, holds the record for most base hits in baseball history with 4,256. However, his career was marred by numerous controversies, including a famous fight with Mets second baseman Bud Harrelson and a collision with Cleveland Indians catcher Ray Fosse in the 1970 All-Star game. Rose's thirst for winning at any cost ultimately led to his ban from baseball in 1989, after he accepted a lifetime ban for betting on baseball, including betting on the Reds. In his 2004 autobiography, 'My prison without bars,' Rose finally admitted to betting on baseball, but it was too late to reverse his ban.

**AP Sports SummaryBrief at 11:08 a.m. EDT**
The NFL has revised overtime rules and expanded replay assist, while the 'tush push' decision remains uncertain. The new overtime rules will give both teams a chance to possess the ball, even if the offense scores a touchdown on the opening drive. The proposal was amended to make overtime 10 minutes, not 15 minutes. Meanwhile, college basketball players are seeking mental health professionals to cope with increasing pressure. Coaches are expressing concerns about the transfer portal and the impact on the game's appeal. The US, Canada, and Mexico are jointly hosting the 2026 World Cup, but President Trump's tariff wars and '51st state' comments are causing loyalty debates, including one about NHL great Wayne Gretzky. Falcons coach Raheem Morris doesn't rule out trading Kirk Cousins but intends to keep him as the backup. The women's Final Four is full of top seeds and historic programs, with no Cinderellas in Tampa. The Boston Celtics are nearing the NBA record for 3s in a season, and lawmakers are considering giving college athletes a tax break on NIL earnings. Braves' Jurickson Profar has been suspended for 80 games without pay for performance-enhancing drug use.

**Fresno State University Suspends Basketball Players Under Suspicion Of Gambling**
Fresno State University's men's basketball team is under investigation for alleged betting activity. As a result, two top scorers, Jalen Weaver and Zaon Collins, have been suspended for at least one game, and another player, Mykell Robinson, has been removed from the team permanently. According to the NCAA, rules ban participation in sports betting activities and prohibit providing information to individuals involved in or associated with any type of sports betting activities. The NCAA conducted a 2023 survey of over 3,500 people aged 18-22 and found that 58% of respondents had participated in at least one sports betting activity. The American sports betting industry posted a record $13.71 billion in revenue for 2024, up from $11.04 billion in 2023. Fresno State University released a statement confirming the suspensions and removal, saying that the players are 'being withheld from competition as the university reviews an eligibility matter.'

**MLB Umpire Pat Hoberg Under Investigation for Alleged Sports Betting Involvement**
Major League Baseball (MLB) umpire Pat Hoberg has been suspended and is under investigation for allegedly participating in a sports betting scheme. Hoberg, who is known for his exceptional performance in the 2022 World Series, where he called 129 pitches correctly, has denied any involvement in betting on baseball games.

However, he has deleted some messages, which is currently a point of investigation. If found guilty, Hoberg could face a lifetime ban if he participated in betting on games he officiated, or a one-year ban if he did not participate.

**MLB Umpire Pat Hooper Fired for Sharing Betting Account with Friend**
Pat Hooper, a Major League Baseball (MLB) umpire, has been fired by the league for sharing a betting account with a friend and deleting messages that could be used as evidence in an investigation. The MLB office announced on February 4 that Hooper has been fired for violating the league's betting rules, and he will not be eligible to return to work until the 2026 Spring Camp. Hooper had been under investigation since last year for his involvement in sports betting and had been unable to participate in any games during the 2024 season. He had already received a notice of termination in May 2024 and appealed the decision. The MLB office stated that while they did not find any evidence that Hooper directly bet on games or attempted to manipulate the outcome, he failed to meet the high level of moral standards expected of an MLB umpire. Hooper shared a betting account with a professional poker player and friend who had bet on baseball 141 times, totaling around $214,000, and made a profit of $35,000. Hooper deleted messages with his friend that could have been used as evidence in the investigation, which the MLB office saw as an attempt to obstruct the investigation. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred stated that Hooper's actions were 'very inappropriate' and that he had a 'high level of moral responsibility' as an umpire. The MLB rulebook states that players, umpires, and officials who bet on games will be permanently banned, and those who bet on other sports will be suspended for one year. Hooper has accepted the decision and apologized for his actions, stating that he will not bet on baseball again.

**Federal Prosecutors Investigating NBA Star For Illegal Betting**
Former Toronto Raptors player Jontay Porter was banned from the NBA for life after violating the league's gambling policy. Porter had others place bets on himself and made sure the bets won by checking out of games with an injury. This incident led to a larger investigation into gambling and alleged game manipulation in pro sports, and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier is now under investigation. According to NBA spokesperson Mike Bass, the league was alerted to suspicious betting activity from a game against the New Orleans Pelicans in March 2023, but found no wrongdoing. However, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York is now investigating the matter, and the NBA is cooperating. Rozier has not been charged, but the league is taking a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to players gambling on themselves.

**Best Sports Betting Picks Today: NBA, NHL Predictions for January 29, 2025**
Jimmy Butler's indefinite ban from the Miami Heat has left the team facing a crucial matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Cavaliers will need leading scorer Donovan Mitchell to bounce back from his poor shooting performance in the previous meeting. Cleveland's Max Strus believes the team has the resiliency to bounce back, saying, 'When things don't go well, this group kind of takes things personal and has the resiliency to bounce back.' The Heat, led by Tyler Herro, will look to even the season series with Miami. The Cavaliers have lost three of their last four games and nine times overall, and will need to regroup to take on the conference-leading team.
