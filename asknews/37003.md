**Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory reports strong exports in Apr | Macau Business**
Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory reported its highest monthly export volume in the past 12 months, with nearly 30,000 vehicles exported in April. The success can be attributed to the popularity of the China-made Model Y in overseas markets, particularly in Australia and multiple Asian markets. In the Republic of Korea (ROK), the New Model Y sparked a buying frenzy, with Tesla's official website crashing due to overwhelming traffic and consumers lining up outside showrooms. Since the made-in-China Tesla vehicles went on sale in the ROK in late 2023, local market sales have surged, with total Tesla vehicle registrations jumping 80 percent year on year in 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, sales of Tesla vehicles in the Chinese mainland totaled 137,200 units, surpassing the figure of 132,800 units in the same period of 2024. The Shanghai Gigafactory delivered over 172,000 Model 3 and upgraded Model Y vehicles in Q1 of 2025, with deliveries exceeding 78,800 vehicles in March 2025, a 156 percent increase from February.

**Global Electric Vehicle Market Grows Strongly, China Leads the Way**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) released a report on May 14, 2025, titled 'Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2025'. The report states that despite global economic uncertainty, the electric vehicle market is growing strongly. It is expected that by 2025, global electric vehicle sales will exceed 20 million units, accounting for over a quarter of new car sales. China continues to lead the market, with over 11 million electric vehicles sold in 2024, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic new car sales. Emerging markets in Asia and Latin America are also growing rapidly, with year-on-year growth exceeding 60%. The IEA predicts that if countries fulfill their energy and climate commitments, electric vehicles will account for over 40% of global new car sales by 2030. Additionally, Tesla's Shanghai Super Factory has achieved a new high in export volume, with over 30,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles exported in April. Ford will recall over 273,789 vehicles in the US due to a brake failure issue, while Waymo will recall nearly 1,200 autonomous taxis in the US to update software to prevent collisions with obstacles.

**Tesla (TSLA) Chinese deliveries dropped to a scary low level**
Tesla's deliveries in China have dropped to a low level, with only 3,070 vehicles delivered last week, a 69% decrease from the same week last year. Despite ramping up production of the new Model Y, demand for the updated vehicle is lower than expected. Tesla's exports from China are also down, and the company is struggling to compete with rapidly growing Chinese automakers. According to insurance registration data, Tesla's deliveries in China are significantly below 2024 levels, and the company's profit margins in the country are already thin, with Tesla making about $3,000 per car without discounts or incentives. Tesla has extended its 0% financing offer through June 30 to try to boost sales, but these current levels of 3,000-7,000 EV deliveries per week are not sustainable.

**People Are Betting That Tesla's Deliveries In The Ongoing Q2 Will Crash By 20 Percent**
According to betting platform Kalshi, Tesla is expected to deliver 355,000 EVs in Q2 2025, a 20% decline from the 443,956 units delivered in Q2 2024. This would be a significant drop in sales momentum, despite Tesla's efforts to boost sales with incentives such as zero percent financing for the new Model Y. Gary Black from Future Fund notes that cheaper models will not expand Tesla's total addressable market (TAM) and will eat into its margins. Tesla's biggest bet is on autonomy, with plans to launch unsupervised FSD on the Model Y in Austin, Texas, and roll out the service to multiple US cities by the end of 2025.

**Tesla China Sales Are Tumbling. TSLA Doesn't Care.**
Tesla's vehicle insurance registrations in China plummeted by 58% last week, marking a 69% decline compared to the same period last year. This is the lowest weekly reading since January. Tesla's China sales have been declining, with a 25% drop compared to the same period last year and a 5.5% drop so far in 2025. The decline comes despite the U.S. and China agreeing to temporarily slash tariffs, with the U.S. cutting its 145% Trump tariff on most Chinese imports to 30%. Analysts expect global Tesla vehicle deliveries to decline 2.6% to 1.74 million in 2025, with some estimates suggesting deliveries might struggle to reach 375,000 in Q2. Tesla has introduced cheap financing for the new Model Y in China and the U.S. to boost sales.

**Tesla's Stock Price Surges as Global Sales Plummet**
Tesla's stock price surged over 4% to $347.68 on May 14, surpassing the $1 billion mark. However, the company's global sales have plummeted, with 336,700 vehicles delivered in the first quarter of 2025, a 13% decline from the same period last year. According to the Daily Economic News, Tesla's first-quarter production and sales decline were mainly due to weak demand for its main models, Model 3 and Model Y. Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, has stated that the company plans to begin testing its Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. However, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has announced plans to investigate Tesla's Robotaxi system, citing concerns over its ability to respond to reduced visibility on roads. Industry insiders believe that Tesla's reliance on camera-based pure vision technology is a major factor in its frequent assisted driving accidents. Tesla's Robotaxi system has been criticized for its lack of laser radar and other advanced sensors, making it less effective in low-light conditions. According to a report by the Observer Network, Tesla's FSD system has a higher accident rate than industry leaders, with a rate of 0.21 per 100 million miles in 2023, compared to 0.31 in 2022. In contrast, Waymo's autonomous vehicles have a rate of 1 in 85,000 miles in California city environments. Tesla's statistics are based on L2-level assisted driving with human supervision, while Waymo operates a fully autonomous L4-level service. The differing approaches to autonomous driving technology reflect the challenges faced by Robotaxi developers in various markets. Tesla's gradual approach, starting with L2-assisted driving and using pure vision technology, is in contrast to the more comprehensive sensor configurations used by Waymo and other 'crossing' companies. According to a Goldman Sachs report, Tesla's Robotaxi fleet is expected to expand from 300 vehicles in 2026 to 1,500 by the end of 2027, with each vehicle completing 15-20 services per day and earning an average of $2.5 per mile. However, Tesla must first submit a statement to the NHTSA on the safety of its FSD software and Robotaxi service by June 19, 2025, or risk further delays in its trial operation.

**Tesla's Shanghai Factory Reports Record Export Volumes in April**
Tesla's Shanghai factory reported a significant increase in exports in April, with nearly 30,000 units shipped, marking its highest monthly export volume in the past 12 months, according to company sources. This achievement comes as the Model Y made in China gains popularity in international markets. The new Model Y, which debuted globally in China in January, is now exported to Australia and multiple Asian markets, including South Korea, said Tesla. The company's first-quarter earnings report revealed that the new Model Y helped Tesla achieve a record-breaking number of single-day orders in the Asia-Pacific market after its launch. In South Korea, the new Model Y sparked a buying frenzy on the day orders opened, with Tesla's website experiencing a brief outage due to the sudden surge in traffic, while Korean buyers lined up outside dealerships in large numbers. Since Tesla's vehicles made in China first went on sale in South Korea at the end of 2023, the company has seen a dramatic increase in sales, with total Tesla vehicle registrations in the neighboring country surging 80% in 2024 compared to the previous year. In the first quarter of 2025, Tesla's sales in mainland China totaled 137,200 units, surpassing the 132,800 in the same period of 2024, according to Tesla China. The Shanghai factory delivered over 172,000 updated Model 3 and Model Y vehicles between January and March 2025. The data also shows that in March of this year, the factory's deliveries exceeded 78,800 vehicles, a 156% increase from the 30,688 delivered in February.

**Best EV & AV Stocks to Electrify Your Portfolio Now**
The electric vehicle (EV) and autonomous vehicle (AV) industries are experiencing a historic shift, with global sales of EVs expected to grow 19.2% this year, reaching 21.3 million units. By 2030, EVs could make up over 40% of global light vehicle sales, and by 2040, over 80%. Rivian Automotive, BYD Co Ltd, and NIO Inc are leading the charge, with Rivian's R2 mid-size SUV expected to start at $45,000, and BYD's Blade Battery tech promising fast charging and long range. NIO's battery swap technology is also a standout feature, with over 3,200 swap stations deployed. BYD has emerged as Tesla's fiercest rival, with over 416,000 battery electric vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2025. The company's deep vertical integration and control over batteries, semiconductors, and vehicle assembly keep costs low in the competitive EV market. BYD's vehicle lineup is wide-ranging, from budget-friendly models to high-end Yangwang models, and the company is making inroads on the autonomous front with its 'God's Eye' driver-assist system. BYD is building plants in several countries and expanding its sales into new markets.

**Tesla's Sales Plummet, Employees Call for Elon Musk to Step Down**
Tesla's sales have plummeted globally, with a 13% year-on-year decline in the first quarter of 2025, delivering 336,700 vehicles. The company's main model, Model 3/Y, accounted for 95% of total sales, with 323,800 units delivered, a 12% decline from the same period last year. In contrast, the Cybertruck and other new models only sold 12,800 units, less than some domestic brands. Tesla's sales in Europe and China have been severely affected, with a 36% year-on-year decline in Europe and a 50% decline in China. The company's market share in Europe has fallen from 1.8% to 1%. Tesla's internal problems, including a lack of product iteration and a decline in brand image, have been exacerbated by external factors such as political risks and declining subsidies. The company's employees have publicly criticized Elon Musk, calling for him to step down. The employees' open letter stated that Tesla's sales have declined by 9% in the US market, while the overall electric vehicle market has grown by 10%. The company's production lines have been shut down for a week, and employees have been told to take a week's leave. The employees' open letter has sparked concerns about Tesla's corporate culture and internal governance. The company's future is uncertain, with some analysts predicting that it will struggle to maintain its market value. Tesla's low-priced car, automatic driving, and robotaxi technologies may be the company's lifeline, but they may also be the final nail in its coffin.

**Tesla Falls Short with 336,000 Deliveries, Raising Analyst Doubts**
Tesla's Q1 2025 electric vehicle deliveries fell short of expectations, with 336,000 vehicles delivered, compared to the consensus expectation of 377,592. This discrepancy has raised questions about the capabilities of analysts who monitor Tesla, as many seem to have misjudged the company's operational performance. Several analysts have released notes to clients, but many have opted to cling to their projected estimates despite their significant misjudgment. The situation becomes more complicated considering the role of Cantor Fitzgerald, a firm with a vested interest in Tesla and connections to Elon Musk, which raises concerns over the impartiality of their analyses. Critics highlight that certain financial institutions, like Truist, appear to still buy into Musk's ambitious claims regarding self-driving technology, while Goldman Sachs notably overestimated Tesla's deliveries by an astounding $2 billion in revenue projections. For the past 15 years, analysts have struggled to predict Tesla's performance accurately, indicating a broader issue within financial analyses related to high-profile tech-driven companies.

Tesla plans to release its Q1 2025 financial report on April 22, 2025. The company stated that despite losing several weeks of production time due to the Model Y production line conversion at four factories, the production of the new Model Y is progressing as planned. Analysts had expected Tesla to deliver 377,592 vehicles in Q1 2025, with Bloomberg predicting 390,000 units. However, Tesla's actual delivery volume fell short of market expectations. As a result, Tesla's stock price plummeted over 8% after the announcement.

**Tesla Faces Disappointing Q1 Delivery Forecast for 2025 - Softonic**
Tesla's Q1 delivery forecast for 2025 is expected to be 377,592 electric vehicles, a significant drop from initial predictions of over 450,000 deliveries. The decline is attributed to the ongoing design changeover for the Model Y, reduced sales of the Model 3 by nearly 30%, and the slow rollout of the Cybertruck. Analysts speculate that Tesla's brand image may also be suffering, which could become clearer in the upcoming Q2 and Q3 periods. According to analysts, the company has been forced to reintroduce 0% financing offers for the Model 3 in the U.S. market to boost sales, further highlighting its struggles. 'The transition to the new design has forced Tesla to shift production at four of its factories, causing a bottleneck in deliveries,' said analysts. 'While the company has maintained delivery levels in China, this has come at the cost of reduced gross margins, as heightened competition impacts its pricing power.'

Tesla, the US-based electric vehicle company founded by Elon Musk, produced 362,615 vehicles and delivered 336,681 vehicles in the first quarter of 2025, in addition to distributing 10.4 GWh of energy storage products. This represents a decline in deliveries compared to 386,810 units last year (-13%) and a value lower than analysts' expectations (they expected Tesla to record deliveries of around 372,410 vehicles, according to a Visible Alpha estimate). According to a statement, 'While the Model Y production line change at all four of our facilities resulted in the loss of several weeks of production in the first quarter, the New Model Y continues to do well.'

However, actual numbers may fall even below these projections. The author's initial base case forecasted 321,000 deliveries, but has since revised it to 346,000 units, with a ±17,500 uncertainty range. The forecast is based on national sales data and takes into account the impact of the Model Y retooling, political backlash in certain markets, and other European and Rest of World (RoW) markets.

**GLJ Research Lowers Tesla's Q1 2025 Delivery Forecast, Citing Potential Disappointment**
GLJ Research has lowered its forecast for Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) first-quarter 2025 deliveries to 352,700 vehicles, a 9.6% decrease from the current consensus of 390,300 and a decline from the 386,800 vehicles delivered in the first quarter of 2024. According to GLJ Research, 'We previously generally estimated TSLA deliveries for 1Q 2025 in the range of 360,000-370,000 units.' However, after updating their estimates, the company now expects lower deliveries, indicating potential disappointment with market expectations. Looking beyond the first quarter, GLJ Research also believes that the consensus forecasts for Tesla's deliveries in 2025 are overestimated. The firm predicts deliveries of 1.628 million vehicles in 2025, a 13% decrease from the current consensus of 1.872 million and the total number of vehicles delivered last year. If this forecast is realized, it would mean two years of negative growth for Tesla, which is 'traded at a P/E ratio of 96.2 to its forecasted non-GAAP EPS in 2025, compared to 20.7 for the S&P 500.' GLJ Research notes that investors will closely watch regional trends in Tesla's deliveries in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region, where demand trends may determine the trajectory of the stock. However, given the already elevated expectations, GLJ Research questions whether there is enough 'embedded in the price' to account for Tesla's slowing growth before tomorrow's delivery report.
