**Musk: Chances of Starship Flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50**
Elon Musk said that the chances of Starship flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50. The spacecraft has already completed nine test flights, with the last one taking place on May 27. However, the mission ended in an emergency due to a fuel leak. The previous flights in January and March also ended in failure, with the spacecraft exploding within the first 10 minutes of flight. Despite this, Musk is optimistic about the progress made and believes that the data collected will help improve the spacecraft. The next version of Starship, Version 3, is expected to be 124.4 meters tall and will be capable of flying to Mars. The spacecraft will be reusable and will have a refueling system on orbit, which is necessary for long-distance space travel. The first flight of this version is planned for the end of this year, and if successful, Starship may fly to Mars as early as next year. SpaceX plans to send five Starship Version 3 spacecraft to Mars in 2026 to test the spacecraft and its technologies. However, Musk believes that it will be challenging to achieve this goal, citing the need to master the refueling of Starship in space as the main problem. He estimates the chances of success as 50/50. If successful, SpaceX plans to send around 20 spacecraft to Mars in 2028-2029, which may be crewed. However, Musk also suggests that two robotic landings may be conducted before sending humans. The final decision will be made later. In the third launch window (2030-2031), up to 100 Starship spacecraft may be sent to Mars, and in the next window (2033), up to 500. SpaceX is currently searching for a suitable location for a Martian city, which should be relatively far from the poles, have access to water ice, and have a flat surface for landings and takeoffs. The main candidate is the Arcadia Planitia region. The ultimate goal is to create a self-sufficient settlement on Mars with a population of over a million people, which will require transporting millions of tons of cargo. According to Musk, the construction and maintenance of such a city will be carried out using Starship, possibly its future 142-meter version. During periods of Earth-Mars alignment, thousands of upper stages of the spacecraft will be able to arrive and depart.

**Elon Musk's Ambitious Plan to Colonize Mars with SpaceX**
Elon Musk has provided new details on his ambitious project to colonize Mars with SpaceX. Despite the challenges of developing the Starship, Musk remains optimistic about his ability to transform his visions into reality. The latest version of the Starship, version 3, is expected to be launched in 2026 and will be capable of carrying out missions to Mars. The Starship will be equipped with a new engine, the Raptor 3, which will allow it to carry a payload of approximately 40 tons. The spacecraft will also be designed to withstand the harsh Martian atmosphere. Musk has stated that the primary challenge to overcome is the ability to refuel in orbit, but if successful, SpaceX plans to send approximately 20 Starship to Mars between 2028 and 2029, with some missions potentially carrying humans. 'If these first missions succeed and land successfully, we will send humans during the next launch window and begin building the infrastructure on Mars,' Musk explained. The ultimate goal is to establish a human settlement on Mars and create a new society with its own values and institutions. However, this raises questions about governance and property rights in space. Musk's vision is to 'transform science fiction into reality' as quickly as possible.

**Elon Musk's Plan to Colonize Mars: 2026 the Key Year**
Elon Musk has revealed his plan to colonize Mars, with the first unmanned flight of the Starship spacecraft to the red planet expected to take place in late 2026. The mission will transport robots humanoides Optimus, developed by Tesla, to Mars. Musk aims to send the first human missions to Mars in the second or third landing, with the goal of establishing a permanent and self-sufficient human settlement on the planet. To achieve this, SpaceX estimates that it will require between 1,000 and 2,000 launches of Starship every 26 months, coinciding with the optimal alignment between Earth and Mars. Musk has calculated that there is a 50% chance that Starship will be ready for the 2026 window. If not, the company will wait until the next window in 2028. Musk has been interested in colonizing Mars since the 1990s and has invested billions of dollars in developing space technology to make humanity a multi-planetary species.

**Elon Musk targets 2026 for first space mission to Mars**
Elon Musk aims to launch the first space mission to Mars by the end of 2026, but acknowledges that overcoming technological hurdles, particularly in-orbit refueling, is crucial for the long journey. A favorable planetary alignment in late 2026 provides a unique opportunity for a relatively short transit between Earth and Mars. If Starship is not ready by then, a new mission in 2028 would be targeted. The first mission would consist of -built Optimus humanoid robots. Despite failed test flights, including a fuel leak and uncontrolled spinning on the ninth test flight, Musk remains optimistic, citing each failure as valuable data for accelerated testing. NASA relies on Starship for its Artemis program, which aims to send astronauts to the moon as early as 2027, a stepping stone to possible human missions to Mars in the 2030s. Musk's ultimate vision is to launch up to 2,000 Starships every two years to establish a permanent and self-sustaining human settlement on Mars.

**Kosmos 482: Soviet Spacecraft Falls to Earth After 53 Years in Orbit**
The Soviet spacecraft Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 as part of the Venera program, re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and fell into the Indian Ocean on Saturday, ending its 53-year journey in orbit. According to Roscosmos, the impact occurred about 560 kilometers west of the Middle Andaman Island. 'The device ceased to exist when it left its orbit and fell into the Indian Ocean,' the Russian space agency confirmed, adding that the event was controlled through automated alert systems to prevent risks in inhabited areas. The mission was intended to study the atmosphere and surface of Venus, but it failed to reach the planet due to a malfunction in the fourth stage of the Molnia-M rocket. The spacecraft's descent capsule, made of titanium and designed to withstand extreme temperatures, remained trapped in an elliptical orbit around the Earth. Despite its failure as a scientific mission, Kosmos 482 survived in space for over half a century, being monitored by international agencies and satellite tracking enthusiasts. The NASA had warned that the robust design of the capsule made it likely that fragments would resist re-entry. 'The device was detected in orbit at 6:04 UTC and was no longer there at 7:32. That is, it fell,' explained astronomer Claudio Martínez, who followed the episode with attention. 'We hope that in the next few hours there will be some video of the event or witnesses describing the fall,' he added. The spacecraft was equipped with measurement instruments to study particle flows, temperature, pressure, gamma spectrometry, and photometry, but none of these were used. Kosmos 482 was also a symbol of another era, marked by the space race between the USSR and the United States. However, its re-entry sparked a current alarm: space debris. According to the European Space Agency, there are over 50,000 large objects orbiting the Earth, and the possibility of uncontrolled impacts generates growing concern. 'Its story illustrates how past technologies can become present problems,' they noted from an ESA report. The impossibility of predicting with precision the impact location and the growing volume of space debris force a rethink of orbit monitoring and control systems. A capsule with Soviet heritage, Kosmos 482 was part of the Venera program, which achieved milestone after milestone in the exploration of Venus. Its twin, Venera 8, landed on the planet in 1972. But this capsule remained as an unfulfilled promise, a lost link that finally closed its cycle on May 11, 2025. And although its fall did not generate reported victims or damage, the episode reinforces an urgent debate: how to manage the legacy of space missions that did not conclude as planned, but continue to gravitate - literally and symbolically - around the Earth.

**Elon Musk's Ambitious Plan to Colonize Mars: 5 to 500 Starships by 2033**
Elon Musk plans to send five Starships to Mars in 2026, followed by a drastic increase in the number of launches, with 20 ships in 2028, 100 in 2030, and 500 in 2033. According to Musk, this plan is a crucial step in colonizing Mars. As Musk said, 'It's a very ambitious plan, but I think it's necessary to make humanity a multi-planetary species.' However, some people are skeptical about the feasibility of this plan, questioning whether it's a point of inflection for humanity or just a sign of Musk's mental detachment.

**Elon Musk Aims to Launch Starship to Mars Next Year**
Elon Musk plans to launch a Starship to Mars next year, with the goal of establishing a permanent human presence on the planet. The first Starships will be launched in 2026, carrying robots, including Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots. Musk estimates a 50% chance of success for the 2026 mission. The next step will be to send 20 Starships to Mars between 2028 and 2029, with humans on board. The ultimate goal is to launch 100 Starships to Mars, with 500 more following in 2033. Musk acknowledges the challenges ahead, but believes that each launch brings the company closer to its goal of making humanity a multi-planetary species. 'Supposing the first missions are successful and land safely, we will send humans on the next mission and really start building the infrastructure on Mars,' Musk said. The SpaceX has already identified a potential location for the first human colony on Mars, Arcádia Planitia, a volcanic plain in the northern hemisphere of the planet.

**Soviet Spacecraft Part Likely Enters Earth's Atmosphere**
The European Space Agency (ESA) announced that a part of the Soviet-era spacecraft Kosmos 482, which has been orbiting the Earth for over 50 years, has likely entered the Earth's atmosphere. Launched in 1972 to study Venus, the spacecraft failed to leave Earth's orbit and has been in pieces for decades. The ESA's Space Situational Awareness (SSA) reported that a part of the spacecraft, believed to be the re-entry system, entered the atmosphere on Saturday at 09:16 UTC. It is unclear whether the part crashed to the ground or burned up in the atmosphere. Stijn Lemmens from the ESA said, 'The likelihood of you being affected by this space debris is lower than winning the lottery.' The spacecraft's re-entry capsule was designed to withstand the high temperatures and pressures of Venus' atmosphere. Experts believe that the capsule may have survived the uncontrolled descent. Lemmens noted that human-made objects frequently enter the Earth's atmosphere, with large spacecraft entering the atmosphere once a week and smaller ones daily. These objects usually burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground. The regions with the highest risk of impact include the Middle East, Central Asia, and South Eastern Europe, including Turkey.

**Soviet-era spacecraft 'likely' to have re-entered Earth's atmosphere**
A fragment of the Soviet-era spacecraft Kosmos 482, which has been orbiting Earth for over 50 years, is 'likely' to have re-entered the atmosphere on Saturday, according to the European Space Agency. The agency's senior analyst, Stijn Lemmens, said, 'It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris.' The lander capsule, designed to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, may have survived the uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere. However, the parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent, is likely to have degraded over time. Lemmens noted that re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs frequently, with bigger spacecraft re-entering weekly and smaller ones daily. Objects typically burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground. The European Space Agency is closely tracking the object and is advocating for future spacecraft to be designed for controlled re-entries to reduce the risk of debris impacting populated areas and protect the environment.

**Soviet Spacecraft Kosmos 482 to Re-enter Earth's Atmosphere after 53 Years**
A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos 482, is expected to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere on May 10, 2025, after 53 years in space. Originally designed for a mission to Venus, the spacecraft was damaged by a rocket malfunction and has been orbiting the Earth since 1972. Due to its robust construction, experts believe that Kosmos 482 may be able to withstand re-entry and land intact on the Earth's surface. The spacecraft's heat shield, made of titanium, was designed to withstand extreme temperatures and atmospheric pressure, which is almost 100 times higher than on Earth. According to Space, various space agencies predict the re-entry will occur around 8am local time on May 10, with a possible deviation of up to 9 hours. The exact impact site is unknown, but the risk of harm to humans is considered extremely low, with a probability of 0.4 to 10,000. However, the spacecraft's impact speed of approximately 240 km/h could still cause significant damage if it lands on inhabited areas. Kosmos 482 was part of the Soviet Venera program, which achieved several milestones in the exploration of Venus, including the first soft landing on another planet in 1970.

**Russian Spacecraft to Re-enter Earth's Atmosphere: What are the Risks?**
A Russian spacecraft, Kosmos 482, weighing around 500 kg, is expected to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere between May 10th and 12th, after being in orbit for over 50 years. The spacecraft, a 1-meter diameter sphere, was part of a mission that failed to leave Earth's orbit due to launch failures. According to scientist Marco Langbroek, the re-entry will occur at a speed of 150 mph (242 km/h) if the spacecraft remains intact. Langbroek states that, despite the risks, the event is relatively common and there is no reason for panic. He compares the situation to a random meteorite impact, which occurs frequently throughout the year. 'The chances of being hit by this piece of space junk are small, much smaller than being hit by lightning,' Langbroek said. The spacecraft was designed to withstand the extreme conditions of Venus' atmosphere, but its parachute system, originally intended for descent on Venus, is likely to be inoperable after over five decades in space. The spacecraft's trajectory may take it to fall anywhere between 51.7° north and south latitude, covering a large area, including densely populated regions like London and southern South America. However, as most of the planet is covered in water, it is more likely to fall into the ocean. Although the risk of damage is considered low, the event highlights the growing concern about space debris control. According to Stijn Lemmens, of the European Space Agency, re-entry of human-made objects occurs frequently, but most of the time these objects burn up in the atmosphere. 'We are becoming increasingly aware of the need to design spacecraft to return to Earth in a controlled manner, minimizing the risk of impact in populated areas,' Lemmens said.

**Soviet Spacecraft Kosmos 482 Expected to Re-enter Earth's Atmosphere**
A part of the Soviet spacecraft Kosmos 482, launched approximately half a century ago to reach Venus, is expected to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere this week. Experts predict that the re-entry will occur in mid-May. Although the exact part of the spacecraft that will re-enter the atmosphere is unknown, scientists believe it is likely to be the descent capsule. This capsule was designed to withstand the high temperatures and intense pressure of Venus, so it may also withstand the Earth's atmosphere. Dr. Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrofizik Merkezi notes that if the re-entering part is indeed the capsule, it may survive to the ground due to its heat shield. However, McDowell also warns that the likelihood of a collision is low, but 'you wouldn't want it to fall on your head.' The Kosmos 482 spacecraft was launched in 1972 as part of the Soviet Union's Venus exploration program, but it failed to leave Earth's orbit and head towards Venus. Another spacecraft from the same mission successfully reached Venus and sent data for approximately 50 minutes. The re-entering part is believed to be the descent capsule, which is a sturdy and dense part of the spacecraft. According to the American Aerospace Corporation, the likelihood of the capsule causing harm to humans is 1 in 25,000. Many old rocket parts and space debris enter the atmosphere every year, and most of them break apart and disintegrate. However, the Kosmos 482 capsule may be able to withstand this disintegration due to its durable design. Marco Langbroek, an expert on space traffic at Delft Technical University, notes that the exact location of the capsule's re-entry is difficult to predict and that a wide area is at risk, including parts of Africa, South America, Australia, the US and Canada, as well as various regions in Europe and Asia. However, since most of the Earth's surface is covered in oceans, the likelihood of the capsule landing in the ocean is higher. Experts warn that if the capsule lands on land, no one should approach it, as it may contain hazardous and toxic materials. Parker Wishik of the Aerospace Corporation notes that, according to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, the ownership of the re-entering spacecraft still belongs to the country of origin, in this case Russia. Russia may attempt to retrieve the wreckage. Wishik also emphasizes the importance of taking measures to prevent space debris: 'Everything you send into space can come back to you decades later.'

**More than 50 years after trying to reach Venus, a failed Soviet spacecraft is about to return to Earth**
A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 as part of the Venera program, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere on May 10. The spacecraft, designed to withstand Venusian conditions, may survive re-entry due to its titanium body. The lander had a refrigeration system, heat shield, and parachute to slow it down, but these have failed. The spacecraft's re-entry will be uncontrolled, but its design may allow it to survive. This is not the first time a spacecraft has re-entered Earth's atmosphere, but it is a rare occurrence for a lander to potentially survive. The re-entry of Kosmos 482 is not a cause for concern, as it is not a threat to human safety. Instead, it highlights the issue of space junk and the environmental impacts of space debris.

**Soviet Spacecraft Expected to Re-enter Earth's Atmosphere on May 10**
A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos-482, is expected to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere on May 10, according to CNN. The spacecraft, which was launched in 1972 but failed to reach Venus due to a malfunction, may pose a small threat to human life if its heat shield survives re-entry. The spacecraft was designed to duplicate the Venus-8 mission, but it was left in a low Earth orbit after a rocket malfunction. As the spacecraft re-enters the atmosphere, scientists are concerned that it may bring with it a descent module intended for landing on Venus. 'A fragment of the Soviet spacecraft that failed to reach Venus over 50 years ago is expected to fall to Earth this week,' said the CNN article. 'The descent module, which could potentially protect the spacecraft from burning up in the atmosphere, poses a small but real threat to human life,' it added.

**Soviet Spacecraft 'Kosmos 482' to Re-enter Earth's Atmosphere**
A Soviet-era spacecraft, 'Kosmos 482', is expected to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and crash to the ground around May 9-10, 2025. The spacecraft was launched in 1972 but failed to reach Venus due to a malfunction. Despite the uncertainty of the exact re-entry time and location, experts believe that the lander module will survive the heat of the atmosphere and land intact. Marco Langbroek, a Dutch satellite observer, notes that the risks are not high, but not zero either, comparing them to a meteorite impact. The module is expected to enter the atmosphere at a speed of around 242 km/h and could land anywhere between 52°N and 52°S latitude. Given that 71% of the Earth's surface is water, it is likely that the spacecraft will land harmlessly in an ocean, causing no damage or harm to humans.

**Venus Mission: A Hypothetical Journey to Our Neighboring Planet**
The European Space Agency (ESA) is planning a mission to the planet Venus in 2031, called EnVision. The unmanned spacecraft will study the outer atmosphere and core of the planet. Berlin-based Professor Dr. Boris Bigalke has written a book about a hypothetical manned mission to Venus, which he believes could be feasible due to the planet's proximity to Earth and similar gravity. However, the extreme temperatures and pressure on the surface of Venus pose significant challenges. Bigalke suggests that a 'schwebende Habitate' (floating habitat) could be a solution, floating 50 kilometers above the surface and providing more favorable conditions. Johann-Dietrich Wörner, former ESA Director-General, also believes that a manned mission to Venus could be worthwhile, despite the biological and technical challenges.

**Venus Life Finder Mission: A New Era in Exploring the Planet's Clouds**
In 2025, the Venus Life Finder mission, a program designed to search for signs of life in the clouds of Venus, is expected to begin. The mission is supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Rocket Lab USA Inc. According to Antígona Segura Peralta, a researcher at the Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), this is the first phase of a series of expeditions focused on the astrobiology of Venus that will last until 2041. The exploration is planned for the first months of 2025 and will start with the launch of the Electron rocket from Rocket Lab, which will deploy the Photon spacecraft near the planet. The spacecraft will carry a small probe weighing around 20 kilograms that will drop just before entering the atmosphere. The probe will be equipped with a nefelómetro de autofluorescencia (AFN) instrument that will allow it to search for organic material in the clouds and characterize particles. Although it will not confirm the existence of life, it could identify conditions that make it possible. As Segura Peralta mentioned, before this mission, other missions have been developed where the ships have orbited around Venus to map its surface or measure the sulfur dioxide in its atmosphere, which is an indicator of volcanic processes.
