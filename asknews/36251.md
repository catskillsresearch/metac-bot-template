**US House Republicans Propose Repeal of Electric Vehicle Tax Credit**
The US House of Representatives' Republican majority has proposed a bill to repeal the electric vehicle tax credit (30D) under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) by 2027. The original deadline for the tax credit was December 31, 2032, but the new bill advances it to December 31, 2026. Additionally, if a company sells more than 20,000 electric vehicles in the US between 2009 and 2025, their vehicles will no longer be eligible for the tax credit. The IRA allows taxpayers to claim up to $7,500 in tax credits for electric vehicles assembled in North America with key minerals and battery requirements met. However, to fund Trump's tax cuts, the Republican majority plans to repeal the electric vehicle tax credit and other clean energy initiatives from the previous Biden administration. The bill also proposes to repeal the '45W tax credit' for commercial electric vehicles after December 31, 2025. The '45W tax credit' is an exception that allows commercial electric vehicles to receive tax credits even if they do not meet the origin requirements. This decision is seen as a response to the Korean government and industry's requests, but some Republicans have criticized it as a 'loophole.' The tax credit for used electric vehicle buyers will also be repealed. The advanced manufacturing production tax credit (45X) for Korean battery companies will be phased out by 2031. The original plan was to gradually reduce the tax credit amount and phase it out by 2033, but the Republican bill will maintain it until the end of 2031. Additionally, products from prohibited foreign entities will no longer be eligible for tax credits, which is seen as a measure to prevent Chinese companies from benefiting from the tax credit.

**Energy Production, Investment Credits Phased Out in GOP Tax Bill**
House Republicans proposed phasing out clean energy business breaks and repealing electric vehicle and clean energy home improvement credits in their tax bill. The move aims to pay for extending tax cuts from the 2017 law, which is set to expire at the end of the year. The proposal targets the clean electricity production and investment credits, also known as 45Y and 48E, by phasing them out and restricting their use. This decision comes after Democrats unleashed billions of dollars in tax credits for clean energy projects in their 2022 tax-and-climate law. As one of the key provisions of the 2022 law, the credits have been a crucial incentive for clean energy investments.

**Daily on Energy, presented by CRES Forum: Legislative text - Washington Examiner**
The House Ways and Means Republicans have released a reconciliation text that aims to cut clean energy tax credits established by the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. The proposal would terminate the $7,500 tax credits for electric vehicles, commercial clean vehicle tax credits, and the Clean Hydrogen Production 45V tax credit. The bill would also phase out the Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits and the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is set to mark up its portion of the budget reconciliation package, which would cancel up to $6.5 billion in unspent funding from the IRA. The Department of Energy is also moving forward with the president's deregulatory agenda by walking back 47 different climate and energy-related regulations. Oil prices surged after the US and China announced a temporary trade agreement to lower tariffs. Chinese battery company CATL plans to raise at least $4 billion to expand overseas. The European Union is asking the Czech Republic to delay signing a nuclear contract with South Korea amid an investigation into foreign subsidies.

**House GOP unveils bill text for slashing Biden energy tax credits**
The House GOP has unveiled a bill that would terminate and modify clean energy and manufacturing tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was passed by Democrats in 2022. The bill would eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, terminate the Clean Hydrogen Production 45V tax credit, and block wind energy from the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax. The legislation also subjects the Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits to a phase-out period and restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) criticized the bill, saying it would 'jack up prices on American families,' 'kill jobs,' and 'create chaos in the business community.'

**US House Republicans Propose Massive Rollback of Climate and Energy Policies**
US House Representatives have proposed a massive rollback of climate and energy policies in the budget draft, aiming to repeal tax credits for clean energy, drastically cut funding for electric vehicles and renewable energy, and recover additional climate-related funds. The Republican plan aims to push through a multi-trillion-dollar budget that aligns with President Donald Trump's agenda. The Energy and Commerce Committee presented a proposal that would bring in $6.5 billion by repealing climate-related parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. The Financial Committee, on the other hand, suggested abolishing or letting expire several lucrative tax credits from President Joe Biden's central climate law. According to the proposal, the tax credit for consumers when buying electric vehicles would expire at the end of this year, not in the next decade. Various central tax credits for clean energy would expire by 2031, and a large tax credit for hydrogen production would be ended prematurely. Trump had promised during the election campaign to end state support for electric vehicles and roll back Biden's comprehensive measures against global warming, arguing that these measures were unnecessary and harmed automakers, oil and gas companies, and mining companies. Trump hopes that his first budget after taking office again will fulfill his promises and drastically reduce the federal bureaucracy. The Energy Committee's plan also includes repealing important environmental regulations from the Biden administration, including a regulation from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that would reduce emissions for cars and light trucks starting from model year 2027. The proposal also includes measures to speed up the approval for the export of liquefied natural gas and over $1.5 billion for the Energy Department to refill the strategic oil reserve. 'This law would recover funds that were intended for green misinvestments through 'environmental and climate justice block grants' and other expenditure mechanisms of the EPA and the Energy Department,' wrote Energy Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie in a guest article in the Wall Street Journal, announcing the proposal on Sunday. The law also includes the elimination of the remaining, unused funds from the $27 billion fund to reduce greenhouse gases - a central goal of EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who claimed in court proceedings that the money was being used fraudulently. Unspent funds from nine funding programs of the Inflation Reduction Act for renewable energy and electrification, such as guarantees for energy loans to indigenous communities and the financing of transmission lines, as well as unused funds from the Energy Department's credit office would also be recovered. Unused funds from the Inflation Reduction Act for methane reduction in oil and gas facilities, greenhouse gas reporting, reducing air pollutants in ports, production facilities and schools, and funds that should enable low-income communities to access clean energy would also be repealed. 'Your proposal destroys investments that lower energy costs, drive a boom in domestic industry, and bring essential health services to communities that need them most,' criticized Lena Moffitt, Executive Director of the environmental organization Evergreen Action. The proposed cuts by the Financial Committee also include a quick expiration of the 'technology-neutral' 45Y tax credits for wind, solar, and other clean energy sources. These credits had no expiration date and would now end in 2031. Also, the transferability, a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which allowed developers to sell their tax credits and use the funds to finance the construction of their projects, would be abolished according to the proposal.

**In Defense of the Consumer: A Call for Action**
Many people are struggling with the rising cost of living, including increased energy prices. According to the Federal Government, prices of goods and services will increase by 5.4% this year, while inflation will remain at least 3%. Energy prices are expected to rise by 7%. For Latinos, the situation is even more concerning, as a study by the University of Indiana found that two out of five Latinos have struggled to pay their electricity bills, and 18% have had their electricity disconnected at least once. However, solutions and benefits exist to help make life and finances brighter. Unfortunately, the administration is trying to end funding for the Home Appliance and Home Efficiency Rebate Project, but funds seem to be flowing again, benefiting low-income families. In Congress, important tax credits, such as the Home Energy Efficiency Improvement Credit (25C), are also under threat. These initiatives are part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which dedicates billions to help consumers save money on their energy bills. Despite political attacks on this law, there is growing Republican support to preserve tax credits in the manufacturing sector, which is creating good jobs for making batteries and electric vehicles. These savings initiatives should not be politicized because they benefit everyone in a non-partisan way. The 50 states, excluding South Dakota, have received approval to launch these rebate programs. Twelve states, including several with high Latino populations, have already launched their rebate programs, and 15 others have been granted funds after the November elections. These programs are extremely popular, with over 3.4 million families benefiting from the IRA in 2023, receiving $8.4 billion in tax credits to electrify and make their homes more efficient. Additionally, they promoted the creation of 142,000 jobs in the clean energy economy. In summary, rebate programs achieve: Reducing energy inflation costs. Creating local jobs. Boosting the manufacturing sector. And strengthening the national electrical grid and energy security. Consumers face significant inflationary pressure, labor market uncertainty, and the rigors of the climate crisis. The Inflation Reduction Act and its historic aid and benefits approved by Congress constitute a well-deserved relief, especially for low- and moderate-income families.

**GOP moves to repeal EV credit, other climate law incentives**
House Republicans are proposing to repeal electric vehicle tax credits and other climate law incentives, according to legislation released by the Ways and Means Committee. The legislation, dubbed 'THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL', would terminate programs tied to the Democrats' 2022 climate law, including home energy efficiency and clean hydrogen production credits. The Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit would be phased out by 2031, and new domestic sourcing requirements would be added. The nuclear power production incentive would also go away by 2031. Additionally, the legislation includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling increase.

**Trump Must Bury Biden's Subsidies for Russian and Chinese Minerals**
The US is heavily reliant on mineral imports from China, which is using its control of supply chains to exert leverage. To break China's hold, the US needs to increase the competitiveness of its mining industry and strengthen incentives for domestic production. However, Section 45X of the Internal Revenue Code, enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, has failed to achieve its goal due to loopholes that allow foreign-mined minerals to be processed in the US and receive tax credits. This hands subsidies to refiners who import minerals from China and Russia while denying access to US-based mining operations. The author argues that Congress should fix 45X to support American production at every level of the supply chain, close loopholes, and expand eligibility to include domestic mining operations. This would strengthen US competitiveness, take on China, and keep American tax policy focused on supporting domestic investment, jobs, and national security.

**Senator Warnock against proposed clean energy repeals**
Georgia Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock is warning that repealing Clean Energy tax credits could lead to the loss of nearly 42,000 jobs in the state. According to Warnock, this includes 7,400 jobs in coastal Georgia. He stated, 'It's a job killer. It's pure and simple.' Warnock is calling out his Republican colleagues in Congress, who are looking to repeal these tax credits, saying, 'Georgia Republicans have a choice to make. These credits have benefited their districts more than blue districts.' Republican Congressman Buddy Carter responded, saying the tax credits are 'inflationary and reckless,' and that he will continue to support policies that bring jobs and growth to the state.

**Trump's Zollpoker: Uncertainty Continues to Plague Clean-Tech Sector**
The recent announcements by the Trump administration have caused significant uncertainty in the global markets, with the US stock market losing over 10% in just two days. This has also affected the Clean-Tech sector, with additional uncertainty caused by the new administration's unclear stance on continuing the incentives from the 'Inflation Reduction Act' (IRA). The IRA, signed into law by Biden in 2023, provides financial incentives to accelerate the transition to a carbon-free economy and combat climate change. Originally, this package was expected to boost the growth of renewable energy. However, the Trump administration's policies, including tariffs of up to 200% on solar panels and modules from China and 271.45% on Vietnamese components, have led to the creation of jobs in the solar industry, particularly in Republican states. First Solar, the largest producer of solar modules in the US, has been able to maintain its value due to its domestic supply chain. Experts from Erste Asset Management believe that the Inflation Reduction Act will not be completely repealed, as it enjoys broad support among Republicans. However, the uncertainty will persist until the trade war ends, which is not yet in sight, and this will continue to harm the US industry.

**Energy & Sustainability Washington Update -- May 2025**
The Trump administration has made significant changes to federal energy and environmental policy, including a dramatic reduction in the federal workforce, with over 260,000 employees either dismissed, retired, or voluntarily separated. The administration has also taken steps to reshape the federal permitting landscape, including the use of emergency authorities to accelerate approvals and the addition of high-profile mining projects to the national permitting dashboard. Meanwhile, Congress has continued deliberations around potential reconciliation bills to preserve the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax rates that expire this year. Key to this will be the fate of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits, such as the 45E Investment Tax Credit (ITC), the 45Y Production Tax Credit (PTC), 45V Hydrogen Credit and the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit. Despite ideological divisions, bipartisan efforts have emerged to preserve incentives critical to domestic industry and job creation. Staff cuts have also been made at key energy agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and Department of the Interior (DOI). The administration has framed these changes as necessary efficiency measures, although clean energy advocates, industry coalitions, and public sector stakeholders have raised concerns about diminished institutional capacity and potential delays in project execution.

**Revise Or Repeal? Commercial Clean Vehicle Tax Credit Awaits Its Fate**
The commercial clean vehicle tax credit under section 45W of the Inflation Reduction Act may be vulnerable to repeal or revision due to its larger size and potential regulatory challenges. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated the revenue effect of the credit at $14.4 billion between 2024 and 2028, compared to $5.6 billion for the clean vehicle credit. The proposed regulations for section 45W have been met with criticism from industry commentators, who argue that the rules are too narrow and would exclude certain types of vehicles from qualifying for the credit. The proposed recapture rules, which would require taxpayers to recapture the credit if the vehicle ceases to be used for business purposes within 18 months, have been criticized for being too harsh and potentially causing significant economic losses. The effective date of the proposed regulations has also been questioned, with some commentators arguing that it would cause commercially retroactive recapture despite standard leasing transactions. Despite these criticisms, some aspects of the proposed regulations, such as the safe harbor guidance for the incremental cost of a vehicle, have been praised by industry commentators.

**Strange bedfellows unite to kill carbon capture credit**
Reps. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) have introduced legislation to repeal the 45Q tax credit, which incentivizes energy companies to capture and store carbon dioxide. Perry, a climate change skeptic, called the credit 'wasteful' and said it 'subsidizes technologies that serve no purpose beyond distorting energy markets.' The 45Q tax credit is considered one of the least imperiled climate-friendly energy incentives from the Democrats' 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Over 110 trade groups and companies, including the American Petroleum Institute and the American Council on Renewable Energy, have sent a letter to lawmakers urging them to protect the 45V hydrogen tax credit in the Inflation Reduction Act. The groups warn that 'private sector investment is at risk due to the uncertainty around this crucial incentive,' and that without it, 'hundreds of companies and thousands of jobs' in the hydrogen sector could be lost, shifting to other countries. Republicans have signaled plans to repeal some clean energy incentives as part of a broader spending cut and GOP priority push.

**01: The fate of tax incentives for the energy transition**
White & Case tax partners Jeffrey Davis and Michael Sykes discuss the fate of tax incentives for the energy transition under the new US administration. They analyze the likelihood of changes to these incentives, including the Section 45X credit for advanced manufacturing, and consider historical precedents, such as lessons from Trump's first term. Davis notes that a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act is highly unlikely, and that changes should be more targeted in nature. Sykes adds that some credits, such as the direct pay credit, may be more at risk than others, while credits like the 45X credit for advanced manufacturing may be safer due to their alignment with Trump's platform. The partners also discuss the impact of changes to tax law provisions on project financing and the potential effects on lenders and tax equity investors.

**Maximize Your Section 45X Tax Credit Ahead of Tax Season**
The section 45X tax credit, introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, aims to incentivize domestic clean energy manufacturing by rewarding manufacturers for producing qualifying advanced energy components. The credit is calculated based on specific metrics, such as production volume, electrical capacity, or cost, and is fully transferable, allowing manufacturers to sell unused credits for immediate cash benefits. The program offers full credit benefits through 2029, with a phased reduction beginning in 2030. To claim the credit, manufacturers must meet the IRS's definition of 'substantial transformation,' which requires significant processing of raw materials or components to become a new and distinct product. The credit is also subject to eligibility and domestic manufacturing requirements, including the sale of manufactured products to unrelated third-parties. The IRS has emphasized rigorous oversight of tax credits like section 45X to prevent misuse, and manufacturers should carefully evaluate their processes and maintain meticulous documentation to validate their eligibility.

**Proposed bill would repeal 45Z clean fuel production tax credit**
Representative Beth Van Duyne has introduced a bill to repeal the Section 45Z clean fuel production tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The credit supports the production of low-carbon transportation fuels, but critics argue that the initial guidance released by the Treasury Department falls short of expectations. The guidance has been met with mixed reactions from industry groups, with some praising the inclusion of climate-smart agriculture practices and others criticizing the lack of clarity on key details. The American Carbon Alliance and National Farmers Union have expressed disappointment with the guidance, while the American Soybean Association and National Oilseed Processors Association have welcomed the Treasury's notice of intent to propose regulation. The industry is urging the Treasury Department to finalize and publish guidance for the 45Z Clean Fuels Production Credit as soon as possible, citing the need for policy certainty and the potential for significant headwinds and business risks if the guidance is not published promptly.

**US state attorneys general urge Congress to keep IRA clean energy credits**
A coalition of 17 US state attorneys general has sent a letter to Congress urging them to retain investments under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Since the IRA's passage in 2022, businesses have invested nearly $500 billion in low-carbon energy and domestic manufacturing, with private investment exceeding public spending five- to six-fold. The coalition is concerned that repealing certain tax credits, such as the Section 45X credit for advanced manufacturing, the Section 48C credit for investments in advanced energy, and the Section 48E clean electricity investment credit, could stymie important projects and leave gaps where jobs and revenue streams were expected. The letter highlights several large projects already benefiting US communities, including a $150 million investment by Siemens in a power transformer factory in North Carolina, which will create over 550 jobs, and a $1.6 billion investment by Our Next Energy in an electric vehicle battery gigafactory in Michigan, which will employ over 2,000 people by 2027. 'Our nation is strengthening domestic energy security, reducing energy costs, diversifying our domestic energy resources, rebuilding our domestic manufacturing economy, bolstering and modernizing critical infrastructure, and creating well-paying jobs while simultaneously reducing harmful pollution,' the letter said.
