**UK Announces Nuclear Submarine and Ammunition Factory Plans in Response to 'Russian Threat'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive rearmament plan for the UK, including the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and six new ammunition factories. The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate £15 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional £6 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.

**UK Announces Construction of 12 New Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarines 'A Message to Moscow'**
The UK has announced the construction of 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines as part of its Defense Review, which Prime Minister Starmer said will give the British army more power against hostile states like Russia and China. According to Starmer, 'The threat is more serious, more immediate, more unpredictable than ever since the Cold War.' The new defense strategy is 'a message to Moscow,' said Defense Minister John Healey, referring to the 'growing' threat posed by Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Starmer has also committed to building at least six new ammunition factories in the UK, creating a hybrid Royal Navy combining drones with warships, submarines, and aircraft, improving living conditions and equipment for military personnel, and investing £15 billion in a nuclear program. The UK is preparing for war at a 'war footing' because Russia is showing it does not want peace, and the best way to deter aggressors is to be ready. Starmer has promised to create a stronger and fully trained reserve, strengthen NATO by making the largest contribution to the alliance since its creation, and invest in innovation. The UK's defense spending will increase to 2.5% by 2027 and 3% by 2030.

**UK to Build New Attack Submarines and Boost Nuclear Arsenal Amid Russian Threat**
The UK's Labour leader has outlined a plan to make the country a 'war-ready' nation, equipped for 'decades to come', in the face of the Russian threat. 'The threat we face today is more grave, more immediate, and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,' he said. He added, 'We are facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyberattacks, and an increasing Russian aggression in our waters, which also threatens our airspace.' Key measures include the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered submarines armed with conventional weapons, as part of the Aukus military alliance with the US and Australia. These new submarines will replace the current UK fleet by the end of the 2030s, which currently consists of seven such vessels.

**UK to build up to 12 new attack submarines**
The UK will build 'up to' 12 new attack submarines to replace the Astute class from the late 2030s onwards, according to the prime minister's announcement. The new submarines will be conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered, and will keep 'Britain and Nato safe for decades', as stated by Sir Keir. The government will also spend £15bn on its nuclear warhead program and commit to increasing UK defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027. The review will make 62 recommendations, which the government is expected to accept in full. The Labour party has committed to increasing defence spending to 3% of national income by 2034, but the Conservatives say this should be met by the end of the decade. The review will also include other announcements, such as £1.5bn to build six new factories for 'always on' munitions production capacity, building up to 7,000 long-range weapons, and setting up a 'cyber and electromagnetic command' to boost the military's defensive and offensive capabilities in cyberspace.

**Top Nuclear-Armed Nations In 2025: Where Does India Stand? - News18**
According to a study by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), as of early 2025, the world's nine nuclear-armed nations collectively possess approximately 12,331 nuclear warheads. The top five countries with the largest nuclear arsenals are Russia (5,449 warheads), the United States (5,277 warheads), China (600 warheads, expected to exceed 1,000 by 2030), France (290 warheads), and the United Kingdom (225 warheads). India has approximately 180 nuclear warheads and adheres to a no-first-use policy, while Pakistan has around 170 nuclear warheads and maintains its arsenal largely due to its historical rivalry with India. Israel is believed to possess around 90 nuclear warheads, and North Korea has approximately 50 nuclear warheads, although the exact number remains uncertain due to the secretive nature of its nuclear programme.

**China Accelerates Nuclear Development: Arsenal Approaching 1,000 Warheads**
According to a recent report by the Federation of American Scientists, China currently possesses around 600 nuclear warheads, with many more in production. The study highlights that China is developing its nuclear arsenal at the fastest rate among the nine nuclear-armed states, despite having signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The report, published by the Nuclear Information Project, reveals that since May 2024, China has continued to develop three new missile silo fields for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with solid fuel, as well as proceeding with the construction of new silos for its ICBMs DF-5 with liquid fuel. China is also advancing the development of new ICBM variants and advanced strategic launch systems. The report suggests that Beijing has produced excess warheads for these systems, ready to be used once the launchers are operational. The study also notes the Pentagon's projections, which indicate that China's arsenal will surpass 1,000 warheads by 2030. The 2024 report presented to the US Congress by the Department of Defense revealed that China could have around 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. However, the Nuclear Notebook notes that the growth of the arsenal will depend on China's stockpiles of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and tritium. In 2023, the International Panel on Fissile Materials estimated that China possessed approximately 14 tons of HEU and around 2.9 tons of separated plutonium available for nuclear weapons.

**China's Nuclear Ambitions: Aiming for 1,000 Warheads by 2030**
China is rapidly increasing its nuclear arsenal, aiming to reach 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030, according to a new study. The country is investing heavily in nuclear weapons, the pinnacle of mass destruction systems, to surpass the United States and become a global superpower. China currently has 600 nuclear warheads and is producing more without pause. The goal is to increase its military deterrence and become a major player in the international order. Analysts note that China's nuclear program will continue to intensify to reach its target, with no end in sight. This development is a cause for concern, as it may lead to increased international tensions, particularly with Russia's recent withdrawal from strategic agreements on nuclear production and use. As one analyst noted, 'The mere presence of nuclear weapons is relevant, regardless of their size or lethality.'

Amazon, Google, and other major companies have signed a pledge to support the goal of tripling the world's nuclear energy capacity by 2050. This pledge is expected to gain more support from industries such as maritime, aviation, and oil and gas in the coming months. The World Nuclear Association facilitated the pledge, which adds to the vow from over 30 countries that also aimed to triple capacity by 2050 in 2023. Nuclear energy currently generates 9% of the world's electricity from 439 power reactors, but the world has only around 411 operating reactors with a combined capacity of 371 gigawatts as of early 2025.

**North Korea to have more nuclear weapons than UK by 2035**
North Korea's nuclear arsenal is expected to surge from around 50 warheads to 300 by 2035, thanks to technical assistance from Russia. Analysts warn that this could make North Korea's nuclear capabilities more threatening than the UK's. According to Ankit Panda, an expert on North Korea's nuclear development, Russia's assistance could help North Korea improve its guidance systems, cruise missile control, and countermeasures. Panda believes that Kim Jong-un will continue to modernize and expand his nuclear forces to achieve 'mutual vulnerability', making it difficult for the US and South Korea to eliminate all his nuclear weapons. This would require an increase in the number of warheads, potentially reaching 300 by 2035.

Analysts have warned that North Korea could have more nuclear warheads than the UK by 2035, thanks to Russian assistance. Ankit Panda, an expert on North Korea's nuclear development, said that with Russian help, North Korea's arsenal of 50 nuclear warheads could rise to 300 in a decade. This would surpass the UK's estimated 225 nuclear warheads. Panda also stated that North Korea may already have the ability to detonate a warhead over an American city. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Director General, Rafael Grossi, accused North Korea of violating UN resolutions by continuing to develop nuclear weapons. Grossi also expressed concern over Iran's increased stockpile of 60% U-235, an isotope often used in nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, experts warned that Europe would need to dramatically increase its nuclear weapons stockpile should the US withdraw from NATO and cease to provide security guarantees to the continent.

**Towards a WW III Scenario. The Privatization of Nuclear War. - LewRockwell**
The world is closer than ever to a nuclear holocaust, with the US nuclear weapons program set to increase to 2 trillion dollars by 2030. The doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) has been scrapped, and 'offensive' military actions using nuclear warheads are now described as acts of 'self-defense'. The development of tactical nuclear weapons, also known as 'mini-nukes', has been accelerated, with the goal of making nuclear war more 'usable'. The privatization of nuclear war has led to corporations having a direct voice in setting the agenda regarding the use and deployment of nuclear weapons. The US public is not aware that the Truman administration had a secret plan to bomb 66 Soviet cities with 204 atomic bombs in 1945, and those who speak out against the use of nuclear weapons are branded as 'conspiracy theorists'.
