**2027 election: After 2 governors, 3 PDP senators endorse Tinubu's 2nd term ambition**
Three Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senators from Osun state, Senator Kamarudeen Lere Oyewumi, Senator Olubiyi Fadeyi Ajagunla, and Senator Francis Adenigba Fadahunsi, have endorsed President Bola Tinubu's second term ambition in the 2027 presidential election. They cited Tinubu's transformative infrastructural projects and effective economic policies, which have led to a significant reduction in food prices and improvement in national security. According to the senators, their endorsement is a 'clear reflection of genuine confidence and satisfaction with President Tinubu's delivery of democratic dividends.' This is the latest endorsement of Tinubu's second term from opposition leaders, following Governor Umo Eno of Akwa Ibom State and Governor Charles Soludo of Anambra state, who have also announced their support for Tinubu's candidacy.

**Bolsonaro's Endorsement of Caporezzo Sparks Senate Dispute in Minas Gerais**
A video circulating on social media shows former President Jair Bolsonaro calling Deputy Cristiano Caporezzo a 'senator', during a meeting with supporters. The recording has gained strength among Bolsonaro supporters in Minas Gerais and has agitated the party's backstage in the state, which is living an internal dispute to define who will be the PL candidate for the Senate in 2026. 'A senator for the photo here! It's Senator Caporezzo!', says Bolsonaro while pointing to the Minas Gerais parliamentarian, as someone next to him says: 'I'll go with whoever you tell me to.' The video has been shared in WhatsApp groups linked to Bolsonaro's base in Minas. This declaration happens in the midst of an internal dispute in the PL to define who will be the party's name in the Senate race next year. Although two vacancies are in dispute for Minas Gerais in the 2026 elections, as allowed by electoral law, the PL, as O TEMPO has already anticipated, intends to launch only one candidate for the position. Currently, at least four names are competing for the party's preference: in addition to Caporezzo, also in the running are federal deputies Domingos Sávio and Eros Biondini and Belo Horizonte city councilor Vile Santos. Behind the scenes of the party, one faction defends Caporezzo's name, mainly due to his proximity to Bolsonaro and alignment with conservative agendas. Another current, however, sees Domingos Sávio as the favorite, especially due to his relationship with mayors, state affiliates and businessmen from Minas. Eros Biondini, on the other hand, has publicly declared that he intends to run for the Senate. According to allies, he is considering leaving the party if he is not chosen. Caporezzo, although officially a pre-candidate for federal deputy in 2026, also remains available to run for the Senate, as he stated in a recent interview to the program Café com Política, from O TEMPO's YouTube channel.

**Ken Paxton Is Coming for Cornyn's Seat  --  And He Might Actually Win**
A recent poll commissioned by the Senate Leadership Fund shows Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) trailing Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton by 16 points in the Republican Texas Senate primary. In a three-way contest with Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas), Cornyn is down 10 points. The poll, conducted by The Tarrance Group from April 27 to May 1, also tested a general election contest between each potential Republican candidate and former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas). Cornyn led Allred by 6 points, while Hunt was up 4 points and Paxton was down by 1 point. Some GOP operatives believe there may be no path for Cornyn to secure the nomination, and Paxton's popularity may not extend far outside of Republican voters. The two candidates have been going back and forth on social media, with Paxton gloating about the poll's results and Cornyn blasting Paxton for his flip-flopping on the Second Amendment and approving taxpayer funds for far-leftist groups. 'Are you even at work in Austin running your office?' Cornyn asked. This race will be noteworthy regardless of who wins, as it pits the anti-establishment side of the GOP against the old guard.

**Jared Golden announces intention to seek reelection**
Maine Representative Jared Golden has announced his intention to seek reelection, citing the need for Democrats to win back the House of Representatives. Golden, a centrist Democrat, has been considered a contender for statewide office and has the support of various union leaders and Democratic leadership. His campaign manager, Kathleen Burns, called him a 'proven winner' and the 'right choice' to beat Republican challenger Paul LePage.

I think that credibility problem is going to persist up until when Democrats say 'we f***** up and we made a terrible mistake.'
