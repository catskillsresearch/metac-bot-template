**Republicans Are Flat-Out Lying About Their Medicaid Cuts**
Republicans are attempting to sell Medicaid cuts to voters by claiming they are 'protecting' the program and eliminating 'waste, fraud, and abuse.' However, the proposed cuts will result in 15 million Americans losing their health care coverage by 2034. The cuts will be fueled by increased requirements for Medicaid recipients, changes to Affordable Care Act marketplace policies, and the failure to renew tax benefits for ACA plan purchasers. Republicans, including President Trump and several lawmakers, have made false claims about the bill, stating that no one will lose coverage and that the cuts are necessary to eliminate waste and abuse. In reality, the bill cuts spending on Medicaid by at least $600 billion over the next 10 years and imposes administrative hurdles to complicate enrollment in the program.

**Why On-And-Off Voters Who Backed Trump May Be GOP's Midterm Silver Bullet | CDN**
A recent study by J.L. Partners found that many Americans who voted for President Donald Trump in the past are now feeling unmotivated to vote Republican in the 2026 midterm elections. Analysts believe that motivating these low-propensity voters could be crucial for the Republican Party to maintain control of Congress. Sam Kay, a pollster at OnMessage Inc., said, 'Republicans will have a hard time surviving the 2026 midterms without figuring out how to engage the low-propensity Trump voter.' Kay added, 'If we want low-propensity Trump voters to turn out in 2026, we need to make this election about protecting President Trump's agenda.' James Johnson, pollster and co-founder of J.L. Partners, said, 'Most (64%) would still vote GOP if the election were held tomorrow, but lack a clear reason to do so.' Johnson believes that these voters are motivated by the idea that voting for a Republican-controlled Congress in 2026 will help the Republicans win the presidency in 2028. Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, said, 'Midterms should be considered separately from presidential elections.' Kondik noted that presidential elections have higher voter turnout than midterms and that the outcome of midterms does not necessarily predict presidential outcomes.

**Pete Buttigieg Leads Democratic Poll for 2028 Presidential Election, JD Vance Tops Republican List**
A recent poll by AtlasIntel shows that Pete Buttigieg, the former US Transportation Secretary, is the most popular choice among Democrats for the 2028 presidential election, with 31.5% of the vote. JD Vance, the current US Vice President, is the most popular choice among Republicans, with 37.3% of the vote. The poll also found that 50.9% of respondents would vote for a Democratic candidate in a mid-term election, while 41.7% would vote for a Republican candidate. Kamala Harris, the current US Vice President, saw a decline in her popularity, with 16.6% of the vote, possibly due to the recent controversy surrounding Joe Biden's health. Pete Buttigieg has not ruled out a potential presidential run, and some speculate that he may be preparing for another bid. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has not commented on speculation that she may run for president in 2028, but some believe she could be a potential candidate for the Senate.

**Surprising Candidate Emerges As Clear Democrat Frontrunner for 2028 (It’s NOT Kamala Harris Or AOC) - Conservative Angle**
A new poll has emerged showing Pete Buttigieg as the clear frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic presidential election, surpassing Kamala Harris and AOC. According to the poll, Buttigieg has 32% of the vote, with AOC at 20% and Harris at 15%. However, Buttigieg has stated that he is undecided about running for president in 2028, saying 'there are times I follow that process and decided to run, and there are times I followed that process and decided not to run — and the process can lead you to surprising places.' If Buttigieg does decide to run, he may face off against JD Vance, the current Republican frontrunner for the 2028 presidential election.

**US Republicans Move to Allow Donald Trump a Third Term**
US Republican Andy Ogles has proposed a constitutional amendment to allow President Donald Trump to serve a third term. The amendment would modify the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms, to allow for a third term. Ogles claims to have 'a lot of support' among his Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives, but acknowledged that the amendment would face a 'difficult path' to passage. The proposed change would enable Trump to serve a third term, which Ogles justified by citing Trump's 'decisive leadership' in contrast to the 'chaos, suffering, and economic decline' experienced by Americans in the past four years. However, Democrats have strongly criticized the proposal, with Representative Steve Cohen saying, 'Two terms are enough chaos for any nation to endure.'

**Trump rules out 2028 run as Republican contenders quietly position for next race | FOX6 Milwaukee**
President Donald Trump has ruled out running for a third term in 2028, stating 'I'm not looking at that' and 'I'll be a two-term president.' Despite this, several Republican politicians are positioning themselves for a potential 2028 presidential run. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp are among those being mentioned as potential contenders. Trump has hinted that Vance could be his successor, but has avoided anointing him as the party's next nominee. Rubio's expanding portfolio in the second Trump administration has fueled speculation about a potential 2028 presidential bid, but he still faces skepticism from parts of the MAGA world. DeSantis has proven his fundraising prowess and retains plenty of supporters across the country, but his feud with the Republican-dominated Florida legislature and controversy over a charity tied to his wife are seen as potential hurdles. Youngkin has seven months left in office and has been able to thrive in a MAGA-dominated party, sparking 2028 speculation. Kemp has survived Trump's wrath and thrived, and has fueled buzz that he may instead be mulling a 2028 White House run. Sen. Ted Cruz has reaffirmed his conservative credentials by voicing opposition to Trump's tariffs, and Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador, is also being mentioned as a potential contender. Other notable mentions include businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and former Vice President Mike Pence.

**Trump Rules Out Third Term, Points to Vance and Rubio as Possible Successors**
Donald Trump has stated that he 'does not seek' a third term as president and has pointed to JD Vance and Marco Rubio as possible successors. Trump said, 'I will be an eight-year president. I will be a two-term president. I have always thought that is very important.' He added, 'It is something that is not allowed, as far as I know. I don't know if it's for constitutional reasons or another reason.' Trump has previously hinted at the possibility of a third term, but now claims that he wants to 'have four great years and pass the baton to someone, a great Republican, I hope, who will continue.' Trump has praised Vance's work as vice president, saying he is 'doing a fantastic job,' and has also praised Rubio, saying he is 'great.' However, Trump emphasized that it is 'too early' to discuss succession. Trump's focus is on the 2026 midterm elections, where the Republican Party will attempt to break a historical trend and maintain their majority in both the House and Senate. Trump plans to be 'very active' in the campaign, particularly in fundraising efforts. He said, 'If you look at it, it's quite consistent that whoever wins the presidency ends up losing the House, losing the Senate. I think we're going to turn that around. I think we're going to turn it around easily.'

US President Donald Trump has ruled out seeking a third term, despite the sale of 'Trump 2028' hats by his organization. Trump stated, 'I'm going to be an eight-year president, a two-term president.

**Trump Rules Out Third Term, Names Potential Successors**
US President Donald Trump stated that he will not run for a third term and named two potential successors, noting that there are others. Trump said, 'Many people are selling the 2028 hat.

Trump mentioned that four years is a long time to do something 'really impressive.' He also stated that he will be president for eight years, two terms, and that he has always considered this to be very important.

**Trump Rules Out Third Presidential Term, Citing Importance of Two-Term Limit**
Donald Trump has stated that he will not run for a third presidential term in the United States, emphasizing the importance of limiting terms to two. Trump said in an interview with NBC News, 'I will be president for a total of eight years, two terms. I have always considered this very important.' According to Trump, his supporters frequently urge him to run in 2028, but he has no intention of doing so. He added that many people are selling 'Trump 2028' hats, but his goal is 'to work four great years and hand it over to someone else, ideally a great Republican.' The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, adopted in 1951, prohibits a person from holding the presidency for more than two terms. Trump previously hinted at the possibility of running for a third term, and there were reports that he had instructed the Department of Justice to investigate the legality of running in 2028. The next presidential election in the United States is scheduled for 2028.

**Trump 2028: A Possible Third Term for the US President?**
Donald Trump's organization is selling red hats with the phrase 'Trump 2028', suggesting that the current US president may run for a third term in 2028. Trump has stated that he 'is not joking' about seeking a third term, and some of his supporters have suggested that there may be ways to circumvent the two-term limit established by the US Constitution. The Constitution's 22nd Amendment states that 'no person... shall be elected to the office of President more than twice,' but some argue that this only prohibits being 'elected' to more than two terms, not 'succeeding' to the office. Trump's supporters claim that this could allow him to run for a third term as vice-president and then assume the presidency through succession. However, experts and lawmakers have expressed skepticism about this interpretation, and the high standards for amending the Constitution make it unlikely that a change would be made to allow a third term. Democrats have strongly opposed the idea, and some Republicans have also expressed reservations.

**Trump's Bid for a Third Term: A Constitutional Conundrum**
US President Donald Trump has stated that he is serious about running for a third term in 2028. However, this possibility is prohibited by the US Constitution, which limits a president to two terms. The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution states: 'No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.' Trump has previously joked about running for a third term, but now says he is not joking. Reforming the Constitution to allow a third term would require a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, which the Republican Party does not have. Even if it were possible, 38 out of 50 states would need to approve the change through state legislatures. Trump would not be the only beneficiary of such a change, as former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama would also be eligible to run again.

**Donald Trump Considers Running for Third Presidential Term in 2028**
Donald Trump, the Republican president of the United States, has stated that he may run for a third presidential term in 2028. Although the US Constitution limits a president to two terms, Trump claimed that there are methods to circumvent this rule. In a phone interview with NBC, Trump said, 'I'm not joking, a lot of people want me to do it.' Trump's comments have sparked speculation that he could remain in power until 2037, due to a legal loophole in the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution. According to Professor Bruce Peabody, the 22nd Amendment only prohibits a president from being re-elected twice, but does not rule out the possibility of re-election through another mechanism. Trump could potentially run for vice president in 2028, accompanied by his current vice president J. D. Vance, and then become president again if the current president were to resign. 'No estoy bromeando, mucha gente quiere que lo haga' (I'm not joking, a lot of people want me to do it), Trump said.

**2028 election odds include possible third terms for Trump, Obama**
Vice President JD Vance is the clear favorite to win the Republican nomination and be elected the next U.S. president in 2028, according to odds from BetOnline. However, oddsmakers have left open the possibility that President Donald Trump will run for a third term in office, with Trump being the 5-1 second choice to be the 2028 Republican nominee. Trump declined to endorse Vance as the 2028 nominee, saying 'No, but he's very capable.' The U.S. Constitution limits presidents to two terms in office, but BetOnline has made the odds 50-1 on a prop that the two-term limit will be scrapped this year. If the two-term limit is repealed, that would also open the door for former two-term presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush to run again. In hypothetical matchups in the 2028 election, Trump is a -200 favorite over Clinton (+160), while Obama is a -200 favorite over Trump (+160).

**Trump Hints at 2028 Presidential Run, Sparking Controversy Over Constitutional Amendment**
Donald Trump has hinted that he may run for president again in 2028, despite not being selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 election. Trump has been quoted as saying that serving as president for more than two terms would be the greatest honor of his life. However, the US Constitution's 22nd Amendment prohibits a president from serving more than two terms. Trump's potential bid to amend the Constitution to allow him to run again has sparked controversy. Republican Party leader Andy Biggs has called for a change to the Constitution to allow a president to serve up to 12 years, rather than the current 8 years. However, the Republican Party does not have a majority in Congress, making it difficult to pass a constitutional amendment. Former Federal Appeals Court Judge J. Michael Luttig has stated that Trump's potential bid to run again is not relevant, as a constitutional amendment would require a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, as well as the approval of 38 states.

**US Presidential Election 2024: How it Works**
The US presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024. The winner of the election will be determined by the Electoral College system, where the candidate who wins the most votes in a state gets all of that state's electoral votes. In most states, the candidate who wins the most votes gets all of the state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, where the electoral votes are allocated proportionally. To be eligible to vote in the US, one must be a US citizen and at least 18 years old. The candidates will finance their campaigns through donations and the 'Citizen-United-Urteil' allows for indirect campaign support with few restrictions. The election process is complex, with multiple stages, including the nomination convention, debates, and the final election. The winner of the election will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. As of now, the candidates for the election are Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, with the first debate scheduled for September 10, 2024. The election will be a crucial moment in US history, with the winner determining the course of the country's future.
