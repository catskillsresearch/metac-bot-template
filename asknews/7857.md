**Declining Child Population to Impact School Planning in Mettmann**
According to a recent analysis, the number of children in Mettmann is expected to decrease. The data suggests that while the number of children will reach a peak in 2027/2028, it will then tend to decline. This has implications for the planning of schools in the area, as the number of students will be lower in the future. As one might expect, the administration is hesitant to provide exact numbers, but the available data indicates a downward trend in the number of children. 'The prognosis is a difficult business,' as the saying goes, and the schools will need to adjust to this new reality.

**Turkey's Fertility Rate Decline: A Demographic Alarm**
Turkey is facing a critical issue that directly affects its future: the decline in fertility rate and the aging of the young population. This situation is closely related to the total population number and the age structure of the society. While some argue that the population is already too large and should decrease, the real threat lies in the increase in the population's average age. For example, in 2020, the median age in Turkey was 32.7 years, indicating that half of the population is over 32.7 years old. A similar situation is seen in South Korea, where the fertility rate is currently 0.78. Experts predict that South Korea will experience a significant demographic collapse between 2040-2050, with a ratio of 100 elderly individuals to every child by 2060, leading to a loss of workforce and social collapse. Turkey is also experiencing a similar trend. The fertility rate in Turkey decreased from 2.16 in 2007 to 1.48 in 2024, indicating that the population cannot reproduce itself. Experts say that a fertility rate of at least 2.10 is needed to maintain a stable population. Various factors are contributing to this decline in fertility, including increased urbanization and education, women's participation in the workforce, economic costs, and changes in lifestyle. The government is preparing to take various steps to reverse this alarming trend. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced that the 2026-2035 period will be declared the 'Family 10 Years' period. As part of this, economic incentives will be provided to couples getting married, and measures will be taken to strengthen family structures. Experts emphasize that demographic balance can only be maintained through long-term social policies and sustainable solutions.

**Global Fertility Rate to Decline Sharply by 2100, Study Warns**
A recent study published in 'The Lancet' predicts that the global fertility rate will continue to decline, with the number of births per woman expected to drop from 2.4 in 2016 to 1.75 by 2100. This decline is expected to be more pronounced than previously thought, with the number of births projected to reach 72 million by 2100, down from 142 million in 2016. The study's authors warn that this decline will lead to a significant social change in the 21st century. According to the study, by 2100, only 3% of countries will have a fertility rate above 2.1, and the majority of births will occur in Africa, south of the Sahara. The study's authors also suggest that governments can take measures to mitigate the decline, such as providing extended parental leave, child benefits, and affordable childcare, but the impact of these measures will be limited. The study's authors also predict that there will be a competition among wealthy countries to attract migrants to address the demographic challenges. 'We are standing in the 21st century before a disturbing social change,' said Stein Emil Vollset, a member of the research group, in a statement about the study. 'We are facing a future where the number of births will be significantly lower than it is today.'

**Bakan Göktaş: Nüfus Artış Hızı Düşer, Okullar Huzur Evine Dönüşebilir**
Family and Social Services Minister Mahinur Özdemir Göktaş has warned that the decline in population growth rate could lead to a shortage of working-age youth and that schools could turn into 'hospices'. She highlighted the challenges faced by family structures and the aging of the population. Göktaş stated, 'If the young population continues to decline, we will not be able to find working young people. Schools will turn into hospices.' She emphasized the importance of addressing the population growth rate and family structures, saying, 'The family has been the guarantor of our country's unity and continuity from the past to the present. However, in the face of the rapid changes in the world, the family structure is exposed to different challenges. Therefore, it is critical to approach the family with a multidisciplinary perspective and produce comprehensive solutions.' She also mentioned that the total fertility rate has decreased from 2.38 in 2001 to 1.48 in 2024, and that the country is not able to renew itself. She stated, 'We are currently in a situation where we cannot renew ourselves as a country. Therefore, our population is aging, and our young population is declining, and many countries around the world are facing similar challenges. In addition, there is a rapid increase in divorce rates and a decrease in marriage rates. This is a worrying situation. The slowdown in population growth and the risks faced by our family structure are indicated by this.'

**Muslim population to decline in these countries by 2050; Hindus to..., Muslims in India...**
According to the Pew Research Center's study 'The Future of World Religions,' the global Muslim population is projected to rise from 23% of the world's population in 2010 to 30% in 2050. The Muslim population is estimated to be 1,599,700,000 in 2010 and is expected to reach 2,761,480,000 by 2050. However, the Muslim population in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to decline from 61.7% in 2010 to 52.8% in 2050.

**South Korea is Over**
South Korea is facing a demographic collapse, with a fertility rate of 0.72 children per woman in 2023, the lowest ever recorded in history. By 2060, the population will have shrunk by 30%, with one in two South Koreans over the age of 65 and less than one in 10 under 25. The country's economy is projected to collapse, with a workforce shrinking to less than half and a GDP that could peak in the 2040s. The societal and cultural collapse will be even more severe, with a loneliness epidemic, a decline in cultural traditions, and a shrinking youth population. The author argues that there is no way back, but rapid and societal changes could make the population want to have kids again. In 2024, births rose for the first time in 9 years, but this is not enough to reverse the trend. The article concludes that demographic collapse is not an abstract thing in the future, but is happening right now, and that it is not just South Korea, but a global problem.

**Immigrants in U.S. without permanent legal status grew to 12.2 million, study finds • Daily Montanan**
A study by the nonpartisan New York think tank found that the number of immigrants in the U.S. without permanent legal status grew to 12.2 million between 2020 and 2023, a 2 million increase. The six states with the largest population of people without permanent legal status saw significant increases, with Florida, New York, and New Jersey experiencing the fastest growth. The population estimate includes immigrants in temporary legal status programs, such as DACA and Temporary Protected Status. The study noted that estimating this population could become more challenging due to potential changes in census data collection and the Trump administration's efforts to enact mass deportations. The study also found that the population of Venezuelan immigrants doubled from 445,000 in 2023, with roughly half a million Venezuelans under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program at risk of losing protections from deportation. The Trump administration is moving to end TPS for Venezuelans, but the Supreme Court has blocked the use of an 18th-century wartime law to rapidly deport suspected gang members. 'The salient questions would be: Did the decline occur because deportations increased, including of populations stripped of temporary legal status, because fear led to an increase in emigration, because fear reduced the response rates in the surveys, or because of a combination of these or other factors?,' according to the study.

**Getting old doesn't have to be a pain. But we need to invest in aging Americans. | Opinion**
The US needs to invest in its aging population to ensure they can age with dignity. The current system, built for the Greatest Generation, is not equipped to handle the needs of millennials and future generations. The longevity economy, driven by people over 50, already generates $45 trillion in annual economic activity worldwide and is projected to reach $118 trillion by 2050. However, the supply side remains undercapitalized, and the market is not yet following the message. A coordinated effort among investors, innovators, and policymakers is needed to unlock the full potential of this market. As Heather Carter, founder of Venture Vitamin, says, 'Aging by design pays dividends. Not just socially but financially.'

**Italy Faces 1:1 Pensioner-to-Worker Ratio by 2050 Due to Low Fertility Rates**
Italy is expected to have a 1:1 ratio of pensioners to workers by 2050, according to the Inapp. The country has already seen a significant decline in the number of women of childbearing age, which is a result of low fertility rates in the past. 'It would not be enough to just increase fertility rates to reverse the trend of declining births in the coming decades,' warns the Istituto Nazionale per l'Analisi delle Politiche Pubbliche. 'We also need to consider the progressive and strong reduction in the number of women of childbearing age, which is a legacy of past low fertility rates.' Italy is the third most populous country in the EU, but has been below the replacement rate between generations since the 1970s. The country's population peaked in 2013 and has been declining ever since.

**Dominican Republic and Mexico to Stop Population Growth by 2070, Cepal Report Says**
According to the Cepal report 'Long-term care for older people, demographic and social perspectives in the Hispanic Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico', the Dominican Republic and Mexico are the countries in Latin America where the population will stop growing between 2050-2070. The Dominican Republic's population will reach its maximum of 13.3 million in 2062, almost 2 million more than in 2024 (11.4 million). By 2070, the population will have decreased by 70,000 people compared to 2062, with a growth rate of -0.13%. Mexico, the most populous country in the subregion, is projected to reach its maximum population in 2052 and will have a population of 139 million in 2070, with a growth rate of -0.35%. The report also states that Cuba, El Salvador, and Costa Rica will reach their maximum population before 2050, while Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama will show the most continuous population growth beyond 2070. The Dominican Republic has a lower average age of 114.5, with 121.4 women of 60 years old per 100 men of the same age, which is below the average. By 2070, this index will decrease to 117 women per 100 men. The countries that will have decreased the indicator the most are El Salvador, Guatemala, Cuba, and Nicaragua. Only Haiti and the Dominican Republic will increase it, although at different rates. The majority of countries in the subregion tend to a reduction of the femininity index between 2024 and 2070, indicating a movement towards greater gender equity in life expectancy. However, Haiti is an exception, as the femininity index increases, suggesting a greater female predominance in the future.'

**Spain's Working-Age Population to Decline by 2030, Aging Population to Reach 30% of Workforce**
According to the Autoridad Independiente de Responsabilidad Fiscal, the working-age population in Spain will decline to 33 million 600 thousand people by 2030, and will continue to shrink until 2050. By 2030, people over 60 will make up 30% of the workforce, up from 20% currently. The population of dependents (those under 16 and over 66) will increase from 48% to nearly 70% in 25 years. The median age will rise by 4 years to 49. The worst period is expected to be the 2040s, with a potential decline in economic growth of 0.4%. However, the aging population will also lead to a decrease in unemployment, reaching 7% by 2070. The Autoridad Independiente de Responsabilidad Fiscal notes that Spain's situation is similar to that of Europe, but does not rule out the need for additional measures. Productivity will be the main driver of economic growth, contributing 1.1 percentage points, while the labor factor will contribute 0.2 percentage points.

**Population Decline Becomes National Security Crisis, Government Lacks Clear Responsible Unit**
The issue of population decline has become a national security crisis, and the Legislative Yuan invited various government departments to attend a hearing on March 27. However, when lawmakers asked about the specific responsible unit for addressing the issue, officials from various departments were unable to provide a clear answer, prompting lawmakers to express dissatisfaction. Representative Wang Yu-min said, 'This way of handling the issue will not solve the problem.' The National Development Council recently released a report on population projections from 2024 to 2070, showing that the total population will return to negative growth by 2040 and will be difficult to reverse. Even if the total fertility rate returns to 1.3 by 2070, the number of births will still decrease by 40% compared to 2024. Representative Wang Yu-min pointed out that the government lacks a clear responsible unit, insufficient measures, and a lack of effective housing policies to address the issue of population decline. He said, 'The government is only talking about the issue, but it has not invested enough resources to solve it.' Representative Huang Hsiu-fang also expressed concerns that the number of newborns will continue to decline in the future and that a higher-level unit should be responsible for addressing the issue. She noted that the government established an office to address the issue of population decline in 2017, but it is now being handled by the Executive Yuan's policy committee, which still lacks a clear responsible unit.

**French Population Expected to Remain Stable Until 2070 Despite Low Birth Rate**
According to a study by the French National Institute for Demographic Studies (INED), the French population is expected to remain stable until 2070, despite a low birth rate. The study predicts that the population will reach a peak of 70 million in the 2040s before declining to its current level by 2070. In 2025, the population was 68.6 million, with a growth rate of 0.25% over the past year. The natural balance, which is the difference between the number of births and deaths, has contributed only 10% to the population growth. The study notes that the natural balance has decreased from 140,000 in 2019 to 17,000 in 2024 due to an increase in deaths and a decline in births. Laurent Toulemon, a co-author of the study, estimates that 'there is a lot of effort to be made by society to well welcome migrants, who are an asset to the population and a richness if they are integrated.' If the birth rate and migration balance remain at their 2024 levels, the population will continue to grow for two decades, reaching a peak of 70 million in the 2040s, before declining to 68 million by 2070.

**French Population Expected to Remain Stable Until 2070**
According to a study published by the Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), the French population is expected to remain relatively stable until 2070. The population is currently estimated to be 68.6 million, with a growth rate of 0.25% in 2025. The growth is largely due to the positive balance of migration, which is 152,000 people in 2024. The natural balance, which is the difference between births and deaths, has contributed only 1/10 to the population growth, with 17,000 people in 2024. If fertility remains at 1.62 children per woman in 2024, the number of deaths will exceed the number of births from 2027. However, if the migration balance remains at the 2024 level, the population will continue to grow for two decades, reaching a peak of 70 million in the 2040s and then declining to 68 million by 2070. 'There is no reason to panic,' said Laurent Toulemon, co-author of the study. 'The population will age significantly, with a slight increase in men and a decrease in children.' However, the study warns that changes in fertility, migration, or health shocks could alter the size and composition of the future population.

**Immigration crucial to France's population future, study finds**
A recent study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) projects that France's population will reach a peak of 70 million in the 2040s before declining to 68 million by 2070. However, the study's authors, Gilles Pison and Laurent Toulemon, emphasize the crucial role of immigration in this future evolution. They note that without a change in the fertility rate and migration balance in France, the population will not decline for another 20 years, as the positive migration balance will compensate for the decrease and eventual inversion of the natural balance. However, after 2040, the number of deaths will be too high for immigration to compensate for this loss, according to Gilles Pison. The current fertility rate of 1.62 children per woman is not sufficient to achieve the 'demographic rearmament' desired by Emmanuel Macron. To address this, 'there is a lot of effort to be made by society to well welcome migrants, who are an asset to the population and a richness if they are integrated,' says Laurent Toulemon. The population of France is estimated to be 68.6 million at the beginning of 2025, with a growth rate of 0.25% over the past year, mainly due to the positive migration balance (+152,000 people in 2024). The natural balance, which is the difference between births and deaths, has contributed only 1/10 to the increase in population (+17,000 people in 2024). The natural balance has been strongly reduced since 2019 due to the increase in deaths and the decrease in births. If the fertility rate remains at 1.62 children per woman, the number of deaths will exceed the number of births as early as 2027, according to the Ined. However, if the migration balance remains at the 2024 level, the population will continue to grow for two decades, reaching a peak of 70 million in the 2040s before declining to 68 million in 2070. The population will then gradually decline to 68 million by 2070. In this scenario, the French population will be composed of slightly more men and slightly fewer children and elderly women in 2070. However, variations in fertility rates, migration balances, or health shocks, such as the COVID-19 crisis, could modify the size and composition of the future population, warn the researchers. 'It is still possible for fertility to remain high in France, as it has been for 20 years, due to the ease of reconciling family and professional life,' notes Laurent Toulemon. The only certainty is that the French population will age significantly, leading to an increase in the needs for personal services. According to an official report published in 2023, the number of French people aged 75-84 will increase by 50% between 2020 and 2030, from 4.1 to 6.1 million. In the following decade, the number of people over 85 will increase by more than 50%.

**Christian to become minority in US by..., this religion will become majority population in America, is it Muslim?**
According to a recent report by the Pew Research Center, the Christian population in the US is expected to decline significantly by 2070. In 2020, around 64% of Americans identified as Christians, but by 2070, this number could drop to 46%, making Christians no longer the majority in the US. The report attributes this decline to the aging Christian population, with older generations passing away and younger, non-religious individuals raising their children without religion. Meanwhile, other religions are expected to grow, mainly due to ongoing immigration trends, and could make up 12% of the US population by 2070. The report also highlights that 34% of people raised as Christians will leave the faith by the age of 30, with 31% having no religious affiliation. By 2050, Christianity's share in the US will continue to decline, and by 2060, it will fall below 50%. By 2070, the Christian population in the US is expected to drop to 46%, making them no longer the majority, but still the most common religious group.

**US Population to Become Less Christian by 2070, Report Predicts**
According to a report by the Pew Research Center, the Christian population in the US will decline from 64% in 2020 to 46% by 2070, making them a minority. The report also predicts that the non-Christian population will increase to 41% and other religious groups will make up 13% of the population. The report suggests that the decline in Christian population is due to a switch in faith among 34% of people who were born into Christian families, with 3% converting to non-Christian faiths and 31% becoming unaffiliated. On the other hand, 21% of people who were unaffiliated will convert to Christianity by the age of 30. The report also takes into account factors such as migration, fertility rates, and mortality rates among different religious groups. As per the report, the US will have a diverse religious landscape by 2070, with no single religion dominating the population.

**Global Population Growth Is Rapidly Declining - Here's Why**
According to the UN, the world's population growth has rapidly declined over the last few years, with many countries having already peaked and set to decline by the end of the century. Experts predict an 80% chance that the world population will peak before 2100, down from a 30% chance just a decade ago. The drastic reduction in fertility rates, which is below 2.1 in over half of all nations, is the main reason for this change. China, which was once the world's most populous country, has now surpassed its peak and is on the way down, with a predicted 14% decrease in population by 2054. The widespread drop-off in fertility rates can be largely explained by demographic transition, where women have fewer babies as nations become increasingly industrialized. This downturn in fertility rates, combined with increasing life expectancy, will fundamentally shift the demographic make-up of a population, with older people outnumbering under 18s by around 2070.
