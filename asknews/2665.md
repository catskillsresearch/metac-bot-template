**Tesla not ready to Make in India, says Union Minister: Report**
Union Minister HD Kumaraswamy stated that Tesla is unlikely to manufacture its cars in India, citing the company's current interest in opening showrooms rather than setting up a local production unit. The Indian government recently launched a new electric vehicle (EV) policy aimed at attracting global carmakers to set up production units in the country. The policy offers benefits to companies that invest at least $486 million to build EVs in India, including a lower import tax of 15%. While Tesla appears to be holding back, other global companies like Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen have shown interest in the Indian EV policy. The government hopes to increase local production, create jobs, and lower prices for Indian buyers, with the goal of raising the share of EVs to 30% by 2030.

**Tesla not keen on local production in India, minister says**
Tesla does not want to produce cars in India, according to a federal minister. Despite this, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen are eyeing India's new electric vehicle policy, which significantly cuts import taxes for foreign automakers that pledge to invest in building EVs domestically. The policy, designed to lure Tesla to set up manufacturing in the country, requires companies to set up a manufacturing facility in India and commence operations within three years. Domestic players like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have invested millions of dollars in local EV manufacturing and lobbied against duty cuts. India's EV sales, dominated by Tata Motors, accounted for just 2.5% of total car sales in 2024, and the government wants to increase this to 30% by 2030.
