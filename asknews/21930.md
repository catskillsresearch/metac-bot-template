**2025 Peace Report: No Common Value Basis with Trump's US**
The 2025 Peace Report states that there is no common value basis with the US under Trump's administration. The transatlantic partnership is 'at the end', according to Christopher Daase, a political scientist from the Leibniz Institute for Conflict and Security Research (PRIF). Europe must become 'defence-capable without the US or against it', he demands. The report states that 'it is currently bad for peace'. The trust in the fundamental security institutions that maintain the European peace order has been deeply shaken. The US has also become a 'security risk' as a global stability anchor. Daase says that Trump has managed to 'transform the oldest democracy in the world into an authoritarian regime in a short time and without much resistance'. The US administration has no 'common value basis' with Europe. The US President pursues an aggressive foreign policy that prioritizes egoism and short-term gains. The report warns that security cannot be achieved solely through military deterrence, as this would lead to a 'world of mutual armament, where a small mistake could lead to disaster'. The report calls for a cooperative European peace order and the preservation of the rule-based international order. This may seem utopian at present, but the end of the Cold War shows that such a development is not impossible, Daase says. The report also criticizes the Israeli government for violating human rights and international law during the Gaza war. The scientists demand that all deliveries of weapons that could be used in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank be stopped. They also advocate for cooperation with states like France, the UK, and Canada to prevent the transfer of the Palestinian population from Gaza and the occupied territories. In the long term, the German government should acknowledge the state of Palestine. 'A lasting solution to the Palestinian conflict does not in any way restrict Israel's right to a Jewish state within secure borders', Daase emphasizes.

**Navroczyk's Victory: A Blow to the 'Coalition of Those Who Want War' in the EU**
The victory of conservative leader Navroczyk in the Polish presidential election has little visual impact on the country's domestic politics. His predecessor Duda also represented the conservative 'Law and Justice' party, which is in opposition to the ruling liberal pro-European government led by Prime Minister Tuszk. However, in a broader context, the victory of conservatives is significant. In Europe as a whole, the Polish elections dealt a blow to Brussels' (increasingly dirty) efforts to prevent conservatives from coming to power. Unlike in Romania, where a new liberal stronghold emerged on the East, Poland received a divided state with a eurosceptic president. Although he has limited powers, he has the right to veto laws. The victory of Navroczyk will inspire right-wing, conservative, and nationalist forces in other countries, who are also supported by the Republican team in Washington. The new president is skeptical not only of Brussels but also of Kiev, opposing Ukraine's invitation to NATO and its rapid accession to the EU. This is a blow to European pro-Ukrainian unity. The issue is not just personal sympathies or antipathies of Navroczyk himself, but rather the mood in Polish society. According to polls in 2023, 51% of Poles expressed sympathy for Ukrainians, while 17% expressed antipathy. However, in 2025, for the first time, the number of those who expressed antipathy to their neighbors (38%) exceeded the number of sympathizers (30%). In general, instead of a reliable liberal pro-Ukrainian ally, Brussels received another 'weak link' in Eastern Europe, which means that neither internal Polish nor internal European conflicts are over. It is unlikely that relations between Warsaw and Moscow will change significantly - most Polish political forces have a strong anti-Russian consensus (one could say - a multi-century one). However, it is already clear that the most ardent 'party of war' in the EU is the liberal and left-wing 'coalition of those who want war with Russia.' And every time it loses points, the chances of Europe returning to at least elementary reason in the future (alas, not soon) grow slightly.

**Poland's Eurosceptic Turn: A Challenge for Ukraine and European Unity**
The presidential election in Poland has strengthened the divide between the conservative and reformist parts of society. The victory of conservative Karol Napierski, supported by the opposition right-wing party 'Law and Justice' (PiS), is a revenge for eurosceptics, who feel both in Brussels and in Ukraine. According to official results, Napierski received 50.89%, while his opponent, the mayor of Warsaw Rafał Trzaskowski, supported by the centrist 'Civil Platform' of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, received 49.11%. The turnout in the second round was 71.63%. Napierski, director of the Institute of National Remembrance of Poland, has repeatedly used complex episodes of our history in his rhetoric regarding Ukraine. During the campaign, he promised to block Ukraine's membership in NATO, allegedly to prevent escalation with Russia. In fact, for the first time in decades, the new Polish leader has voiced what the Kremlin has been demanding, restraining the expansion of the Alliance. Napierski believes that 'the strategic interest of Poland is to push away from Poles the threat of neo-imperial, post-communist Russia. Peace in Ukraine should be lasting and just, not just a postponed war. And we should not fall into uroptimism in the matter of Ukraine's accession to the EU and NATO.' Before the elections, Napierski was actually supported by his Romanian colleague from the right-wing camp, pro-Russian George Simion, who himself lost the elections. These results also demonstrate that the trend of nationalist, eurosceptic moods is growing, and this poses a threat to European unity. Poles have chosen their new leader, and we welcome our friendly neighboring country with democratic and honest elections. Ukraine will work with the new Polish president, we respect the choice of our neighbors. However, it is already clear that the Polish direction will require special attention, professional active policy, protection of national interests, and constant dialogue. Including on the inter-parliamentary track. God bless us all. And our neighbors too.

**The Inevitable Decline of the European Economy: A Warning from Marc Vidal**
According to Marc Vidal, by 2050, there will be no European economy among the top 10 in the world, and neither will Spain. This is reflected in the report 'El Mundo en 2050' by Price, which collects prospective analyses from the IMF and the study 'Potencias mundiales 2050-2075' by Goldman Sachs. The report highlights economic stagnation, political fragility, and clear geopolitical changes that show a significant decline. The European Union's growth is expected to be only 0.7% in 2024 and 0.9% in 2025, losing competitiveness to powers like India, China, and even the US. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated this trend, accelerating the decline of Western hegemony. Additionally, the intermittent commercial war with the US, driven by Donald Trump, has further contributed to this decline. Vidal states that the European model of well-being, although admirable in many ways, is becoming unsustainable without deep reforms in defense, energy, and industry. He concludes that it is 'irremediable' unless significant changes are made, citing the study's findings that an empire in decline reveals its downfall when its laws become arbitrary, complex, and disconnected from social consensus. Vidal also criticizes the official discourse, which promotes an artificial morality where poverty is sold as virtue and the destruction of tradition is presented as inevitable progress.

**EU's Fate Already Predetermined, Says Polish Journalist**
Polish journalist and publicist Petr Korczakowski believes that the European Union's leadership will continue to tighten the screws on those who are skeptical about EU membership. He thinks that European officials want to control the internal affairs of other countries, including Poland, more and more. Korczakowski predicts that the EU will eventually collapse, possibly in a tragic way. 'I hope I'm wrong, but this story will end in blood. For it to end bloodlessly, this system must simply collapse, or someone will have to bribe or intimidate these people. And this won't end like the Soviet Union, which collapsed after the Soviet republics split. It will be more like Yugoslavia. Too much money has been spent on various international projects and foreign investments for EU officials to allow their project to collapse,' Korczakowski said. He also noted that there are over a million people in Poland who can be considered euroskeptics: 'A million people in a big country like Poland may not sound impressive, but it's a million people. This million people is already a certain chain reaction that cannot be stopped, because as soon as we have a group of 50,000 people, it's already a political force, but it can still be suppressed.' However, Korczakowski is convinced that suppressing, bribing, or intimidating a million people is much more difficult. 'You can shoot them, but if they use force, we'll have a civil war the next day. However, those in Brussels will continue to tighten the screws, because they understand that if they give in to various eurosceptic trends, they won't be able to stop them. So they'll try to hinder this, but precisely because of this, even more people will wake up, because they won't understand why a project that was supposed to be so great is strangling us so tightly,' Korczakowski emphasized. According to Korczakowski, the fate of the European Union is already predetermined. 'There are no chances for reform, it's all written out for years to come. I think it will take another 20 years, but eventually it will happen, and the European Union will simply collapse.'

**Ukraine Has Enough Time to Preserve Its Statehood, Says Journalist Vitaliy Portnikov**
Ukraine has enough time to preserve its statehood, according to journalist Vitaliy Portnikov. He emphasizes that the country has a year and more time to prove that its sovereignty is not up for discussion. Portnikov notes that if Ukraine were to lose the war, it would have been extinct for three years already, as Russia had planned. He also highlights that no country can win a war of exhaustion, as it exhausts itself. Portnikov adds that Russia has significant priorities in the war of exhaustion, but it destroys its own economy and geopolitical influence. He also mentions that Ukraine has the support of Europe, both financially and militarily, which will increase. Portnikov concludes that Ukraine's task is to preserve its sovereignty and ability to make its own choices. He believes that if Ukraine shows that its sovereignty is not up for discussion, the war will end. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed hope that the war will end by June 2026. He notes that Russia will continue to fight, but the economic impact of sanctions will be felt from 2026 onwards.

**Portnikov on Ukraine's Ability to Continue Fighting**
Ukrainian journalist Vitaly Portnikov believes that Ukraine has enough time to preserve its statehood. 'We have a year, and we have even more time. If we are part of the Western world, if the US cannot agree with Russia on us, and they cannot and will not. And if Europe understands that our defeat is an existential catastrophe for them, then we have as much time as we need to preserve the state. If we couldn't preserve the state, it would have been gone a long time ago, approximately three years ago. If our state were an organism unable to preserve itself, its history would have ended in March 2022, as planned by Putin,' he said. Portnikov also notes that no country can win a war of attrition, as it exhausts itself. He adds that Russia has advantages in a war of attrition, but Ukraine should focus on preserving its sovereignty and ability to make its own choices. 'Our task is to preserve Ukraine's sovereignty and our ability to make our own choices. As you see, Russian conditions are not about territory, but about getting rid of our independence. Russia is fighting our sovereignty because it has already understood that it cannot destroy our statehood. And now instead of destroying our statehood, it wants to destroy the sovereignty of this state. And that's what we need to overcome. If we show that our sovereignty is not up for discussion, the war will end,' Portnikov concluded. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed hope that there would be no war by June 2026. He noted that the Kremlin plans to continue fighting, but there is an analysis by many intelligence agencies that Russia's economy will feel the effects of sanctions from around summer 2026.

**The Future of Europe: Three Hypothetical Scenarios**
According to experts, there are three possible scenarios for Europe's future. The first scenario involves continuing as a junior partner to the United States and NATO, which would be a less traumatic and simpler option after a likely Ukrainian defeat. However, this would require establishing a European security area, which would be challenging due to the exponential increase in security and defense budgets, potentially straining the EU. Additionally, this scenario would exacerbate the refugee crisis and increase the risk of a large-scale war. Furthermore, Europe's energy weakness would persist, and the viability of the European Green Plan would be compromised. The second scenario involves a rightward shift in Europe, leading to a concession to Russian demands. If Russia wins the war, it would create a de facto new Iron Curtain, and countries like France and Germany might re-establish relations with Russia and increase their trade ties with China. This would lead to a division of Europe into two factions: those aligned with the United States, including the UK, and the majority of European countries. This option is unlikely and would ultimately end the idea of a united Europe. The third scenario involves Europe taking no side in the conflict, which is not impossible but unlikely. This would require resolving the energy deficit and potentially leading to the withdrawal of the United States from the continent. However, this scenario is also challenging due to the need for a significant European rearmament. Regardless of the scenario, experts agree that Europe must strengthen its politics to move beyond a timidly normative approach and focus on what unites Europeans rather than what divides them.

**Portnikov Predicts War to Continue Until 2032**
According to political observer Vasily Portnikov, the hot phase of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which typically lasts 7-10 years, may continue until 2032. After that, a phase of conflict with possible battles and bombings may begin. Portnikov emphasized the need to prepare for a peaceful next phase of the conflict, which could last at least 10-15 years, by receiving help from the Americans and Europeans, improving Ukrainian policy and mobilization, and enhancing Ukraine's military-industrial complex. 'We need to prepare and prepare for a war that is still very short in terms of the nature of this conflict. This is only the first stage. There will be a second, third,' Portnikov warned. He believes that there are no objective grounds for the war to end in the near future, but suggested that under favorable circumstances (Russia's economic situation and US pressure), the fighting may stop in this or the next year. 'The war will not end in our lifetime. The fire will stop,' he stressed.

**We are at War: The Fragmentation of Reality and the European Union's Military Plans**
In a world of increasing geopolitical polarization, the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will be a reflection of the fragmentation of our reality, which we will witness as spectators over the next two decades, looking towards the Far East. The author, a professor, has announced to their students that we are at war, just like they did in February 2022, when the drums of war were first heard. This time, the European Union is taking steps towards a possible war in five years, as announced in the Joint White Paper 'Rearm Europe 2030', which aims to prepare the European defense. The plan will cost an additional 800 billion euros over the next four years, on top of the general budget. As the author says, 'we are giving the enemy day and hour'.

**Russia's Bet on War Continuation: A Shift in the Balance of Power**
Russia is betting on the continuation of the war, as indicated by the failure of the recent peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey. The main reason for this failure is the difference in the general understanding of the outcome of these negotiations. Moscow sees the war as a means to achieve its goals, while Kyiv and the West, including the Biden administration, believe that a peaceful resolution is possible. Ukraine has been firm in its stance, refusing to compromise on its territorial integrity and its right to join NATO. However, Moscow is not impressed by Ukraine's concessions, such as the discussion of the status of Crimea or the delay of a decision on the issue. The current military situation favors Russia, and Ukraine, along with the West, is no longer able to keep up with the pace of the war. Ukraine lacks the necessary military equipment, including ammunition, and the advanced Western weapons, such as F-16 fighter jets and Patriot air defense systems, have not been able to create a balance in the war. Additionally, Ukraine lost a key supporter when President Trump stopped providing military aid to the Ukrainian forces. Furthermore, European countries have been drained and are no longer able to send more weapons, and have given up on the idea of sending troops to Ukraine. Europe's rhetoric has changed dramatically from encouraging the war in 2022 to calling for a ceasefire and an end to the conflict starting from mid-2024. Europe had previously refused to allow Turkey to host a peace agreement, and had failed to negotiate a peace deal in May 2022, but is now welcoming Turkey's role in ending the war of attrition that Ukraine is suffering from.

**EU and Allies Approve Creation of Tribunal to Prosecute Russian War Crimes**
The European Union and its allies have approved the creation of a tribunal to prosecute Russian war crimes. The tribunal will be established with international judges and will respect the highest procedural guarantees, according to the European Commission. The main task of the tribunal will be to investigate, prosecute, and judge those responsible for the crime of aggression against Ukraine, declared the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Denís Shmigal. The creation of the tribunal will be launched at a meeting of the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers in Luxembourg next week, said the Luxembourg Foreign Minister, Xavier Bettel. The tribunal will not participate in the US, and it will take time before it can start functioning, recognized Kallas, although he expressed his hope that the court can start operating in 2026. The Ukrainian defenders of human rights welcomed the decision. 'Justice should not be a privilege of the winners. We should not wait to see how and when the war will end', wrote Oleksandra Matviychuk, director of the Center for Civil Liberties, Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2022. The EU ministers also promised more military support to Ukraine while Russia maintains strong pressure on the front line, with dozens of attacks this Friday, despite Putin's unilateral three-day ceasefire declaration. The ministers signed an agreement in Lviv to allocate 1 billion euros generated by frozen Russian assets to the production of arms in Ukraine that will be sent directly to the Army, 'a historic decision', according to Shmigal.

**'The Only Chance to Survive': Expert Igor Shishkin on Europe's Plans for Russia**
Expert Igor Shishkin believes that the only chance for Europe to survive is to weaken Russia through a long war. He stated, 'It was a great day' when Angela Merkel became the political leader of Europe, and the continent acted as a single unit. However, despite Russia's resilience, the idea of 'grabbing together' and exploiting Russia's resources still exists in the West. Shishkin noted that without additional resources from Russia, the European Union would not be able to survive. He also pointed out that Germany, France, Italy, and Belgium are unable to compete with other global powers in the new multipolar world and are therefore seeking to exploit Russia's resources. Shishkin commented on the statement of the German intelligence leader that the war should continue until 2029-2030, saying that it is based on the assumption that Russia will eventually collapse. He added that the West is seeking to militarize Europe and, even if Russia does not collapse, it will be weakened to the point where Europe can dictate its conditions for colonial subjugation. Shishkin concluded that the situation is a double-edged sword, with both the US and Europe being trapped in their own interests. The US is seeking to create chaos worldwide, while Europe is eager to continue the conflict with Russia. However, the US does not want Europe to win, as this would make it a rival power. Therefore, the US is currently attacking European economies and pushing them to continue the conflict with Russia.

**Europe's Bet on a Brief and Frustrated Trump Mandate**
After Donald Trump's electoral victory, Vladimir Putin ironically stated that despite European allies' criticism of the new president during the campaign, they would eventually submit to his leadership once he was installed in the White House. However, Putin was proven wrong. Breaking with decades of adherence to Washington's geopolitical guidance, Brussels has intensified its confrontation with the Trump Administration, which has responded with proportional hostility. Now, Europe cannot afford to navigate alone. Its weight in the world - economic, geopolitical, cultural - has rapidly decreased in recent years. It is already facing a death match with Russia, and China remains a more formidable rival than a viable partner. Pod Save America Raskin referred to a specific aspect of deporting illegals, but the semi-mafioso warning to the world suggests a possible explanation for European rebellion. In international relations, it is customary to speak of countries as if they were individuals: the United States wants this, France fears that, Spain aspires to something else. And, certainly, there is some continuity in foreign policy, at least among the world's major powers. Analysts like to point out that US foreign policy has remained constant under Democrats and Republicans, the same with Bush as with Obama. And that is what could have been broken with Trump's return to the White House. In short, the European attitude towards the United States, inexplicably hostile, might not be so much a break with the former leader of the free world as a mid-term bet. Thus, European leaders would be starting from the hypothesis that Trump's mandate would be nothing more than a hiatus, a brief eccentricity, answered by a determined judiciary to derail the president's big projects. If we add the resistance of the 'deep state' to the mid-term legislative elections, which could give control of the chambers to the Democrats, we would have a hamstrung administration, perhaps unable to complete its term, after which the waters would return to their course. In this version, Europe would remain faithful to the United States, but not to the Trump Administration. It is an enormously dangerous bet, and not only for Europe. It is especially so for the United States, which is living for the first time in its history, since the Civil War, a fierce internal confrontation that does not respect the most elementary institutional formalities. One of the principles of any constitutional democracy is the peaceful acceptance of the election winner, and institutional loyalty, especially towards the outside. Threatening countries that collaborate voluntarily with yours because they govern your enemies has never been seen in the United States and does not bode well. Nor are these words of Raskin in the interview reassuring: 'We have to become leaders of a national popular movement to stop the fall of fascism in the United States.'

**Ukraine's War: Former Spokesperson Predicts Continued Conflict**
According to former spokesperson of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Vladyslav Selezniov, there are no realistic scenarios for the end of the war in Ukraine, except for one side's capitulation. 'There is no other option, except for the capitulation of one of the parties in the Russian-Ukrainian war de facto. Putin does not give up his plans to destroy Ukraine, and we want to survive, resist, ensure our independence, and restore our territorial integrity. Therefore, I think the war will continue until one side is completely exhausted and surrenders,' Selezniov said. He believes that support for Ukraine from Europe will increase. 'I do not indulge in illusions about the United States - it is obvious. I do not think it is worth expecting a breakthrough and changes in the US's foreign policy vector,' Selezniov said. He added that European friends and partners understand that they may become the next target if Ukraine does not hold out. 'They are primarily interested in investing in their own safe future by providing arms and military equipment to the Ukrainian military. This is obvious. Therefore, the war will continue. The Center for Countering Disinformation states that the enemy has resources for 2025-2026 to conduct active offensive operations. Perhaps, the resources will not be enough by the end of 2026, but the next year will be quite dynamic in terms of the enemy's attempts to attack,' Selezniov said. He added that 'we depend on European partners, but we cover at least part of our military needs ourselves.' When asked about the possibility of a sudden end to the war, Selezniov replied: 'I remember the previous 25 ceasefire agreements that were signed by officials. None of them worked. We all wait for good news, but we should not indulge in illusions, given Putin's position and his entourage.'

**DAN MCLAUGHLIN: Trump has bet his legacy on two daring gambles**
President Donald Trump has taken two significant risks in his presidency: starting a 'war' and vowing to end another. His gamble on Ukraine has led to a 30-day ceasefire agreement between Kyiv and Russia, but the odds of success are still low. Trump's detractors argue that his position on Ukraine is a departure from decades of GOP policy, but he is betting that if he gets results, nobody will care if it was winning ugly. However, the thorniest issues remain, including Zelenskyy's demands for the Western world to guarantee Ukraine's security and Russia's insistence on disarming and isolating Ukraine. Meanwhile, the tariff war with the EU and Canada is still ongoing, and Trump's margin for error is shrinking. If he fails to turn around the country's economic dynamics, his party will be punished in the 2026 midterm elections and his second term in office will be politically neutered. 'It takes two to tango,' Trump said, but peace remains a long way off.

**These countries will have Islamic rule in next 20 years, check names, chilling predictions made by Baba Vanga**
Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian mystic and healer, made several predictions about future events, including a conflict in Europe and the eventual fall of Europe under Muslim rule by 2043. According to Vanga, communist rule will return globally by 2076, and the world will end in 5079 due to a natural event. Critics argue that Vanga's prophecies are often vague and subject to interpretation, making it difficult to verify their accuracy. As Vanga said, 'the world will ultimately end in 5079 due to a natural event.' However, it is worth noting that several of Vanga's past predictions have come true, but their ambiguous nature has led to skepticism. 'Europe will fall under Muslim rule by 2043,' Vanga predicted, but the exact details of her predictions remain unclear. 'By 2076, communist rule will return globally,' she also forecasted, but the accuracy of these predictions is uncertain. 'The world will ultimately end in 5079 due to a natural event,' Vanga predicted, but the exact nature of this event remains unknown.

**No Humanity, No Democracy: The EU's Crisis and the US's Role**
The Conference of Yalta and Potsdam without the UK, with Europe absent, is a continuation of the division of the continent between the two winning powers of the European civil war. The recent mass in Paris organized by Macron has highlighted the disunity of the EU in security policy and values. Luis García Montero recalled the argument of American philosopher Martha Nussbaum that the regression of humanism deprives citizens of the skills necessary for critical thinking. He added that we are witnessing the reverse of the great principles of the Enlightenment: liberty, equality, and fraternity, replaced by the law of the strongest, hate speech, and disrespect for human dignity. US Vice President Vance's intervention in Munich was characterized by hostility and hypocrisy. He said that the main threat to Europe is not Russia or China, but the loss of its values. Vance accused Europe of censoring dissidents, closing churches, and canceling elections. He advocated for absolute freedom of communication, including fake news, and made jokes, saying, 'If the US democracy has survived Greta Thunberg's speeches, you can handle Elon Musk for a few months.' Vance encouraged European voters to establish strong democratic mandates, a bet on authoritarian governments, as demonstrated by his support for Alternative for Germany. Trump has gone even further, clearly taking Putin's side to end the conflict. He has despised Zelenski without mercy, calling him a 'modestly successful comedian.' He has accused Zelenski of starting a war he couldn't win, after manipulating Biden. Trump considers Zelenski a dictator for refusing to hold elections because he would lose, given his low poll numbers. The situation in Europe is summarized by Professor Ruth Ferrero as the triple i: impotence in the face of US imperial action, dividing Ukraine with Russia, indignation at the humiliation of its military protector, and irrelevance in the global scene and the fate of its continent. Trump and Putin are taking the initiative, and the values of European liberal democracies that bother Vance are human rights. Nussbaum argues that without humanity, there is no democracy, but Russians and Americans are in a different phase.

**Ukraine Conflict: Who Will Be the Winners and Losers?**
The US and Russia seem to be taking matters into their own hands to resolve the nearly three-year-long conflict in Ukraine, with a meeting held in Saudi Arabia without Ukraine's presence and minimal European participation. According to Guillaume Lavoie, a member associated with the Raoul-Dandurand Chair, 'It was very easy to end the war. You just have to call Vladimir Putin and give him what he wants or a good part of what he wants.' Lavoie believes that under President Biden, there was an idea that the Russian regime was malevolent and that the aggression against Ukraine was illegal and unacceptable, but these preconditions do not exist under President Trump. Putin seems to be winning his bet initiated when he invaded Ukraine in February 2022, as he has obtained a significant portion of what he wants and has maintained control of the territory already conquered. However, Lavoie notes that the 'security guarantee' that Putin might announce does not hold much weight. The US and the Western coalition seem to be giving Putin the latitude to play the long game, and it is unclear if they will be able to last this time. The resources of Ukraine, including rare earth minerals, coal, and wheat, may be part of the negotiations, with the US potentially gaining the upper hand. If Ukraine is excluded from the negotiations, it could be a significant loser in a conflict resolution orchestrated by Washington, as could the rest of Europe. Lavoie notes that Europeans have only themselves to blame for not having a real security policy for decades.
