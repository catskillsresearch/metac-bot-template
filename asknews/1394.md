**Investment Preferences Shift: Experts Predict Rise of AI, Tokenized Properties, and Gold**
Investors' preferences are shifting due to technological advancements, demographic changes, and economic fluctuations. Experts predict that artificial intelligence, tokenized properties, and gold will be the top investment choices in the coming years. Currently, approximately 48.7% of global investments are in real estate, with a total value of $380 trillion. Bonds and stocks follow, with $133 trillion and $124 trillion, respectively. Gold and cryptocurrencies trail behind, with a total market value of $22.4 trillion and $3.6 trillion, respectively. Despite being the least popular investment option, cryptocurrencies have provided the highest returns to investors in recent years. For example, Bitcoin has increased by approximately 3100% since 2018. In contrast, gold has grown by 167%, stocks by 66%, bonds by 29.4%, and global real estate by 22.5% over the same period. Experts believe that investment preferences will shift towards digital and thematic areas in the future, driven by economic, technological, demographic, and climate factors. Tokenized properties, which are becoming increasingly popular, may reduce the high entry costs associated with real estate. Younger investors are turning to digital assets with smaller capital, while aging populations may lead to decreased demand for housing in some countries. Traditional safe-haven assets like bonds are losing their appeal due to rising government debt and declining credit ratings. Stock markets, on the other hand, continue to offer long-term investment opportunities in sectors like artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, cloud technology, and biotechnology. Gold remains a popular investment option during times of uncertainty, but experts warn that factors like space mining may increase gold supply and drive down prices in the future. Cryptocurrencies are growing as an alternative to traditional finance, with an estimated 560 million people, or 7% of the global population, using them by 2024. According to ARK Invest, the value of this market could reach $12 trillion by 2030 and $50 trillion by 2050.

**AI Predicts Russia's Future: Breakup, Local Conflicts, or Deep Political Transformations?**
ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence, has made a prediction about the future of Russia, which is facing economic problems and internal political conflicts due to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The AI suggests that the fate of the aggressor state will depend on further sanctions and how long the current regime in the Kremlin will last. According to ChatGPT, there are several possible scenarios for Russia's future. A long-term scenario (more than 20 years) could lead to the country's breakup into several independent states. A short-term scenario (5-10 years) may involve local conflicts or the strengthening of separatist movements in certain regions. A medium-term scenario (10-20 years) could result in deeper political transformations that may change the status of individual regions. ChatGPT also identified several factors that could influence Russia's future, including internal economic problems caused by sanctions, dependence on energy resources, and demographic challenges. Additionally, the AI mentioned the importance of political stability, national movements within the country, and external pressure and international policy. When asked about the death of Russian dictator Putin, ChatGPT replied, 'I understand your question, but making predictions about the death of specific individuals is an ethical and delicate topic that I cannot discuss.' It's worth noting that Russian propaganda has been spreading a fake narrative that the West plans to break up Russia into 10-20 separate parts, allegedly as part of a 'conspiracy by Western elites.'

**"Stop sugar-coating it": Anthropic CEO says AI will slash 50% of entry-level white collar jobs  --  leaving Gen Z out of work**
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned that AI could take over up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs, saying that the government needs to 'stop sugar-coating' the threat AI poses to the job market. Amodei stated, 'We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming.' This comes as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates predicts that AI will replace humans for most things, with a few professions surviving the revolution. LinkedIn Chief Economic Opportunity Officer Aneesh Raman echoed similar sentiments, comparing AI's threat to the decline of manufacturing in the 1980s. Meanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed the claims, saying that the AGI moment will come within the next 5 years and have surprisingly little societal impact.

**The Rise of Superintelligence: A New Era for the Economy**
A recent note, 'Superintelligence Strategy', has warned of the potential consequences of a superintelligence or AGI (artificial general intelligence) takeover. The authors, Eric Schmidt, Alexandr Wang, and Dan Hendrycks, predict that AGI will arrive within 24-36 months, driven by the laws of scale, which suggest that increased computing power, data, and model complexity will lead to greater AI progress. The note's authors argue that the development of AGI will have significant economic and societal implications, including the potential for job displacement and a shift towards an economy of abundance. They also suggest that governments and investors are already preparing for this shift, with the US government, for example, planning to develop strategies to mitigate the risks of AGI. The authors conclude that measuring the capacity of AGI to innovate is crucial, as it could either accelerate technological progress and improve material satisfaction with fewer resources, or lead to a significant shift in societal structures.

**AI Godfathers Warn of "Suicidal" AGI Race  --  Are We on the Brink of Disaster?**
Top AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Stuart Russell, have warned that the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could lead to a catastrophic outcome. AGI will have the ability to set its own goals, making it inherently uncontrollable. AI predictions suggest that AGI could be the biggest existential threat humanity has ever faced, with potential consequences including deception, emergent behavior, and loss of control. The 'paperclip maximizer' problem, where an AGI optimizes its goal at the expense of everything else, is a real concern. Additionally, AGI could lead to mass unemployment and wealth concentration, as well as a geopolitical arms race. The public perception of AI is shaped by companies that benefit from downplaying its risks, and ethical AI initiatives are lacking teeth. The AI predictions coming from leading scientists and researchers are not exaggerated, and the risks of AGI are real.

**Sam Altman Hints at More Open-Source AI as OpenAI Moves Toward AGI**
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has hinted at the possibility of open-sourcing more AI as the company moves towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Altman noted that the cost of using AI has fallen 150 times between early 2023 and mid-2024, and that lower prices lead to increased use. He outlined three key economic trends in AI: intelligence scaling predictably with resource investment, a rapid decline in AI costs, and super-exponential socioeconomic value from increasing intelligence. Altman warned that the impact of AGI will be uneven across industries, and that intervention may be necessary to prevent a shift in the balance of power between capital and labor. He emphasized the importance of prioritizing individual empowerment and cautioned against authoritarian control of AI. Altman also projected that AI agents could eventually handle tasks similar to junior developers at top firms, though requiring supervision.
