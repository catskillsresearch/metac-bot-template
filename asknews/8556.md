**Senators to Visit Detained Brazilian Women in the US**
A group of senators will visit the United States in the coming days to visit three Brazilian women detained for immigration irregularities and accused of involvement in the January 8, 2023 coup acts. The mission was approved by the Senate's Human Rights Commission and will be funded with congressional resources. According to Senator Eduardo Girão, the women claim political persecution and are awaiting asylum analysis by the US government. Girão states, 'These women left Brazil in search of political protection against political and judicial persecution in the processes that accused them of violent abolition of the Democratic State of Law, coup, qualified damage by violence and grave threat, with the use of flammable substance, against the Union's property, deterioration of a listed property and armed organized crime association.' He argues that there is no evidence that they participated in acts of vandalism or invaded public buildings, saying, 'There is no indication that they invaded public buildings or participated in acts of depredation, only entering a building to protect themselves from the bombs being lit by helicopters.' Girão classifies the situation as a reflection of 'arbitrary acts' and defends that the Senate act in the oversight of possible abuses.

**The Inconstitucionalidade of PEC 12/2022 and the Periodicity of the Vote**
The Proposed Amendment to the Constitution (PEC) 12/2022 aims to alter the duration of elected officials' mandates to five years, prohibit immediate re-election, and unify national, municipal, and state elections. However, this proposal is considered inconstitucional and inconvenient, particularly regarding the duration of mandates and simultaneous elections. The PEC would remove the possibility of discussing the country and city at different times, distance elected officials from voters, and postpone the period of accountability and subsequent electoral responsibility. The only proposal that may have some sense is the prohibition of immediate re-election in the Executive, but this does not prevent the maintenance of political oligarchies or abuse of power. Other topics, such as the institution of recall, the alteration of the electoral system, the redistribution of the number of legislators, the presence of women and indigenous people in parliament, are left unaddressed. Examples from other countries, such as Argentina and Italy, may be interesting, such as party primaries, a Senate with proportional seats per state, renewal of half of the Chamber and a third of the Senate every two years, second-round elections for the Legislature, and seats for Brazilians living abroad.

**Brazilian Senators to Visit Detained Women in US Amid Human Rights Concerns**
A Brazilian Senate committee, funded by the National Congress, will travel to the United States to visit four Brazilian women who fled the country after participating in the January 8th coup attempt. The women, who were detained by the Trump administration for attempting to enter the US, have been held in a US prison for four months awaiting a decision on their asylum requests. According to Senator Eduardo Girão, the women were not involved in any violent acts, but rather sought protection from what he calls 'political persecution'. Girão argues that the committee's visit is necessary to investigate the women's prison conditions and potential human rights violations. 'These women have been imprisoned for 4 months in an American prison waiting for a decision from the American justice on their political asylum requests,' Girão emphasizes. 'There is no indication that they invaded public buildings or participated in acts of vandalism, they only entered a building to protect themselves from the bombs that were being lit by helicopters,' he argues. Girão also states that the mission reinforces the Senate's commitment to defending human rights. 'Therefore, it is essential that the Senate's Human Rights Committee carries out a diligence, with urgency, to verify the conditions of these prisoners and investigate the allegations of abuses and human rights violations. The visit will provide a direct assessment of the situation and will help to promote the accountability of all those involved in these arbitrary acts,' he says.

**Climate Change and Women: Impacts and Prospective Views**
The effects of climate change on women are becoming increasingly severe, with women being more vulnerable to its impacts. According to the IPCC, the economic costs of climate change in developing countries will range from $290 billion to $580 billion annually by 2030. Additionally, 189 million people, mostly women and children, are affected annually by extreme weather events in developing countries since 1991. The IPCC has released a report outlining possible future scenarios under continued climate change, including a scenario where global carbon dioxide emissions are reduced to zero by 2050, aligning with the Paris Agreement's goals. However, an opposing scenario assumes a doubling of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, leading to a 4.4°C temperature increase by 2100, which will undoubtedly affect women's health worldwide. The article emphasizes the need for international cooperation and education to mitigate the effects of climate change on women and promote sustainable development.

**Brazilian Senators to Visit Detained Women in US After January 8th Coup Attempt**
A Brazilian Senate committee, paid for by the National Congress, will travel to the United States to visit four Brazilian women who fled to the US after participating in the January 8th coup attempt. The women, who were detained by the Trump administration, are being held in El Paso, Texas. According to the committee's request, the women were arrested for attempting to enter the US after fleeing Brazil. Three of the women have been convicted by the Supreme Court for their involvement in the coup attempt, while the fourth is still awaiting trial. The committee's request, approved by the Senate's Human Rights Committee, aims to investigate the women's prison conditions and potential human rights violations. 'These women have been imprisoned for 4 months in an American prison waiting for a decision from the American justice system on their asylum requests,' said Senator Eduardo Girão. 'There is no indication that they invaded public buildings or participated in acts of vandalism, they only entered a building to protect themselves from the bombs being dropped by helicopters.' Girão also stated that the mission reinforces the Senate's commitment to defending human rights. 'Therefore, it is essential that the Senate's Human Rights Committee conducts an investigation, with urgency, to verify the conditions of these prisoners and investigate the allegations of abuses and human rights violations.

**Brazilian Senate to Send Delegation to Visit Fugitives in the US**
The Brazilian Senate will send a delegation to visit three women accused of involvement in the January 8th event who fled to the United States to avoid arrest. The senators will visit the three women in El Paso, Texas, where they are being held for being in an illegal situation in the US, not for the January 8th event. The request for the visit was made by Senator Eduardo Girão and approved on Wednesday (28/5) by the Senate's Human Rights Commission. According to Girão, 'It is essential that the Human Rights Commission of the Senate carries out an investigation, with urgency, to verify the conditions of these prisoners and investigate the allegations of abuses and human rights violations.' The four women, Michely Paiva Alves, Cristiane da Silva, Rosana Maciel Gomes, and Raquel Lopes de Souza, are accused of crimes such as violent abolition of the State, qualified damage to the Union's property, deterioration of a protected heritage, and organized crime association. However, Cristiane was deported to Brazil on May 24th.

**French Women's Health: A Major Gap in Medical Care**
A new survey by the Agir pour le Cœur des Femmes association reveals that one in four French women consider their health to be bad or very bad. The survey, which questioned 2054 women, found that over a third of them have experienced a lack of listening or minimization of their symptoms during medical consultations. This proportion reaches 60% among women under 25. The survey highlights a major gap in the medical care of women, particularly in the field of cardio-gynécologie. Despite cardiovascular diseases being the leading cause of mortality among women, half of them have never discussed the topic with a healthcare professional. Thierry Drilhon, co-founder of the association, emphasizes that 'prevention and taking care of one's health is not just about consulting a doctor when you're sick, it's an investment. We must all take responsibility to abandon the curative model and turn towards prevention.' The survey also found that 74% of women resort to self-medication before consulting a doctor, and that 30% of them have cancelled or postponed a medical appointment for family reasons or because they no longer thought it necessary. The association is calling for a general mobilization to address these issues, including training healthcare professionals in cardio-gynécologie, developing targeted information campaigns, and involving companies in the health of their employees.

**Letters to the editor: May 30, 2025**
The Senate's budget bill has been criticized for taking from the poor to give to the rich, earning it the nickname 'Hood Robin Bill'. Economist Robert Reich estimates that Americans making between $17,000 and $51,000 will lose $700 a year, while those with incomes of less than $17,000 will lose over $1,000 a year. In contrast, the top 0.1% of earners will gain nearly $390,000 a year. Additionally, the article discusses the misuse of artificial intelligence, comparing it to a high school student who steals answers from classmates. It also criticizes PG&E's rate increase, with the CEO predicting a decrease despite a 68.6% increase in bills over the last five years. Furthermore, the article expresses opposition to rainbow crosswalks, and supports President Trump's executive order banning transgender women from competing in female sports, citing concerns about fairness and women's rights.

**Akpabio Reiterates Support for Greater Female Representation in Governance - METRO DAILY Ng**
The President of the Senate, Godswill Akpabio, has reiterated his support for greater female representation in governance, stating that a lack of female participation in politics is a missed opportunity for progress. He described women as 'better managers' and strong decision-makers, and lamented the challenges they face in political spaces, including a lack of female voting for female candidates. Akpabio advised women activists to do more to win converts for the 'Reserved Seats for Women Bill', which aims to increase female representation in the National Assembly. Osasu Igbinedion, leader of the advocacy group, said, 'This bill is not asking for charity; it is calling for justice. It is not about reducing the space for men; it is about expanding the possibilities for Nigeria.' The Senate President's endorsement of the bill is seen as a turning point, which will send a powerful message across Nigeria that the Senate is ready to lead with integrity and act with boldness in pursuit of equality. Currently, Nigeria ranks among the lowest in Africa for women's representation in parliament, with women occupying less than 5% of seats in the National Assembly.

**Brazilian Senate Debates Proposal to Reserve 20% of Parliamentary Seats for Women**
The Brazilian Senate's Commission of Constitution and Justice (CCJ) debated a proposal to reserve 20% of parliamentary seats for women, which would be valid for 20 years. The proposal is part of a new Electoral Code project (PLP 112/2021) that aims to unify seven existing laws. The project also includes new rules for campaign finance, a four-year quarentena for police, judges, and military personnel seeking office, and stricter regulations for online election propaganda. Senator Marcelo Castro defended the 20% quota, arguing that over 700 municipalities in Brazil have no female representation in their legislatures. 'Every meeting that deals with politics in any municipality in Brazil will have at least two women. These women will serve as an example for other women. They will have a mandate, visibility, and an assistant, and they will have parliamentary amendments,' he said. However, Senator Dr. Hiran opposed the quota, arguing that it would be difficult for the public to understand why women with low vote counts would represent the society that voted for men with higher vote counts. Senator Espiridião Amim suggested that the quota would be a 'deficit cultural' and that it would be necessary to stimulate women's participation in politics. Senator Eliziane Gama defended the quota, citing that several countries in Latin America have higher female representation in politics than Brazil. 'We are the country in 136th place in the world in terms of female participation. Venezuela has 32% of female participation. We have around 17% to 18%. When I was elected federal deputy, I was the only woman elected from Maranhão in 2014,' she said. Senator Soraya Thronicke defended parity in politics, with 50% for men and 50% for women, but said that the proposal is an advance. 'I would like to mention some countries in Latin America that already have parity: Mexico, Nicaragua, Cuba, a country that is completely closed has parity, and we here, with all this democracy, do not have parity. Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina have parity. And Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, cannot even discuss parity,' she said.

**Women at the Heart of a Green Future: Empowering Change in Renewable Energy | Science-Environment**
Women play a crucial role in shaping a sustainable energy future, yet they comprise only 32% of the renewable energy workforce. Sanjana Chhantyal, a 30-year-old leader in the 2030 leadership network, shares her journey of overcoming barriers to education and resources. She emphasizes the importance of women's lived experiences, creativity, and leadership in building energy systems that are both technically and humanely effective. A toolkit has been developed to guide students toward higher education, and the 'Women in Energy' project aims to reframe the energy sector as more than just an engineering field. The article highlights the need for financial inclusion, safety in finance, and the use of gender-responsive financial instruments to support women's participation in the energy sector. According to the article, universal energy access could lift 185 million women out of poverty by 2050. Chhantyal notes, 'Women’s lived experiences, creativity, and leadership are essential to building energy systems that work—not just technically, but humanely.'

**The great imbalance: Women make up half of NH’s population. You wouldn’t know it by looking at the Legislature**
New Hampshire has a significant imbalance in its government representation, despite women making up 50.1% of the state's population. According to data from Rutgers University's Center for American Women in Politics, women hold only 35.8% of the legislative seats. The largest gender gap is in the 400-person House, where women are underrepresented. Historically, women have briefly reached gender parity in the 24-person Senate, but currently, they are outnumbered by one seat. The lack of representation is a concern, and efforts are needed to address this imbalance.

**This One Demographic Will Receive 'Most' of the $124 Trillion Great Wealth Transfer: 'More Money Than Ever Before'**
According to a report from the Bank of America Institute, women are expected to receive the majority of the $124 trillion great wealth transfer by 2048, with close to $100 trillion going to women. The study estimates that $47 trillion will shift to women in younger generations as inherited wealth and $54 trillion will go to surviving spouses, 95% of whom are expected to be women. This transfer is expected to have a profound impact on how women use their money, with increased demand and spending on services, products, and experiences tailored toward women. Bank of America research also found that women have more wealth, independence, and opportunity than previous generations, with 1.4 billion women between 50 and 70 years old expected to grow to 2.1 billion by 2050. As a result, the bank predicts that women will soon control more money than ever before, with women representing 85% of solo travelers and driving demand for women-only travel options.

**Gender and Age: We need a female perspective on ageing populations**
The world is experiencing a significant demographic shift with a growing proportion of older people. By 2050, 82 million people aged 65 and older will live in the US, and 80% of older adults will live in low- and middle-income countries. This poses challenges to healthcare systems and economies, with every 1% increase in healthcare burden resulting in a 0.083% decrease in GDP growth rate. Social isolation affects one in four people worldwide, with over 2 million people in England over 75 living alone. Women are more likely to experience loneliness, especially with disability, and face greater disadvantages of 'multiple forms of inequality' throughout their lifespan. As the UN's decade for 'healthy ageing' (2021-30) is underway, nations must include 'social' perspectives in policies and programmes to fight social isolation and loneliness, focusing on the special needs of women. 'They encounter tremendous hardship in their twilight years as they fight against the twin challenges of patriarchy and vulnerability,' noted an exploratory research study among older women residents of a care home in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.

**Survey: Will Women Have Achieved Equality by 2050?**
A recent survey by Elle magazine reveals that 67% of respondents believe that women will hold the top position in the country by 2050. Currently, only 19% of mayors in France are women. The survey also shows that 74% of French people think that education will be less influenced by gender stereotypes in 25 years. However, 83% of those who believe that certain jobs are still gendered think that they will remain so in 2050. The survey also found that 67% of respondents believe that the salary gap between men and women will disappear by 2050, and 77% think that promotions and bonuses will be distributed fairly. Additionally, 83% of respondents believe that there will be a more equal sharing of household chores by 2050, and 80% think that the length of paternity leave and the number of childcare places will continue to improve. However, 27% of respondents still believe that 'it's up to women to take care of the children and the home.' Despite this, the survey shows that attitudes are changing, and 84% of respondents want to see more women in the media and culture.

**More Than Half the World Could Be Overweight by 2050 - One Green Planet**
A new global study predicts that by 2050, over half of all adults and a third of young people worldwide will be overweight or obese. The research, led by Prof. Emmanuela Gakidou, warns that obesity rates are accelerating rapidly, especially in lower-income countries. According to the study, 57.4% of men and 60.3% of women will be overweight or obese by 2050, with countries like China, India, and the U.S. expected to see the largest numbers. Dr. Jessica Kerr of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute emphasizes the importance of prevention strategies, saying, 'If we act now, preventing a complete transition to global obesity for children and adolescents is still possible.' Individuals can make sustainable choices to slow this epidemic, such as shifting towards a plant-based diet and reducing processed food consumption.

**More than Half of the World's Adults Expected to be Obese by 2050**
According to a study, it is predicted that more than half of the world's adults will be obese by 2050. The researchers analyzed data from over 200 countries and found that obesity, which has become a major health problem in developed and developing countries, is on the rise. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity as 'excessive fat accumulation in the body' and 'an excessive increase in body weight above the desired level due to an excessive increase in body fat mass relative to lean body mass.' The study found that nearly half of the world's adult population was already obese or overweight in 2021. If current trends continue, the study predicts that the percentage of obese adults will increase to 57.4% in men and 60.3% in women by 2050. The study also found that obesity is expected to increase by 121% among children, young people, and young adults, with the number of obese young people expected to reach 360 million by 2050. The study also predicts that obesity will be most prevalent in China, India, and the US by 2050. The study's results were published in The Lancet.

**More than 50% of adults predicted to be obese by 2050 worldwide**
A new study published in The Lancet journal predicts that more than half of all adults worldwide will be overweight or obese by 2050. The researchers warn that obesity levels are accelerating rapidly, particularly in lower-income countries. However, experts say that if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what they describe as a 'profound tragedy'. The study found that by 2021, almost half the global adult population was overweight or obese, and this proportion has doubled since 1990. If trends continue, global rates of overweight and obese adults would rise to about 57.4% for men and 60.3% for women by 2050. The countries with the biggest populations of overweight or obese people in 2050 will be China, India, and the USA. However, population growth means that forecasters are predicting the number in sub-Saharan Africa will rise by more than 250% to 522 million. Experts say that if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what could be a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems. Prof Emmanuela Gakidou said, '[Governments] can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment.' Dr Jessica Kerr added, 'But if we act now, preventing a complete transition to global obesity for children and adolescents is still possible.'
