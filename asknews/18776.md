**BRIEF-UK Should Expand Army's Size When Funding Allows, Review...**
The UK's Strategic Defence Review recommends increasing the number of regular army personnel when funding allows, likely in the next parliament. The review also suggests reducing the Ministry of Defence's civil service costs by at least 10% by 2030. The authors of the review state that their plan can be accelerated if needed in a turbulent world. The review emphasizes the importance of backing Ukraine in its pursuit of a durable political settlement, as well as learning from its experience in land warfare, drone, and hybrid conflict. The review also highlights the key role of the US-China relationship in a more multipolar world marked by 'great power' competition. According to the review, China is seeking to establish dominance in the Indo-Pacific, erode US influence, and put pressure on the rules-based order. The review recommends keeping military-to-military channels of communication with China. Additionally, the review warns that Russia's war economy, if sustained, will enable it to rebuild land capabilities more quickly in the event of a ceasefire in Ukraine. The review identifies the Middle East and Indo-Pacific as the next priority regions for defence engagement after the Euro-Atlantic.

**US Senators Vow to Introduce New Sanctions Against Russia Before G7 Summit**
US Senator Lindsey Graham announced plans to introduce new sanctions against Russia before the G7 summit on June 15-17 in Canada. Graham, along with Democrat Richard Blumenthal, emphasized the need for coordinated sanctions with Europe to send a clear signal to China and other countries helping Russia evade international restrictions. 'We hope to introduce sanctions before the G7 summit in coordination with Europe to send a clear signal to China,' the senators said after meeting with French officials in Paris. Their bill proposes a 500% tariff on imports from countries buying Russian energy resources. The document has already been supported by 82 senators. Graham stated, 'Russia indiscriminately kills men, women, and children. It's time for the world to act decisively against Russia's aggression, holding China and others accountable for buying cheap Russian oil that fuels Putin's war machine. If you want this war to end, make China help end it.' The US President Donald Trump expressed uncertainty about supporting the bill, citing concerns about not wanting to 'ruin' the agreement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky predicted the war's end date, stating that Western sanctions will particularly hurt Russia's economy in early summer 2026. Meanwhile, The Moscow Times reported that 'Rosneft' suffered a significant loss, with a 58% decrease in net profit in the first quarter of 2025 due to sanctions, falling oil prices, and an abnormal strengthening of the ruble.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**Multiple Countries Unite to Counter China and North Korea's Growing Threats**
At the 'Shangri-La Dialogue', high-ranking security officials from multiple countries expressed that China and North Korea's support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine has exposed the blurring of regional boundaries in international security, and the world needs to work together to promote defense strategies. Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovilė Šakalienė stated that if Russia succeeds in invading Ukraine, it will have a chain reaction in Asia and may embolden the Chinese government to be more aggressive in its actions against Taiwan and almost the entire South China Sea. She said, 'If Russia wins in Ukraine, it's not just about Europe, it's not just about a region, it's a very clear signal to small countries in the Indo-Pacific: anyone can ignore their borders, anyone can use any fabricated pretext to justify an invasion.' The 22nd Shangri-La Dialogue was held from May 30 to June 1, with over 600 representatives from 47 countries attending. The forum discussed six key topics, including the US's new security ambitions in the Indian Ocean-Pacific region, ensuring stability in a competitive world, controlling the risk of nuclear proliferation in the Asia-Pacific region, and addressing challenges in the areas of network space, the seafloor, and outer space. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth suggested that European countries should focus on their own region and leave the defense of the Indo-Pacific region to the US, but Šakalienė pointed out that global security regions are actually interconnected and boundaries are becoming blurred. She said, 'It is well-known that the main network security threats to Japan come from China, Russia, and North Korea; the main network security threats to Lithuania come from Russia, China, and Belarus, and the two main threats - China and Russia - overlap completely.' Moscow and Pyongyang have recently acknowledged that North Korea has sent troops and military equipment to the front lines in Ukraine, while China has been economically and technologically supporting Moscow and opposing international sanctions against Russia. Iran has been a key supplier of drones for Russia's war efforts. Šakalienė emphasized that the international community needs a unified response to the growing coordination and fusion between the authoritarian axis of Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. She said, 'In this context, the US focusing its strategic priorities on the Indo-Pacific region is both reasonable and necessary, but this is not just the US's responsibility.' Her comments echoed French President Emmanuel Macron's speech at the opening ceremony on Friday, in which Macron hinted that Europe should be more actively involved in the Indo-Pacific region. Macron explicitly named China, warning that if China does not take more measures to prevent North Korea from participating in the Ukraine war, NATO may increase its presence in Asia. Macron also called for a new alliance between Europe and Asia to counter the great powers seeking to establish a 'deterrent range' in the region. He pointed out that the Eurasian alliance would be based on 'common principles and rules,' and 'without a doubt, the non-alliance era is over.' Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles also stated during the conference that the main conclusion he drew from the meeting was that European countries are actively participating in the discussion, reflecting the interconnectedness between the Indo-Pacific region and the North Atlantic. Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. dismissed China's claim that the US is a hegemonic power. The Philippines is engaged in an increasingly intense conflict with China over the South China Sea. He said, 'China's government's concept of 'fair justice' may be in stark contrast to the norms and values accepted by the world, especially by small countries.' He pointed out that 'to imagine what a China-led international order would look like, we only need to look at how they treat smaller neighbors in the South China Sea.' The Philippine Defense Secretary also emphasized that the South China Sea is one of the key sea lanes that are the lifelines of the global economy, and the tensions in the Indo-Pacific region will have a severe impact on the global situation. He said, 'If any of these sea lanes are interrupted, it will trigger a chain reaction in all continents, affecting trade flows, military deployments, and diplomatic situations.'

**Almost 700 million rubles allocated for border control upgrade in Novosibirsk region**
The Novosibirsk region has announced a tender for the installation of two portal inspection complexes at the 'Tashanta' international automobile checkpoint on the border with Mongolia. The project is being implemented by the Novosibirsk branch of the Federal State Budgetary Institution 'Rosgranstroy', a subsidiary of the Federal Customs Service. According to the technical specification, each complex must be able to scan vehicles and cargo, displaying the image on a monitor. The equipment is designed to handle up to 120 vehicles per hour at speeds of 3-15 km/h. The systems will operate 24/7, functioning stably in temperatures from -40 to +50°C and humidity up to 80% at 25°C. The initial contract price is 699.9 million rubles, funded by the federal budget for 2025-2027. The 'Tashanta' checkpoint has been experiencing high traffic since 2014, when a visa-free regime was introduced with Mongolia. The additional influx of traffic became particularly noticeable after the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions and the launch of a high-speed highway connecting China to Russia through Mongolia. The checkpoint's reconstruction began in 2022, initially planned to be completed by 2026, but later extended to 2030. After modernization, the checkpoint's capacity is expected to reach 1,020 vehicles and 4,000 people per day. In 2024, according to the Ministry of Transport of the Republic of Altai, approximately 60,000 vehicles passed through 'Tashanta'.

**China rejects US defence chief's warnings on Taiwan invasion threat**
China has rejected US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's warnings about the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, calling them 'groundless accusations'. Hegseth had stated that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan 'would result in devastating consequences'. China's National Defence University vice president, Hu Gangfeng, said the accusations were 'nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region'. Australia's Defence Minister, Richard Marles, pointed out that China's largest conventional military build-up since World War II is happening without strategic reassurance and without a clear strategic intent. Australia is currently on track to reach defence spending levels of 2.33 per cent of GDP by 2033-34, and is optimistic about the progress of the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine deal.

**US Focus on Indo-Pacific Region Sparks Concerns Over Double Standard**
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that China is expected to invade Taiwan by 2027, warning that any invasion would have devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific region and the world. French President Emmanuel Macron cautioned that if the US and Indo-Pacific countries focus on a potential conflict with China over Taiwan, they will be at risk of a double standard, abandoning Ukraine. Macron asked, 'If you think it's acceptable for Russia to take control of part of Ukraine's territory without any restrictions or global response, how would you describe the situation in Taiwan, and what would you do when something happens?' This comes as the US plans to reduce its military presence in Europe and focus on the Indo-Pacific region. China responded to Macron's comments, stating that the two issues are unrelated.

**US Warns of China's 'Imminent' Plans to Invade Taiwan**
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned at the main Asian security forum in Singapore that China's 'imminent' plans to invade Taiwan are a threat to the region. Hegseth emphasized the US commitment to security alliances with its Indo-Pacific partners, urging them to invest more in defense. 'China has shown it wants to alter the status quo,' Hegseth said, referring to China's operations in the South China Sea and Taiwan. 'We can't look away and ignore it.' Hegseth referred to China's alleged intention to invade Taiwan in 2027, a move that would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. 'Any attempt by the Communist Party to conquer Taiwan by force will result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world,' he emphasized. Hegseth also linked his warnings about China to messages assuring allies that the Indo-Pacific remains 'priority' for the US. 'America first doesn't mean America alone,' he said, calling for more spending on defense from its partners. 'Our defense spending must reflect the dangers and threats we face, because deterrence is not cheap.' Hegseth's warnings came as China sent a delegation from the National Defense University instead of Defense Minister Dong Jun, a surprise move that was seen as a sign of China's reduced engagement at the forum. 'China attaches great importance to this forum,' said General Hu Gangfeng, a member of the Chinese delegation, but added that it would not affect China's strategy in the region. The forum, which has been held since 2002, was reduced this year to a meeting between the US and Europe, represented by EU High Representative Kaja Kallas. Kallas also warned about China's contributions to Russia's war against Ukraine, a 'highly concerning' threat to global security, she said.

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong emphasized the importance of China and Russia working together to maintain stability and ensure prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. According to Sun, 'China and Russia need to firmly stand together,' defending the world order established after World War II and ensuring international justice. Sun noted that under the leadership of President Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, relations between the two countries have continued to expand at a high level. Sun stressed that China and Russia should continue to strengthen communication and coordination with regard to the affairs of the Asia-Pacific region, and work together to protect regional peace, maintain stability and ensure development and prosperity.

**Russia's War Efforts: Challenges and Uncertainties Ahead**
According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russia's military efforts are currently focused on advancing in the Donetsk region. Analyst Christina Garvard notes that Russian forces will likely continue these efforts, particularly to capture the remainder of the Donetsk region in the future. However, she warns that this will be a significant challenge for Moscow, requiring a large amount of personnel and equipment. Garvard also notes that Russia's ability to continue the war at its current pace after 2025 is uncertain, as the country is conducting intensive infantry attacks that result in significant losses. Additionally, Russia is struggling to maintain a high level of military spending, and may be forced to implement another unpopular partial mobilization, similar to the one seen in September 2022. Furthermore, Russia is facing a shortage of equipment, as its defense-industrial base is unable to produce new vehicles or artillery systems quickly enough to replace current losses. The Kremlin is heavily reliant on its Soviet-era stockpiles, which are expected to be depleted by the end of 2025 or 2026. Garvard also notes that Russia may turn to its allies, such as North Korea or Iran, for support, but these relationships are limited. China, on the other hand, appears to be unwilling to provide direct support to Russia. According to the Ukrainian General Staff, Russia has already begun its offensive on the north and east of Ukraine, but this is seen as part of the ongoing efforts that began in May 2024, with no significant changes on the front.

**Russia Aims to Complete War Against Ukraine by 2026, Says Intelligence Official**
According to Vadim Skibitsky, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) of the Ministry of Defense, Russia aims to complete the war against Ukraine by 2026. Skibitsky stated that a prolonged war would prevent Russia from competing with the US and China. He also mentioned that the Kremlin has developed 15 scenarios for possible military conflicts by 2045, with six related to Northern Europe and four to Poland. Additionally, Moscow has prepared a geopolitical forecast for 2026-2035, which indicates that the war against Ukraine should be completed by 2026. As Skibitsky noted, 'If the war continues for another 5-10 years, Russia will never be able to catch up and become on the same level as the US and China.' Skibitsky emphasized that Ukraine plays a crucial role in the new system of European security.

**China and Russia Strengthen Nuclear Alliance, Lifting Restrictions on Chinese Warheads in 2026**
The Pentagon has warned that China is actively supported by Russia in building a more imposing nuclear arsenal, and starting from 2026, all restrictions on the number of Chinese warheads will be lifted. According to the report, China currently has around 600 nuclear warheads, but the number could rise to 1,000 by 2030. China is also developing a vast infrastructure plan that includes the construction of 320 missile launch sites in the western region of the country. The report highlights the role of Russia in providing technology and fissile material for the production of plutonium in Chinese autofertilizing reactors, which has effectively projected China towards a deterrence capacity similar to that of major nuclear powers. The US and Russia are also seeking an agreement on minerals, while China and Russia are strengthening their nuclear alliance, which could lead to a new arms race in 2026.

**Germany's BND Warns of Russia's Plans for Large-Scale War with NATO**
According to the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND), Russia is preparing for a large-scale war with NATO. The BND report states that the Kremlin views its relations with the West as a systemic conflict and is willing to use force to achieve its goals. The BND estimates that by the end of the current decade (2030), Russia may be fully prepared for a 'large-scale conventional war'. The Lithuanian intelligence service believes that while Russia is not yet ready to attack the entire alliance, it may 'test NATO' by launching military operations against one or more member countries to understand how the alliance will react to a threat. The BND report notes that despite the full-scale war with Ukraine, Russia's air force and navy remain combat-ready. If the war in Ukraine ends, Russian troops may be redeployed to the borders of Baltic countries. The report also states that Russia is replenishing its losses in the war against Ukraine and the Russian defense industry is producing more weapons than needed for the current war. Russia's military spending is growing at a record pace, reaching nearly €120 billion in 2025, which is 6% of its GDP. The Kremlin also plans to increase the size of its army to 1.5 million personnel and increase the amount of equipment and technology on its borders with NATO by 30-50%. As a reminder, Russia has already predicted 15 possible military conflict scenarios by 2045. About half of these scenarios relate to Northern Europe. 'Russia will try to resolve the Ukrainian issue by 2026,' said Vadim Skibitsky, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, during a roundtable discussion 'New contours of European security'. 'If the war continues for another 5-10 years, Russia will never be able to catch up with the US and China,' Skibitsky added. The Kremlin's geopolitical calculations relate to the period 2026-2035, with consequences extending to 2045. Countries in the Baltic region and Poland are at particular risk, according to Skibitsky.

**Russia's 15 Scenarios for Military Conflicts in Europe by 2045: A Threat to Northern Europe**
Russia has developed 15 possible scenarios for military conflicts in Europe by 2045, with six of them related to Northern Europe. According to General Vadim Skibitsky, deputy head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, the countries of the Baltic region and Poland understand the current threat. 'Six of them are related to Northern Europe. And... Northern Europe understands, the Baltic countries understand. Poland understands. There are only four scenarios of possible military conflict in Poland. Poland currently understands that this is - a direct threat,' he said. Skibitsky also stated that Russia clearly understands its place on the world stage and its role in global politics. He added that Russia has previously created a forecast for 2026-2035 years with a perspective to 2045, which defined four main scenarios of development of events. 'The first is absolute US leadership, the second is the growing role of China, the third is a multipolar world where Russia sees itself too, and the fourth is regionalization, as they called it, by regions. In fact, by regions... we see this too. And... Russia in these documents clearly defined - the Ukrainian issue must be completed by 2026. They are based on those scenario analyses and that forecast. Because if the war continues for another 5-10 years, Russia will never be able to catch up and become on the same level as the US and China. It will forever remain a regional player on our Eastern European level,' he explained. Skibitsky also noted that Russia's aggression against Ukraine began not in 2014, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union, including the situation with Crimea, Tuzla, and other disputed issues. 'You all remember Crimea, Tuzla, and other issues. And... the role of our state is just in recognizing and new approaches to organizing the European security system, in fact, it is invaluable,' he reminded. Pavlo Zhovniarenko, head of the board of the 'Center for Strategic Studies' NGO, added that the new structure of European security should not be limited to Europe. 'It simply cannot be purely European, because the geographical principle does not work. Here, the union must be on value-based principles,' he believes.

**Russia Predicts 15 Possible Military Conflict Scenarios by 2045, Direct Threat to Poland**
Russia has predicted 15 possible military conflict scenarios by 2045, with six of them affecting Northern Europe. According to General-Major Vadim Skibitsky, deputy head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, countries in Northern Europe, particularly the Baltic states and Poland, are aware of the potential threat. Skibitsky stated that Poland is directly threatened by four possible military conflict scenarios. 'For Poland, there are only four scenarios of a possible military conflict. Poland now understands that this is a direct threat,' he said. Russia has previously prepared a forecast of events from 2026 to 2035 with a perspective to 2045, identifying four possible scenarios of the world order. The first scenario involves the absolute dominance of the US, the second the strengthening of China's role, the third a multipolar world where Russia aims to become one of the key players, and the fourth regionalization, or the division of influence into separate regions. Skibitsky noted that Russia's strategic documents clearly state the intention to complete the 'Ukrainian question' by 2026. He believes this is because a prolonged war for 5-10 years would prevent Russia from reaching the level of the US and China, leaving it a regional player in Eastern Europe. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius previously stated that, considering the growth of the Russian army, there is a possibility of Russia attempting to attack NATO countries in 2029-2030. In response, he emphasized the importance of strengthening the Alliance's defense capabilities before then.

**Russia Forecasts 15 Possible Scenarios for Military Conflicts by 2045**
Russia has identified 15 possible scenarios for military conflicts by 2045, with six of them related to Northern Europe. According to Deputy Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, General-Major Vадим Скібіцький, countries in Northern Europe, including Baltic states and Poland, are aware of the potential threat. 'There are four scenarios of a possible military conflict over Poland. Poland currently understands that this is a direct threat,' Skібіцький said. Russia previously prepared a forecast of the development of events for 2026-2035 with a perspective to 2045, identifying four possible scenarios of the world order. The first scenario assumes the absolute dominance of the US, the second - the strengthening of China's role, the third - a multipolar world where Russia seeks to occupy a place among key players, and the fourth - regionalization, i.e. the division of influence into separate regions. Skібіцький noted that in Russian strategic documents, it is clearly stated that Russia intends to complete the 'Ukrainian question' by 2026. He believes that this is related to the fact that a prolonged war for 5-10 years will prevent Russia from reaching the level of the US and China, leaving it a regional player in Eastern Europe. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius stated in January that, given the growth of the Russian army, there is a possibility of Russia's attempt to attack NATO countries in 2029-2030. In this regard, he emphasized the importance of strengthening the defense capabilities of the Alliance by that time.
