**Eddie Poku writes: What Ghana needs to lead Africa's automotive revolution - MyJoyOnline**
Ghana has the potential to lead Africa's automotive revolution, but several challenges need to be addressed. The country is heavily dependent on used imports, and only 175,915 new vehicles were sold across Sub-Saharan Africa in 2024. To unlock efficiency and reduce costs, Victoria Backhaus-Jerling, CEO of the African Association of Automobile Manufacturers (AAAM), suggests implementing a continent-wide commitment to policy alignment, trade facilitation, and clean energy infrastructure. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) offers a key mechanism to achieve this through the Rules of Origin (RoO), which mandates vehicles to contain at least 40% local content for tariff-free trade. Gradual reforms, such as phasing age limits for imports and offering low-interest auto loans for new vehicles, could also help. Additionally, Ghana needs to invest in technical training institutes, electrify and digitize its grid, and position itself to lead the EV value chain. As Martina Biene, Chairperson and Managing Director of Volkswagen Group Africa, says, 'If we get this right, Africa could become a global player in the automotive industry, not just a market, but a maker of mobility solutions.'

**Pharmaceutical players warn constant default in paying for medicines will cripple businesses - MyJoyOnline**
The Ghana National Chamber of Pharmacy has expressed concern over the lack of proper credit financing structures in the pharmaceutical sector, leading to cash flow issues for importers and wholesalers. According to Chief Executive Audrey Serwaa Bonsu, 'the system is being actively abused' with some businesses collecting pharmaceutical products on credit and failing to pay back, redirecting revenue for personal ventures. The chamber is working with regulatory bodies to enforce measures that will make financial default a serious offense, including revoking operating licenses for defaulting pharmacies. Ms. Bonsu emphasized that 'this is not a one man fight' and requires the collaboration of all stakeholders, including fintech, banking, regulators, and business owners, to restore integrity and accountability in the sector. The regulators are showing interest in embracing digital tools and data solutions to monitor compliance, which is a 'major win for the industry.'

**Pharmaceutical Industry 2024 & 2025 Q1 Summary: Focus on Cash Flow, Prioritize Improving Profitability and Product Variety**
The pharmaceutical industry has shown signs of improvement in Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, with a general increase in profitability. The downstream inventory clearance and anti-corruption effects are gradually being cleared, despite temporary pressure. The industry is still divided, with chemical pharmaceuticals and medical consumables performing well. Research and development expenses have increased in 2024, which will lay a foundation for the industry's long-term stable development. Companies with solid research and development platforms and continuous innovation capabilities are expected to be the first to see a turnaround in their performance. The industry's sales and management expenses have decreased, and the quality and efficiency of the industry have improved significantly. Currently, the pharmaceutical industry's valuation is still at a historical low, with a large upward space. In 2025, with the continued optimization of pharmaceutical policies, government stimulus, and local debt, the industry has strong rebound momentum. We recommend focusing on cash flow and profitability improvement, and looking forward to the return of core assets' value. The innovative drug industry chain has received full-process support from policies, and commercialization is accelerating. Benefiting from the early recovery of the overseas investment market, demand is gradually recovering, and CXO and upstream companies' orders are increasing. The industry has turned the corner. CXO's revenue has recovered well, and profitability has continued to improve, with a more significant improvement in profitability. The industry's fundamentals have shown an upward trend. Geopolitical and tariff policies have caused some fluctuations and impacts on the industry, and CXO and upstream companies have gradually increased their overseas production capacity layout, expanded non-US markets, and diversified overseas risks. High-quality, efficient, and low-cost products and services are the core barriers, and China's pharmaceutical industry has continued to consolidate its advantages, with the potential to occupy a larger market share in the global market. In 2024, multiple government departments issued a series of policy files to support the development of innovative drugs, strengthening support in new drug research and development, review and approval, supply and use, multiple payment methods, and financing support. Innovative drug stocks achieved high growth in 2024, with commercialization accelerating. China's innovative drug industry has entered the harvest period after decades of development, with a bright future. With the combination of policy friendliness and improved market liquidity, the domestic innovative drug market has a bright future. We recommend paying attention to the fields of tumors, autoimmunity, weight loss, Alzheimer's disease, NASH, hair loss, and hepatitis B. Outpatient consumption and medical services: in 2025, outpatient consumption (pharmacies, OTC, etc.) is expected to recover from inventory clearance and weak consumption, with apparent growth rates improving. The national enterprise-led industry M&A wave continues to drive high-quality development. We recommend paying attention to national enterprise reform, active external expansion, and Chinese medicine innovation and investment opportunities. Medical devices: in 2024, the medical device industry's revenue and net profit growth were under pressure, mainly due to hospital reform, bidding not meeting expectations, and procurement. The industry's business development has been limited. Looking at the industry's sub-sectors, medical equipment revenue and net profit have decreased significantly, while medical consumables have maintained high growth. With the recovery of bidding, tariff benefits, and reduced procurement impact, we believe that the industry's performance will turn around in 2025, and we recommend focusing on device domestic substitution, AI + medical, and high-growth consumables. Beneficial targets: Araladin, Kanglong Chemical, Rongchang Biotechnology, Nuocheng Jinhua, Meipu Medical, Yiheng Jiaye, Weichuang Robot-B, Yirui Technology, Yifeng Pharmacy, Daxianlin, Meiyuan Health. Risk warning: procurement price reduction exceeds expectations, consumption recovery does not meet expectations, and enterprise external expansion is lower than expected.

**Middle East, North Africa solar manufacturing capacity to reach 44 GW by 2029, says WoodMac**
Wood Mackenzie forecasts that the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will become a top solar export hub, overtaking Southeast Asia, and become the primary exporter of solar panels to the US by the end of the decade. The region's solar manufacturing capacity is expected to reach 44 GW by 2029, driven by local content requirements and strategic partnerships with Chinese firms. Yana Hryshko, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said that the region's tariff advantage is a 'game changer', positioning it to offer the most cost-competitive solar modules for the US market. Chinese companies are forecast to account for over 85% of MENA's solar module manufacturing capacity by 2028, making the region China's next major production base outside Asia. The region's solar strategy is focused on large-scale, long-term growth, buoyed by robust government support, and is prioritizing the deployment of advanced technologies and scaling up production. Hryshko concluded that MENA's solar ambitions are reshaping the global solar industry landscape and marking a decisive shift away from fossil fuel reliance.
