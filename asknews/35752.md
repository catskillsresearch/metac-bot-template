**Trump Receives Powell at the White House Amid Criticism and Threats**
US President Donald Trump received Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, at the White House on May 29. Powell has been the target of Trump's criticism, attacks, and threats since the beginning of his second term in January. The meeting was held at Trump's invitation, according to a statement released by the Federal Reserve. In his last meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced the maintenance of the basic interest rate at 4.25% to 4.5% per year. This was the third consecutive meeting in which the Federal Reserve maintained the interest rate unchanged. Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to emphasize that the trajectory of monetary policy will depend entirely on the economic information received and what it means for the prospects, according to the Federal Reserve's statement. Powell also stated that he and his FOMC colleagues will define monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices, and will make these decisions based only on careful, objective, and apolitical analyses. Trump has been critical of Powell, calling for a reduction in interest rates in the US. 'The price of oil has fallen, food is cheaper, and the US is enriching itself with tariffs. The 'delayed' one should have already reduced interest rates, as the ECB did a long time ago, but certainly should now. Powell's dismissal cannot come soon enough,' Trump said. However, Trump later backtracked on his comments, saying he had no intention of firing Powell. 'I never had that intention. The press exaggerates things,' he said. 'No, I have no intention of firing him. I would like to see him be a bit more active in relation to his idea of reducing interest rates,' Trump continued. The Federal Reserve is composed of seven members who serve terms of 4 to 14 years, all of whom are appointed by the US President. The appointment for the position of Federal Reserve President is defined by the White House and confirmed by a vote in the US Senate every 4 years.

**FRB to Wait for Clearer View on Monetary Policy**
The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) released the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 28. Participants analyzed that the risk of inflation and unemployment rate increase is high, but they also noted that the US economy is stable. They agreed to wait until the situation becomes clearer before making a decision on monetary policy, such as lowering interest rates. At the May meeting, the FOMC will discuss lowering the main policy interest rate for three consecutive meetings, but they will not make a decision until they have a clearer view of the situation. As one participant said, 'We will observe the situation before making a decision.'

**Fed Well Positioned To Wait For Clarity On Outlook, Minutes Say**
The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on May 6-7, 2025, to discuss monetary policy. The committee reaffirmed its commitment to the 2% longer-run inflation objective and emphasized the importance of longer-term inflation expectations being firmly anchored at that target rate. The FOMC discussed the advantages and disadvantages of flexible average inflation targeting and flexible inflation targeting, with some participants noting that flexible average inflation targeting could have potentially limited the risk of longer-run inflation expectations becoming unanchored to the downside. The committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with several central banks. The FOMC also discussed the economic situation, noting that consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated, but core PCE price inflation was lower than its year-earlier level. Labor market conditions remained solid, with the unemployment rate at 4.2% in March and April. The FOMC also discussed the financial situation, noting that market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next few meetings edged up, but declined somewhat toward the end of the year. Yields on shorter- and medium-term nominal Treasury securities declined, but longer-term rates rose somewhat. The FOMC staff provided an updated assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system, characterizing the system's financial vulnerabilities as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures were notable, with equity valuations declining but still standing at the upper end of their historical distribution. Vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate, while those associated with leverage in the financial sector were characterized as notable.

**Virologist Hendrik Streeck Appointed as New Federal Commissioner for Drug Issues**
Hendrik Streeck, a virologist known from the Corona crisis, has been appointed as the new Federal Commissioner for Drug Issues. Streeck said, 'As a doctor and scientist, I want to help, inform, and act, not just point fingers.' He emphasized the need for better protection for children and young people from addiction, digital risks, and new hazardous substances. Streeck, a 47-year-old CDU member, will replace Burkhard Blienert, an SPD politician, in the role. The government also appointed Katrin Staffler, a 43-year-old CSU member, as the new Commissioner for Nursing Care. Stefan Schwartze, a 51-year-old SPD member, will remain as the Patient Commissioner. Health Minister Nina Warken said, 'The health policy is in need of exchange with all those affected.' She praised Streeck's medical background, saying it will help to depoliticize the often emotionally charged debate on drugs. A key issue in this legislative period will be the handling of cannabis legalization, with Union and SPD planning an 'outcome-open evaluation' this fall. A first evaluation of the legalization law, which allows adults to consume cannabis with certain restrictions since April 1, 2024, is also planned.

**Fed Minutes: Officials Take Cautious Approach Amid Economic Uncertainty**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has released its minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 6-7. The minutes show that the Fed officials are cautious about the economic outlook, citing the uncertainty caused by recent developments. The officials believe that the economy is still growing and the labor market is strong, but the current monetary policy is slightly restrictive. They expect more clarity on inflation and economic activity in the coming months. The minutes also mention that the officials are concerned about the potential impact of trade policies on the economy, which could lead to a weaker growth forecast for 2025 and 2026. The Fed officials are also cautious about the risk of a recession, with some members believing that it is as likely as the baseline forecast. 'We are in a good position to wait for more clarity on the economic outlook,' said the officials. 'We are taking a cautious approach, given the uncertainty caused by recent developments.'

**Fed Minutes: Officials Adopt Cautious Approach Amid Economic Uncertainty**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has published the minutes of its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 6-7. The minutes show that Fed officials are concerned about the increasing uncertainty in the economic outlook. They believe that the economy is still strong, but the current monetary policy is mildly restrictive, and therefore, they expect more clarity on inflation and economic activity. The minutes state, 'The officials agreed that it was appropriate to adopt a cautious approach, given the increasing uncertainty in the economic outlook, and the potential effects of a series of changes in government policies on the economy.' The officials are also concerned about the downward risks to employment and economic activity, and the upward risks to inflation. They believe that the main reason for these risks is the potential effects of the increase in tariffs on the economy. The minutes also note that the officials expect the inflation to remain high for a while longer. They are also concerned about the risk of a recession, and believe that it is as likely as their previous estimate. The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for June 17-18.

**Fed Expects 'One or Two' Interest Rate Cuts by End of Year**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) expects 'one or two' interest rate cuts by the end of the year, according to its meeting minutes released on Wednesday. The Fed noted that the 'modal implied path based on option prices (...) decreased slightly during the period and was consistent with one or two 25-basis-point rate cuts by the end of the year, slightly more than in the March meeting'. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left interest rates unchanged at 4.25-4.5% after its meeting on May 6-7. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stated that while it is 'likely' that tariffs will lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth, and higher unemployment, the economy remains solid. The minutes added that 'tariff announcements caused a significant deterioration in the global risk perception, which largely reversed after a subsequent pause in the application of some tariffs and growing investor optimism about the decline in trade tensions'. This comes a day before the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) releases its first revision of the first-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP). According to data released in late April, the GDP contracted 0.3% at an annualized rate from January to March, marking the first quarterly negative reading since 2022. The Fed noted that the technical staff's projection of real GDP growth in 2025 and 2026 was weaker than in the March meeting, as announced trade policies implied a greater drag on activity. It was also predicted that trade policies would lead to slower productivity growth and reduce potential growth in the coming years. Participants in the Fed meeting agreed that inflation may be more persistent than expected, but also that the organization is well-positioned to make decisions without haste, awaiting 'greater clarity' on price increases and economic activity.

**Trump's Ability to Fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell**
US President Donald Trump has been verbally attacking Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell due to his refusal to lower interest rates further, sparking concerns that Trump may try to fire Powell. However, it is unclear whether Trump has the authority to do so. According to Reuters, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 states that members of the Federal Reserve Board, who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for staggered 14-year terms, can only be removed for 'cause', which is believed to mean misconduct, not policy disagreements. The law does not explicitly mention the restrictions on removing the Chairman of the Federal Reserve from his four-year term, who is one of the seven members. If Trump were to fire Powell from his position as Chairman, it would be unclear what would happen to his other positions. Powell holds three positions: Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Member of the Federal Reserve Board, and Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates for the Federal Reserve. If Trump were to fire Powell from his position as Chairman only, Powell would remain a member of the Board until the end of his term in January 2028. The Board would not be vacant until January 2026, meaning Trump would only have the option to nominate one of the other current members to replace Powell as Chairman. Trump has appointed two of the other six members, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, who were recently nominated by Trump as Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Both have spoken about the importance of the Federal Reserve's independence, making it unclear whether either would implement the interest rate cuts that Trump desires. Trump does not have direct control over who chairs the Federal Open Market Committee. The Chairman is chosen annually by the Committee's 12 members, including the seven members of the Board, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four other regional bank presidents who serve in a rotating capacity. Traditionally, the Federal Open Market Committee chooses the Chairman of the Federal Reserve as its leader, with the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as his deputy. However, theoretically, the Committee could choose any of its members, including Powell if he remains a member. Removing Powell from his position as a member of the Board would have the greatest impact. If this decision were to withstand legal challenge, it would give Trump a vacant seat on the Board and the Chairmanship, allowing him to appoint a replacement of his choice. This would also open the door for Trump to fire any number of other members as he sees fit, installing a broader leadership at the Federal Reserve that aligns with his desires. Powell has repeatedly stated that he believes he cannot be fired under the law and has said that he does not think the cases currently making their way through the courts regarding Trump's firings of other independent members of government boards and agencies will apply to the Federal Reserve. Trump discussed firing Powell and replacing him with Kevin Warsh, but Warsh advised against it, urging Trump to allow Powell to remain until the end of his term in May 2026. Last week, White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett, who is also seen as a potential replacement for Powell, said the matter was under ongoing study within the administration.

**Anna Paulson Appointed as President of the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) of Philadelphia announced the appointment of Anna Paulson as its next president and CEO, effective July 1, 2025. Paulson, currently executive vice president and director of Research at the Fed of Chicago, will replace Patrick Harker, who will retire after 10 years as regional head. According to Anthony Ibargüen, president of the Fed of Philadelphia's Search Committee and Board of Directors, 'Anna Paulson is the ideal person to lead the Fed of Philadelphia, due to her expertise in economics and monetary policy, as well as her career.' Ibargüen highlighted that Paulson has demonstrated a commitment to the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment for two decades. Paulson has been with the Fed since 2001 and is an expert in financial stability, insurance markets, and monetary policy. As president in Philadelphia, she will participate in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings starting in July and will have voting rights in 2026, following the rotation among regional banks.

**Trump Appoints Bowman as Fed's New Vice Chair for Bank Supervisi**
U.S. President Donald Trump has appointed Michelle 'Miki' Bowman as the Federal Reserve's new Vice Chair for Bank Supervision, a move welcomed by Wall Street banks and smaller lending institutions. Bowman, a Federal Reserve Board member since 2018, is expected to adopt a more lenient regulatory stance towards the banking industry. Her appointment indicates Trump's supportive approach towards the banking sector, which has seen banking stocks outperform the broader market since his election. Bowman's background as a bank executive and her prior experience in Trump's first term suggest she will likely ease regulations for smaller banks. As a Federal Reserve Board member, Bowman is also part of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is scheduled to meet this week, but no changes in interest rates are expected.

**No signs of process for appointment of new CEC, two members**
The process for appointing a new Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and two Election Commission members has not been initiated, despite the constitutional deadline of 45 days having passed. The prime minister and leader of the opposition have not met to discuss potential nominees, and the parliamentary committee, which is responsible for finalizing the appointments, has not been formed. According to the appointment process, the prime minister and leader of the opposition must agree on a nominee(s) before sending the proposed names to the parliamentary committee for approval. If a consensus is not reached, each side submits three names per position, and the committee takes the final decision. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf is considering taking the matter to court, as they have previously expressed no-confidence in the incumbent Election Commission. The five-year term of Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja ended on January 26, along with two other members of the Election Commission.

**FRS USA to Approach Monetary Policy Changes with Caution**
Members of the Federal Reserve's (FRS) open market committee consider it prudent to approach potential changes to monetary policy with caution due to high uncertainty, according to the January meeting protocol. 'Most participants noted that the current high degree of uncertainty makes it prudent for the committee to take a cautious approach to considering additional adjustments to monetary policy,' the protocol states. Participants emphasized that if the US labor market remains near full employment, they would like to see further progress on inflation before making additional adjustments to the interest rate target range. Many participants noted that the committee may maintain the rate at the restrictive level if the economy remains strong and inflation remains high. However, some participants suggested that if labor market conditions worsen, economic activity declines, and inflation returns to the 2% target faster than expected, monetary policy may be eased, the protocol states. The committee's decisions on interest rates are not predetermined and depend on the development of the economy, economic forecasts, and risk balance, members of the committee noted. The FRS maintained the base interest rate at 4.25-4.5% after the January meeting. The next meeting is scheduled for March 18-19.

**Fed Members Expressed Concerned About Inflation Before Pausing Rates**
Newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting show that members are concerned about inflation risks and support pausing interest rate cuts. Members noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated and progress toward its 2% goal had slowed over the past year. They also expressed concern that President Donald Trump's tariffs could push up inflation a little further. The minutes stated that 'with the stance of policy significantly less restrictive than it had been before the Committee's policy easing over its previous three meetings, all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.' Recent economic data supports concerns over inflation, with the Producer Price Index shooting up more than expected in January.

**US Fed chair Powell to speak at Congress today - Check time and where to watch**
US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify before the House Financial Services Committee today, February 12, 2025, at 10 am. In his statement to Congress, Powell warned that quicker rate cuts could potentially reignite inflation, while a prolonged pause could destabilize the economy. Powell emphasized that any future rate cuts will be data-dependent and that the Federal Reserve remains committed to achieving maximum employment and stable prices. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has maintained the target range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for 14 months, and markets expect only two rate cuts in 2025. Powell's testimony may have a minimal impact on gold prices, but the release of January CPI data, which is expected to be released about 2 hours before his testimony, could have a significant impact on the market.

**US Fed chair Powell to speak at Congress today – Check time and where to watch**
US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to testify before the House Financial Services Committee today, February 12, 2025, at 10 am. In his previous statement to Congress, Powell expressed caution against cutting interest rates too quickly, citing concerns that it could reignite inflation. Powell emphasized that the Federal Reserve will prioritize achieving maximum employment and stable prices, and that any future rate cuts will be data-dependent. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for 14 months, and markets currently expect only two rate cuts in 2025. The release of January US CPI data today may have a significant impact on the market, particularly if it shows stickiness, which could influence the Fed's decision on future rate cuts.
