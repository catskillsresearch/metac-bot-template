**Lilo & Stitch and Mission: Impossible Dominate Box Office**
Lilo & Stitch and Mission: Impossible -- The final reckoning dominated the box office for the second week, contributing to a record-breaking Memorial Day weekend.

Lilo & Stitch, from Disney, took the top spot again with $63 million from 4,410 locations in North America. This was enough to surpass Sinners and become the second-highest-grossing film of the year with $280.1 million in domestic ticket sales. Worldwide, its total is $610.8 million. Meanwhile, Sinners remains strong in its seventh weekend with $5.2 million, bringing its total to $267.1 million domestically and $350.1 million worldwide.

**Lilo & Stitch Nears $1 Billion at the Global Box Office**
The Disney film 'Lilo & Stitch' continues to achieve great success at the global box office, nearing the $1 billion mark in revenue. According to reports, the film has earned approximately $610.8 million worldwide, including $183 million domestically during the Memorial Day weekend in the United States, setting a new record for the highest opening weekend in history for this holiday, surpassing 'Top Gun: Maverick'. The film's strong performance in international markets, particularly in Asia, Latin America, and Europe, has solidified its position among the top-grossing films of 2025, behind 'Ne Zha 2' and 'A Minecraft Movie'. It is expected that the film will continue to achieve strong numbers in the coming weeks, benefiting from the lack of direct competition in theaters, with predictions that it will surpass the $1 billion mark in a few weeks. The film, directed by Dean Fleischer-Camp, features Maya Kowaloha as 'Lilo' and Chris Sanders, the original director, reprising his role as the voice of 'Stitch', adding an extra emotional depth to the film. The story follows the imaginative and troubled 'Lilo', who lives in Hawaii with her older sister 'Nani' after losing their parents. Lilo struggles with isolation and loneliness until she decides to adopt a strange creature she believes is a dog, but is actually an alien fugitive from a distant galaxy, known as 'Stitch'. Despite his destructive nature, a unique bond forms between Lilo and Stitch based on love and acceptance.

**Record-Breaking Memorial Day Weekend at the Box Office**
The Memorial Day weekend is shaping up to be a historic one at the box office, with Disney's live-action remake of 'Lilo & Stitch' raking in $183 million and surpassing 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One'. According to studio estimates cited by various media outlets on Sunday, the US box office is expected to reach a record $322 million over the weekend, surpassing the previous record set in 2013 when films like 'Fast & Furious 6' and 'Hangover III' generated $314 million. 'Lilo & Stitch' is projected to take the top spot at the box office with an estimated $183 million by Monday, marking the highest opening weekend for a Memorial Day film of all time, surpassing 'Top Gun: Maverick' and its $126 million opening in 2022. 'Mission: Impossible-Dead Reckoning Part One' is in second place with an estimated $77 million in box office revenue by Monday, making it the highest-grossing opening for any 'Mission: Impossible' film. 'Final Destination: Bloodlines' takes third place in the box office, earning $24 million over the four-day weekend, followed by 'Thunderbolts', 'Sinners', and 'The Last Rodeo'. Experts cited by Los Angeles Times believe that the strong Memorial Day box office and the highest spring movie attendance on record suggest that box office revenue will likely be high this summer, which is typically the busiest time for movie theaters. Upcoming summer releases that could generate big box office numbers include 'Karate Kid: Legends', the live-action remake of 'How to Train Your Dragon', 'Elio' from Disney/Pixar, 'Ballerina', the 'John Wick' spin-off, 'Jurassic World Rebirth', a new 'Superman' film, and 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' from Marvel Studios. 'Lilo & Stitch' is on track to outperform the original animated film's box office total during its entire theatrical run, not accounting for inflation. The original animated film grossed $145.8 million in domestic box office revenue during its initial release in 2003. 'Lilo & Stitch' is poised to be one of the biggest openings for Disney for one of its live-action remakes, behind 'The Lion King' in 2019, which grossed $191.7 million over three days.
