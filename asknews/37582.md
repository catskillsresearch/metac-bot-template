**Rent Increases in June 2025: What You Need to Know**
In June 2025, rent contracts signed in June 2023 will experience their second and final annual increase of 80.65%, 15 percentage points less than the 95.24% increase in May, according to the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA). Additionally, contracts signed between October 17 and December 29, 2023, will be adjusted semi-annually based on the Casa Propia coefficient, which is expected to be around 48.44% in June. For example, a two-bedroom apartment in Buenos Aires rented for $334,888 in December 2023 would increase to $1,298,908 by June 2025. Meanwhile, contracts signed after December 29, 2023, with quarterly or bi-quarterly adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index (IPC), will see an increase of 9.58% in June 2025, calculated with the last IPC index published by INDEC in April 2025. This means that if the initial rent was $500,000, the new rent in June would be approximately $547,889, and if the initial rent was $800,000, the new rent would be $876,622.

**High-Priced Rentals on the Rise in Seoul Metropolitan Area**
The Seoul metropolitan area is experiencing a rapid increase in high-priced rentals, with the proportion of rent transactions exceeding 60% of the total housing transactions. According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's 'April Housing Statistics', the proportion of rent transactions in the country reached 60.4% this year. In particular, the Seoul metropolitan area showed a high proportion of rent transactions, with 63.6% in Seoul and 59.3% in the metropolitan area. The proportion of apartment rent transactions also increased from 43.4% last year to 44.5% this year. High-priced rent transactions of over 500 million KRW are also on the rise, with 366 transactions in Seoul from January to May this year. For example, a 84㎡ apartment in the '래미안 원베일리' complex in Seocho-gu, Seoul, was rented for 600 million KRW per month with a deposit of 8 billion KRW in May. Additionally, a 84㎡ apartment in the '서울숲트리마제' complex in Jongno-gu, Seoul, was rented for 1.1 billion KRW per month with a deposit of 1 billion KRW in May. Industry insiders predict that if interest rates are lowered rapidly after the election, the trend of renting out apartments for high prices will continue to worsen. As a result, people may increasingly turn to renting out apartments as a form of investment, rather than saving in bank deposits.

**Australian Housing Market Sees Rebound in May, Prices Reach New High**
The Australian housing market has seen a rebound in May, with prices reaching a new high due to the decrease in interest rates. According to data from Cotality, the median price of Australian housing in May was AU$831,288, a 0.5% increase from April. This growth is seen across all states and territories, with a 0.4% or higher increase in most areas. Cotality research director Tim Lawless attributes the growth to improved consumer confidence, saying, 'It's clear that the rate cuts since February have had a positive impact on the housing market.' However, he notes that the growth rate of 0.4-0.5% is not remarkable, but rather sustainable. Lawless also points out that the growth is largely driven by market sentiment rather than an improvement in borrowing and lending capacity, as interest rates are still restrictive. He notes that consumer confidence and housing market activity are closely related, saying, 'From a historical perspective, consumer confidence and housing market activity are closely linked.' On a national level, rents increased by 0.4% in May, following three consecutive months of 0.6% growth. However, from a yearly perspective, rent growth is showing a downward trend, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. The low vacancy rate in state capital cities, below 2% of the long-term average, is driving up rents. Overseas net migration has increased significantly since the pandemic, but is now returning to normal levels, while family sizes are expanding, which is suppressing demand. However, the slow progress in supply is unlikely to improve in the short term, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics reporting a 5.7% decrease in housing approvals in April, making it even more difficult to achieve the goal of building 1.2 million new homes in the next five years. Lawless notes that the shortage of rental properties and high rents will continue for some time, saying, 'Given the current shortage of rental properties, the issue of high rents will persist for some time.'

**Single mum 'breaks down' after £100 rent hike and says 'it needs to stop' - Birmingham Live**
A single mother, Bridget Chapman, has launched a petition to cap the amount landlords can raise rent by, after her own rent was increased by £100. The petition, which has been signed by over 46,000 people, also calls for a three-month notice period for rent changes. Bridget, who shares her three-bedroom home in County Durham with her two adult children, said, 'They're just allowed to do that. There should be a cap in the system so landlords can only raise the rent to a certain point.' She added, 'You need about £1,400 to £1,600 for a deposit to move, and you can't do that if you're already paying an extra £100 a month.' Generation Rent, a campaign group advocating for private renters, has backed Bridget's petition, stating, 'This is indefensible. If renters are to finally feel secure in their own homes, we need protections from sudden rent rises.'

**LandlordBuyer Reveals the Best UK Cities for Landlords in 2026 - and London Doesn't Make the List**
According to LandlordBuyer, the UK's buy-to-let property market is undergoing significant transformation due to rising interest rates and regulatory changes. However, 2026 could represent a year of strategic opportunity for landlords who adapt swiftly to the evolving market landscape. Key forecasts for 2026 include a 11% rise in BTL lending to £42 billion, a 4% growth in average UK house prices, and a 3.5% increase in rental prices. The best regional yield performers are Blaenau Gwent with a 11.4% yield, Redcar & Cleveland with a 9.5% yield, and Derby and Newcastle with 6-8% yields. Birmingham is emerging as a promising city for landlords, with forecasted rental price growth of 3.5% and strong demand from young professionals and students. Jason Harris-Cohen, Managing Director of LandlordBuyer, believes Birmingham's rental market is poised for continued growth and presents an opportunity for landlords to achieve attractive rental yields and capital appreciation. 'Birmingham's rental market is poised for continued growth through 2025 and 2026, underpinned by strong demand, limited supply, and ongoing urban development.'

**Rent Increases in May 2025: What You Need to Know**
Rent increases are expected in May 2025, according to the adjustment index used in contracts. The increases will vary depending on the type of contract. For those who signed contracts in May 2023 under the old law, the second and final annual adjustment will be 95.24% interannual, which is lower than the 116.85% applied in April. This is the first time in three years that the adjustment by this index is below 100%. For example, a rent of $400,000 will increase to $780,952, and a rent of $600,000 will increase to $1,171,440. The adjustment index is published daily, so the exact increase depends on the date of the contract within the month. Additionally, contracts signed between October and December 2023 will have a semi-annual adjustment of 56.7%, and contracts signed after the derogation of the old law will have a quarterly or semi-annual adjustment tied to the Consumer Price Index (IPC). For example, a rent of $500,000 will increase to $557,525, and a rent of $800,000 will increase to $892,040.

**Renters to Pay Less: Update in ICL Breaks Trend of Increasing Rental Prices**
Due to the update in the Index for Rental Contracts (ICL), the trend of increasing rental prices has been broken, and in May, the gap of 100% was also broken. Those who signed their contract after the law was repealed will have to pay an increase according to the update formula. According to the ICL, the percentages for May will be: However, despite the significant increase in contracts, 'rental prices for housing are decreasing in real terms', specified by the College of Real Estate. This is because they increased below the inflation rate. From January 2024 to February 2025, the average decrease was 36.3%. 'In some contracts, we can already see decreases in nominal terms of the locative values. We observe counter-offers from tenants, which are increasingly accepted by landlords', specified in the March 2025 report. The repeal of the Rent Law allows the contract clauses to be determined freely between the parties. This includes the update formulas, duration, and currency for payment. According to the report by the College of Real Estate, the most chosen modality in 2025 is:

Despite the significant increase, 'the prices of rental housing are decreasing in real terms', as stated by the CPI. This is due to the fact that the rent increases are below the inflation rate, with an average decrease of 36.3% from January 2024 to February 2025.

**Fewer Multifamily Permits Today Could Mean Costlier Rents Ahead**
According to Realtor.com, the decline in multifamily permitting activity in the top 50 metros could lead to higher rent prices in the future. In 2024, only 294,000 multifamily units were permitted, which is well below the 318,000 units permitted at the peak of the pandemic in 2020. Danielle Hale, Chief Economist of Realtor.com, said, 'The low level of permitting for multifamily housing, particularly in markets where rents are still climbing, may become a catalyst for future rent growth.' In hot markets where demand is high, low levels of multifamily housing permitting will cause further supply constraints and could make rents go up even higher in the future. However, in some metros where multifamily permitting was higher than recent history, rent prices declined, such as Birmingham, Ala., where rent declined 5.4% YoY, and multifamily building permits grew by 22.10% from the average of the previous five years.

**Black First-Time Homebuyers on the Rise, According to Zillow -- RISMedia**
According to a new report from Zillow, Black first-time homebuyers are on the rise, accounting for 62% of the market in 2024. This is a record high, with Black households making up 63% of first-time buyers in 2023. Despite affordability challenges, Black first-time buyers are showing a strong commitment to homeownership, said Zillow Senior Economist Orphe Divounguy. 'While income disparities and saving difficulties continue to delay homebuying for Black households, programs like down payment assistance, first-time buyer tax credits and flexible lending options have helped increase access,' he said. The report also found that Black renters are 29% more likely to move into a more affordable metro and make the jump into homeownership. However, in 2024, the typical Black household could afford just 18% of homes for sale on Zillow, compared to 38% for white households. The most affordable housing markets for Black households include St. Louis, Birmingham, and Memphis, with 30.3%, 29.5%, and 29% of listings within reach, respectively.

**Black First-Time Homebuyers Are Purchasing Real Estate Despite Affordability Challenges Nationwide, Zillow Report Finds**
Despite rising market costs and affordability challenges, Black first-time homebuyers are driving a rebound in the housing market. According to a Zillow research report, Black first-time buyers made up 63% of first-time purchases in 2023 and 62% in 2024, outperforming all other racial groups. While only 17.6% of listings are within reach for a typical Black household, cities like St. Louis, Birmingham, and Memphis offer more affordable housing options, with 30.3%, 29.5%, and 29.0% of listings falling within reach, respectively. The growing flexibility of remote work is also contributing to the rise in Black homeownership, with Black renters 29% more likely to be in a position where homeownership could become attainable if remote work were an option. Zillow's innovative tools, such as the 'Buyability' tool, are helping potential buyers navigate these challenges and plan for homeownership.

**Housing market map: Zillow just revised its 2025 home price forecast**
Zillow economists have revised their 2025 home price forecast, expecting a 1.1% increase in U.S. home prices between January 2025 and January 2026, down from their previous 2.9% projection. They attribute this downward revision to higher-than-expected new listings and increased inventory. Zillow also predicts that U.S. existing home sales will remain unchanged at 4.1 million, which is below the pre-pandemic level of 5.3 million. Additionally, they forecast a 3.7% increase in single-family rents and a 3.1% increase in multifamily rents. The strongest home price appreciation is expected in Knoxville, TN (5.2%), Atlantic City, NJ (5.1%), and Torrington, CT (4.8%), while the weakest is expected in Lake Charles, LA (-7.3%), Houma, LA (-6.4%), and New Orleans, LA (-5.1%). Zillow notes that Florida's significant increase in active inventory and months of supply may signal potential pricing weakness, with single-family and condo prices currently declining in most Florida housing markets.
