**The new space race: Direct-to-device satellite communications**
The space communications industry is experiencing a boom, with launches occurring at a record-setting pace. Falling launch costs, from $20,000 per kilogram to under $2,000 per kilogram with SpaceX's Falcon 9, are driving this acceleration. The industry represents a $464 billion market, with 200 million direct-to-device capable smartphones sold in 2024 alone. Investors have poured $3 billion into direct-to-device satellite technology this year, recognizing its transformative potential. This shift is moving from traditional satellite phones to seamlessly integrated satellite capabilities in standard smartphones, making it increasingly important for enterprises with remote workers or disaster recovery needs to understand the evolving satellite communications landscape.

**Musk in Crisis: SpaceX Accelerates Starship Tests Amid Recent Failure**
In response to the recent failure of the Starship test, Elon Musk, founder and owner of SpaceX, has announced an acceleration of the test launch schedule. The plan is to increase the frequency of tests to three or four times a month. This acceleration is significant, despite the already demanding pace set by the private company. Only China, as a state, has been able to keep up with SpaceX's pace. The recent failure of the Starship test, which exploded on the ground, has likely caused damage to the launch structure and further delayed the program. This may explain the acceleration of the tests. Although Musk considers every failure a step towards success, he may face problems in the future. The Starship is a key part of the NASA's Artemis program to return humans to the Moon, and as such, it is well-funded. However, if the trust placed in SpaceX by the US space agency is lost, due to the recent disagreement with former President Donald Trump, Musk may face additional challenges. The cancellation of the proposal to appoint Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur and founder of Shift4, as the new Administrator of NASA, by Trump, does not help Musk's case. Musk had proposed Isaacman, who is closely tied to private space missions conducted by SpaceX, as a possible ally and symbol of the new vision for the US aerospace sector. It is also possible that the announced acceleration of the tests is a classic move by Musk to boost the stock prices of not only SpaceX, but also his other companies, including Tesla, the economic backbone of his business empire. Recently, the European car market has penalized Tesla, preferring the more affordable and technologically advanced Chinese brand BYD. If Tesla's sales have dropped by 50%, BYD has seen a 350% increase in sales. These numbers are relative, but they impose choices. We are not talking about a possible bankruptcy, but rather a necessary adjustment caused by some choices that have not been compatible with the entrepreneurial activity. The SpaceX, valued at 350 billion dollars, has a predicted value of 1 trillion dollars by 2040.

**Here's Why Rocket Lab Stock Is a Buy Before August | The Motley Fool**
Rocket Lab USA's (RKLB) stock has skyrocketed nearly 470% over the past 12 months due to successful Electron launches, fresh contracts, and upcoming Neutron rocket launches. Despite the recent rally, investors may still consider buying Rocket Lab's stock ahead of its next earnings report in August for five reasons: 1) its Electron rocket has successfully launched 66 times and carried small payloads of up to 300 kilograms into space; 2) it has secured big contracts from NASA, the U.S. Space Force, and other major customers; 3) its annual revenue has risen more than sevenfold from $62 million in 2021 to $436 million in 2024; 4) its Neutron rocket will have a higher maximum capacity of 13,000 kilograms to low-Earth orbit and is scheduled to arrive in the second half of 2025; and 5) the growing rift between the Trump administration and Elon Musk, as well as SpaceX's recent delays and failed launches, might drive more government contracts to Rocket Lab. Analysts expect Rocket Lab's revenue to nearly triple from $436 million to $1.2 billion from 2024 to 2027 and its adjusted EBITDA to turn positive in 2026 and more than triple to $202 million in 2027.

**Here's Why Rocket Lab Stock Is a Buy Before August**
Rocket Lab USA's (NASDAQ: RKLB) stock has risen 470% in the past 12 months due to successful Electron launches, new contracts, and upcoming Neutron rocket launches. Despite the recent rally, investors should consider buying Rocket Lab's stock ahead of its next earnings report in August for five reasons. Firstly, the Electron rocket has achieved 66 successful launches and deployed 227 satellites. Secondly, Rocket Lab has secured contracts with major customers such as NASA, the U.S. Space Force, and BlackSky Technology. Thirdly, annual revenue has increased more than sevenfold from $62 million in 2021 to $436 million in 2024. Fourthly, the Neutron rocket will have a higher maximum capacity of 13,000 kilograms and has already secured new contracts from NASA and a leading satellite network operator. Lastly, Rocket Lab's adjusted EBITDA margins have improved from negative 70% in 2021 to negative 22% in 2024, driven by more launches, higher average launch prices, and increased in-house manufacturing. As SpaceX faces delays and failed launches, Rocket Lab may secure more government contracts in the future.

**Macron says Europe must become 'space power' again**
President Emmanuel Macron has called for Europe to regain its status as a global space power, warning that France risks being squeezed out of the low-orbit satellite constellation market. Macron emphasized the need for increased investment in the European space industry, citing the challenges posed by US and Chinese rivals, including SpaceX and China's growing involvement. 'SpaceX has disrupted the market, Amazon is also getting involved. China is not far behind, and I think we all need to be very clear-headed,' Macron said. He urged European countries to prioritize their independence in satellite infrastructure and called for collaboration with non-European partners. Macron also announced plans to organize a space summit in early 2026 to 'mobilize our public and private partners across the globe.' As part of a deal worth 1.35 billion euros, the French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, positioning the company as an alternative to Starlink.

**WindTre Announces Price Increase for Some Fixed Network Offers**
WindTre has announced a price increase for some of its fixed network offers, with a 2 euro per month increase effective from September 1, 2025. The change is motivated by the need to reposition the commercial offer and ensure services in line with market demand. According to the operator, customers will receive an official communication with their June bill, informing them of the contract variation. As per regulations, customers will have the option to terminate the contract without penalties, including the possibility of porting to another operator. Those who do not wish to accept the price increase must notify WindTre of their intention to cancel by August 31, 2025, citing 'Modification of contractual conditions' as the reason. Customers who have purchased a product on credit, such as a modem or smartphone, will have the option to continue with the monthly payments or settle the outstanding balance in a single payment. WindTre has also scheduled a further price increase for some fixed network offers, effective from August 1, 2025, with an increase of 2-3 euros per month, and a deadline for cancellation by July 31, 2025. The operator continues to adjust its tariffs, while giving customers the right to choose whether to maintain their offer or switch to another provider without additional costs.

**Naftogaz Wins $1.37 Billion Arbitration Case Against Gazprom**
Naftogaz announced that an international arbitration tribunal in Switzerland has ordered Gazprom to pay $1.37 billion in favor of Naftogaz. According to Naftogaz's chairman, Sergiy Korchevskyi, Gazprom has been violating its 'take or pay' contract obligations since May 2022, stopping payments. 'We initiated arbitration in September 2022, which Gazprom tried to block through Russian courts. This didn't work. Now we have the final decision: the tribunal of arbitrators from Sweden, Switzerland, and Israel has fully sided with Naftogaz. This is an important victory. I sincerely thank the professional team of lawyers at Naftogaz and our legal advisors Wikborg Rein for this result. The next step is to ensure the enforcement of the decision. We will work on this step by step,' Korchevskyi wrote. This is not the first victory for Naftogaz in arbitration. In April 2025, a Paris court recognized and granted permission for the enforcement of the Hague arbitration award regarding the compensation for damages caused by Russia's unlawful expropriation of Naftogaz's assets in Crimea, worth $5 billion. In December 2024, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands rejected Russia's cassation appeal, which aimed to cancel the partial decision of the Hague arbitration on compensation for damages caused by the unlawful expropriation of Naftogaz's assets in Crimea. The court confirmed that Russia expropriated Naftogaz's Crimean assets, violating the provisions of the intergovernmental agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the encouragement and mutual protection of investments. In October, the Helsinki District Court satisfied the petition of Naftogaz Ukraine and five other companies of the Naftogaz group, imposing an arrest on specific assets belonging to Russia on the territory of Finland.

**Oyo APC asks Makinde to cancel N63.5bn govt house renovation plan**
The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State has called on Governor Seyi Makinde to reconsider his plan to allocate N63.5 billion to renovate the Agodi Government House. The party criticized the move as a display of profligacy, insensitivity, and impunity, warning that it could further destabilize the state's economy. The APC also questioned the need for such a significant investment in renovations for structures built to last decades and previously renovated by the former administration in 2017. The party further raised concerns about potential contract splitting in the ongoing upgrade of Alakia Airport and the proposed aircraft purchases, warning that this could serve as a means for a few individuals in power to misappropriate public funds. According to Olawale Sadare, the Oyo APC Publicity Secretary, 'all he could do to defend the reckless spending in the name of Government House renovation was to announce another plan to purchase two aircraft for him to monitor criminals from the air space.' The party concluded that 'aircrafts are not what Oyo state needs at the moment to combat crime but synergy among stakeholders, motivation of security agents and deployment of relevant technologies.'

**Trump Threatens to Review Multi-Million Dollar Contracts with Elon Musk's Companies**
US President Donald Trump has announced that he will review the government contracts with companies owned by Elon Musk, including SpaceX and Tesla, calling them 'considerable subsidies'. Trump stated, 'We're going to review everything... it's a lot of money. It's a considerable subsidy.' This comes after a series of public exchanges between the two, which began with Trump criticizing Musk's proposal for the US budget and escalated into a public feud on social media. Despite Musk's attempts to reduce tension, Trump showed no interest in reconciliation, stating on his Truth Social platform that the best way to save millions for the government is 'to cancel the subsidies and contracts' with Musk. The main target of Trump's comments is SpaceX, which received a $5.9 billion contract from the US Space Force in April to launch satellites over the next five years. Musk had also threatened to cancel the Dragon program, essential for supply and transportation to the International Space Station, but later backtracked and ruled out dismantling the project. When asked if he would cancel the contracts with Musk, Trump was ambiguous, stating, 'We'll analyze it, only if it's fair. Only if it's fair for him and for the country.' He also denied any intention to investigate Musk's companies, but left the possibility open for the future.

**Musk and Trump's Relationship Deteriorates, Threatening SpaceX's NASA Contracts**
A recent controversy between US President Trump and billionaire Elon Musk has sparked concerns about the stability of US space missions. The dispute began when Musk criticized a budget adjustment bill supported by Trump, leading to a heated exchange of words between the two. Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that 'the simplest way to save billions of dollars is to terminate Elon's government contracts and subsidies', although he did not directly mention SpaceX. Musk responded on X by stating that SpaceX would begin to retire its Dragon spacecraft. However, Musk later clarified that he would not retire the spacecraft. The incident has raised concerns about the impact on US space development and national defense if the government were to cancel its contracts with SpaceX. According to Musk, SpaceX is expected to generate $155 billion in revenue in 2025, with $11 billion coming from NASA. SpaceX has also been involved in several military satellite launch missions and provides Starlink communication services and develops surveillance satellite networks for the US Department of Defense. Industry insiders point out that losing these contracts would not only damage SpaceX's revenue but also create chaos in US space policy. Currently, only SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Russia's Soyuz can transport astronauts to and from the International Space Station. NASA relies heavily on SpaceX for its space missions, and SpaceX is also building a new generation of 'retired' spacecraft for NASA to safely remove the space station from orbit.

**Trump's Threat to Kill SpaceX Presents One Hidden Safety Concern**
President Trump's threat to cancel SpaceX's government contracts raises concerns about the safety of the International Space Station. SpaceX is currently tasked with building the United States Deorbit Vehicle (USDV) to safely deorbit the ISS by the end of the decade. If SpaceX were to lose its government contracts, it's unclear who would take over this critical task. NASA awarded SpaceX a $843 million contract in 2024 to build the USDV, and SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft has proven to be the most reliable way for the U.S. to get people in and out of space. While SpaceX's Starlink services are profitable, losing the NASA contract would not put the company out of business. As Ken Bowersox said, 'Selecting a U.S. Deorbit Vehicle for the International Space Station will help NASA and its international partners ensure a safe and responsible transition in low Earth orbit at the end of station operations.'

**Musk's Companies Receive $38 Billion in Government Contracts, Canceling Them Would Have Severe Consequences**
Elon Musk's companies, SpaceX and Tesla, have received over $38 billion in government contracts. SpaceX has received $3.8 billion in government contracts in 2024 alone. The company has a monopoly on transporting astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station and has a exclusive contract to dismantle the ISS in 2030, a critical task to avoid an accident with the largest artificial object in orbit. Tesla, on the other hand, does not rely heavily on direct government contracts. However, it benefits from tax credits, subsidies, and other incentives. The consequences of canceling these contracts would be severe: the International Space Station would be at risk of being left without transportation of personnel and supplies, and the Artemis mission would face significant delays, potentially allowing the Chinese space program to take the lead. The safety of the US in space would also be compromised, as the United Launch Alliance is experiencing certification issues with its new rocket and is not ready to take on all the missions. For Tesla, the main risk is not the loss of contracts but the tightening of regulatory frameworks. The government could: freeze the approval of Full Self Driving and Autopilot systems through the NHTSA, delay the development of the Starship and the expansion of SpaceX's facilities through the FAA, or reduce or eliminate tax credits for EVs, hurting demand. The political and geopolitical cost of canceling these collaborations would be a strategic mistake, experts warn, unless they are immediately replaced by alternative solutions, which is not currently realistic.

**Trump Threatens to Cancel Contracts with Elon Musk's Companies**
US President Donald Trump has threatened to cancel government contracts with companies owned by Elon Musk, including SpaceX and Tesla, in response to a dispute over the fiscal plan. Trump stated on Truth Social, 'The easiest way to save billions of dollars in our budget is to cancel Elon's government subsidies and contracts.' SpaceX has the most government contracts with the US government, including a $5.9 billion contract with the Space Force for satellite launches and missions over the next five years. Tesla may also be affected, as the US Department of State had reserved $400 million for the purchase of hundreds of Cybertruck units, although the status of that contract is currently unknown. Trump's message comes after a public disagreement between the two, with both sides exchanging criticism on social media. Musk had called the fiscal plan an 'abomination' and criticized Republicans who voted for it, accusing them of making a 'mistake' by supporting a plan that would increase public debt. Trump responded by saying that Musk never showed him the plan and went further by stating that without his support, he would never have won the 2024 election. Musk has also considered creating a new political party, with an online poll showing 83% of people in favor and 17% against.

**Trump Threatens to Cancel Contracts with Elon Musk's Companies**
Donald Trump has threatened to cancel contracts and subsidies with Elon Musk's companies, SpaceX and Tesla, in response to their disagreement over Trump's new fiscal plan. Trump claims that canceling these agreements would save 'millions of dollars' in the federal budget. He expressed surprise that his predecessor, Joe Biden, did not take this measure earlier. Trump stated, 'The way to save millions of dollars in our budget is to cancel the government contracts and subsidies of Elon. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!' The companies of Elon Musk have various contracts with the US government, mainly through SpaceX and Tesla. SpaceX has a $5.9 billion contract with the US Space Force to launch satellites and other missions over five years. Tesla could also be affected by Trump's statements, as the Department of State had reserved $400 million to acquire units of the Cybertruck electric pickup truck. However, the status of this contract is unclear. The tension between the two arose over Trump's new fiscal plan, which Musk strongly criticized, calling it a 'repugnant abomination.' Musk also questioned the plan's increase in public debt and the support of it by Republican lawmakers. Trump responded by saying that Musk knew the details of the plan and was disappointed by his criticism. He also mentioned that Musk's support was key to his 2024 electoral victory, which now seems uncertain. In the midst of this dispute, Musk posted a poll on his X account asking if it was time to create a new political party, with 83% of participants in favor of the idea.

**SpaceX, Blue Origin, and ULA Secure $13 Billion Contracts with US Space Force**
SpaceX, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance (ULA) have secured multimillion-dollar contracts with the US Space Force, worth over $13 billion, to lead 54 critical missions under the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program's Phase 3 between 2025 and 2029. SpaceX and ULA will receive over $5 billion each to execute approximately 28 and 19 missions, respectively. Blue Origin will receive around $2.4 billion for seven missions starting from the 2026 fiscal year. The Space Force aims to increase competition in the program, which launches sensitive and valuable military technologies. The missions will begin between 2027 and 2032, approximately two years after the contract awards. 'The US leads the world in space launches, and through these Phase 3 NSSL contracts, we will ensure continued access to this vital domain,' said Major General Stephen Purdy, the Air Force's interim undersecretary for space acquisition and integration. The NSSL program, initiated in 1994 by the Air Force, began assigning contracts for new-generation launch vehicles in 2018. So far, all missions have been conducted with SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, and ULA's retired Delta IV and Atlas V rockets. During Phase 1, the Air Force contracted ULA, Blue Origin, and Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems (NGIS) to develop the Vulcan Centaur, New Glenn, and OmegA rockets, with the latter being canceled in 2020. SpaceX already had active and certified rockets at the time. In Phase 2, ULA and SpaceX won a total of $3.5 billion for around 30 missions between 2022 and 2026. The Falcon rockets have completed five missions under this phase. In March, the Space Force certified the Vulcan rocket, which could allow ULA to fully rejoin the program this year. Phase 3 significantly expands, more than doubling the number of missions planned in Phase 2. 'The result is guaranteed access to space for our national security missions, which increases military readiness,' said Brigadier General Kristin Panzenhagen, the program's Access to Space director. Panzenhagen announced in January that 18 Phase 2 missions are expected to be launched in 2025, including 11 with the Vulcan rocket. She also anticipated that New Glenn will be certified for Lane 1, although its inclusion in Lane 2 has not been confirmed. The FAA closed its investigation last week, clearing the way for a new New Glenn launch in the coming months.

**SpaceX Secures $5.9 Billion Contract with US Government for Space Exploration**
SpaceX, a space company owned by Elon Musk, has won a $5.9 billion contract with the US government to make its rockets available for launching military satellites. According to the US Space Forces, SpaceX will be responsible for 28 out of 54 planned missions by 2029. The US Space Forces believe that this agreement will provide them with a reliable access to space for executing national security missions that will serve the military. SpaceX dominates the US spaceflight market and has been performing regular missions for NASA and other clients. Other companies, such as United Launch Services ($5.4 billion) and Blue Origin ($2.4 billion), have also secured similar deals with the US administration for space exploration.

**Space Startup Plans Reusable Rocket Inspired by SpaceX - iHLS**
Cosmoleap, a Chinese rocket startup founded in March 2024, has raised around $14 million to develop its Yueqian rocket and recovery system. The concept design for Yueqian bears a striking resemblance to SpaceX's Starship, particularly in its planned rocket recovery method, which involves a reusable booster caught by mechanical 'chopstick' arms. Cosmoleap plans to conduct its first flight test of the Yueqian rocket by 2025 or 2026 and is eyeing a much larger rocket, capable of carrying 100 tons to low Earth orbit, which it plans to launch by 2030. While the startup has sparked criticism online for its similarities to SpaceX's technology, it has secured backing from multiple investors and joins a growing ecosystem of private space companies in China.
