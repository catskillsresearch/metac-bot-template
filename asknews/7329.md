**DC Edit | Centre Needs To Take Lead To Kickstart The Economy**
India's economy grew by 6.5% in FY 2024-25, retaining its position as the fastest-growing large economy in the world. However, a deeper analysis reveals a slowdown in momentum, particularly in the manufacturing sector, which grew by 4.5% compared to 4.6% in the previous year. This has raised concerns about deceleration and the country's ability to create jobs for its growing youth population. The government is under pressure to frame an appropriate industrial policy to stimulate domestic consumption and increase capital expenditure, but risk-averse companies are unlikely to raise salaries or expand their workforce, shifting the onus onto the Central government to kick-start the slowing economy. As said by the article, 'the government could find it challenging to frame an appropriate industrial policy'.

**Global Public Debt Rises at a Faster Rate, Threatening Long-Term Sustainability**
According to a recent report by our team, the global public debt is expected to rise to 100% of the world's GDP by the end of the decade if current trends continue. This increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio reflects the renewed economic pressures, as well as the financial consequences of the pandemic, as stated in our report. The graph for this week shows that about a third of the countries, which represent 80% of the world's GDP, have a higher public debt than before the pandemic, and it is increasing at a faster rate. More than two-thirds of the 175 economies studied are now facing the burden of a heavier public debt than before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The development of public debt over the past 5 years has varied greatly between countries, meaning that fiscal policy should differ in line with the specific factors and conditions of each country. However, given the uncertain times that may await us due to the strong tensions in trade policies, countries everywhere will need much greater flexibility. Specifically, fiscal policy should be: part of comprehensive macroeconomic policies aimed at stability. In most countries, it should aim to reduce public debt and rebuild the ability to spend and respond to new pressures and other economic shocks through a medium-term reliable framework. Increase the potential growth to alleviate political tensions. In a state of uncertainty, fiscal policy should establish trust and stability for economies to achieve growth and prosperity. It is increasingly necessary for governments to build trust, impose taxes fairly, and spend wisely. Policymakers should commit their political capital to promote trust. This begins by doubling their efforts to maintain order in their financial households.

**Understanding the New Global Economy**
As the world becomes more volatile and complex, policymakers, business leaders, and investors must reassess their mental models for analyzing the global economy. Three structural dynamics are transforming the global landscape: capital flows, demographic changes, and ideological divisions. Capital flows are driven by regulatory requirements and investors' search for higher returns in various sectors and regions. The US represents nearly 70% of global market capitalization and attracts over 70% of global private investment flows, valued at $13 trillion. However, global debt has reached 237% of global GDP, raising concerns about who holds pending liabilities and the extent of hidden leverage in the global financial system. Demographic changes will significantly impact global demand and production of basic goods like food and energy. The world's population is expected to reach 11.2 billion by 2100, with 90% of the population living in emerging markets. The Indian population, for example, will remain heavily dependent on coal and fossil fuels. The transfer of wealth from baby boomers to millennials is estimated to be $84 trillion by 2045. Ideological divisions between countries and regions are also a concern, with the collapse of multilateralism and fragmentation of trade, capital flows, migration, and ideas already being valued by markets. The desglobalization has led to a shift towards greater centralization in contracting, sourcing, and trade of goods and services, and is putting at risk 'carry trade' operations and making it difficult to repatriate profits.

**Europe's Aging Population: A Growing Concern**
The median age in Europe has reached 44.7 years, with some countries, such as Italy, already exceeding 48.7 years. According to Eurostat, the population of the EU will begin to decline in 2026, with a projected decrease of 50 million people by 2100. The main cause of this demographic shift is the decline in fertility rates, which have fallen below the replacement level. In 2023, the global fertility rate in the EU was 1.38 children per woman, down from 1.44 in 2003 and below the replacement level of 2.1. Eurostat estimates that the proportion of people aged 65 or older will increase from 21.6% in 2024 to 32.5% in 2100, while the proportion of people aged 80 or older will multiply by 2.5, from 6% to 15%. The tasa de dependencia, which measures the relationship between the number of young people and those of older age, will tend to worsen, with a projected ratio of two people in work for every one dependent in 2024. As stated by Eurostat, 'the process of aging is so accelerated, linked to the increases in longevity, that Eurostat predicts that the proportion of people aged 80 or more in the population of the EU will multiply by 2.5 between 2024 and 2100, passing from 6% to 15%.'

**India to Surpass Japan as Third-Largest Economy, but Challenges Remain**
India is expected to surpass Japan as the third-largest economy by the end of 2025, according to the IMF. However, the country's per capita income is similar to that of Bangladesh. The Indian government has been celebrating this achievement, with President Emmanuel Macron of France supporting India's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. However, the country's economic growth has not translated to improved living standards for the majority of its population, with 80% of Indians still relying on rationing cards. The Indian government faces significant challenges, including creating 200 million jobs in the next decade and addressing climate change, which could see the city of Bombay underwater by 2050. Despite these challenges, the Indian stock market has seen significant growth, with the Sensex index increasing by 3.75% this year. An anonymous employee of the World Bank notes that while the Indian government has made improvements in infrastructure and digitalization, corruption remains a significant issue.

**Indonesia has more people than Russia, Canada, Australia & Germany put together**
According to the UN projections for the year 2100, Indonesia is expected to surpass the combined population of Russia, Canada, Australia, and Germany. By 2100, African countries such as Congo, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Egypt are expected to form more than 10% of the global population. In contrast, China is expected to lose nearly half its people by the end of the century, while Russia and Japan are also in demographic decline. As the author notes, 'a lot of demographic dividend is yet to be realized' in countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nigeria, which are currently ranked lowly in terms of GDP.

**Catalonia's Future: Preparing for a Population of 10 Million**
The Catalan government believes that the region will reach 10 million inhabitants in the near future and is preparing for the challenges that come with it. The current population of 8 million is expected to grow due to immigration, with the government projecting that the population will reach 10 million by 2052. However, some experts argue that this growth is not sustainable and that the region's infrastructure and services are not equipped to handle it. The government is planning to update the 1995 Plan Territorial General de Catalunya to address the needs of the growing population, including housing, transportation, and education. The plan aims to ensure that the region's resources are used efficiently and that the population has access to the services they need. Some experts, such as sociologist Mariña Couceiro, argue that immigration has been the driving force behind Catalonia's economic growth and that it is essential for the region's prosperity. Others, like Jaume Grau of Ecologistas en Acción, are concerned about the environmental impact of the growing population and the need for sustainable development. The government is aware of the challenges ahead and is working to address them, but the debate is ongoing and there are differing opinions on how to manage the region's growth.

**Diminishing Returns Threaten World Economic Stability**
The author predicts that the world economy will shrink in the next 10 years due to energy and debt limits. The economy is facing diminishing returns in various areas, including fossil fuels, uranium, fresh water, and minerals. The author cites various factors, such as rising population, low oil prices, and high debt levels, as contributing to the impending economic contraction. The author also expects a decline in living standards, with governments becoming vulnerable to cutbacks and universities enrolling fewer students. Additionally, the author predicts an increase in debt defaults, bank failures, and tariffs, as well as a rise in empty shelves and interest rates. The author notes that this list is not exhaustive and that new economies may begin to evolve in the future.

**Opinion | Having more babies isn't the only answer**
The United States is facing a potential 'baby bust' and the government is proposing initiatives to encourage women to have more children. However, experts argue that simply throwing money at young couples or fortifying social welfare is not enough. Bina Venkataraman suggests that technology and AI can boost the productivity of a nation's economy without requiring a replacement of the labor force at the same rate. She also proposes a combination of bringing in robots and immigrants to meet the labor needs. According to the United Nations, by 2100, South Korea's population is expected to decrease by 58% to nearly 22 million people, while the rest of the world is expected to peak at 10 billion people before potentially plummeting. Only six countries are predicted to have fertility rates above replacement rate by 2100: Somalia, Niger, Chad, Samoa, Tonga, and Tajikistan.

**The World's Aging Population and Falling Growth Rate (1980-2100)**
The global population is undergoing a significant demographic shift, with average ages rising and population growth slowing down. According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook, April 2025 edition, the average person is 33.6 years old, up from 26.5 years in 1980, and global population growth has slowed from 1.8% to 0.9% in 2025. This trend is expected to continue through the end of the century, with the global population projected to begin declining in 2085 and the average person expected to be 43 years old by 2100. However, the trend is divided across countries, with advanced economies like Japan, Germany, and Italy aging rapidly and seeing population declines, while emerging economies like India still have growing populations but slowing growth. The IMF notes that while people are living longer, they're also aging more healthfully, which could result in longer working lives and enhance productivity among older workers, potentially easing the economic impacts of an aging population.

**Age-burdened "silver economy" comes with silver linings, IMF finds**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has concluded that an ageing population need not be a 'demographic time bomb' for the economy. According to the IMF, governments can promote policies to keep senior citizens fit and employable, and make early retirement less appealing. The report found that healthier ageing trends can boost labor force participation, extend working lives, and enhance productivity. The IMF forecast that global population growth will slow from 1.1% per year to zero by 2100, with the average age of the world's population increasing by 11 years between 2020 and the end of the century. A survey of 41 advanced and emerging economies found that a person who reached the age of 70 in 2022 had the same cognitive ability as a 53-year-old in 2000, making older citizens more likely to be working and earning. The IMF recommends a comprehensive approach to increase effective retirement ages, including pension reforms, training, and workplace adaptations, as well as lifelong upskilling and reskilling programs to ensure individuals remain employable.

**Africa By 2040: The Future Of Africa’s Youth - P.M.EXPRESS**
Africa's population is projected to grow significantly over the next century, with the continent's population expected to double by 2070 and reach 40% of the world's total population by 2100. This demographic trend has created a massively young population, with 70% of Africans under the age of 30. However, this youth bulge can be either an asset or a liability, depending on the choices governments make today for the future. Professor Kingsley Moghalu, President of the African School of Governance, argues that massive investments in education, skills development, and innovation are required to future-proof Africa's youth. He also emphasizes the need for competent governance, including providing security and tackling conflicts and terrorism. Moghalu concludes that Africa's youth population boom can be a super story of broad-based prosperity or a dystopian future of unemployment and frustration, and that the choices governments make today will determine the outcome.

**China's 80s Generation Faces Significant Crisis**
China's 80s generation is facing a significant crisis, with a mortality rate of 5.2% compared to 4% for the 70s generation, 0.7% for the 60s generation, and 2% for the 50s generation. This has led to a significant decrease in the number of people in this age group, with over 11 million people having died by 2024. The 80s generation has been described as a 'killing' generation, with many people in this age group having died suddenly due to various reasons. The Chinese government has been criticized for its handling of the population crisis, with some experts predicting that the population will decline to 493 million by 2050 and 100 million by 2100. The decline in population has also led to a significant increase in the number of elderly people, with some experts predicting that the ratio of elderly people to working-age people will reach 1.3:1 by 2050. This has raised concerns about the sustainability of the pension system and the impact on the economy. The decline in population has also led to a decrease in the number of marriages and births, with some experts predicting that the number of marriages will decline by 50% and the number of births will decline by 60-70% in the future. The Chinese government has been criticized for its handling of the population crisis, with some experts calling for a more proactive approach to address the issue.

**China's Population Decline: A Major Challenge for the Country's Future**
The Chinese government has released the results of the seventh population census, which shows a significant decline in the population of the 80s generation. According to the data, the mortality rate of the 80s generation is around 5.2%, which is higher than that of the 70s, 60s, and 50s generations. This phenomenon has caused widespread concern. The population of China has been declining since 2022, and the number of marriages in 2024 has reached a record low. Many experts believe that the decline in population will have a significant impact on China's economy and social development. The 80s generation has been experiencing a lot of pressure, including high unemployment rates, low wages, and a lack of social security. Many 80s generation individuals have expressed their concerns about the future of China's population and the impact it will have on their lives. The Chinese government is facing a major challenge in addressing the issue of population decline and its consequences. According to the United Nations, China's population is expected to decline by half by 2100, which will have a significant impact on the country's economy and social development. The Chinese government needs to take immediate action to address the issue of population decline and its consequences.

**The New Demographic Realities Nations Ar**
A McKinsey Global Institute report warns that top economies are facing a 'population collapse' due to falling birth rates. By 2100, some countries could see their populations decline by 20-50%. The world is experiencing a 'youth deficit' as people have fewer children, with two-thirds of the global population living in countries with fertility rates below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per family. McKinsey predicts that if demographic trends continue, younger people will face slower economic growth while supporting larger cohorts of retirees, eroding generational wealth. The study warns that 'something must give' to support existing income and retirement norms, citing countries like China, Italy, and Brazil, which are projected to experience significant population declines. The primary driver of this trend is not longer lifespans, but a 'youth deficit' due to fewer young people. The world's support ratio has dropped from 9.4 in 1997 to 6.5 today and is expected to reach 3.9 by 2050, putting a growing burden on younger people and increasing government deficits and debts.

**Global Demographic Decline: Impacts on Economies and Societies**
A recent report by McKinsey Global Institute has highlighted the global demographic decline, which will have significant impacts on economies and societies in the coming decades. By 2100, some countries, such as China, Japan, and Italy, will experience a population decline of 20-50%. This will lead to changes in consumption patterns, labor markets, and business locations. The report predicts that the global consumption will more than double by 2050, but it will be concentrated in different regions. The main consumers will be the US, India, and emerging Asia. The African continent will have a unique situation, with a growing population and increasing consumption. To adapt to these changes, businesses will need to invest in technology, develop skills, and adjust their workforce. Governments will also need to implement policies to mitigate the effects of demographic decline, such as immigration and education. The report concludes that the world will need to increase cooperation to address the challenges of demographic decline.
