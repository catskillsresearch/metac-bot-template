**Starship IFT-9 Test Flight Raises Concerns about Human Missions to the Moon and Mars**
The recent Starship IFT-9 test flight has raised concerns about the potential delay of human missions to the Moon and Mars. The flight saw several new improvements, including a redesigned structure to prevent fuel leaks and tile burnout, but unfortunately, these changes did not succeed. The mission was unable to deploy a mock payload, which is crucial for the Starlink satellite constellation. This delay could impact the development of the satellite internet, as well as the human missions to the Moon and Mars. Elon Musk has postponed the conference on Mars flights, and the 2028 manned mission to Mars is now uncertain. The company has received permission for 25 launches in 2025, but the Starship is still only launching every few months. Additionally, SpaceX has a contract with NASA to create a lunar landing module HLS based on Starship, which is due to be completed in 2027. However, this poses significant challenges, including the need to develop a life support system for astronauts and a 50-meter spacecraft capable of landing on the Moon. The company's attention is now focused on the development of Starlink and the lunar landing module, rather than the human missions to Mars.

**Trump Withdraws Nomination of Isaacman as NASA Head, Deal Blow to Elon Musk**
A surprise turn of events has dealt a setback to Elon Musk. Trump had nominated a close friend of the tech billionaire, Isaacman, as the new head of NASA, but Trump has now withdrawn his nomination. Trump did not comment on the reasons for his decision, but it is believed that Isaacman's past donations to the Democratic Party and his close ties to Musk may have been factors. Musk is stepping down as a special envoy to the US government. This comes at a bad time for Musk, as the US government plans to cut NASA's budget by a quarter and reduce its staff by a third. The government also plans to redefine NASA's mission, with a focus on missions to the moon and Mars. This is important for SpaceX, which is developing the Starship rocket, capable of carrying up to 100 tons of cargo and potentially enabling a manned mission to Mars in a few years. Musk aims to send a million people to Mars by 2050. However, SpaceX has faced repeated setbacks in the development of the Starship, including a recent test flight that ended in a crash in the Indian Ocean. Musk remains undeterred, and has outlined an ambitious plan for a Mars mission, including a unmanned flight in 2026, a crewed flight in 2027, and the establishment of a Mars station in 2029, with the help of Optimus robots built by Tesla.

**Musk retains plan to fly Starship to Mars in 2026 despite setbacks**
Elon Musk has reaffirmed his plan to send Starship to Mars in 2026, despite recent setbacks in test flights. Musk stated that the success of this mission depends on Starship's ability to accomplish several challenging technical feats, including a post-launch refueling manoeuvre in earth orbit. He gave SpaceX a 50% chance of meeting the deadline. If not, the company will wait two years before trying again. Musk envisions launching 1,000 to 2,000 ships to Mars every two years to establish a self-sustaining human settlement. NASA plans to return humans to the moon aboard Starship in 2027, with the goal of launching astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. Musk has previously aimed to send an uncrewed vehicle to Mars by 2018 and a crewed mission by 2024, but has since pushed back the timeline.
