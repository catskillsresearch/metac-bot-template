**There may be a surprising upside to losing coral reefs as oceans warm**
Researchers have found a potential upside to the decline of coral reefs due to warming oceans: the seas may absorb up to 5% more carbon dioxide by 2100, slowing the build-up of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Lester Kwiatkowski, a researcher at Sorbonne University, notes that while this is a beneficial effect, the decline of corals will also reduce biodiversity, harm fisheries, and leave coasts more exposed to rising seas. Kwiatkowski's team used a computer model to estimate that the oceans could take up between 1 and 5% more carbon by 2100, and up to 13% more by 2300. However, this does not account for other factors that can cause reef decline, such as overfishing and coral diseases. If their estimates are correct, it means that the amount of emitted CO2 that will lead to a given level of warming - the carbon budget - is a little larger than currently thought.

**The Newtons Laboratory and Protergia Prove It’s Never Too Late to Fall in Love | LBBOnline**
The Newtons Laboratory and Protergia conducted a national study on Greek citizens over 65, revealing a reality that contradicts the common narrative of decline. The study found that 65+ individuals are active, connected, and thriving, with key findings including: 33% saying their age does not limit them in daily activities, 50% enjoying trying new things typically associated with younger people, and 66% owning a smartphone. The campaign 'Dedicated to Those Who Never Stop Dreaming' presents a tender story of unexpected romance between two older characters, celebrating love, connection, and optimism at any age. The campaign aims to acknowledge the value, vitality, and right to be seen, heard, and represented with dignity of the 65+ generation, which will make up nearly one-third of EU citizens by 2100. As Protergia, the largest independent provider of electricity in Greece, challenges assumptions and sparks reappraisal among the 65+ audience, the campaign's message is simple: life doesn't stop at 65 — and neither should love.

**Scientists Predict Sea Level Rise and Irreversible Consequences Due to Glacier Melting**
A group of international scientists from Switzerland, the US, Belgium, and other countries have concluded that if current warming trends continue, three-quarters of the Earth's glacier mass will disappear by 2100, causing a 23 cm sea level rise and other irreversible consequences. The study, published in the journal Science, highlights the situation in Alaska, where up to 69% of the glaciers could disappear, despite the region having the third-largest glacier reserve in the world (16,246 gigatons). Even in the best-case scenario, Alaska would lose 41% of its ice, and global losses would be 47%. Unlike previous studies, which were limited to 2100, the new modeling considers the period until the glaciers reach a state of 'equilibrium' - in the case of Alaska, this would take 330 years. The study involved 21 scientists from 10 countries, using eight different climate models to analyze 200,000 glaciers. The scientists believe that even if warming stops, glaciers will continue to melt for hundreds of years due to 'climate inertia'. They consider the current decade critical for taking measures to preserve the Earth's cryosphere.

**Scientists in Panic: Planet Faces Catastrophic Consequences Due to Ice Loss**
A group of international scientists from Switzerland, the US, Belgium, and other countries have concluded that if the current rate of warming continues, three-quarters of the Earth's ice mass will disappear by 2100, resulting in a 23 cm rise in sea levels and other irreversible consequences. The study, published in the Science journal, notes that the situation in Alaska is particularly alarming, where up to 69% of the ice could disappear, despite the region having the third-largest ice reserve in the world (16,246 gigatons). Even under an optimal scenario, Alaska would lose 41% of its ice, with global losses reaching 47%. Unlike previous studies, which were limited to 2100, the new modeling considers a period of up to 330 years to reach 'equilibrium' for Alaska's ice. The study involved 21 scientists from 10 countries, using eight different climate models to analyze 200,000 ice formations. The researchers emphasize that even if warming stops, ice will continue to melt for hundreds of years due to 'climate inertia.' They stress that the current decade is critical for taking measures to preserve the Earth's cryosphere.

**The Riemann Hypothesis and Magic: The Gathering**
A group of Magic: The Gathering players, including Alex Churchill and Haow Chung Yin, have created a programming language that uses the game's cards to perform mathematical calculations. They have also created a scenario where the game can be used to solve the Riemann Hypothesis, a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. The scenario involves a card that creates a legendary creature, Primo, when a player controls a prime number of lands. The creature can then be used to create more lands, and the process can be repeated to create an infinite amount of damage. The damage is infinite if and only if the Riemann Hypothesis is true. While this is not a direct solution to the problem, it is an interesting and creative way to think about it. The article also mentions that the game has been used to create other mathematical scenarios, such as a card that creates a machine that can perform any calculation, and a card that creates a counter that can count to infinity. The article concludes that while this is not a direct solution to the problem, it is an interesting and creative way to think about it, and it may inspire new ideas and approaches to solving the problem.

**Title: I Gave Up Proving the Riemann Hypothesis  --  and Found Emptiness**
The author, who was once driven to prove the Riemann Hypothesis, has abandoned the pursuit after realizing that the zeros they were trying to compute were 'too perfect'. The author believes that the Riemann Hypothesis is not just a question of prime numbers, but a question of certainty. Despite verifying the first ten trillion non-trivial zeros, which all fall precisely on the critical line, the author wonders if the line is a 'law of the universe' or just a 'mirror' created by the act of looking. As G.H. Hardy once said, 'if the Riemann Hypothesis is not true, then the universe is not what we think it is.'

**Spectral Coherence and Geometric Reformulation of the Riemann Hypothesis via Torsion-Free Vector...**
A new approach to the Riemann Hypothesis has been proposed, focusing on spectral coherence and geometric reformulation. The hypothesis is reframed as a problem of spectral stability, where the distribution of non-trivial zeros is not chaotic, but follows a geometric principle of angular alignment. The Vectorial Reformulation constructs a complex vector-valued function that sums the directional influence of the non-trivial zeros over a regularized spectrum. The author demonstrates that the only configuration in which the global torsion function vanishes is the critical line itself, connecting the Riemann Hypothesis with concepts from differential geometry and coherent interference. The complete paper is available on open-access repositories Zenodo, Figshare, and Harvard Dataverse.

**The Real Madrid's Unsolvable Secret: A Mathematical Problem?**
The Real Madrid's success can be compared to the Riemann Hypothesis, a mathematical problem that has been unsolved for over 150 years. The team's ability to win without playing exceptional football is a mystery that has been debated by experts. According to the article, there are two main reasons for the team's success: the quality of its players and an intangible quality that is often referred to as 'carácter' or 'gen ganador'. This quality is difficult to explain, but it is thought to be a key factor in the team's ability to win consistently. The article also mentions that the Real Madrid's success is not just due to its players, but also to the team's ability to overcome adversity and win despite its weaknesses. As the article states, 'No hay dinámica ganadora en el mundo del fútbol comparable a la del Real Madrid.'

**Mathematicians Prove MacKay Hypothesis After 50 Years**
Mathematicians Britta Schapira and Mark Cabanes have finally proved the MacKay hypothesis, a problem that has been unsolved for 50 years. The hypothesis, proposed by John McKay in 1972, states that the number of representations of a group can be determined by studying a small part of the group, called a normalizer of the Sylow subgroup. McKay noticed a surprising pattern in the number of representations of a group of order 72, which can be broken down into smaller parts, called subgroups, of order 8 and 9. He conjectured that the number of representations of the group is the same as the number of representations of one of its normalizers. The problem was later studied by many mathematicians, including Martin Isaacs, who showed that the hypothesis is true for a large class of groups. However, the problem remained unsolved for many years, until Schapira and Cabanes found a new approach to the problem, using the classification of all finite simple groups, which was completed in 2004. They showed that the hypothesis is true for all finite groups, and their proof was published in 2023. The proof is a result of a long and difficult journey, which involved the work of many mathematicians over several decades. Schapira and Cabanes' achievement is a testament to the power of mathematics and the importance of perseverance and collaboration in solving complex problems.

To imagine what the French Riviera will look like in 2100, we asked the new French Artificial Intelligence, Le Chat - Mistral, to generate images of our cities. The results are both fascinating and unsettling. According to the AI, Nice in 2100 will be a futuristic city with neon-colored skyscrapers, primarily in pink and blue. The Allianz Riviera stadium will undergo a complete renovation, becoming a state-of-the-art facility. Toulon will have a coastal landscape with buildings shaped like sails or hulls, reminiscent of the maritime world. Antibes will be a futuristic coastal city with a high-speed train crossing a bridge over the water. The buildings will be modern, with entirely glass facades. Menton will have a tramway and futuristic buildings, while Monaco's Larvotto beach will be crowded with people and have futuristic infrastructure. Cannes will be dominated by futuristic skyscrapers with wind turbines on their rooftops. The city will be greener, and the water will be clearer, thanks to advanced cleaning technologies. La Seyne-sur-Mer and Fréjus will have modern constructions with wind turbines. Hyères will be a city of large green spaces, while Cagnes-sur-Mer will have houses with wind turbines on their rooftops, surrounded by nature and pedestrian-friendly streets.

**Snow in the Cévennes: Why the Current Episode Doesn't Prove Climate Skeptics Right**
The recent snow episode in the Cévennes region has sparked a wave of climate skeptic comments on social media. However, according to climatologist Christophe Cassou, this event does not contradict the evidence of climate change. Cassou explains that the distinction between weather and climate is crucial: 'If the climate were the scenario of a film, the weather would be a sequence.' A film remains a thriller even if a romantic scene is inserted. 'When we focus solely on the sequence, i.e., the weather, we cannot understand the scenario. These are fallacious arguments used to deny the evidence of climate change,' he says. Cassou also notes that 'there are scientific facts that say that climate change is entirely due to human activities.' The snow episodes, even in a world affected by climate change, can be explained by the variability of seasons. 'The presence of this internal variability that makes us have winters that are milder than others, summers that are more humid than others, and all that, it superimposes on large trends.' 'We see that the probability of having a snow episode decreases over time as climate change becomes more pronounced. However, it is not zero,' Cassou explains. He recommends using the terms 'change' or 'derangement' instead of 'warming' to avoid misleading people. 'Even in 2100, the probability that it will snow will not be zero. There will always be snow episodes, but they will be less frequent and more intense.'
