**Mark Cuban says left-leaning Bluesky's 'lack of diversity of thought'...**
Mark Cuban, a tech billionaire and longtime supporter of Bluesky, has expressed concerns about the platform's 'lack of diversity of thought' and 'hostile echo chamber' where dissenting opinions are met with outrage. Cuban, who has posted nearly 2,000 times on the platform, warned that the predominantly left-leaning user base is pushing users back to Elon Musk's X, the social network formerly known as Twitter. He agreed with a Washington Post opinion piece that argued the platform's left-leaning user base fosters a political silo. Cuban's concerns were met with hostility from some users, who called him a 'despicable bastard' and told him to 'leave then, p---y.' Despite the platform's explosive growth, Cuban worries that it is discouraging debate and becoming a digital echo chamber.

**The State of Social Media: Instagram and Facebook Still on Top Despite Rise of TikTok**
Meta's Facebook and Instagram remain the dominant social media platforms, with 2.11 billion and 1.5 billion monthly active users respectively. TikTok, despite its popularity, has only half the user base of Facebook, with 1.16 billion active users. According to Sensor Tower, Meta's Q1 2025 earnings reported a 35% increase in sales, driven by the combined dominance of Facebook and Instagram in the online ad market. Natalie Park, a lifestyle influencer, credits TikTok's algorithm for its ability to keep users hooked, saying 'They're just really good at adjusting and figuring out how to keep people hooked.' Meanwhile, newer platforms like Lemon8 and Bluesky are gaining traction, with Lemon8 growing from 8.6 million MAUs in Q4 2024 to 11 million as of May 2025.

**France Considers Blocking X, Reddit, Bluesky, and Mastodon Over Pornographic Content**
The French government is considering reclassifying social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, Bluesky, and Mastodon as pornographic platforms due to their alleged tolerance and facilitation of explicit content. According to a law already in effect since June 8, the government plans to require these platforms to robustly verify the age of their users, going beyond simply checking a box. As Clara Chappaz, the minister delegate to the Digital Ministry, said, 'the simple fact of checking a box will no longer be enough.' The move is aimed at reducing the porosity between public and explicit content on these platforms.

**Mark Cuban says liberal alternative to X has become 'hateful' due to leftist groupthink**
Billionaire Mark Cuban has expressed his disappointment with the social media platform Bluesky, a liberal alternative to X, stating that it has become 'hateful' due to the anger and groupthink displayed by its users. Cuban, who initially joined the platform in November 2024, has seen a decline in engagement and an increase in negativity, with users resorting to name-calling and personal attacks. He shared a Washington Post column that argued the platform has become an echo chamber, where only progressive views are tolerated and dissenting opinions are met with intense negative engagement. Cuban commented, 'The lack of diversity of thought here is really hurting usage.'

**Bluesky is making progress, but X remains dominant among news influencers**
Bluesky is gaining traction among news influencers, especially progressive ones, but X remains dominant in terms of usage and audience. According to a Pew Research Center study, 43% of news influencers had created a Bluesky account between February and March 2025, up from 21% before the 2024 US presidential election. However, 82% of influencers were still active on X at the start of 2025, and only 6% use Bluesky exclusively. The study suggests that news influencers are looking to diversify their presence on new platforms without giving up on older ones. Bluesky appeals for its decentralized moderation and 'healthier' platform image, but X retains the audience, habits, and weight of public debate. 'Among right-leaning influencers, 97% of those with an X account posted there at least four days per week during the study period,' Pew Research Center concludes. 'But too few of them have Bluesky accounts to reliably report on their posting frequency there.'

**Bluesky use doubled after Trump election but is still dwarfed by X, report says**
A new report from Pew Research Center shows that while news influencers on Bluesky doubled after President Donald Trump's 2024 election, they still outnumber those on Bluesky. According to the report, 'The share of news influencers in our sample with a Bluesky account roughly doubled in the four months after Election Day 2024, from 21 [percent] beforehand to 43 [percent] by March 2025.' However, despite this growth, most news influencers still have an account on X, with 82 percent still active on the platform. The report also found that news influencers on X are much more active than those on Bluesky, with 83 percent posting four or more days each week, compared to 21 percent on Bluesky. Additionally, the report found that news influencers who flocked to Bluesky are 'largely people on the political left.'

**Study Shows That Left-Leaning Influencers Remain Active on X, Despite Supporting Bluesky**
A recent study by Pew Research Center found that left-leaning influencers are still active on X, despite supporting Bluesky as an alternative. According to the study, about half (54%) of news influencers on Bluesky posted there in the first full week of January, but this share grew to 66% in the last full week of March. Meanwhile, X remained popular but saw a small decline in activity: 92% of news influencers on X posted there in the first full week of January, compared with 87% in the last full week of March. The data suggests that while Bluesky has gained momentum, it's not close to surpassing X as the leading news platform, with most left-leaning influencers who are posting on Bluesky still maintaining their activity on Elon's app. Bluesky has also been surpassed by Meta's Threads, which is now up to 350 million actives.

**Humorless scolds dominate liberal-favored Bluesky - Washington Examiner**
Bluesky, a microblogging platform similar to X, has seen significant growth in monthly users, from around 1 million at launch to 27 million as of March 2025. This growth is attributed to progressive users who oppose the current administration and are fleeing X, which they see as having shifted to the right under Elon Musk's ownership. Experts, including Andrew Selepak and Nick Mattar, believe that Musk's changes to X have driven users to Bluesky, which is seen as a more user-friendly and free platform. However, Bluesky lacks the wit and humor of Twitter in its heyday and is now dominated by humorless scolds, with users such as academics, journalists, and Democratic Party operatives. Germany Kent predicts that Bluesky will overtake X if Musk's politics continue to generate resistance.

**Barack Obama Joins Bluesky, Rival Social Media Platform to X**
Bluesky, a social media platform rival to X, has gained a high-profile user that could boost its popularity. Former US President Barack Obama has joined the platform, posting a message celebrating the 15th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, a key achievement of his presidency. With over 33 million users, Obama's presence on Bluesky could attract other notable figures and drive user growth. Obama maintains a large following on other social media platforms, including X and Facebook, with over 130 million and 55 million followers, respectively. According to Obama, 'the Affordable Care Act is a reminder that change is possible when we fight for progress.' Bluesky has gained traction since Elon Musk acquired Twitter in 2022 and rebranded it as X, with many users seeking alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon. Other US politicians, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Al Green, Gavin Newsom, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are already active on Bluesky, with Ocasio-Cortez becoming the first person to reach one million followers.

**Barack Obama Joins Bluesky, a Growing Microblogging Platform**
Former US President Barack Obama has joined Bluesky, a microblogging platform competing with X (formerly Twitter). Obama, who has over 130 million followers on X, has confirmed his presence on Bluesky, stating, 'It was a great day.' According to TechCrunch, 'It's not surprising that many American users no longer want to participate in X, as Bluesky has over 33 million users and is still growing.' Obama's first posts on Bluesky celebrated the 15th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, describing it as 'a reminder that change is possible when we fight for progress.' Obama's massive following on X is second only to Elon Musk's, and he also has a significant presence on Facebook with 55 million followers.

**Bluesky Gains Momentum as Alternative to X, with Barack Obama on Board**
Bluesky is becoming the primary alternative to X, with numbers showing its growth - 25.9 million users at the end of December 2024, now 33 million. Public figures are also increasingly opening new accounts on the social platform, launched in 2023 and made available to everyone in February last year. The latest high-profile acquisition is Barack Obama, who has opened a new account on Bluesky, a move with strong political connotations, and a stance against X, its owner, and those who use it to spread conservative American thought. Obama's X account, with 130.6 million followers, remains active, but he has simply opened a new one on Bluesky. It remains to be seen if this move will lead to his definitive departure from X.

**Engagement Trends Show Threads Growing, X's Virality Strength, and Bluesky's Slowdown**
BufferApp analyzed 1.7 million posts from X, Threads, and Bluesky, finding that they have a common median engagement rate of four interactions per post. However, the platforms have different patterns, dynamics, audience behavior, and consistency. The study highlights that posts on Threads have higher engagement, but some data shows that posts on X have as many engagements as posts on Threads. In 2024, the platforms had the same number of engagements, but in February 2025, Threads received a median 5 engagements, X remained at 4 engagements, while Bluesky reduced to 3. The gap between median and average engagement shows if a post has gone viral, with X getting 328 average engagements, Threads getting 58, and Bluesky getting 21. The standard deviation on X is over 5,000, making it highly unpredictable, while Threads and Bluesky have lower engagements but are consistent. As a result, X has the most viral potential, despite its median engagement rate of four. Threads has moderate engagement, but it is stabilizing quickly, with steadier audience growth. Bluesky has a small engagement spread and is more community-driven than viral reach.

**Bluesky Sees 22% User Surge After Initial Post-Election Spike**
Bluesky, a platform popular among left-leaning users, has seen a 22% surge in users to 2.83 million daily users in the first week of February, according to Sensor Tower data. This growth follows a post-2024 election spike, where some X users fled due to Elon Musk's support for Donald Trump. Celebrities such as Mark Hamill, Gabrielle Union, and Barbra Streisand have joined the platform, as well as media personalities like Jen Rubin and Joy Reid. However, X has also seen a 27% increase in users, offsetting the losses, with 25 million daily users in the U.S. a few weeks after the election. Advertisers like Disney and Apple have also resumed spending on the app.
