**UK Announces Nuclear Submarine and Ammunition Factory Plans in Response to 'Russian Threat'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive rearmament plan for the UK, including the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and six new ammunition factories. The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate £15 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional £6 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.

**'World has changed': Starmer plans UK army ready to fight in Europe to give message to Putin, Trump**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced plans to increase military spending to 3% of national income by 2034, with a focus on building new nuclear-powered attack submarines, preparing the army to fight a war in Europe, and becoming a 'battle-ready, armor-clad nation.' The move is intended to send a message to Moscow and Washington, and follows a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer. The review recommends increasing production of submarines and weapons, establishing a cyber command to counter Russia-linked attacks, and investing 15 billion pounds in Britain's nuclear arsenal. Starmer said the plans would create a 'defense dividend' of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs, but it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money. The UK's defense spending is currently on track to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027, but some leaders in Nato think 3.5% is needed to deter Russia from future attacks.

**Britain is getting a defence boost aimed at sending a message to Moscow, and to Trump**
The UK government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has announced a significant boost to military spending, aimed at sending a message to Moscow and Washington. The plans include building new nuclear-powered attack submarines, increasing conventional weapons stockpiles, and investing in Britain's nuclear arsenal. Defence Secretary John Healey said the changes would 'send a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. The government aims to reach a defence spending target of 2.5% of national income by 2027 and 3% by 2034, but it is unclear where the money will come from. The plans also include setting up a cyber command to counter threats from state-linked sources and increasing the number of soldiers by the early 2030s. As Starmer said, 'We have to recognize the world has changed, with greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.'

**UK Digital Banks: Starling Struggles, Monzo Rises, and Revolut Soars**
Three UK digital banks, Starling, Monzo, and Revolut, were once seen as revolutionizing the financial services industry with their cutting-edge technology, superior customer experience, and sleek mobile interfaces. However, their paths have diverged. Revolut and Monzo are experiencing record growth, while Starling is facing a financial and reputational crisis. Starling's annual results showed a significant drop in profitability, with a loss of £223 million in 2024, compared to £301 million in the previous year. The company has been hit with a £29 million fine from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for serious deficiencies in its anti-money laundering controls. Revolut, on the other hand, has surpassed 50 million customers worldwide and recorded over £1 billion in profits this year, a remarkable achievement for a company that has struggled with regulatory delays and governance issues. Monzo's customer base has grown by 31% to 9.7 million in 2024, and deposits have increased by 88% to £11.2 billion. Revolut is planning an initial public offering (IPO) of £6 billion on the London Stock Exchange, one of the most anticipated IPOs of the year in the UK.

**Starmer Promises 'New Wave of Investments' in Defense to Strengthen UK's Combat Forces**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has promised a new 'wave of investments' in defense to 'strengthen' its combat forces and 'renovate' the nation, as part of the new defense plan of the Government, which will be made public on Monday and contemplates the creation of at least six new ammunition factories in the United Kingdom. 'We will put an end to the shameful depletion of our Armed Forces. We will invest in a more integrated, more prepared and more lethal combat force than ever, to return Great Britain to its rightful place: Leader in defense and leader in NATO,' Starmer has guaranteed in a written statement published on Sunday by 'The Sun'. The new approach, he emphasized, responds to the need to have a 'constant' capacity for producing ammunition. This change, he defended, goes beyond 'superficial adjustments'. 'We are being directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, so we must be ready to fight and win. After all, the best way to prevent a conflict is to prepare for it,' he insisted, praising the 'British genius for innovation'. The announcement comes after Defense Secretary John Healey said on Friday that 'Britain will spend 3% of its GDP on defense in 2034, without a doubt', which will allow the British government to 'plan in the long term' and 'face pressures'. Currently, the UK allocates 2.3% of its GDP to defense, a percentage that the United States has described as 'irritating', especially compared to its goal of having NATO countries invest 5% of their GDP in defense spending.

**Russia to Test 'Starlink' Alternative in Arctic Region in 2026**
The Russian company 'Бюро 1440' plans to start testing its Starlink-like satellite internet service in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug (NAO) in 2026. The project aims to provide internet access to remote areas where traditional connectivity is not available. The company has already launched six satellites, with plans to have 292 satellites in orbit by 2030 and a total of 383, including reserves. The project is funded mainly by the company, with a budget of 329 billion rubles, plus 116 billion rubles from the government, with 37 billion rubles allocated for 2025. The goal is to provide high-speed internet to 97% of Russian households by 2030. The testing in NAO will help to fine-tune the equipment in harsh Northern conditions and understand how people will use the service. The low-orbit satellites will provide good internet speeds even in small villages where laying fiber optics is too expensive, as explained by Anton Lebedev, deputy governor of NAO, at the TransNet conference on March 13.

**Russian analogue of Starlink to be tested in harsh Arctic conditions**
The Russian aerospace company 'Bureau 1440' plans to launch a pilot project in 2026 in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug (NAO) to provide connectivity using low-orbit satellites, a Russian analogue of Starlink. According to Anton Lebedev, head of the department of digital development, communication, and mass media of NAO, the connection through low-orbit satellites will be significantly cheaper than using satellites on a geostationary orbit. The project will also be tested in several other regions of the country. 'We are working with several regions and representatives of regional authorities to provide connectivity where the ground network is not available,' said a representative of 'Bureau 1440'. The company plans to launch a satellite group in 2025-2027 and a commercial satellite communication service in 2027. By the end of 2030, the group will consist of 292 satellites, and a total of 383 satellites will be launched, including 91 satellites for replacement of those that have failed. The goal of the project is to provide high-speed broadband internet access to 97% of households by 2030. According to Andrei Ionin, advisor to the general director of GC 'Geoscan', the cosmic internet is in demand in the Arctic region because laying ground networks there is economically unfeasible. Currently, internet access is available in cities, but it is absent in remote industrial facilities and settlements. Ionin believes that the pilot project in NAO will allow to work out the work of ground equipment in harsh northern conditions and to test consumer scenarios of use. The cost of communication services through low-orbit satellites will be significantly lower, and the quality will be higher compared to traditional satellite communication on a geostationary orbit, confirmed Sergei Pechterev, an investor in the company 'KA-Internet' (operator of satellite communication). He noted that the success of the 'Bureau 1440' project will also depend on the cost of subscriber terminals, as well as their design and production features.

**Russian analogue of Starlink to be launched by 2030, says Roscosmos head**
The head of Roscosmos, Yuri Borisov, stated that Russians will be able to connect to the Russian analogue of Starlink by 2030, possibly even earlier, in 2028-2029. Borisov emphasized that there is no need to rush and set records, but rather to focus on quality and providing a minimum necessary volume of services in the interests of the economy, defense, and security. He noted that the project, similar to Starlink, is being implemented by the aerospace company 'Bureau 1440' (part of 'IKS Holding'), which will provide services for broadband internet access. Borisov also mentioned the development of the 'Skiy' space group on medium orbits, which will complement the low-orbit system. He expressed hope that more private companies will join the market and develop their plans. When asked if there are already such companies today, Borisov replied positively, saying that they need to be 'nurtured and cared for'.

**Russia Enters the Satellite Internet Race with 'Bureau 1440' Project**
Russia plans to create its own low-orbit satellite group to provide high-speed internet access. This ambitious task is part of the national project 'Economy of Data' and could lead to significant changes in the telecommunications market. The global race for satellite internet has been ongoing, with SpaceX leading the way with its Starlink project, which has over 4,750 operational satellites and serves over 2 million customers in 60 countries. However, Russia does not want to be left behind and has announced its own project, 'Sfera', which aims to launch a satellite group to provide connectivity across the country. The company 'IKS Holding' has already launched the first three low-orbit satellites as part of the 'Bureau 1440' project, with plans to launch 700 satellites by 2035. According to Mikhail Mishustin, the Prime Minister of Russia, the goal is to create a group that will meet the needs of fast internet not only in Russia but also in friendly countries. The project has already undergone several test launches, including a successful test of a laser communication system with a data transfer speed of up to 10 Gbps over a distance of 1,000 km. Experts note that creating a Russian analogue of Starlink is a complex and ambitious task that will require significant financial and technological resources. 'We have never had a low-orbit satellite group, which should appear by 2028... To solve this problem, which has not been solved for decades, using a low-orbit satellite group is possible,' said Denis Kuskov, general director of the analytical agency TelecomDaily. The project 'Bureau 1440' will compete with the 'Sfera' project from Roscosmos, which also aims to create a satellite group for internet access. According to Mikhail Mishustin, the goal is to increase the number of satellites in orbit by several times, which will significantly improve the quality of services for the state, citizens, and business. 'To implement the tasks set by the President, it is necessary to increase the composition of the orbital group of spacecraft by several times, which will allow significantly improving the quality of services for the state, citizens, and business,' said Mikhail Mishustin. The head of Roscosmos, Yuri Borisov, announced that the production of satellites in Russia will start in 2026, which will require 60 billion rubles. It remains to be seen whether this ambitious task will be implemented.
