**EU Employment Rate Reaches Record High in 2024**
According to Eurostat, the employment rate in the EU has reached a record high of 75.8% in 2024, with 197.6 million people employed. This represents a 0.5 percentage point increase from 2023 and a 1.2 percentage point increase from 2022. The highest employment rates were recorded in the Netherlands (83.5%), Malta (83.0%), and the Czech Republic (82.3%), while the lowest rates were recorded in Italy (67.1%), Greece (69.3%), and Romania (69.5%). The report also highlights the issue of overqualification, where people with high education levels are employed in sectors that require lower levels of education. The EU's overqualification rate was 21.3% in 2024, with the highest rates recorded in Spain (35.0%), Greece (33.0%), and Cyprus (28.2%). 'In 21 of the 27 EU countries, women had higher rates of overqualification than men, with the largest differences recorded in Italy (7.7 percentage points), Slovakia (6.4 percentage points), and Malta (5.3 percentage points),' the report states.

**ILO revises downward job creation estimates in 2025**
The International Labor Organization (ILO) has revised its estimates of job creation in 2025 downward, reflecting a decrease in global economic prospects. The ILO estimates that nearly 84 million jobs in 71 countries are directly or indirectly linked to American consumer demand, with the Asia-Pacific region accounting for the majority (56 million). However, Canada and Mexico have the highest proportion of exposed jobs (17.1%). ILO Director-General Gilbert Houngbo stated, 'We know that the global economy is growing at a slower pace than expected. Our report now tells us that if geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions continue, and if we do not address the fundamental issues reshaping the world of work, they will certainly have negative repercussions on labor markets worldwide.' The report highlights concerning trends in income distribution, with the share of labor income decreasing globally from 53.0% in 2014 to 52.4% in 2024. Africa and the Americas have experienced the largest declines. If this share had remained unchanged, global labor income would have been $1,000 billion higher in 2024, equivalent to $290 more per worker in terms of constant purchasing power. The erosion of the global share of labor income is putting pressure on inequalities and highlighting a disconnect between economic growth and worker remuneration. The report notes a shift towards high-skilled jobs, with women leading this trend. Between 2013 and 2023, the proportion of women in high-skilled jobs increased from 21.2% to 23.2%, while the proportion of men in high-skilled jobs was around 18% in 2023. As education levels continue to rise globally, the labor market remains characterized by significant mismatches between education levels. In 2022, only 47.7% of workers had qualifications matching their job requirements. The proportion of under-educated workers decreased from 37.9% to 33.4% over the past decade, while the proportion of over-educated workers increased from 15.5% to 18.9%. The report also addresses the effects of new technologies on the world of work, finding that nearly one in four workers could see their job transformed by generative AI. A greater proportion of jobs in moderately skilled professions are moderately exposed, but a greater percentage of jobs in highly skilled professions are highly exposed, with existing tasks potentially being automated by AI.

**80% of People with Obesity are Women, Says Nutritionist**
According to Daisy Rivas, a nutritionist at the Teófilo Dávila hospital, there is a high percentage of obesity in the country, with at least 10-13 out of 15 patients she sees per week suffering from obesity, and the majority of them are women. Rivas emphasizes that this problem affects people of all ages, from children to adults and the elderly, with around 80-90% of patients presenting with obesity. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 1 billion people (1 in 8) worldwide suffer from obesity, a figure that was expected to reach 2030 but has already become a reality in 2024. Rivas highlights the importance of education in preventing obesity, suggesting that parents, especially mothers, learn and teach their children how to eat a balanced diet. She also warns against the dangers of processed and ultra-processed foods, as well as fast food, which can lead to weight gain and other health problems. Rivas recommends consulting a nutritionist for a personalized treatment plan, rather than following 'miracle diets' that can cause imbalances and harm. The Ministry of Public Health (MSP) promotes strategic lines of action through public policies and intersectoral interventions to address obesity as a national problem.

**Climate Change and Women: Impacts and Prospective Views**
The effects of climate change on women are becoming increasingly severe, with women being more vulnerable to its impacts. According to the IPCC, the economic costs of climate change in developing countries will range from $290 billion to $580 billion annually by 2030. Additionally, 189 million people, mostly women and children, are affected annually by extreme weather events in developing countries since 1991. The IPCC has released a report outlining possible future scenarios under continued climate change, including a scenario where global carbon dioxide emissions are reduced to zero by 2050, aligning with the Paris Agreement's goals. However, an opposing scenario assumes a doubling of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, leading to a 4.4°C temperature increase by 2100, which will undoubtedly affect women's health worldwide. The article emphasizes the need for international cooperation and education to mitigate the effects of climate change on women and promote sustainable development.

**French Women's Health: A Major Gap in Medical Care**
A new survey by the Agir pour le Cœur des Femmes association reveals that one in four French women consider their health to be bad or very bad. The survey, which questioned 2054 women, found that over a third of them have experienced a lack of listening or minimization of their symptoms during medical consultations. This proportion reaches 60% among women under 25. The survey highlights a major gap in the medical care of women, particularly in the field of cardio-gynécologie. Despite cardiovascular diseases being the leading cause of mortality among women, half of them have never discussed the topic with a healthcare professional. Thierry Drilhon, co-founder of the association, emphasizes that 'prevention and taking care of one's health is not just about consulting a doctor when you're sick, it's an investment. We must all take responsibility to abandon the curative model and turn towards prevention.' The survey also found that 74% of women resort to self-medication before consulting a doctor, and that 30% of them have cancelled or postponed a medical appointment for family reasons or because they no longer thought it necessary. The association is calling for a general mobilization to address these issues, including training healthcare professionals in cardio-gynécologie, developing targeted information campaigns, and involving companies in the health of their employees.

**AK Parti's Efforts to Empower Women: A New Era of Social Policies**
AK Parti Genel Merkez Kadın Kolları Başkanı Tuğba Işık Ercan said, 'Women's production, earning, and standing on their own feet is not only economic empowerment, but also a guarantee of social justice, family unity, and the country's development.' Ercan emphasized that women's participation in production, entrepreneurship, and employment has increased, and that they are contributing to the country's hope with their initiatives. Ercan stated that they have implemented numerous policies and programs to increase women's participation in production, entrepreneurship, and employment, and that these efforts have led to significant improvements in women's economic empowerment. According to Ercan, the percentage of women in the workforce has increased from 28% in 2002 to 37% today, and the percentage of women in employment has increased from 25% to 33%. Ercan also noted that the number of women working outside the formal sector has decreased from 73% to 33%, and that the number of female entrepreneurs has increased from 13% to 18%. Ercan said, 'Today, thanks to your efforts, this rate will increase even more. The percentage of women in public employment has reached 49%, and the percentage of university-educated women in the workforce has exceeded 68%.' Ercan also announced that they aim to increase the percentage of women in the workforce to 40% and the employment rate to at least 36.2% by 2028. Ercan emphasized that they are working closely with women to strengthen the state support provided to women and to increase their participation in the workforce. Ercan also mentioned the 'İş'te Kadın Kardeşim Projesi' (Women's Sister Project in the Workplace) and stated that they are implementing new policies to support women's participation in the workforce, such as flexible working models and childcare support. Ercan said, 'We have announced 2025 as the 'Aile Yılı' (Family Year) and are developing policies to protect family structures and empower women's roles in society. We are also implementing new applications to facilitate women's participation in the workforce, from parental leave to flexible working models and childcare support. The goal of these supports is to enable women to both care for their families and pursue their careers.'

**Turkey's Young Population: Challenges and Opportunities**
According to the '2024 İstatistiklerle Gençlik' report by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the proportion of young people in Turkey is 15% of the total population, which is higher than the European Union average of 10.7%. However, long-term projections show a significant decline in the proportion of young people. The number of young people aged 15-24 in Turkey is expected to decrease from 12.8 million in 2024 to 9.1 million in 2050. The proportion of young people in the total population is also decreasing, from 16.6% in 2013 to 9.7% in 2050. This trend indicates that Turkey is losing its demographic advantage and highlights the need to restructure education, employment, and social policies to adapt to this demographic change. Education is the main reason for migration among young people, with 35.8% of those who migrated doing so to access better, more diverse, or more accessible education opportunities. The second most common reason for migration is the desire to find a job and start working, with 14.5% of migrants citing this as their reason. The unemployment rate among young people is 16.3%, with a higher rate among women at 22.3%. This highlights the challenges faced by young women in accessing employment. The majority of working young people (56.3%) are employed in the service sector, while 30.7% are employed in industry and 13% in agriculture. The birth rate among young women has been declining rapidly, with 10 births per 1,000 young women aged 15-19 in 2024, down from 49 in 2001. This decline reflects changes in societal awareness, women's education and career-oriented lifestyle choices, and access to birth control methods. The net enrollment rate in secondary education is 88% in 2023/24, with 81.2% of students completing secondary education and 42.7% completing higher education. The net enrollment rate in higher education is higher among women at 49.0% and lower among men at 36.7%. Education is becoming more accessible to women. The main sources of happiness for young people are health (45.3%) and success (25.1%), with family, friendship, and material means being less important. The digital habits of young people are also notable, with 98.5% using messaging apps, 95.7% using social media, and 95.3% using voice or video calls. However, more productive or public content, such as political participation (6.2%) and selling goods or services (13.9%), is less prominent in their digital lives. This highlights the use of digital platforms for social communication. The distribution of young people across the country also shows significant differences, with Hakkâri having the highest proportion of young people at 20.8% and Balıkesir having the lowest at 11.8%. This reflects the impact of internal migration, education, and employment on regional demographic structures. The marriage rate among young women is 3.5 times higher than among young men, with 11.7% of young women being married compared to 3.3% of young men. This highlights the impact of societal roles, expectations, and cultural norms on gender.

**COC Athlete to Graduate with Fire Technology Degree - SCVNews.com**
Samantha Miranda Rodriguez, a 21-year-old College of the Canyons student-athlete, is set to graduate with an associate of science degree in fire technology in June. Rodriguez, who is part of the 9% of female firefighters in the US, has faced discouragement and negativity throughout her journey, but has persevered and worked hard to achieve her lifelong dream. Her confidence was strengthened after taking Fire Technology 101 at COC, where her teacher, Keith Kawamoto, believed in her and made her feel capable of succeeding. Rodriguez's athletic background has also served as a source of discipline and confidence for her firefighting aspirations. She was recently hired as a wildland firefighter with the Santa Mountains National Park Service and will continue her education at California State University, Los Angeles, pursuing a bachelor's degree in fire protection administration and technology. Rodriguez advises other women considering careers in male-dominated fields to connect with people who are already doing the job and to not listen to negativity, but to work hard and believe in themselves. 'There are people who will help you,' said Rodriguez. 'Don't listen to the negativity. If you work hard and believe in yourself, anything is possible.'

**Study: Maghreb Immigrants Among Most Qualified in France**
A new study by the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) reveals that immigrants arriving in France are more educated than ever, with those from North Africa leading a remarkable leap in educational attainment. The study shows that 52% of immigrants aged 25 and over who entered France in 2023 held higher education degrees, compared to 41% in 2006. The Maghreb countries registered a 25-point jump in university-educated immigrants between 2006 and 2023, with half of all African immigrants arriving in France possessing higher education credentials. Africa has replaced Europe as the main continent of origin, now accounting for 45% of all immigrant entries to France in 2023. The study also notes that women still predominate, representing 51% of newcomers to France in 2023, and that employment prospects for immigrants tend to improve with their duration of stay in France. 'The study shows immigrants arriving in France are more educated than ever,' said the report. 'This is a remarkable leap in educational attainment, particularly for those from North Africa.'

**Young Women Outperform Young Men in German Education**
According to a new study by the German Federal Statistical Office, young women in Germany tend to perform better in school and university exams than young men. The study found that in the 2023 graduating class, 55% of students with a general higher education entrance qualification were women. In terms of university degrees, women are now the majority, making up 53% of the 501,900 relevant degrees awarded in 2023. However, men still lead in promotions, with 54% of promotions going to men. Notably, men are more likely to fail their studies, with 66% of failed exams being taken by male students. Additionally, men tend to be slightly older when completing their first degree, at an average age of 23.9 years, compared to 23.4 years for women. Furthermore, boys and young men are more likely to repeat a grade in school, with 56% of the 147,100 students who repeated a grade in the 2023/2024 school year being male.

**Women Closing the Gap in Higher Education Diplomas**
According to Statbel, 56.9% of women aged 25-34 had a higher education diploma in 2024, compared to 44.4% of men. The gap between the sexes continues to widen over the years, from 5.9 percentage points in 2000 to 12.5 points in 2024. Statbel notes, 'At the beginning of the 2000s, a little over a third of 25-34 year olds had a higher education diploma. Today, this figure is approaching one in two, and the United Nations' goal of 45% by 2030 has already been met since 2017.'

**The Evolving Landscape of Higher Education in America**
The landscape of higher education in America has undergone significant transformation over the past three decades, with a growing gender gap in college completion rates across every major racial and ethnic group. In 1995, 25% of both men and women aged 25-34 held a bachelor's degree, but today, 47% of women hold a degree compared to 37% of men, a 22 percentage point increase for women and a 12 point increase for men. This shift is particularly notable among white, Black, and Hispanic women, who are now more likely than their male counterparts to hold bachelor's degrees. The Asian American community presents a unique pattern, with both men and women showing significant increases in degree completion rates. Research suggests that financial barriers, different attitudes towards higher education, and varying types of obstacles faced by men and women contribute to the gender gap. The transformation raises important questions about the future of higher education in America and the need to develop educational policies and practices that ensure equitable access to and completion of higher education for all Americans.

**This One Demographic Will Receive 'Most' of the $124 Trillion Great Wealth Transfer: 'More Money Than Ever Before'**
According to a report from the Bank of America Institute, women are expected to receive the majority of the $124 trillion great wealth transfer by 2048, with close to $100 trillion going to women. The study estimates that $47 trillion will shift to women in younger generations as inherited wealth and $54 trillion will go to surviving spouses, 95% of whom are expected to be women. This transfer is expected to have a profound impact on how women use their money, with increased demand and spending on services, products, and experiences tailored toward women. Bank of America research also found that women have more wealth, independence, and opportunity than previous generations, with 1.4 billion women between 50 and 70 years old expected to grow to 2.1 billion by 2050. As a result, the bank predicts that women will soon control more money than ever before, with women representing 85% of solo travelers and driving demand for women-only travel options.

**Gender and Age: We need a female perspective on ageing populations**
The world is experiencing a significant demographic shift with a growing proportion of older people. By 2050, 82 million people aged 65 and older will live in the US, and 80% of older adults will live in low- and middle-income countries. This poses challenges to healthcare systems and economies, with every 1% increase in healthcare burden resulting in a 0.083% decrease in GDP growth rate. Social isolation affects one in four people worldwide, with over 2 million people in England over 75 living alone. Women are more likely to experience loneliness, especially with disability, and face greater disadvantages of 'multiple forms of inequality' throughout their lifespan. As the UN's decade for 'healthy ageing' (2021-30) is underway, nations must include 'social' perspectives in policies and programmes to fight social isolation and loneliness, focusing on the special needs of women. 'They encounter tremendous hardship in their twilight years as they fight against the twin challenges of patriarchy and vulnerability,' noted an exploratory research study among older women residents of a care home in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.

**Survey: Will Women Have Achieved Equality by 2050?**
A recent survey by Elle magazine reveals that 67% of respondents believe that women will hold the top position in the country by 2050. Currently, only 19% of mayors in France are women. The survey also shows that 74% of French people think that education will be less influenced by gender stereotypes in 25 years. However, 83% of those who believe that certain jobs are still gendered think that they will remain so in 2050. The survey also found that 67% of respondents believe that the salary gap between men and women will disappear by 2050, and 77% think that promotions and bonuses will be distributed fairly. Additionally, 83% of respondents believe that there will be a more equal sharing of household chores by 2050, and 80% think that the length of paternity leave and the number of childcare places will continue to improve. However, 27% of respondents still believe that 'it's up to women to take care of the children and the home.' Despite this, the survey shows that attitudes are changing, and 84% of respondents want to see more women in the media and culture.

**The decline of the college-educated American man**
The number of young men pursuing U.S. college degrees has fallen in recent years, with 1 million fewer American men ages 18-24 enrolled in college in 2022 compared to 2011. According to Osirus Polachart, a college counselor, many young men are prioritizing vocational schools over college because they can get blue-collar jobs that pay well. A 2021 Brookings Institution report noted that women complete four-year degrees in greater numbers and do so more quickly, exacerbating the gender gap. The result is lopsided, with over 1.1 million women earning a bachelor's degree in 2018-19 compared to fewer than 860,000 men. Analysts and educators are struggling to understand what young men want when it comes to higher education, with many citing financial concerns and a desire for immediate job prospects as reasons for not choosing college.

**First-Degree Graduate Rate in Germany: Women Outperform Men**
According to the German Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 297,200 people achieved their first university degree in Germany in 2023, representing 32% of the same-age population. The proportion of first-degree graduates among women was 36%, significantly higher than among men at 28%. The majority of first-degree graduates were young people between 21 and 29 years old, and most of the degrees obtained were Bachelor's degrees (86%). The decrease in the absolute number of first-degree graduates between 2022 and 2023 did not affect the first-degree graduate rate, as the population count was recalculated based on the 2022 census, which revealed a lower population count than previously assumed. This led to a higher first-degree graduate rate. If the rate for 2023 had been calculated based on the old population forecast from the 2011 census, it would have been 31%, slightly lower than in 2022. The first-degree graduate rate has increased 1.7 times since 20 years ago (2003: 18%). The increase occurred mainly until 2012, and since then, the rate has remained between 31% and 32% each year, except for 2020 and 2021. In 2020, the rate decreased to 30% due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in 2021, it increased to 33% due to catch-up effects. The highest first-degree graduate rate in 2023 was found in Berlin (51%), while the lowest was in Brandenburg (23%). However, it is worth noting that many first-degree graduates from Berlin universities belong to the population in Brandenburg. The city-states generally benefit from the influx of students from the surrounding areas, resulting in a higher first-degree graduate rate. In 2023, the rate was 41% in the city-states and 31% in the federal states.

**Erstabsolventenquote in Germany 2023: 32% of young people earn their first degree**
In 2023, 297,200 people in Germany earned their first university degree, resulting in an Erstabsolventenquote (first-degree graduate rate) of 32%. This rate was higher for women (36%) than for men (28%). The majority of first-degree graduates were young people between 21 and 29 years old, and most of the degrees earned were Bachelor's degrees (86%). The Erstabsolventenquote has been increasing over the years, with a 1.7-fold increase compared to 2003 (18%). Berlin had the highest Erstabsolventenquote among the federal states (51%), while Brandenburg had the lowest (23%). The city-states had a higher Erstabsolventenquote (41%) than the federal states (31%). According to the Statistisches Bundesamt (Federal Statistical Office), the Erstabsolventenquote is calculated by adding the percentage of first-degree graduates in each age group, resulting in a total percentage. The Erstabsolventenquote is a useful indicator for comparing time and regional differences in higher education.

**Study: Gender gap persists with top-paying college degrees | Bankrate**
Despite women outnumbering men in college and the workforce, a new Bankrate analysis finds that women make up only 26% of graduates with the 20 highest-paying bachelor's degrees. Experts say traditional gender influences and societal norms contribute to this disparity, with women often prioritizing flexibility and helping others over high-paying careers. The analysis also found that women are disproportionately concentrated in lower-paying fields, such as early childhood education and communication disorders sciences, and that even when women enter high-paying fields like STEM, they often earn less than their male colleagues. To close the pay gap, experts recommend that women negotiate for higher pay, build their confidence, and seek out job opportunities that align with their skills and interests.
