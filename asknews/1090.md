**Donald Trump Spreads Conspiracy Theory About Joe Biden's Alleged Assassination**
US President Donald Trump shared a conspiracy theory on his Truth Social page, claiming that former President Joe Biden was allegedly assassinated in 2020 and replaced with 'clones' or 'robotic beings'. Trump shared a post from a user named llijh, which stated, 'There is no Joe Biden - killed in 2020. Biden clones, doubles, and robotic soulless mindless beings - that's what you see. Democrats don't see a difference.' This theory comes after Biden was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, which has metastasized to his bones.

**Trump Spreads Baseless Conspiracy Theory About Biden's Assassination**
US President Donald Trump reposted a baseless claim on his social media platform Truth Social that his predecessor Joe Biden was assassinated in 2020 and replaced with clones or robots. The claim, made by a user with a history of spreading conspiracy theories, stated that Biden was replaced with 'clones, duplicates' and 'robotic, soulless, mindless entities.' Trump shared the post without comment or explanation, despite having millions of followers on the platform. The White House has not commented on why Trump shared the claim or whether he actually believes it. Trump has a history of spreading fake news and conspiracy theories, including claiming he won the 2020 presidential election, which was debunked and led to the January 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol. He has also promoted the conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the US and has made other unsubstantiated claims during his 2024 presidential campaign. 'It's a baseless and irresponsible claim that has no evidence to support it,' said a spokesperson for Biden, who recently received a diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer with metastases. 'To date, no diagnosis of prostate cancer has been made to President Biden.'

**Trump Shares Conspiracy Theory: Biden Assassinated, Replaced with Robot Clone**
Former US President Donald Trump shared a post on Saturday night claiming that President Joe Biden was assassinated in 2020 and replaced with a robot clone. The post, which read 'There is no longer a Joe Biden - he was executed in 2020,' was met with enthusiasm by some of his supporters, who pointed to supposed differences in Biden's appearance in the past and present as evidence. Some users claimed that Biden's ear structure had changed, while another user suggested that Biden had held a funeral ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery on his inauguration day. Trump's wife Melania Trump was also previously the target of similar conspiracy theories, with some claiming that she had been replaced by a body double. The White House has dismissed these claims as 'unimportant.' Trump's conspiracy theories continued over the weekend, with him sharing a video claiming that a 2015 interview with Stephen Colbert on The Late Show was edited out by CBS. However, a simple search revealed that the interview is still available on CBS's YouTube channel with over 17 million views.

**Colombian President Gustavo Petro Denounces Assassination Plots**
Colombian President Gustavo Petro has made new allegations of plots to assassinate him, including the discovery of anti-tank weapons near the Palacio de Gobierno in Bogotá. Petro warned on social media that members of the police had hidden the encounter with the mentioned armament, which he described as 'very grave'. He wrote, 'The investigation will be thorough, but this is not the only fact we have found in recent months. Several meetings have been held to coordinate attacks. The order has been given by the extreme right-wing mafia. My protection is from the people.' Petro also stated that other sophisticated weapons have entered the country with the same purpose and that the first information about a potential attack came from the US Embassy on July 20 last year. A rocket launcher was found in February near the Casa de Nariño, and Petro has previously accused a group called the Junta del Narcotráfico of seeking to kill him. According to Petro, this group controls a network of prosecutors and, through the Technical Investigation Body of the Colombian Prosecutor's Office, manages the port of Buenaventura. Petro attributed the murder of Paraguayan prosecutor Marcelo Pecci to this group and stated that they had covered up the intellectual authors of the crime. Petro concluded, 'They have tried to kill me without success.'

**Trump Shares Conspiracy Theory Claiming Biden Was Assassinated in 2020**
US President Donald Trump has shared a conspiracy theory on his social media platform Truth, claiming that Joe Biden was assassinated in 2020 and replaced by a lookalike. The theory, which originated from a satirical article on a conservative website, suggests that Biden was killed using a mechanical device called the Autopen and that those responsible should be arrested and charged with treason. This is not the first time Trump has attacked his predecessor, as he has previously questioned the validity of Biden's pardons and accused him of being opposed to opening the borders. Despite Biden's recent announcement of his prostate cancer diagnosis, Trump has continued to launch attacks against him, including a recent statement on Truth that Biden was 'not a good guy' and that his advisors were 'bad people'.

**Trump backs madcap theory Joe Biden was killed and replaced with clone in 2020**
President Donald Trump has endorsed a conspiracy theory that Joe Biden was killed and replaced by a 'clone' in 2020. The theory, shared on Trump's TruthSocial site, claims that Biden was executed and replaced by a robotic entity. Trump's endorsement of the theory has sparked a social media frenzy, with over 14,000 likes from his supporters. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and Biden was inaugurated as president in January 2021 alongside Kamala Harris. This is not the first time Trump has shared unhinged conspiracy theories, having previously suggested the father of rival Republican Ted Cruz was involved in the JFK assassination and promoted the 'birther' conspiracy that falsely claimed President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.

**Samora Machel Remembers Amílcar Cabral's Assassination as a 'Cowardly and Odious' Act**
Samora Machel, the first President of Mozambique, remembered the assassination of Amílcar Cabral as a 'cowardly and odious' act. In a speech delivered at Cabral's funeral in January 1973, Machel stated that the assassination was a 'true sense' of the destruction of the PAIGC, which would have isolated the Guinean revolution, freeing up troops and material to fight in Mozambique and Angola. Machel blamed the extinct PIDE (Polícia Internacional de Defesa do Estado) for the assassination. He also recognized Cabral as a pioneer of the movement for unity among the people of the former Portuguese colonies against colonialism, and as a leader of all the African liberation movements against the Portuguese colonial regime. Machel believed that Cabral's death should be transformed into an 'incentive' for the struggle of the liberation movements. He stated that 'the experience proves that, for revolutionary forces, tragedies, like the one today in PAIGC, (...) constitute radical vaccines against enemy and reactionary action.' Cabral was born on September 12, 1924, and died on January 20, 1973, at the hands of his own comrades, eight months before the unilateral proclamation of Guinea-Bissau's independence on September 24, 1973.

**25 Years After Jesús Mari Pedrosa's Assassination, the PP Remembers and Condemns ETA's Violence**
Jesús Mari Pedrosa, a 57-year-old PP councilor affiliated with the ELA union, was assassinated by ETA on June 4, 2000. He was shot in the head by an ETA gunman while walking alone, without an escort, despite being a target of ETA. Pedrosa, who was known for his nationalist connections and integrative character, believed that his relationships with the nationalist sectors would protect him. However, he was wrong. 'I don't think anything will happen to me,' he would say to those who expressed concern for his safety. Carlos Iturgaiz, former president of the PP in the Basque Country, recalls that Pedrosa's murder was one of many in a dark period of Basque history. 'We looked at each other and wondered in silence, who will be the next?' Iturgaiz says. This Wednesday marks 25 years since Pedrosa's assassination, and the PP will hold a mass and floral offering in his memory. The event will take place on June 3, as the PP parliamentarians will attend the plenary session in the Basque Parliament on June 4. 'The memory and remembrance are fundamental axes for Euskadi to move forward,' Iturgaiz says. He also criticizes EH Bildu for not condemning ETA's assassinations and threats against politicians, journalists, and judges. '25 years later, this has not ended,' Iturgaiz concludes.

**Judge delays Miami trial of 5 men accused of plotting assassination of Haiti’s president**
The Miami trial of five men accused of plotting the assassination of Haiti's president, Jovenel Moïse, has been delayed to March 2026 due to a massive volume of evidence, over 2.5 million text messages, emails, and other records, that federal prosecutors are still turning over to defense lawyers. U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Becerra expressed her dissatisfaction with the delay, stating, 'I do not take it lightly in any way that this case has been delayed.' The defendants, who were arrested and taken into federal custody in the months after the July 7, 2021, assassination, will have to wait nearly five years for their trial to begin. The delay is compounded by the difficulties of traveling to Haiti to question ex-Colombian soldiers jailed on Haitian charges of assisting in the killing, with Judge Becerra granting the defense team's request to take video depositions of five of the Colombians. However, one potential Haitian witness, former Haitian Superior Court Judge Windelle Coq Thélot, who died in January, will not be able to be questioned. According to prosecutors, Thélot gained the support of the suspected plotters in South Florida as a replacement for Moïse in June 2021, and her 'apparent signature' appeared on a written request for assistance to arrest Haiti's president. One of the suspects, Haitian American maintenance worker James Solages, admitted to knowing the assassination plan by mid-June 2021, and five of the 11 defendants in the U.S. case have pleaded guilty to conspiring to kill Haiti's president, receiving life sentences.

**The Assassinations of US Presidents: A Look Back**
Four US presidents have been assassinated in the country's history. The first was Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president, who was shot by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. Lincoln died the next morning. The second was James A. Garfield, the 20th president, who was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at a train station in Washington D.C. Garfield died 79 days later. The third was William McKinley, the 25th president, who was shot by Leon Frank Czolgosz, an anarchist, on September 6, 1901, while attending a Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. McKinley died eight days later. The fourth was John F. Kennedy, the 35th president, who was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, a former Marine and Marxist, on November 22, 1963, while riding in an open-top car in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy died that day. The assassinations of these presidents had significant impacts on American politics, society, and culture. They led to changes in the way the government protects its leaders and the way the country views itself and its place in the world.
