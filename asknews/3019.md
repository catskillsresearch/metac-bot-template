**Russia becomes one of global leaders in number of franchises  --  analysts**
Russia has become one of the global leaders in terms of the number of franchises per capita, surpassing the US, Germany, and China, according to Alexey Shashkin, Director of the Small and Micro Business division at Sber. Shashkin stated, 'Russia is one of the leaders in terms of the number of franchises per capita: we are ahead of the US, Germany, and China, but this does not mean the market is oversaturated.' The business segment holds enormous potential, particularly in the regions and for franchises requiring investments of $37,896 - $75,792. Successful networks have shown that competent franchisee support and digitalization can yield double-digit growth. In 2024, the market turnover increased by 17% to reach 3.72 trillion rubles ($47 bln), and the number of franchises grew by 12%. The fastest-growing franchise segments in the Russian market over the past four years have been food service and services, with their shares rising from 22% and 48% in 2020 to 29% and 52%, respectively, last year.

**Russia Becomes a Leader in the Number of Franchises per Capita**
Russia has become one of the world leaders in the number of franchises per capita, according to data from Sber's 'Small and Microbusiness' division, citing an analysis conducted jointly with consulting company Strategy Partners. 'Russia is one of the leaders in the number of franchises per capita: we outperform the US, Germany, and China, but this does not mean that the market is oversaturated,' said Alexey Shashkin, director of Sber's 'Small and Microbusiness' division. He noted that the potential for growth in this segment is huge, particularly in regions and for franchises with investments of 3-6 million rubles. 'Successful networks show that proper support for franchisees and digitization can give a double-digit growth,' Shashkin said. According to experts, franchising in the retail sector remains one of the most dynamic segments of the economy, despite the transformation of the consumer market. 'According to the analysis, in 2024, the market turnover grew by 17% and reached 3.72 trillion rubles, and the number of franchises grew by 12%,' Shashkin said. Experts note that the fastest growth in the Russian market of franchises over the past four years has been in the food service and services sectors - their share has grown from 22% and 48% in 2020 to 29% and 52% respectively last year. 'In the trade sector, the number of applications grew most in car parts stores (+189%), marketplaces (+124.1%), and online stores (+41.2%),' Shashkin continued. The most interesting thing, in his opinion, is that the largest number of franchises falls on the segments with investments of 1-3 million rubles and 3-6 million rubles. However, the key problem for franchisees in 2024 remains the growth of costs. '44% of franchisees increased the franchise fees, and 98% of entrepreneurs faced a shortage of personnel, rising prices, and difficulties with renting,' Shashkin noted. Nevertheless, franchising remains an important tool for business development in the regions: their share has increased from 71% to 74% over four years. Moscow accounts for 19% of franchises, and St. Petersburg accounts for 7%. As for the future of the franchising market, it remains with technology, Shashkin said. 'Artificial intelligence, CRM systems, and sales automation are becoming critically important for business survival, in addition, Russian franchises are actively entering international markets - Serbia, the UAE, and Armenia,' he explained. However, the director of the division still warned not to consider franchising as a story about quick money. 'This is about long-term work, discipline, and strict adherence to the business model: if the franchisee is not willing to share knowledge, and the franchisee does not want to learn - nothing will come of it, but if both act as partners, the result will exceed expectations,' Shashkin concluded.

**NYC homicides and shootings drop to record lows so far in 2025, officials say**
New York City has recorded its fewest homicides and shootings in decades, with 112 killings and 264 shootings through May, according to Mayor Eric Adams and NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The numbers represent a significant decrease from previous years, with a 30% drop in homicides and a 20% drop in shootings compared to the same timeframe in 2024. Adams attributed the improvement to the police's focus on removing guns from the streets and using data to improve officer deployments. Tisch credited aggressive enforcement against illegal firearms and a data-driven policing strategy for the reduction in shootings and homicides. Adams said, 'These numbers represent thousands of New Yorkers who are alive today and safer today, families who can sleep more soundly at night, and communities that are thriving because they know their city isn't just coming back from the throes of the pandemic -- it is back.' Tisch added, 'Results like this never happen by accident, and certainly not at a time when the state's criminal justice laws have made a revolving door out of our criminal justice system. We will not let up.'

**America's 21st Century fighter gap exposed * WorldNetDaily * by Peter Mitchell, Real Clear Wire**
The US Air Force has the smallest fighter fleet in its history, with only one-third of its fighters being 5th generation aircraft. This shortage puts the country at risk of not being able to protect its homeland and secure the skies abroad. The threat from cheap and hard-to-detect drones is now enduring, not episodic, and requires a robust fighter force to counter. The Air Force needs to produce 72 new fighters annually, but actual procurement is barely half of that. This production shortfall is a strategic vulnerability that adversaries are watching closely. A fundamental shift in how America approaches fighter procurement is required, with long-term contracts to enable manufacturers to invest in expanded production lines, automation, and workforce development. This would provide the stability needed to expand production capacity and secure American skies.

**Suicide rate levels off in 2024 • Minnesota Reformer**
Minnesota's suicide rate remained steady between 2023 and 2024, with an estimated 813 suicides and an age-adjusted rate of 13.9 per 100,000. However, the long-term trend shows a steady increase of roughly 50% since 2000. According to Minnesota Health Commissioner Brooke Cunningham, 'The overall increase in deaths by suicide over the last couple of decades continues to be concerning.' The demographic picture remains similar to prior years, with men three times more likely to commit suicide than women, and Indigenous Minnesotans having the highest suicide rates. The suicide rate in rural areas is about twice as high as in the Twin Cities, with lack of access to mental health services and easy access to guns contributing to the elevated numbers. Preliminary data also shows that the state's 988 responders answered more than 90,000 contacts in 2024, a significant increase from the previous year.

**Accidental shooting in Wisconsin calls for strict implementation of gun control laws**
A 19-year-old man, De'Shawn L. Sturkey, was killed in an accidental shooting in Wisconsin on April 16. The incident highlights the need for stricter gun control laws, as the U.S. has a serious gun problem. According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, there are approximately 27,000 unintentional firearm injuries and 500 unintentional firearm deaths per year in the U.S. The article argues that federal laws regulating child access and safe storage of firearms could help prevent such incidents and save lives. It also suggests imposing harsh penalties on individuals who do not properly store their firearms. The author emphasizes that owning a firearm is a constitutional right, but the laws surrounding firearms need to be improved to prevent mass shootings and make the country a safer place.

**New Colorado suicide data shows slight decrease, offering hope after years of rising numbers**
New data from Colorado shows a slight decrease in suicide fatalities, offering hope after years of rising numbers. According to the data, 1,290 people died by suicide in 2023, a decline from 1,370 in 2021. Betty Van Thournout, who lost her son to suicide nearly 11 years ago, says 'even one suicide is one too many.' She emphasizes the importance of asking hard questions and seeking help, saying 'don't be afraid to ask the hard questions.' Sources of Strength follow-up project outreach at gun retailers and free youth therapy options are available across Colorado to offer support and hope. The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline is also available 24/7 for those facing thoughts of self-harm or suicidal crisis.

**More than 17,000 Guns Reported Lost/Stolen from FFLs in 2024**
According to data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, over 17,200 firearms were reported lost or stolen from federally licensed firearms dealers in 2024. This highlights the issue of gun theft, which is often used by anti-gunners to argue for restrictive gun laws. However, data from Everytown for Gun Safety shows that more guns are stolen from private citizens than from retailers, with over 112,000 guns reported stolen in 2022. The majority of these thefts occurred from cars, with nearly 62,000 guns stolen in 2022. Gun theft is a problem that affects both retailers and private citizens, and it contradicts the argument that restrictive gun control laws will keep guns out of the hands of criminals. As Dave Workman notes, 'Gun thieves are known to crash their way into gun stores,' and it is essential for retailers to keep a sharp eye on their inventory to prevent such thefts.

**US-Mexico Firearms Trafficking: A Systematic Failure**
A study has estimated that around 135,000 firearms were trafficked from the United States to Mexico in 2022. This is a significant increase from previous estimates, which ranged from 200,000 to 600,000 firearms per year. The study, conducted by a professor of economic development and a investigative journalist, used data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and other sources to track the flow of illicit firearms from the US to Mexico. The researchers found that many of these firearms were purchased legally in the US and then sold to Mexican cartels, who use them to commit crimes and violence. The study also found that the ATF has struggled to regulate the sale of firearms in the US, with many dealers failing to conduct background checks and other required procedures. The researchers conclude that stricter regulations and better oversight are needed to prevent the flow of illicit firearms from the US to Mexico. 'If you want to take seriously the process of keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people, it shouldn't be facilitated by those who have a personal interest in selling them,' said Daniel Webster, a scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. 'Our analysis shows that stricter supervision can reduce the illegal resale of guns, supporting the conclusions of the authors.'

**Argentina's Firearm Owners: 919,347 with Credencial de Legítimo Usuario, but 65% Expired**
According to the ANMaC, there are 919,347 people in Argentina with a Credencial de Legítimo Usuario (CLU), the required credential to legally access a firearm. However, over 65% of these credentials are expired, with only 314,060 (34.2%) being valid. The majority of CLU holders are men between 31 and 60 years old, with a significant difference in numbers: for every woman with a valid CLU, there are over 20 men. The number of tenancies of firearms has been fluctuating in recent years, but with a recent increase. In 2022, 71,103 tenancies were granted, in 2023 the number decreased to 67,884, and in 2024, 76,861 tenancies were granted. The trend continued in 2025, with 11,565 tenancies approved in the first three months of the year. 'Tenencia Express', a new digital system, has been launched to streamline the process of obtaining a firearm. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students,' said no one, but the system aims to make the process easier and more efficient.

**U.S. Ammunition Market Set to Reach $9.05 Billion by 2028 - Explore Key Insights!**
The US ammunition market is expected to reach USD 9.05 billion in 2028, growing at a CAGR of 2.60% during the forecast period. The market is driven by the country's military strength, technological prowess, and robust civilian firearms industry. The defense segment accounted for the largest share in 2023, with the military subsegment being the largest market size and share. The small caliber segment also accounted for the largest share by caliber type in 2023. The growth of the small caliber segment can be attributed to its increased use by military and homeland security personnel due to its less lethality. The 9x19 mm ammunition market is poised to lead the industry due to its widespread use, versatility, and popularity across military, law enforcement, and civilian applications. Market growth can be attributed to increasing defense expenditures globally, new product launches, and service partnerships.

**This Pacific tourist destination is stockpiling guns like it's the US**
New Caledonia, a French territory in the Pacific, has seen a significant increase in gun ownership, with some estimates suggesting it has the highest rate of gun ownership per household in the Pacific, second only to the US. The increase in firearms is attributed to both hunting and concerns over civil unrest between Indigenous Kanak people and European descendants. A 2022 report from the High Commission of New Caledonia found that there were 64,000 registered privately-owned weapons and between 64,000 and 128,000 unregistered weapons, making an average rate of 48 per 100 people. The French government has been unable to put a lid on the issue, and the local administration plays a role in firearm regulation. The recent riots in 2024, which claimed 13 lives and caused 13,000 people to flee, have highlighted the need for a solution to the issue of gun ownership and civil unrest.

**Mexico's Thriving Black Market for Firearms: A Growing Concern**
Mexico has a thriving black market for firearms, with over 200,000 illegal guns entering the country each year, mainly from the United States. According to Sergio Aguayo Quezada, a researcher at El Colegio de México, between 2005 and 2024, three million 900,000 illegal firearms entered Mexico, with authorities only seizing 8.64%. Dulce Alicia Torres Hernández, who conducted the report 'Aporte del Seminario sobre Violencia y Paz a la discusión sobre las armas de fuego en México', estimates that in 2024, 72.92% of homicides were committed with firearms, the highest percentage in history. The Small Arms Survey estimates that by the end of 2017, Mexico had a total of 16,800,000 firearms, both legal and illegal, in the hands of civilians. After subtracting the 3,425,181 registered firearms with the Secretariat of National Defense from 2000 to 2017, the number of illegal firearms in the hands of civilians would be 13 million 374,819. Carlos A. Pérez Ricart, an academic at the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE), believes that the topic of firearms is the great struggle of our time, as no country can withstand the injection of more than 200,000 new firearms each year. He argues that there is no judicial reform or police model that can resolve the 'river of steel' that floods Mexico.

**Small Arms Permits in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: A Growing Concern**
The number of small arms permits in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has increased to 15,000. The police are concerned and warn of growing distrust of the public in the state's protection. According to Christian Schumacher, the chairman of the police union (GdP), the increase may be a sign that people feel they are not adequately protected by the state. 'In the current security situation, the police need many things, but what they don't need is the arming of the population,' he said. The state should be responsible for the safety of its citizens, he emphasized. Schumacher also called for the police to become more visible in the rural areas of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The small arms permit allows the holder to carry stun guns, irritant substances, and signal guns, according to the Federal Office for Administration. In the northeast, this number was around 15,000 at the end of 2024, about 850 more than at the end of 2023. In 2018, there were 9,600 permit holders. The applicant's suitability and reliability are checked.

**Swiss Gun Sales Increase Due to Growing Popularity of Shooting Sports**
It is difficult to determine the exact number of guns in Swiss homes, as there is no centralized registry of firearms. However, a 2018 study by the Geneva-based non-governmental organization 'Small Arms Survey' estimates that there are approximately 2.3 million guns in private hands. According to several gun dealers, the concerns about war have not been a factor in the purchase of guns. Instead, they attribute the increase in sales to the growing popularity of shooting sports. 'We are observing an increase in sales, which we can attribute particularly to shooting sports,' explains Alexander Ambauen, owner of the 'Gunlex' gun store in Beckenried (NW). Ambauen notes that this is due to the relaxation of rules by the Swiss Shooting Sport Association (see box). Since 2022, it has been possible to practice the sport with 'modern pistols,' Ambauen explains. Many of his new customers come to his store because they want to try this sport. Previously, only sport pistols or military-issue guns could be used for shooting sports. From 2022, the rules have become more flexible. Since then, any brand and type of pistol, including Glock and Beretta, can be used, as long as they fit in a test box in terms of size and have a 9mm caliber. The Swiss Association of Gunsmiths and Gun Dealers (SBV) also notes an increase in individual shooting sports, thanks to the 'great successes of shooting sports at the last Olympics,' as Vice President Christoph Gilgen told 20 Minuten.

**Nearly 1500 Right-Wing Extremists and Reichsbürgers Held Firearms Permits in 2023**
According to a response from the Federal Ministry of the Interior to a small question from Left Party MP Martina Renner, nearly 1500 right-wing extremists and Reichsbürgers held a 'firearms permit' at the end of 2023. This includes 1039 right-wing extremists, 393 'Reichsbürgers and 'Self-Administrators' and 37 people from the spectrum 'Verfassungsschutzrelevante Delegitimierung des Staates' (State-Delegitimizing). Renner stated, 'The arming of the right-wing extremist and Reichsbürger scene remains high.' She added, 'Only in 2023, around 1500 scene members had access to nearly 4000 permit-requiring firearms. The dark numbers are likely to be much higher.' Renner also noted that the disarmament of the scene is progressing 'in small steps.' She emphasized, 'Those who want to overthrow the democratic constitutional state should not be allowed to carry firearms. Otherwise, the security risk from the right-wing scene will continue to escalate.'

**Thuringia: Record Number of Small Arms Permits Issued**
The number of small arms permits in Thuringia continues to rise, with around 16,900 residents holding a valid permit by the end of 2024, according to a spokesperson for the Thuringian Ministry of the Interior. However, the police do not see this as an increase in safety, but rather the opposite. The permits allow individuals to carry stun guns or tear gas guns outside their own homes or properties, but without a permit, they can be purchased but not carried in public. The number of permits has been steadily increasing over the years, with 16,300 people holding a permit at the end of 2023 and 15,300 at the end of 2022. In contrast, only 9,800 people held a permit at the end of 2017. Unlike the application for a firearms permit, no need for the possession or use of a stun gun or tear gas gun is required, and no special knowledge is necessary. The police warn that carrying these types of guns can lead to a false sense of security and can even lead to dangerous situations, as they can be mistaken for real guns and trigger a reaction from others. 'In the end, it's not suitable for deterring or combating potential offenders,' said the spokesperson. 'On the contrary.'
