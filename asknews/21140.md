**German Plans for the Strongest Military In Europe Looking a Little Shaky**
German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is considering reintroducing conscription to meet the country's ambitious plans to strengthen its army. This comes after a coalition agreement between the Christian Democrats (CDU) and Pistorius' Social Democrats (SPD) agreed to stick to voluntary military service. However, Pistorius has stated that 'voluntary' is more of a concept than a rock solid principle, and the country needs more bodies to meet its NATO requirements. According to internal sources, an additional 80,000 German military personnel are required, and the government is struggling to find them. Germans can opt out of the draft by doing social work instead, and the native population is declining as a percentage of the overall population. The German government is now considering calling up its lapsed reservists and Iraq/Afghan veterans, but they can't find them due to data protection regulations. Patrick Sensburg, president of the German Reservists Association, says 'This is crazy. We have simply lost touch with these people.' The country needs at least 1 million reservists, but they currently stand at just 60,000. Even the 93,000 soldiers who served in Afghanistan cannot be reached. Sensburg says 'The annual volunteer quota of 5,000 is illusory. It's a joke.' He added, 'Without conscription, we cannot achieve our own goals and we will lose a war.'

**Tyssekrup Steel Europe Reaffirms Plan to Cut 11,000 Jobs**
Tyssekrup Steel Europe, Germany's largest steel company, has reaffirmed its plans to cut 11,000 jobs, announced in November last year. The company has announced its intention to present a social plan to manage this process. According to Dirk Schulte, the company's new head of human resources, 'negotiations with IG Metall union for the metal industry will start soon.' In November, Tyssekrup Steel Europe presented plans to reduce the number of jobs from its current level of slightly less than 27,000 to 16,000 jobs within six years. The company announced that 5,000 jobs will be cut by the end of 2030 through 'production and management adjustments,' and 6,000 other jobs will be outsourced. IG Metall union has strongly criticized the company's plans and announced 'strong resistance.' The union had demanded, as a precondition for negotiations, the exclusion of compulsory layoffs, the closure of sites, and long-term financing for the company.

**Germany Introduces New Law to Simplify Safe Country of Origin Classification**
The German government is planning to simplify the classification of countries as safe countries of origin for asylum seekers. According to the German newspaper 'Tageschau', the German cabinet plans to pass a bill on Wednesday (June 4, 2025) that would allow the federal government to classify countries of origin for asylum seekers through a decree, without the need for approval from the Federal Council (Bundesrat). If a country is considered safe under the law, it means that the political conditions in the country indicate the absence of political persecution or inhumane treatment. Based on this, asylum applications are usually rejected, especially those from individuals from countries classified as safe. However, this does not prevent individual protection from being recognized in certain cases, but it also allows for the easy and rapid deportation of rejected applicants. The new coalition agreement between the Christian Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany aims to classify Algeria, India, Morocco, and Tunisia as the first countries of safe origin. Similar initiatives have failed in the past due to opposition from states led by the Green Party and the Left Party. Currently, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ghana, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Senegal, Serbia, Georgia, Moldova, and the countries of the European Union are considered safe countries of origin in Germany. This classification aims to reduce irregular migration from these countries.

**Germany Expands 'Safe Country' List to Speed Up Deportations**
The German government has introduced a new initiative to speed up the deportation of asylum seekers by expanding the list of 'safe countries'. According to a report by the Tagesspiegel newspaper, a draft law that will allow the government to determine which countries are considered 'safe' will be voted on by the Cabinet on Wednesday. This move aims to break the blockade in the State Parliament, which has been ongoing for years, and to overcome the opposition of the Green Party-led states. The State Parliament has consistently rejected the government's proposals for safe countries in recent years, with the exception of Moldova and Georgia in 2023. 'Safe' country nationals' asylum applications can be quickly decided upon after a short review process, allowing for faster deportation proceedings. According to Thorsten Frei, the responsible minister, 'We are working intensively on a new regulation to simplify the classification of safe countries of origin, as we expect people to quickly implement the government's changes to its migration policies.' Frei also hopes that this new regulation will make it easier to deport 'safe' country nationals currently living in Germany. The coalition agreement between the Christian Union parties (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) originally planned to add Algeria, India, Morocco, and Tunisia to the list of safe countries and to gradually expand the list. The selection of countries to be added to the list will be based on the percentage of asylum applications accepted by their citizens, which must be below 5% over a period of at least five years. The classification of safe countries has so far been done in accordance with European Union asylum regulations and the German Constitution. However, the German Constitution requires the approval of the State Parliament, which has not been forthcoming. CDU politician Thorsten Frei argued in 2019 that the German Constitution plays a minor role in the classification of safe countries, as EU regulations are the dominant factor in practice. The Green Party, on the other hand, has strongly criticized the government's plan to make it easier to deport asylum seekers. Felix Bonaszak, co-chair of the Greens, accused the SPD of playing a 'theater' to appease Christian Democrat voters, saying 'I'm starting to wonder if the SPD is really a part of this coalition.'

**Germany to Phase Out DSL Internet Connections by 2030**
The German government has announced plans to phase out DSL internet connections by 2030, with the goal of transitioning to fiber-optic internet. The Bundesnetzagentur has outlined a three-stage plan, starting with a voluntary phase where internet providers will encourage customers to switch to fiber-optic connections. In the second phase, providers will create concrete shutdown plans, which will be approved by the Bundesnetzagentur. Customers will then receive a binding deadline to switch to fiber-optic connections. The third phase will be the actual shutdown of copper lines. As a consumer, it is recommended to inform yourself early and prepare for the transition. Check if fiber-optic internet is available in your area and compare different offers. If you are a tenant, discuss the installation of fiber-optic internet with your landlord. Homeowners should consider agreeing to fiber-optic connection when providers approach them, as EU regulations and national laws may require it in the future. Note that not only your internet connection will be affected, but also your landline phone service. When switching to fiber-optic, you will typically be switched to IP-telephony, and old analog phones will only work with adapters. The transition from DSL to fiber-optic is a complex logistical challenge, especially in rural areas where infrastructure is lacking. Currently, only about half of German households are technically accessible to fiber-optic internet, and many consumers do not actively use fiber-optic connections even if they have one. The Bundesnetzagentur emphasizes that the technology change should be fair and transparent, and no one should be left without internet. A coordinated approach from all parties involved - internet providers, alternative providers, politics, and end-users - is crucial for a successful transition to the new technology. According to Statista, more than 23 million people in Germany still have a DSL connection.

**AfD's Unopposed Leadership: A Threat to CDU?**
The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has unopposed leadership, with Markus Frohnmaier as the candidate for Minister-President and Emil Sänze leading the state list. Both are co-chairmen of the AfD state association. The article suggests that the AfD's goal is to dismantle the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). However, no specific quotes or statements from the AfD leadership are provided to support this claim.

**AfD's 'Counter-Report': Could the Union be Considered Unconstitutional?**
The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has commissioned a report that questions whether the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) parties could be considered unconstitutional. The report, written by a lawyer from the Hoecker law firm in Cologne, concludes that if the same standards used by the Verfassungsschutz (Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) were applied to the CDU and CSU, they would also have a 'handfestes Problem' (serious issue). This move by the AfD is seen as a counter-attack, as they have been the subject of similar reports in the past.

**Klingbeil's Plan for 17 Billion Euro in Tax Cuts for Companies**
Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil is implementing several measures from the coalition agreement to boost the economy. According to a media report, the measures include tax cuts for companies, including a reduction in corporate tax and new depreciation rules for electric cars. The tax cuts are expected to total 17 billion euros by 2029, with 48 billion euros in total for the period 2025-2029. Klingbeil stated, 'With this law, priority measures for location strengthening and investment promotion are being implemented, from which a strong signal for the short-term and long-term competitiveness of the economic location Germany goes out immediately.' The law includes a 'Investitionsbooster' with special depreciation rules for companies on investments in 2025, 2026, and 2027, as well as a reduction in corporate tax from 15 to 10 percent by 2032. Additionally, the tax relief for companies will increase over the years, with 2.5 billion euros in 2025, 8.1 billion euros in 2026, and 11.3 billion euros in 2029.

**Friedrich Merz: AfD-Hammer for the Chancellor in New Survey**
The Union has continued its upward trend, according to a recent survey, reaching its highest value in two months. The satisfaction with Chancellor Friedrich Merz is also increasing. He is even surpassing the Alternative for Germany (AfD). The survey found that the Union is gaining ground, while the AfD is losing ground, standing at 24%. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remains unchanged at 16%. The Greens (11%) and the Left (10%) also show no changes. The Alliance for Sara Wagenknecht (BSW) remains at 4%, while the Free Democratic Party (FDP) can improve slightly, reaching 5%. The satisfaction with Chancellor Merz's work has increased to 31%, with 47% still being critical and 22% undecided. The overall assessment of the black-red federal government is also positive, with 34% being satisfied, compared to 26% at the time of its inception. However, 44% are still critical. Despite the positive trend for the government parties, a crucial problem remains: the CDU/CSU and SPD together only reach 43%, which is not enough for a majority in the Bundestag. A majority would only be possible with a coalition between the Union and the AfD, which would reach 51%. However, the Union has ruled out such a coalition.

**Germany's New Government Takes Shape: CDU/CSU and SPD Reach Coalition Agreement**
After 45 days of coalition talks, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)/Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Germany have reached an agreement and formed a new government. CDU leader Friedrich Merz, CSU leader Markus Söder, and SPD co-leaders Saskia Esken and Lars Klingbeil announced the final version of the Coalition Agreement in a joint press conference. The 130-page agreement includes measures to reduce the tax burden on low- and middle-income earners and businesses, as well as a guarantee that pensioners' benefits will not be lower than 48% of their recent earnings until 2031. However, the SPD's demand for higher taxes on high-income earners was not included in the agreement.

**Germany's New Chancellor Faces Challenges in Rearming the Country**
Friedrich Merz, the new Chancellor of Germany, has won the legislative elections of February 23 and has already negotiated a coalition between his CDU/CSU and the SPD. The coalition is necessary to overcome the fragmentation of the party system and to achieve a clear majority in the Bundestag. However, Merz faces new challenges, such as rearming Germany, which feels threatened by Russia and abandoned by the United States. Merz has agreed with the SPD and the Greens to a vote on rearmament before taking office, in order to avoid future blockages. The AfD, a far-right party, has gained 20% of the votes and is now the second-largest party in the Bundestag. The party's leader, Alice Weidel, has been praised by Elon Musk and has distanced herself from the party's more extreme members. The German society rejects the xenophobic discourse of the AfD, and the churches have been at the forefront of the fight against xenophobia. The bishop Georg Bätzing has stated that 'the significant increase in voter participation is a good sign for our country, showing that democracy is being taken seriously.' The president of the Evangelical Church in Germany, Kirsten Fehrs, has also appealed for a 'Germany where human dignity and mutual respect matter.'

**Germany: 'Alternative' Party Ties with 'Christian' Bloc for First Time in Poll**
The leader of the German Social Democratic Party, Saskia Esken, said, 'It is essential to fulfill our promises now, to draft an alliance agreement and set goals that we can achieve.' For the first time, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is on par with the Christian Union in a poll. The AfD party has gained 1 percentage point, reaching 24% in the weekly poll conducted by the Institute for Public Opinion Research (Insa) on behalf of the German newspaper Bild. In contrast, the Christian Union, led by future Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has lost 2 percentage points. The Christian Union won the general election on February 23, 2025, with 28.5% of the votes, while the AfD party came in second with 20.8% of the votes. The Social Democratic Party's popularity has remained at 16%, while the Green Party and the Left Party have gained 1 percentage point each, reaching 11% each. The Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party have each gained 4%. The poll included 1206 Germans between March 31, 2025, and April 5, 2025. Esken emphasized the need to 'ensure the provision of public services to citizens with trustworthiness, and to provide them with security, also in terms of their jobs.' She said, 'Then we will achieve our promises.' Esken stated that significant progress has been made in terms of financial packages for infrastructure and defense, 'but there are still matters that need to be decided: how do we achieve stability for our pensions? How do we ensure that education and care become more just and reliable, and many other things?' Esken expressed hope that the coalition government negotiations will be concluded soon, but refused to set a specific timeline, saying, 'I am extremely confident that we will conclude the negotiations, but I cannot provide any information on the date.' According to reports, it is not planned to hold extensive negotiations between representatives of the future coalition government on Sunday (April 6, 2025).

**CDU and SPD Conclude Preliminary Negotiations to Form Coalition Government**
The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) have concluded preliminary negotiations to form a coalition government. The agreement covers issues such as strengthening border control and the return of migrants. CDU leader Friedrich Merz emphasized the need for stricter measures against illegal migration, including deportation of migrants without the right to reside in Germany. In contrast, SPD co-chair Lars Klingbeil called for a more effective restriction on the influx of illegal migrants. In the field of social policy, Merz announced a reform of the unemployment benefit for the unemployed, which will be replaced by a 'basic allowance' for job seekers. Those who refuse to work will be deprived of benefits. The two parties aim to form a coalition by Easter, April 20, 2025. Merz stated that intense negotiations with the 'Greens' will take place next week, as their support is crucial for reaching a final agreement. The CDU and SPD have agreed to increase defense spending, as announced last week. Following the February 23 elections, the CDU/CSU bloc secured 28.6% of the votes, while the SPD garnered 16.4%. Meanwhile, the Alternative for Germany party came in second with 20.8% support, but is not invited to join the coalition due to its perceived pro-Russian stance.

**Germany's CDU and SPD Announce Start of Formal Negotiations for Grand Coalition**
The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) have announced, along with the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the start of formal negotiations to form a 'grand coalition' government in Germany. The coalition will be led by CDU leader Friedrich Merz as the new Chancellor of the country. Merz stated, 'We have a joint document that is the basis for the coalition negotiations that will begin next week.' The coalition aims to form a new government before Easter, which falls in the second half of April. The main topics of discussion include migration, with Merz proposing a radical change in Germany's migration policy, including the expansion of border controls and the acceleration of repatriation processes. The coalition also plans to introduce a minimum wage of 15 euros, increase pensions, and reform the tax system. However, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has criticized the coalition, calling it 'socialist' and accusing Merz of breaking his campaign promises. The AfD has also criticized the coalition's economic policies, saying they will not create prosperity or economic growth. The Greens have also expressed concerns about the coalition, saying it will only solve structural problems with money and leave them 'a bit further away' from supporting the coalition.

**Conservatives and Social Democrats Begin Talks to Form Government Excluding AfD**
The conservative block formed by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), will begin negotiations with the social democrats of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) to form a government. The agreement will exclude the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party from the government and maintain a 'cordón sanitario' around them. The formal coalition talks will start next week. According to Friedrich Merz, the leader of the CDU, the negotiations will be based on a joint document that outlines the three key areas of agreement: migration policy, finance and labor market, and economy. Merz stated, 'We have a joint document that constitutes the basis of the coalition negotiations that will begin next week.' He added, 'The situation in the world is changing dramatically every day, and we need to start making decisions as soon as possible to correct the country's economic course.'

Many Germans are surprised by the AfD's surge in popularity, and while some expect the parties to avoid coalitions with the far-right movement, others are tired of the 'cordon sanitaire' against the AfD.

**Laschet's CDU/CSU Wins German Federal Election, Faces Coalition Negotiations**
The Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) led by Armin Laschet has won the German federal election, making him a potential candidate for the next German Chancellor. Laschet has vowed to help Europe achieve 'true independence' and has begun forming a government. However, he faces a complex and lengthy coalition negotiation process due to the strong performance of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which secured 20.5% of the vote, a historic high. Laschet has criticized the US for its 'extremely impolite' comments during the election period, comparing them to Russian interference. He emphasized that his top priority is to achieve European unity and to strengthen Europe, allowing it to gradually achieve true independence from the US. Laschet will need to negotiate with other parties to form a government, possibly including the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which is currently the largest party in the opposition. The coalition negotiation process is expected to be challenging, and the outcome is uncertain. If a three-party coalition is formed, it may further impact the government's efficiency and make it difficult for Germany to project a clear leadership on the international stage.

**Merz Rejects Governing with the Far Right, Offers Alliance to AfD**
Merz has emphasized that the leaders of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party 'want the opposite of what we want, and therefore it is not possible to govern with them'. The veteran politician has highlighted the 'victory' of the conservative coalition he leads in the German federal elections held on Sunday and has assured that he will govern. 'We will govern (...). We have won the federal elections of 2025. We, the CDU and the CSU (Christian Social Union), the Union, have won these federal elections of 2025', Merz said to the followers of the formation gathered in the Berlin headquarters. Merz has offered an alliance to the AfD, saying 'We are open to coalition negotiations with the CDU. Otherwise, it will not be possible for a political change in Germany'. The AfD candidate, Alice Weidel, has offered to form a coalition government with the CDU, saying 'We are open to coalition negotiations with the CDU. Otherwise, it will not be possible for a political change in Germany'. Merz has also expressed his respect for his political rivals, saying 'I am aware of the responsibility. I am also aware of the magnitude of the task that lies ahead. I will face it with the greatest respect and I know it will not be easy'. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) candidate, Olaf Scholz, has recognized the 'bitter result' of his party, saying 'It is a bitter electoral result for the Social Democratic Party, a defeat'. Scholz has also warned the CDU not to collaborate with the AfD, saying 'We cannot stay with our arms crossed'.

**AfD Offers Coalition Talks to CDU, but Acceptance is Unlikely**
Alice Weidel of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has offered Friedrich Merz of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) coalition talks, saying, 'Our hand is outstretched, to implement the will of the people. You just have to take it.' She added, 'The people want Blue-Black.' The AfD is prepared to offer a 'stable Germany coalition to implement the will of the people.' However, it is considered highly unlikely that Merz will accept this offer, as all other parties had ruled out a coalition with the AfD before the election. According to the ZDF Forschungsgruppe Wahlen, there are four possible coalitions that could form a majority in the Bundestag, including three possible three-party coalitions for the Union and one two-party coalition with the AfD.
