**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**Ray Kurzweil Predicts Humanity Will Reach 'Speed of Longevity Escape' by 2029**
Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that humanity will reach the 'speed of longevity escape' by 2029, where our life expectancy will increase by more than one year for every year that passes, allowing us to gain time rather than lose it. Kurzweil bases this prediction on the concept that medical and technological advancements will soon reach a pace where improvements in treatments and therapies will extend our life expectancy faster than we naturally age. He notes that currently, we recover approximately four months of longevity per year due to scientific advancements, but by 2029, this number will reach one year. Kurzweil's methodology is based on the 'law of accelerating returns,' which states that technological progress advances at an exponential rate. He also predicts that humans will be able to merge their neocortex with the cloud by the early 2030s, surpassing the biological limitations of the human brain. However, he acknowledges the limitations of his predictions, stating that 'achieving the speed of longevity escape does not guarantee living forever.'

**Europe's Aging Population: A Growing Concern**
The median age in Europe has reached 44.7 years, with some countries, such as Italy, already exceeding 48.7 years. According to Eurostat, the population of the EU will begin to decline in 2026, with a projected decrease of 50 million people by 2100. The main cause of this demographic shift is the decline in fertility rates, which have fallen below the replacement level. In 2023, the global fertility rate in the EU was 1.38 children per woman, down from 1.44 in 2003 and below the replacement level of 2.1. Eurostat estimates that the proportion of people aged 65 or older will increase from 21.6% in 2024 to 32.5% in 2100, while the proportion of people aged 80 or older will multiply by 2.5, from 6% to 15%. The tasa de dependencia, which measures the relationship between the number of young people and those of older age, will tend to worsen, with a projected ratio of two people in work for every one dependent in 2024. As stated by Eurostat, 'the process of aging is so accelerated, linked to the increases in longevity, that Eurostat predicts that the proportion of people aged 80 or more in the population of the EU will multiply by 2.5 between 2024 and 2100, passing from 6% to 15%.'

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**More than half of young people will face health problems by 2030**
A new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, more than 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity and overweight have increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The document also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. In 2016, fewer than 1,000 adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, but by 2021, the number had already exceeded 1.1 billion. Another concerning aspect is the role that climate change and technology will play. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with an average annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. According to UN estimates, by 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24. This generation faces a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.

**Longevity experts reveal when humans will start living to 1,000**
Experts predict that humans could live to 1,000 or beyond through various technologies. Dr. Ian Pearson believes that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced tech to live forever, either in enhanced bodies or as digital minds. Ray Kurzweil predicts that AI will match human intelligence by 2029, leading to a merger between humans and machines that could result in immortality by 2045. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, argues that medical advances could make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live to 1,000 or beyond. Each of these breakthroughs offers a different path to immortality, and they're not just about living longer, but changing what it means to be human. 'By 2050, it will only really be for the rich and famous,' Pearson said, noting that these technologies will start expensive but become affordable by the 2060s for middle-class people. Kurzweil believes that AI will transform society, making necessities like food and housing cheaper and connecting human brains to the cloud via devices like Elon Musk's Neuralink. De Grey's approach, called 'integrative rejuvenation,' uses multiple treatments to fix cellular damage, like clearing out harmful waste or repairing DNA. 'Aging is a disease,' de Grey argued, saying that we should treat it like we treat cancer or diabetes.

**The Future of Longevity: Will Humans Live to be 100 and Beyond?**
According to gerontologists, the current generation of children will have a 50% chance of living to be 100 years old, and by the end of the century, most people will live to be 110-120 years old. This optimism is based on the fact that despite epidemics and wars, the average lifespan of people is increasing rapidly. According to the UN, in 1900, the average lifespan was 32 years, while in 2023, it was 73 years. In developed countries, the average lifespan is approaching 85 years. The main reasons for this progress are the reduction in child mortality, the successes of medicine, and the improvement in the quality of life. The number of centenarians (people over 90 years old) is increasing rapidly, with a six-fold increase in their share of the population since the mid-20th century. By 2050, 0.79% of the world's population is expected to reach the age of 90 or more, and by 2100, this number is expected to reach 2.14%. In countries with a high standard of living, such as the EU and Japan, the number of centenarians is expected to increase significantly, with over 10 million people in the EU and 6 million in Japan. The director of the Institute of Gerontology, Sergey Shcherbov, notes that people over 65 years old living today are significantly different from their counterparts 50-70 years ago, with better physical health, cognitive abilities, and a longer period of vitality. The example of 94-year-old Warren Buffett, who only began to feel his age after 90, is cited as an example of how people are living longer and healthier lives. However, it is also noted that there is a limit to human lifespan, and that the maximum lifespan of 110-120 years is considered to be the upper limit. The formula for longevity includes a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, social interaction, and mental stimulation. Researchers are also exploring the use of senolytics, anti-oxidants, and stem cells to promote longevity, but these approaches have not yet been proven to be effective in humans. The article concludes that while there is still much to be learned about the biology of aging, the current understanding of the factors that contribute to longevity provides a solid foundation for further research and development.

**AI Predicts a Bleak Future for Humanity in 2100**
A study by artificial intelligence predicts a bleak future for humanity in 2100. The analysis is based on current technological, environmental, and social developments. According to the AI, some people will have merged with technology to improve their physical performance and reduce suffering, while others will choose simpler ways of life, living in small communities connected to the earth and ancestral knowledge. Cities will float, but many regions will be destroyed by natural disasters. The AI predicts the disappearance of countries as we know them, replaced by digital borders. The main struggle will be for access to essential resources like water, air, and data. The AI also suggests that children may not always be born naturally, but rather in laboratories or through guided processes by 'ancient souls' to restore balance. However, the vision is not entirely pessimistic, as a new generation is said to emerge, guided by memory and spiritual connection, and living in harmony with nature. 'They talk to trees. They listen to the dead. And they walk without haste, knowing that time is no longer a line, but a spiral,' the AI concludes.

**ChatGPT Predicts Humans Will Be Irrelevant by 2100**
ChatGPT, a conversational AI, was asked about the fate of humanity by the year 2100 and responded, 'Yes, but they will be irrelevant.' According to ComputerHoy, this response is precise, as technology will continue to advance, bringing us closer to what was once considered science fiction. The AI does not foresee a physical or biological collapse of the human species or a large-scale extinction. However, it does predict that humans will have minimal influence in key processes by the year 2100. This statement is not optimistic, as the AI does not envision a future of prosperity or ethical progress, but rather a species that has been marginalized from the center of the system it created. 'In a time marked by automation and the increasing delegation of decisions, it's not surprising that we start to question the place of people in the next few decades,' says ComputerHoy. 'The future is already a cultural and philosophical question.'

**Survive Till 2050 And You May Live Forever. Here's How**
Dr. Ian Pearson claims that individuals who survive until 2050 may have the possibility to evade death altogether due to advancements in medical science. According to Dr. Pearson, science will progress to the point where damaged organs can be replaced, potentially leading to eternal youth. Scientists are currently working on techniques to prevent the ageing of human body cells through genetic engineering and 3D printing organs. Initially, this revolutionary treatment will be available only to the wealthy due to its high cost, but Dr. Pearson predicts that by the 2060s, the technology will become affordable, allowing most people to benefit from these life-enhancing advancements. Aubrey de Grey emphasizes that this research aims not just to prolong life but to promote a healthy and productive life, and scientists like Ray Kurzweil predict that by 2045, humans might achieve immortality by uploading their brains into computers.

**The Coming Scarcity of Humanity**
The author envisions a future where technology has advanced to the point where human labor is no longer necessary, and people are free to pursue their passions and interests. With the help of AI, robotics, and bioengineering, tasks that once required human effort are being automated, creating a paradox where technology improves productivity but also reduces the necessity for human labor. However, this shift enables people to focus on creative, ethical, and deeply personal contributions that machines cannot replicate. The author argues that rather than competing with AI, humans can harness it to amplify their unique strengths and create a world where scarcity is replaced by abundance through better resource management and technological breakthroughs. By 2100, global population growth is expected to decline, and humanity could achieve unprecedented levels of well-being through technological advancements like AI-driven healthcare, renewable energy solutions, and space colonization. The key to a thriving future is not resisting technological progress but integrating it with a human-centered approach. The author calls for a balance between leveraging technology to solve pressing issues and ensuring that humanity remains at the center of our progress.

**World Population Expected to Peak at 10.3 Billion by 2100**
The world's population is expected to peak at 10.3 billion by 2100, with an 80% chance of reaching this number, according to the United Nations (UN). After that, the population will start to decline. This is a more pessimistic prediction than 10 years ago, when it was estimated that the peak population would be over 12 billion. The UN's report, 'Perspectivas da População Mundial em 2024', states that many countries have already reached their peak population, including 63 nations such as Germany, Russia, China, and Japan. The report also predicts that 48 countries, including Brazil, will reach their peak population between 2025 and 2054. In contrast, 126 countries, including the United States, Indonesia, and Pakistan, are expected to continue growing after 2054. According to the UN, despite the predicted decline in population, life expectancy is expected to increase. 'In the last three decades, mortality rates have decreased and life expectancy has increased significantly,' said the UN. 'After a brief decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, global life expectancy at birth is increasing again, reaching 73.3 years in 2024, up from 70.9 years during the pandemic.'

**How Our Bodies Will Change in the Future**
Researchers have used digital tools to explore how technology and climate change might shape human evolution. According to their studies, by 2100, humans may develop a 'text claw' grip, with hands molded into a claw-like shape due to prolonged smartphone use. Additionally, people may grow a second set of eyelids to filter out excess light from technology devices. Climate change could lead to humans growing webbed feet and bigger toes, as well as larger noses to warm cold air when inhaled.
