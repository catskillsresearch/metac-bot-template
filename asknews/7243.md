**Forget Canada and Greenland, Puerto Rico Should be the 51st State of the Union**
If Donald Trump is serious about increasing the number of states in the Union, he should support Puerto Rico's bid to become a state, rather than continuing as a commonwealth. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, but lack representation in Congress and the right to vote for U.S. President. Despite this, Puerto Rico has a strong military presence, with one of the highest per-capita military enlistment rates and a history of honorable service since World War I. In 2024, Puerto Ricans voted in favor of statehood with nearly 60% support, marking the fourth time this century they have done so. However, any change to Puerto Rico's status would require Congressional approval, which has been divided on the issue. Additionally, Puerto Rico's massive debt and history of corruption and high crime would require significant U.S. government support if it were to become a state.

**Humberto Costa Warns of 'Disaster' if Far-Right Wins Senate Majority**
Senator Humberto Costa (PT-PE) expressed concern about the 2026 election scenario, where 54 out of 81 Senate seats will be up for grabs. According to Costa, there is a 'concrete possibility' that the opposition, led by the far-right, will win the majority in the Senate, which he believes would be a direct threat to the country's democratic balance. 'I don't think it will be easy, but if the far-right wins a majority in the Senate, it could be a disaster for our democracy. It could start the opening of processes against STF ministers, rejection of names for the Central Bank, regulatory agencies, diplomatic corps... a true pandemonium could be installed,' Costa warned. He confirmed that he will try to renew his mandate and stated that the Senate dispute will be the PT's top priority in 2026. Costa's goal is to build a solid base of support for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), in case he is re-elected. 'In the Senate, the main strategy will be to build a solid base for the Lula government, so we don't have to face the same difficulties we're facing now,' he declared. Costa also emphasized the importance of expanding the party's representation in the Chamber of Deputies, and stated that the PT will invest in viable candidacies and names with strong electoral appeal.

**Humberto Costa: 'Far-right Senate majority would be a disaster for democracy'**
Senator and interim president of the PT, Humberto Costa, expressed concern in an interview that the opposition may win a majority of seats in the Senate in 2026, when 54 of the 81 mandates will be renewed. 'I don't believe it will be easy, but if the far-right wins a majority in the Senate, it could be a disaster for our democracy,' he said. 'It could lead to the opening of processes against STF ministers, rejection of names for the Central Bank, regulatory agencies, and the diplomatic corps... it could be a true pandemonium.' Costa confirmed that he will run for re-election and stated that the PT's central strategy will be to prioritize the Senate election. He aims to form 'the future government Lula's bench' in case of Lula's re-election in 2026. 'In the Senate, the main strategy will be to form a solid base for the Lula government, so we don't have to face the same difficulties we're facing now,' he said. Costa also stated that the party will work to expand its presence in the Chamber. 'It's possible to do so with a well-planned election. Good teams and vote-pullers can improve our situation in the Chamber,' he said.

**The Meaning of "Commonwealth" - PUERTO RICO REPORT**
Puerto Rico is often referred to as a commonwealth, but what does this term really mean? The answer lies in the 1952 local constitution, which was approved by Congress. However, Congress was explicit that this did not change Puerto Rico's status as a territory or lessen federal control. Since then, the term 'commonwealth' has evolved to describe a potential relationship between the US and Puerto Rico, where Puerto Rico would have special rights and privileges. However, US officials have rejected this proposal as unconstitutional and unfeasible, stating that 'commonwealth' is not an option that the US federal government accepts. Despite this, the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico has continued to promote the 'commonwealth' label, even going so far as to urge supporters to vote for 'none of the above' in protest. In a 2017 plebiscite, 97% of voters chose statehood, further solidifying the unconstitutionality and unattainability of the 'commonwealth' platform.

**Senate rankings: The 5 seats most likely to flip**
The 2026 midterm cycle is heating up, with several Senate seats up for grabs. Here are the five seats most likely to flip: Georgia, North Carolina, Maine, Michigan, and New Hampshire. In Georgia, Sen. Jon Ossoff is considered the most vulnerable Democrat, and Republicans are eager to win back the seat. However, the GOP's top choice, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, has decided not to run, leaving a crowded field of B-tier candidates. In North Carolina, Democrats are waiting to see if Gov. Roy Cooper will run against Sen. Thom Tillis. In Maine, Democrats are struggling to find a viable candidate against Sen. Susan Collins, and Rep. Jared Golden has announced he will run for his House seat instead. In Michigan, a trio of Democrats are running to succeed retiring Sen. Gary Peters, including Rep. Haley Stevens and former health director Abdul El-Sayed. In New Hampshire, Rep. Chris Pappas is the top-tier Democratic candidate, but Republicans are eyeing a comeback with former Sen. Scott Brown. 'Kemp is the 1:1 on the board. Full stop,' said one GOP operative. 'This is a situation where you want a primary. Where you want them to show their mettle because I just don't think that we have a clear enough indication on any of these guys to say they can do it.' Democrats remain bullish on their chances, but the Republican Party is confident in their ability to win back the majority. 'I am bullish on Jon Ossoff.... He's done a great job. He's centered the people of Georgia and their needs and their concerns,' said Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.). 'I'd hate to have to run as a Republican in this moment,' he added.

**Opposition Coalition in Dilemma over Choice of New Party, Fails to Meet**
The National Opposition Coalition Group, led by Senator David Mark, failed to meet on May 30, 2025, to decide on a political party to join. The group was considering joining the African Democratic Congress (ADC) or the Social Democratic Party (SDP), or registering a new party. However, discussions with the SDP have reached a dead end, and many members have shifted their support to the League of Northern Democrats (LND), which is pushing for the registration of a new party. Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, former Governor of Sokoto State Aminu Bello Tambuwal, and others are in favor of joining the ADC, while former Governor of Rivers State Rotimi Amaechi and others support the registration of a new party, Alliance for Democratic Alliance (ADA). A written submission by the LND states that joining an existing party would lead to 'systemic crisis and leadership crisis' and that registering a new party is the best option. 'After an exhaustive internal review, wide consultations and critical evaluation of the strategic pathways available to the National Opposition Coalition Group ahead of the 2027 general elections, we conclude that it is best advantageous for the opposition to register a new party platform, presenting the most viable, principled and sustainable path forward,' the group said.

**2027: Shekarau, others seek new party for Atiku's coalition**
Some northern political elite members, led by former Kano State Governor Ibrahim Shekarau, have called on the coalition of opposition leaders led by former Vice President Atiku Abubakar to form a new political party ahead of the 2027 general elections. The League of Northern Democrats, comprising former governors, senators, academics, and business leaders, believes that a new party would offer the best chance for success, citing risks of structural conflict, leadership disputes, and legal complications associated with joining existing platforms. According to Dr. Umar Ardo, the group's convener, 'Following an exhaustive internal review and critical evaluation of the strategic options available to the National Opposition Coalition Group, we have unanimously resolved that registering a new party offers the best chance for success in 2027.' The group emphasizes the importance of ideological clarity and decisive action, stating, 'This movement is not merely about seizing power. It's about national rebirth -- a fresh start anchored in values, principles, and competence.'

**PRFAA Insists There Will Be No Cuts to PAN**
The executive director of the Federal Affairs Administration of Puerto Rico (PRFAA), Gabriella Boffelli, stated that the proposed budget cuts by President Donald Trump are not definitive and that the US Congress will determine the final version. She also confirmed that the proposed budget includes an increase in funds for the Program of Nutritional Assistance (PAN), which will directly benefit Puerto Rico. According to Boffelli, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) document does not present significant changes in terms of priorities or proposed cuts. However, Trump still intends to reduce non-defense discretionary spending by over $160 billion, while proposing increases in military spending. Boffelli emphasized that the budget still needs to be evaluated, amended, and approved by Congress. 'The constitutional authority to evaluate, amend, and approve the budget rests exclusively with Congress. The legislative process has already begun,' she said. Boffelli stated that PRFAA remains attentive and active in the legislative process, advocating for the needs of Puerto Rico. She added that it is unlikely that the approved budget for fiscal year 2026 will include drastic cuts or the elimination of programs with bipartisan support, such as CDBG or Head Start.

**Senate | Cook Political Report**
The Cook Political Report provides an overview of the 2024 US Senate elections, highlighting key battleground states and potential candidates. The report notes that Democrats' chances of winning the Senate depend on their performance in Maine, which is considered a challenging state to win. The article also mentions potential Republican candidates in Alabama and Louisiana, and discusses the importance of the Senate elections in determining the balance of power in Congress. According to Jessica Taylor, 'A crowded GOP field is expected to seek to succeed Tuberville in Alabama Senate.' Additionally, 'Bayou Battle looms as Cassidy tries to repent from Trump impeachment vote' in Louisiana. Amy Walter states, 'Democrats' road to the Senate goes through Maine. That's harder than it sounds.' The report concludes by asking, 'Could Republicans blow it again?'

**González Colón Defends Garffer's Eligibility as Secretary of State**
Puerto Rico Governor Jenniffer González Colón stated that Arthur Garffer meets the requirements to be Secretary of State, citing that the Constitution of Puerto Rico allows for individuals with US government designations to maintain their residency in Puerto Rico. González Colón explained, 'When the Constitution of Puerto Rico was approved, in the session diary, when this was debated, members of the Constituent Assembly spoke of keeping the residency of people who had designations to work on behalf of the US government, including military personnel, if their residence was in Puerto Rico. He meets perfectly, not because there is an exception, but because it was contemplated that way by the Constitution's parents.' However, Manuel Calderón Cerame, leader of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), disagreed, stating that Garffer would have to wait until December 2025 to meet the constitutional requirements, and therefore should withdraw his nomination.

**Senate Approves Bill to Extend Coal Use in Puerto Rico Until 2032**
The Puerto Rican Senate approved a bill on Monday night, extending the use of coal as a source of energy generation in Puerto Rico until December 31, 2032. The bill, presented by La Fortaleza, includes language that establishes the reduction of fossil fuel use through the progressive integration of renewable energy, as technology allows, without compromising the continuity of the electrical system. The bill also maintains the compliance with the 2050 goals, particularly in terms of the reliability and resilience of the electrical service. The Popular Democratic Party (PPD), Independentist Party of Puerto Rico (PIP), and Dignity Project (PD) delegations, as well as independent senator Eliezer Molina Pérez, did not support the measure, which was confirmed with 18 votes in favor and 9 against.

**Fact Check Team: Push for Puerto Rico independence could save US $617B, report suggests**
A draft executive order suggests that making Puerto Rico an independent nation could save the US approximately $617.8 billion annually. However, this would also result in Puerto Ricans losing access to federal benefits, including healthcare, education, and public services. Currently, Puerto Rico's median household income is about $25,000, roughly one-third of the US median. While some advocate for independence, others support statehood, which could grant Puerto Ricans full citizenship and up to $12.5 billion more in federal benefits. Critics, including former Senator Mitch McConnell, have expressed concerns that adding Puerto Rico as a state could alter the political landscape by providing Democrats with two additional Senate seats, according to a recent report from the Council on Foreign Relations.

**Puerto Rico Seeks Statehood, Despite Trump's Lack of Interest**
The government of Puerto Rico has launched a campaign in Washington this week, hoping to become a US state, despite the lack of interest shown by the Trump administration on this issue. According to Puerto Rico's Governor, Jennifer González, 'The people of Puerto Rico continue to demand, clearly and unequivocally, to be granted the status of a state.' González pointed out that the majority of voters in Puerto Rico, in referendums held in 2012, 2017, 2020, and 2024, have expressed their desire to join the United States, with 58% of voters supporting the move in the latest referendum. However, this is not binding as it requires Washington's approval. In a recent interview, Elon Musk, the CEO of the Government Efficiency Department, stated that he decided to support Donald Trump's candidacy because the Democratic Party's leadership wants to turn Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. into states to gain control of the legislative body. González downplayed the importance of these statements, emphasizing that Musk was referring to California and Washington D.C., and that he 'mentioned Puerto Rico as an example.'

**Puerto Rico Intensifies Campaign for Statehood in the United States**
Puerto Rico's government has strengthened its campaign in Washington D.C. to become the 51st state of the United States. Despite the lack of support from the Trump administration, Governor Jenniffer González expressed the local government's firm stance in favor of statehood during the Puerto Rico Equality and Statehood Summit at the Capitol, according to EFE. González stated that the people of Puerto Rico have consistently expressed their desire to become a state of the United States, as confirmed in the non-binding consultations of 2012, 2017, 2020, and 2024, in which 58% of voters supported annexation. González emphasized that statehood is a firm goal of the Puerto Rican government and that she is committed to pursuing it, despite the obstacles, including the lack of interest from the Trump administration and the opposition from some politicians. She also mentioned that Elon Musk, director of the US Department of Government Efficiency, expressed support for Trump's candidacy, citing the Democratic Party's intention to make Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. states to gain control in Congress. However, González downplayed these statements and reaffirmed that Puerto Rico has a political balance that would allow it to advance towards statehood, regardless of the party in power in the White House.

Elon Musk stated that he strongly supported Donald Trump due to the Democrats' support for Puerto Rico's statehood. Musk, who became a special advisor and major donor to Trump's campaign, said, 'This was a divergence in the path, a very obvious divergence.' He also claimed that if the Democrats had four more years, they would legalize enough undocumented immigrants in key states to turn them 'blue' and win the House of Representatives, Senate, and presidency. Musk added, 'If we take the seven key states, the margin of victory is usually around 20,000 votes. If we put 200,000 undocumented immigrants and they have an 80% chance of voting for Democrats, it's only a matter of time before those key states become permanent Democratic states, a deeply blue socialist state.'

**Puerto Rico as the 51st State: An Economic Powerhouse Waiting to Happen**
Making Puerto Rico the 51st state could be a 'slam dunk' for the U.S. economy, with billions in federal funding and job creation. According to the Government Accountability Office, Puerto Rico lost $2.9 billion in Medicaid funding in 2023 due to its territorial status. Statehood could also boost tourism, with the island's $9 billion industry potentially rivaling Hawaii's $20 billion. However, the article warns that Hawaii's statehood experience shows how economic gains can come at the cost of cultural identity, and that Puerto Rico's Spanish roots, Taíno heritage, and Afro-Caribbean soul must be protected. Governor Jenniffer González-Colón's GOP credentials and engagement with cultural icons like Bad Bunny could help sway Republicans and ensure buy-in from the 58% of Puerto Ricans who voted for statehood in 2024. 'Make it the 51st state, and watch it shine -- for itself, and for us all,' the article concludes.

**Could Canada really become the 51st US state? Here’s what it would take**
President Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested that Canada should be the 51st U.S. state, but the process of adding a new state is complex and would require approval from Congress. According to Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution, Congress must approve the admission of a new state, and the president must sign the bill into law. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham joked that 'They skipped Canada. We'll fix that next time!' However, no major legislation is advancing that would extend an invitation to statehood to America's northern neighbor. Canada would have to hold a referendum to gauge voters' interests in joining the U.S. before the process could begin. If Canada were to join the U.S., its population of 41.6 million would make it the largest state, and it would get two senators and 55 House seats. This would profoundly affect U.S. elections, making Canada the presidential race's richest prize with 57 Electoral College delegates. Trump has also talked about adding other potential new states, including Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., but Republicans now control both chambers of Congress and are likely to oppose adding states that could be majority Democratic.

**Senate Democrats Protest Vought's Nomination, Citing History of Delaying Federal Aid**
Senate Democrats are planning a marathon of speeches to protest the nomination of Russ Vought for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Vought is expected to be confirmed on Thursday night, despite Democrats' concerns about his ties to the Project 2025 and his claims that the 2020 elections were 'rigged'. Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, highlighted Vought's history of delaying federal aid, including his role in blocking and delaying aid to Puerto Rico after the hurricanes Irma and María. Schumer stated, 'Russell Vought has a long history of slowing down or blocking federal funding for Americans in need. Even in the midst of unimaginable suffering after the disaster, Vought cruelly stopped and delayed billions of dollars in aid to his fellow citizens in Puerto Rico after the hurricanes Irma and María devastated the island. As a result, more people suffered, more died, and the recovery was severely delayed. This is not what we are as Americans, where we believe in taking care of our fellow citizens after a disaster. The confirmation of Vought, author of the extremist Plan 2025, in the OMB will mark the beginning of a golden era of incompetence, cruelty, and anarchy.' Between 2018 and 2020, Vought blocked the delivery of over $16 billion in aid to Puerto Rico, citing 'presumed corruption' and 'poor fiscal management'.
