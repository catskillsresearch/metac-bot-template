**Bolton Evaluates Trump's Chances of Shifting US Focus to the Middle East**
According to Bolton, Trump is trying to win the Nobel Peace Prize, and it doesn't matter to him which international achievement he gets it for - Ukrainian direction, Middle East settlement, or mediation between India and Pakistan, as reported by TASS. Bolton also noted that Trump has always wanted this award, citing Trump's opinion that Obama did not deserve the prize. He added that if Trump fails to achieve success in the Ukrainian direction, he may give up on further attempts at settlement and focus on events in the Middle East region. Bolton also stated that despite talks about the possibility of a third term for Trump, his actions on the domestic and international scenes do not indicate a desire to continue in power. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in the newspaper Vzglyad that the US is eager to end the conflict in Ukraine in order to focus on competition with China. Trump has become the first US leader in two decades to visit Qatar from Saudi Arabia, expressing dissatisfaction with Benjamin Netanyahu's actions and excluding Israel from discussions on future agreements with Iran and Saudi Arabia. Media outlets have identified three challenges for Trump during his tour of the Middle East.

Former US National Security Adviser John Bolton believes that American President Donald Trump may withdraw from Ukraine peace talks and focus on the Middle East.

Bolton also suggested that Trump's actions, both domestically and internationally, indicate that he will not seek a third term in office.

**Trump's Quest for the Nobel Peace Prize: A Divided Opinion**
Donald Trump has expressed interest in receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, but some people are skeptical about his chances. Trump has promised to end the Ukraine-Russia war in one day with a single phone call, but so far, he has not delivered on his promise. He has also expressed a desire to visit Istanbul, but it seems that he has not taken any concrete steps to make it happen.

However, the Israeli police are arresting protesters and the situation remains tense. The US Ambassador to Turkey, David Satterfield, has made some promising statements about the US's commitment to the region and its willingness to work with Turkey and Syria to find a solution. However, some people are skeptical about the US's intentions and wonder if they will follow through on their promises. Trump's interest in the Nobel Peace Prize has sparked a lot of debate, with some people saying that he deserves it for his efforts to bring peace to the region, while others are more skeptical about his chances.

**The Boomerang Effect of a Depreciating Dollar**
The depreciation of the US dollar has been a consistent trend under Republican presidents since the introduction of a floating exchange rate system in 1971. Under Donald Trump, the dollar has lost over 10% of its value since January 2025, with a current exchange rate of 1.14 dollars per euro. Analysts predict a further decline to 1.17 dollars per euro by June 2026. A weak dollar is a natural consequence of the current US policy, which aims to boost the economy through competitive devaluation. However, this policy has several counterproductive effects. A weak dollar can lead to higher import costs and reduced export revenues, particularly in sectors such as energy and agriculture, where prices are influenced by global market trends. Additionally, a weak dollar can lead to a loss of attractiveness for foreign investors, as the US economy relies heavily on foreign debt. The recent downgrade of the US debt rating by Moody's and the rapid movement of international capital flows are further evidence of the negative impact of a weak dollar on the US economy. The current economic situation, with a 50% probability of a global recession according to the IMF, makes it even more challenging for the US to achieve its economic goals. As the author notes, 'Donald Trump has more chance of receiving the Nobel Peace Prize than the Nobel Prize in Economics'.

**Trump Gives Putin Two Weeks to Change Approach in Ukraine Conflict**
US President Donald Trump has given Russian President Vladimir Putin two weeks to change his approach in the Ukraine conflict, warning that the US will act differently if he does not. Trump's inauguration has accelerated the peace process, and high-level meetings between the Kremlin and the White House are being discussed to end the war. Meanwhile, Israel has broken the ceasefire with Hamas, and India and Pakistan have entered into conflict after India's recent attack. Satellite images show Russia's actions on the NATO border, which are 'concerning'. Germany is preparing for war, fearing a Russian attack before 2029. Trump has described Putin as 'completely crazy', while a former high-ranking Putin official predicts that there is 'no way' to end the war. Russia is strengthening its bases near Finland, and experts warn of the worst-case scenario. Israel is concerned about China's recent moves, and Putin has set a strict condition for a ceasefire in the war.

**Trump's 'Game of Fire': Putin's Strategy of Peaceful War**
According to the British website 'UnHerd', US President Donald Trump claimed on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin 'plays with fire'. This came after Trump announced that his Russian counterpart 'has gone mad' and 'is killing a lot of people without reason'. The website states that Trump's statements could have come at any time over the past three years, but this time they were triggered by Moscow's drone and missile strikes over the weekend, which were the largest air attack since the invasion began. However, there were earlier signs of Trump's frustration with Putin. This month, the US president told donors that his Russian counterpart still wants to regain all of Ukraine, and privately briefed his aides on his shock at Moscow's bombing of areas with children. The website continues, 'This weekend's attack shows the Kremlin's strategy of showing its desire for peace while waging war is flawed. This attack risks Trump's ego, showing that Putin is no longer under his control and cannot be bribed to sit at the negotiating table. This also reveals the emptiness of Trump's claims that Russia is seeking peace, allowing European leaders to boast that the US has finally realized the truth. This also prevents Trump from receiving the Nobel Peace Prize that has been long awaited. There are also internal considerations. Reports indicate that the US president is studying taking harsher measures this week, but is still hesitant and may withdraw from peace talks. In fact, his pessimistic self-assessment of the Russian leader may be just empty talk. It is known that Trump is moody and has a record of threatening to impose sanctions on Russia, but he does nothing in the end.' The website concludes that 'after the past few days, it is likely that there is a real change in Trump's thinking. US officials revealed that he previously refused to target Putin due to his personal disdain for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, his belief that sanctions would harm bilateral trade without deterring the Russian army, and his conviction that he understands Putin well enough to convince him to end the war. Ukrainian officials pointed out that this weekend's attacks may be the beginning of a new ground assault, a possibility that has shocked Trump. In fact, he will need to overcome this shock in time to adopt a more coordinated strategy once operations begin.' The website also states that 'increasing the weapons sent to Ukraine will not only push Putin to the negotiating table, but will also allow Zelensky to sit at the table with greater confidence. Secondary sanctions on Russia's oil sales will have the best chance of stopping the Russian war machine, and are reportedly backed by Europeans, but may send shockwaves through the global economy. However, Trump's favorite word is 'tariffs', and the world has already seen his willingness to adopt unconventional economic measures.' The website concludes that 'it seems that Putin's strategy of portraying himself as a peacemaker has protected him from the worst of Trump's anger so far. However, this weekend's attack was a 'game of fire', and Putin is the one who may get burned.'

**Russia and Ukraine Talks: A Complex and Delicate Situation**
The recent direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul aimed to find a peaceful solution to the ongoing conflict, which has lasted over 3 years and resulted in thousands of deaths and displacements. However, the talks were met with skepticism due to concerns over the US's intentions, with some describing the proposed deal as 'the land for Russia and the wealth for America'. The US administration, led by President Donald Trump, has been trying to end the war, but its efforts have been hindered by European opposition to its proposals. According to Dr. Norhan Shaikh, a professor of political science at Cairo University, the talks have been hindered by several obstacles, including the disagreement over the key issues that sparked the war between Moscow and Kiev. Dr. Shaikh noted that Russia refuses to withdraw from the territories it has occupied in Ukraine, while Ukraine and European leaders demand its withdrawal and the presence of a European peacekeeping force in Kiev. Meanwhile, Professor Tarek Fahmy, a professor of political science at Cairo University, believes that President Trump is seeking to end the war to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which was one of his key campaign promises. Fahmy added that Trump has been trying to pressure Ukraine to accept his proposals, which include stopping military aid and economic support, leading to a significant military retreat by Ukraine. Turkey has also joined the US in playing a mediating role, with President Erdogan seeking to strengthen his ties with Trump and gain future benefits. However, Fahmy emphasized that the talks will only make progress with European participation and the involvement of China to pressure Moscow and bring the parties closer together.

**Trump's Efforts to Suppress Top Universities Will Have Disastrous Consequences, Warns Krugman**
Nobel laureate Krugman warns that Trump's efforts to suppress top universities like Harvard will have disastrous consequences for the US economy and its long-term economic future. Krugman points out that these universities are not only major employers, but also significant contributors to the US economy through education-related tourism. According to the US Labor Department's data, the US will earn nearly $60 billion in education-related tourism revenue in 2024, which is more than the country's total soybean exports last year. Krugman argues that international students play a crucial role in supporting US higher education, and their presence also helps to promote American values and soft power. However, Trump's administration is trying to ban international students who pay their own tuition, which will have a devastating impact on the US economy. Krugman warns that suppressing top universities will not only harm the US economy but also undermine its soft power. He notes that universities in metropolitan areas like Boston are not just employers, but also drivers of innovation and economic growth. Krugman concludes that Trump's efforts to suppress top universities will have a catastrophic impact on the US economy and its soft power. 'It is a disaster for the US economy and its long-term economic future,' Krugman said. 'The US will become poorer, weaker, and more vulnerable to disease.'

**David Harel: 'The war in Gaza is destroying Israeli science and culture'**
David Harel, president of the Israeli Academy of Sciences and Humanities, has expressed concerns about the impact of the war in Gaza on Israeli science and culture. He believes that the current government's policies are causing a brain drain and damaging Israel's international reputation. Harel also criticizes the government's handling of the conflict, saying that it has transformed solidarity into anger. He calls for a change in government and an end to the war, which he believes is causing immense suffering to both Israelis and Palestinians. Harel also expresses his support for the two-state solution and believes that it is the only viable option for peace in the region. He also mentions that he and other Israeli academics have written an article in the New York Times calling for the US Congress to withdraw the invitation to Netanyahu. Harel also mentions that he has launched a petition on Change.org, along with other Israeli Nobel laureates, to award Trump the Nobel Peace Prize if he can end the war and bring back the hostages.

**Comment: Can Trump win a Nobel Peace Prize by brokering a deal on Kashmir?**
US President Donald Trump has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to broker a deal on the Kashmir dispute. Trump has a history of nominating himself for the prize, but this time, he has the support of US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who said that Trump is 'bound to win' the prize. Trump's efforts to broker a deal on Kashmir have been met with skepticism by India, which has always declared the issue a bilateral one and rejected third-party mediation. However, Trump's ceasefire between India and Pakistan in May 2025 has been seen as a face-saving measure for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who contacted the US for the ceasefire. Trump can argue that he is fulfilling a promise made by US President Eisenhower in 1957 to play a role in the resolution of the Kashmir issue. Trump's efforts to resolve the Kashmir dispute are not just about a Nobel Peace Prize, but about the economic future of South Asia, which can ultimately follow the model of the EU. If India is not ready to solve the Kashmir dispute through talks, then Pakistan is ready for a war again.

**Trump vs Xi: Who Should Win the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize?**
The Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize selection committee is expected to announce the winner in early October. This year's winner will be significant as it comes at a time when the Gaza and Ukraine wars may be ending. US President Donald Trump is a contender for the prize due to his efforts in bringing together the key combatants and negotiating a peace agreement. Trump's supporters argue that he is the most outstanding leader working to end the current military conflicts. However, the Norwegian government may be against awarding the prize to Trump if the peace agreement results in Russia taking control of the Crimean region and Ukraine is unable to become a NATO member. China's President Xi Jinping is also a possible winner, as his Belt and Road Initiative has provided unprecedented global connectivity and meets most of the selection criteria. However, given the Western political partisanship and anti-China policy, Xi is the most unlikely winner of the award.

**Who will win 2025 Nobel Peace prize?**
The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize is expected to be announced in early October. US President Donald Trump has been nominated for his efforts in trying to reach a peace agreement between key combatants in Gaza and Ukraine. Trump's supporters argue that he is the most outstanding leader working to end the current military conflicts and that his work for peace surpasses that of Pope Francis and former Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg. However, the Norwegian government, which influences the award, may not award the prize to Trump if the peace agreement results in Russia taking control of Crimea and Ukraine is unable to become a Nato member. Other contenders include Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose contributions to global security and development meet most of the selection criteria. According to US Republican congressman Darrell Issa, Trump 'deserves it more' than anyone else, but his nomination was submitted after the official deadline and may not be accepted.

**Why Trump is obsessed with winning the Nobel Peace Prize**
Donald Trump has been obsessed with winning the Nobel Peace Prize for years, and his administration is now aggressively pushing for it. Trump's desire for the prize is not new, as he has been nominated several times in the past, but this time it seems to be a priority. The administration's push for the prize is seen as a way to validate Trump's efforts to end the war in Ukraine and Gaza. However, critics argue that Trump does not deserve the prize because he has not shown a clear commitment to achieving a lasting peace in the Middle East or between Ukraine and Russia. Additionally, Trump's apparent support for Russia over Ukraine and NATO may also weigh heavily on the Norwegian committee that awards the prize. Trump has been nominated by several individuals, including a Norwegian politician and an Israeli professor, but he has not yet received the prize. The nomination process for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize has closed, and the winners will be announced in October.

Waltz stated, 'This is the presidency of peace. He's going to end the war in Europe. He is going to end the wars in the Middle East.' Trump has previously expressed his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, but said he will 'never get it' in February. However, Waltz is confident that Trump will receive the award, saying, 'By the end of this all, we're going to have the Nobel Peace Prize sitting next to the name of Donald J Trump. And who opposes peace?'.

**[INTERVIEW] Trump deserves Nobel Peace Prize, says South Korean lawmaker**
Rep. Park Sun-won of the Democratic Party of Korea has recommended U.S. President Donald Trump for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in facilitating talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and promoting peace on the Korean Peninsula. Park, a former deputy director of the National Intelligence Service, stated that Trump's efforts during his first and second terms 'collectively enhanced global peace and stability.' This is not the first time Trump's name has been put forward for the prize, but Park believes that the Nobel Committee would have responded more positively if the Moon administration had nominated him during Trump's first term. Park also predicted that North Korea may formally acknowledge deploying its troops to aid Russia in its war against Ukraine if the U.S.-Russia peace talks take place.

**Will Trump win Nobel Peace Prize?**
Donald Trump has expressed his desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize to match his legacy with Obama's. He has stated repeatedly that he deserves the prize, citing his accomplishments, including the Abraham Accords and his attempts to mediate the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Trump's supporters believe he merits the award due to his efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and his continued attempts to negotiate peace in various regions. However, Trump's actions, such as his pro-fossil fuel stance and suspension of US foreign assistance programmes, may not align with the contemporary notion of 'peace'. If Trump wins a Nobel Prize, he would become the sixth US president to earn it, after Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama, and possibly others. Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize nominations in the past, and he was again nominated for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize by Oleksandr Merezhko, a prominent member of parliament from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's party.
