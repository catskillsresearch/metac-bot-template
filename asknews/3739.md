**Is intermittent fasting safe for everyone? Dietician explains who's most at risk**
Intermittent fasting may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with underlying health conditions like diabetes, according to Bhakti Samant, Chief Dietician at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital in Mumbai. While some studies show that intermittent fasting can lead to weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced inflammation, it may offer metabolic benefits to individuals with type 1 diabetes, but those with eating disorders, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and people with complex medical conditions should avoid it or proceed under strict medical supervision. Samant emphasized the importance of consulting a healthcare provider before starting any fasting regime, saying, 'The concept of intermittent fasting (IF) is simple- eat during specific windows of time and fast during the rest.'

**Expert Warns: Keto Diet May Cause Permanent Damage**
Dr. Kaya, in his new book 'Hayat Yeniden', warns about the potential dangers of various diets, including the keto diet. He stated, 'The keto diet may lead to rapid weight loss, but it is not sustainable. We should be aware that unscientific diets can have fatal consequences. Many popular diets are part of the commercial sector.' Dr. Kaya emphasizes that the 'Akdeniz Diyeti' (Mediterranean Diet) is the healthiest and most scientifically-backed diet. He cites a 25-year study published in Lancet Public Health, which found that a daily carbohydrate intake of 50% reduces the risk of death. Dr. Kaya warns, 'Low-carb, gluten-free, or keto diets exclude certain food groups, leaving people without essential nutrients. All research points to the Mediterranean diet as the healthiest and most undisputed diet.'

**Who Should Avoid Okroshka: A Doctor's Warning**
According to gastroenterologist Vladimir Neronov, okroshka can be both a beneficial summer dish and a source of digestive problems, depending on the ingredients and health status. 'Okroshka is a traditional cold dish, but it can trigger exacerbation of chronic diseases of the digestive system, especially the pancreas. It's better to consume it slightly chilled, not below 24-27 degrees. Ice-cold okroshka is too aggressive for the digestive system,' Neronov said. The most popular bases for the dish are kvass and kefir, but each variant has its pros and cons. 'During exacerbation of digestive diseases, it's better to abstain from okroshka. In normal times, don't overindulge: it's a cold dish, and it's best to eat hot food for lunch. It's optimal to alternate between kefir and kvass options based on the body's needs,' the doctor concluded. Sofia Kovanova, a dietitian and nutritionist, also shared her advice on how much ice cream can be safely consumed.

**Probiotics vs. Prebiotics: Secrets to a Balanced Gut, Better Digestion, and a Healthier, Happier You**
Probiotics and prebiotics are essential for maintaining a healthy gut microbiome. Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts, while prebiotics are specialized plant fibers that feed and sustain these beneficial bacteria. Fermented foods such as natto, coconut kefir, and miso are rich sources of probiotics, while prebiotic foods include garlic, onions, bananas, jicama, chicory root, and leafy green vegetables. A balanced diet that includes both probiotics and prebiotics is necessary for achieving optimal gut health, as it helps maintain a diverse and resilient gut microbiome that supports digestion, immunity, and overall well-being. As Riya Verma notes, 'Probiotics and prebiotics together form the foundation of a healthy gut microbiome.'

**The Ketogenic Diet: A Safe and Sustainable Choice?**
The Madrid Diabetes Association, which represents over 3,000 children, young people, and adults with diabetes, has investigated the safety and sustainability of the ketogenic diet. According to the experts, the diet was originally developed as a treatment for various neurodegenerative disorders, including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, due to its impact on metabolism, the association warns that this diet is not recommended for people with kidney failure, cardiovascular diseases, or those at risk of developing them. Additionally, it is not advised for pregnant or breastfeeding women. As the experts say, 'this diet is not a quick fix for weight loss, but rather a treatment that requires careful consideration and monitoring.'

**Ketogenic Diet: Safety and Sustainability**
The Asociación Diabetes Madrid, a non-profit organization for over 3,000 children, young people, and adults with diabetes, provides information on the safety and sustainability of the ketogenic diet. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the ketogenic diet is a 'type of diet rich in fats and poor in carbohydrates (sugars) that makes the body break down fats into molecules called ketones. Ketones circulate in the blood and become the main source of energy for many cells.' The Asociación Diabetes Madrid states that the ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that limits daily carbohydrate intake to less than 50 grams, mainly from vegetables. This diet was originally developed as a treatment for various neurodegenerative disorders, including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The mechanisms that may favor greater weight loss include increased satiety due to higher protein consumption, as well as regulation of grelin and leptin secretion, hormones responsible for appetite control. However, the Asociación Diabetes Madrid also recognizes that the ketogenic diet has significant adverse effects, including reduced bone density, which can lead to osteoporosis over time. Additionally, they warn about short-term side effects such as fatigue, dizziness, confusion, and constipation. They also note that this diet can lead to micronutrient deficiencies, as the drastic reduction in carbohydrates limits the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are primary sources of vitamins and minerals. This also negatively impacts fiber intake, leading to digestive problems such as constipation and polyuria. Another effect mentioned is bad breath due to the increase of ketone bodies in the body. Given its impact on metabolism, they advise against this diet for people with kidney insufficiency, cardiovascular diseases, or those at risk of developing them. They also advise against it for pregnant or breastfeeding women, as well as those with type 1 and 2 diabetes, due to the risk of hypoglycemia. Those with gallbladder problems or who have undergone its removal should also avoid it, as the ketogenic diet is based on a high-fat diet.

**Keto Diet: Benefits and Risks**
Dietitians have expressed concerns about the keto diet, which is a low-carb, high-fat diet that can be effective for weight loss but may be harmful to the thyroid and liver. According to Oleg Shvets, president of the Association of Dietitians of Ukraine, and dietitian Yevheniia Rozum, the diet can be beneficial for people with metabolic disorders, but it should be used under medical supervision and for a short period of time. They also warned that the diet can cause a range of negative side effects, including dizziness, weakness, and an increased risk of kidney and liver problems. Shvets emphasized the importance of consulting a doctor before starting the keto diet and monitoring calorie intake after returning to a normal diet. Rozum noted that the long-term effects of the keto diet are not yet fully understood and that it is essential to approach it with caution. The keto diet was originally developed in 1921 by American doctor Russell Wilder to treat epilepsy in children, and it has been used for this purpose ever since. However, its use for weight loss and other purposes has raised concerns about its safety and effectiveness.

**Does the Ketogenic Diet Promote Longevity? What Science Says**
The ketogenic diet (keto) has gained popularity for its benefits in weight loss, metabolic health, and cognitive function. Some scientists argue that nutritional ketosis mimics fasting, triggering pathways that enhance cellular repair, reduce inflammation, and extend lifespan. Research suggests that keto may activate longevity pathways similar to those seen in caloric restriction and fasting. Studies have shown that mice on a ketogenic diet lived 13% longer than those on a standard diet, with improved cognitive function. Human evidence is still emerging, but keto improves metabolic flexibility, reduces risk factors for diabetes, Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular disease, all of which contribute to a longer, healthier life. However, long-term adherence to keto may come with potential downsides, such as nutrient deficiencies, gut microbiome changes, and hormonal effects. To optimize keto for longevity, consider following a clean, whole-food keto approach, incorporating intermittent fasting, and cycling carbs occasionally. Monitor blood markers and prioritize protein intake to ensure long-term metabolic health.

**The Ketogenic Diet: Benefits, Risks, and Suitability**
The ketogenic diet has been a popular trend in the fitness and health industry for years. It is claimed to not only help with weight loss and improve physical performance, but also to improve mental clarity. However, how healthy and effective is the keto diet really? According to nutrition experts, the keto diet can have several benefits, but also some risks. Benefits include: faster fat loss, improved mental clarity, stable blood sugar levels, and reduced hunger. However, risks include: keto flu, potential nutrient deficiencies, and difficulty in implementing the diet in everyday life. The keto diet can be effective for weight loss, but it is not suitable for everyone and requires careful planning. It is also not a long-term solution for maintaining a healthy weight. A keto diet can be adapted to a plant-based diet, but the selection of suitable foods is limited. The keto diet is particularly suitable for people who want to quickly lose weight or change their metabolism, as well as for athletes who want to improve their endurance performance. However, it is not suitable for people with kidney or liver problems, or for those who need quick energy sources, such as sprinters. To check if you are in a state of ketosis, you can use various methods, including a blood test, urine test, or breath test. A more accurate, but expensive method is the blood test, while the urine test is a cheaper alternative. A further method is to rely on your feelings: if you feel energized, have less hunger, sleep well, and are focused, it is a sign that you are in ketosis. In conclusion, the keto diet can be a useful tool for weight loss and improving performance, but it requires careful implementation and is not suitable for everyone.

**The Ketogenic Diet: A Safe and Effective Way to Lose Weight?**
The ketogenic diet, also known as kethodiet, has been around for over a century and was originally used to treat epilepsy. The diet consists of a very low carbohydrate intake, with only 10% of daily calories coming from carbohydrates, 30-35% from protein, and 55-60% from fat. This is in contrast to a typical healthy diet, where carbohydrates make up 55-60% of daily calories. The diet has been popularized by Hollywood stars such as the Kardashian sisters, Rihanna, Halle Berry, and Megan Fox. However, according to Dr. Tatyana Solntseva, a dietitian and therapist, the diet has several negative consequences, including a lack of fiber, which can lead to digestive problems, and a potential increase in the risk of heart disease. The diet is also not recommended for people with diabetes, liver or kidney disease, or pregnant women. Dr. Solntseva recommends a balanced diet with moderate calorie restriction and increased physical activity as the most effective and safe way to lose weight.

**Keto or Paleo: Which Diet is More Beneficial for Health?**
According to U.S.News, a keto or paleo diet can be beneficial for health. A paleo diet focuses on consuming natural, nutrient-rich products, with a low carbohydrate and high protein intake. It allows for a wide variety of allowed products and encourages a holistic approach to wellness, including physical exercise, yoga, and meditation. A keto diet, on the other hand, aims to put the body into a state of ketosis, where fat becomes the primary source of energy instead of carbohydrates. To achieve this, a keto diet requires a specific balance of macronutrients, limiting starchy vegetables, most fruits, grains, added sugars, and most legumes. Both diets offer potential health benefits, but lack long-term studies to confirm their effectiveness. A paleo diet may provide more variety and encourage a sustainable lifestyle.

**The keto diet sounds appetising, but there are risks - here is what you need to know**
The keto diet, which involves consuming high amounts of fat and low amounts of carbohydrates, has been around since the 1920s and was originally recommended for reducing seizures in children. However, Dr Conor Kerley, founder and chief science officer at Phytaphix, notes that the diet can be difficult to sustain due to its stringent food restrictions and comes with potential risks such as calorie depletion, nutrient deficiencies, and negative effects on the heart. Dr Kerley warns that the high intake of fat, especially saturated fat, can lead to increased cholesterol levels and that the diet limits many foods with well-known health benefits such as wholegrains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits. New research suggests that the keto diet could put people at risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, and stroke. Dr Kerley recommends including nuts, seeds, and avocado as opposed to butter, cream, and fatty meats, and suggests that a small amount of ketosis can be induced through fasting. He advises seeking professional guidance and advice before committing to a new eating plan and making small changes that align with health goals.

**The Ketogenic Diet: Benefits, Risks, and Recommendations According to Experts**
The ketogenic diet has gained popularity as a strategy for weight loss, diabetes control, and epilepsy treatment. However, dietitian Amanda Beaver from Houston Methodist Hospital warns that 'there are different ways to follow a ketogenic diet that greatly affect its goodness or badness.' The diet reduces carbohydrates to less than 10% of daily caloric intake and increases fats between 70% and 90%. Beaver notes that 'healthy fats found in nuts, seeds, and olive oil can be very beneficial for heart health,' but consuming products like bacon, butter, and red meat 'can be very harmful to heart health.' The diet's effectiveness in weight loss is one of its main attractions, but Beaver explains that 'initially, the ketogenic diet will result in greater weight loss than other diets,' although its long-term effects are not always superior. For people with diabetes, this regimen can help reduce hemoglobin A1C, a blood glucose marker, but Beaver notes that 'there are much less restrictive diets that can achieve weight loss and reduce A1C.' Despite its benefits, the ketogenic diet is not easy to maintain, and Beaver warns that 'one of the main reasons why many health professionals do not recommend the ketogenic diet is that it is not a sustainable diet.' Its strict carbohydrate restriction can lead to abandonment and a rebound effect on weight, and it can also alter the relationship with food, generating the false perception that all carbohydrates are harmful.
