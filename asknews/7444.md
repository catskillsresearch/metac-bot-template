**'I think I've done enough': Musk says will cut back on political spending**
Elon Musk, the richest person in the world and a key financial supporter of President Donald Trump, announced that he will be spending 'a lot less' on political campaigns, citing that he 'think[s] I've done enough.' This reversal comes after Musk's tumultuous tenure as Trump's pick to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, which has fallen far short of its goals for reducing federal spending. Musk has scaled back his government role to spend more time at his businesses, including Tesla, which has seen intense blowback. Musk spent at least $250 million supporting Trump in the presidential campaign and suffered a public defeat in April after he became deeply involved in a Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign. Musk's statement marks a reversal of the course he had set during the 2024 campaign and immediately after.

**Elon Musk to slash political spending, hits snag for Republicans**
Elon Musk, the world's richest person and a key supporter of President Donald Trump, announced that he will be spending 'a lot less' on political campaigns, a decision that could be a setback for Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Musk made the statement during a Bloomberg forum in Doha, Qatar, citing his possible disenchantment with politics after his tumultuous tenure as Trump's pick to lead the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk has scaled back his government role to focus on his businesses, including Tesla, which have seen intense backlash. 'I think I've done enough,' Musk said when asked why he would be reducing his political spending. Musk spent at least $250 million supporting Trump in the 2024 presidential campaign and suffered a public defeat in April when his-backed groups lost a Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign. Musk's decision comes as he is focusing on new business opportunities, including a deal to host his Grok artificial intelligence chatbot on Microsoft's data centers.

**Musk claims he'll cut back on political spending**
Elon Musk, the richest person in the world and a key supporter of President Donald Trump, claimed he'll spend 'a lot less' on political campaigns, a reversal that could be a setback for Republicans ahead of next year's midterm elections. Musk made the statement during a Bloomberg forum in Doha, Qatar, citing that he 'think[s] I've done enough.' This marks a reversal of his previous stance during the 2024 campaign, when he was among the top political spenders. Musk spent at least $250 million supporting Trump in the presidential campaign and suffered a public defeat in April after he became involved in a Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign. Musk's statement comes as the 2026 midterm campaigns are just getting off the ground, and some candidates have not yet announced their candidacy for elections that remain 18 months away.

This decision comes after investors expressed concern over the decline in sales and stock prices following the boycott of Tesla vehicles in protest of Musk's involvement in government. Musk attempted to alleviate these concerns, saying, 'Sales are going well at this point.'

**Musk was once a political force on X. Now he's back to business.**
Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has shifted his focus away from politics and back to his business ventures. Since purchasing X (formerly Twitter) in October 2022, Musk used the platform to advocate for MAGA politics and government policy, but now he posts about space travel, electric vehicles, and artificial intelligence. According to a Washington Post analysis, in February, 51% of Musk's posts were about the U.S. government and politics, but in May, only 19% of his posts were about DOGE or American politics. Musk has announced that he will do 'a lot less' political spending in the future, after investing at least $288 million to elect Trump and other GOP candidates. Musk's return to his role as CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and other holdings has assuaged some previously skittish investors, with Tesla's stock rising since the company announced its earnings in late April.

**Elon Musk to Spend Less on Politics, 'He Has Done Enough'**
Elon Musk, the world's richest person, has announced that he plans to spend significantly less money on politics in the future, stating that 'he has done enough'. According to Musk, he sees no reason to continue investing in politics, although he did not specify why. This decision comes after Musk's involvement in several high-profile elections, including the 2024 US presidential election, where he spent nearly 3 billion SEK supporting Donald Trump and the Republican Party. Musk's recent lack of engagement in US politics is evident in Donald Trump's recent social media posts, where he has not mentioned Musk since April. Musk's decision to reduce his political spending may be related to his recent criticism as the leader of the Doge department, a controversial efficiency department.

**Elon Musk Announces Reduced Involvement in Politics**
Elon Musk, the world's richest man and largest donor to Donald Trump, has announced that he will dedicate 'much less time' to politics in the future, dealing a blow to Trump's supporters ahead of the 2024 midterm elections. Musk, who donated over $250 million to Trump's presidential campaign in 2024, stated that he had 'done enough' with his political donations. He also declared that he would 'considerably reduce' the time he dedicates to politics, adding that 'I don't see any reasons' to maintain the level of support he has given to conservative candidates in the past year. This announcement comes after Musk's last foray into electoral politics ended in defeat, with the candidate he backed for the Wisconsin Supreme Court losing 10 percentage points in April. Musk, whose popularity is lower than Trump's, according to polls, announced that he would distance himself from the Department of Efficiency and Governance, which he created, to focus on leading Tesla, whose sales have fallen due to protests against the public spending cuts initiative. Musk's decision is a significant blow to Trump's supporters, who had expected him to continue supporting the MAGA Republicans in the next electoral cycle.

**Elon Musk Remains World's Richest Person in 2025**
As of the end of April 2025, Elon Musk remains the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $335 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This is significantly higher than the net worth of other billionaires, such as Jeff Bezos ($209 billion) and Mark Zuckerberg ($195 billion). Forbes also estimates Musk's net worth to be $342 billion, keeping him at the top of the list of the world's richest people. Musk's wealth is largely driven by his stakes in Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. Although Tesla's stock has declined by 37% since the beginning of the year, the growth in value of SpaceX and other assets has helped to offset these losses. Musk has also announced plans to focus on leading Tesla, reducing his involvement in public affairs, which may positively impact investor confidence and further growth of his companies. In December 2024, Musk's net worth reached a record $500 billion, but it later decreased due to the decline in Tesla's stock. Since the beginning of 2025, Musk has lost approximately $134.7 billion. However, thanks to the growth in value of SpaceX and other assets, his net worth has again exceeded $300 billion. As a result, Musk continues to hold the position of the world's richest person, despite market fluctuations and political challenges.

**Elon Musk loses £6.1bn in a day - still world's richest person by £137bn**
Elon Musk lost £6.1 billion in a day, but remains the world's richest person by £137 billion. The loss came after Tesla reported its biggest sales drop ever, falling 13% in the first quarter, with 50,000 fewer vehicles delivered compared to the same period last year. Early Tesla investor Ross Gerber described the numbers as 'sucking', stating that 'the brand is broken and may not be fixable'. Musk's net worth peaked at around £304 billion in December 2024, making him the first person to reach that milestone.

The United States has the most billionaires, with 902 individuals having a combined net worth of $6.75 trillion. According to White House sources, Elon Musk is expected to leave his role as the head of the US's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) at the end of May. 'He's really intelligent, and he's done a terrific job. I adore smart people. I like intelligent folks. Elon will eventually want to return to his company,' President Donald Trump stated. However, earlier this year, Musk's net worth dropped by KSh 16.9 trillion due to Tesla's stocks falling 27% from its December 2024 peak and 13.4% since the start of 2025.

The Hurun Global Rich List 2025 has been released, featuring 284 billionaires with a total wealth of 9.8 trillion rupees. The list includes 13 new Indian billionaires, with 175 billionaires seeing an increase in their wealth and 109 seeing a decrease. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has maintained his position as the world's richest person for the fourth consecutive year, with an 82% increase in his net worth to $189 billion. Amazon's Jeff Bezos is in second place with a 44% increase in his net worth to $81 billion. In India, Mukesh Ambani is the richest person with a total wealth of 8.6 trillion rupees, but has seen a decline of around $15 billion in his wealth since last year. Gautam Adani is in second place in India, with a 13% increase in his wealth to 8.4 trillion rupees. According to the report, Ambani is the 17th richest person in the world with a total wealth of $100 billion, while Adani is in 18th place. The report attributes Ambani's decline in wealth to debt, reduced demand in several sectors, and increased competition in the market, which has affected the performance of Reliance's stocks. As of December 2024, Reliance Industries has a debt of 3.50 trillion rupees.
