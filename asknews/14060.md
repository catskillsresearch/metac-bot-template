**Musk: Chances of Starship Flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50**
Elon Musk said that the chances of Starship flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50. The spacecraft has already completed nine test flights, with the last one taking place on May 27. However, the mission ended in an emergency due to a fuel leak. The previous flights in January and March also ended in failure, with the spacecraft exploding within the first 10 minutes of flight. Despite this, Musk is optimistic about the progress made and believes that the data collected will help improve the spacecraft. The next version of Starship, Version 3, is expected to be 124.4 meters tall and will be capable of flying to Mars. The spacecraft will be reusable and will have a refueling system on orbit, which is necessary for long-distance space travel. The first flight of this version is planned for the end of this year, and if successful, Starship may fly to Mars as early as next year. SpaceX plans to send five Starship Version 3 spacecraft to Mars in 2026 to test the spacecraft and its technologies. However, Musk believes that it will be challenging to achieve this goal, citing the need to master the refueling of Starship in space as the main problem. He estimates the chances of success as 50/50. If successful, SpaceX plans to send around 20 spacecraft to Mars in 2028-2029, which may be crewed. However, Musk also suggests that two robotic landings may be conducted before sending humans. The final decision will be made later. In the third launch window (2030-2031), up to 100 Starship spacecraft may be sent to Mars, and in the next window (2033), up to 500. SpaceX is currently searching for a suitable location for a Martian city, which should be relatively far from the poles, have access to water ice, and have a flat surface for landings and takeoffs. The main candidate is the Arcadia Planitia region. The ultimate goal is to create a self-sufficient settlement on Mars with a population of over a million people, which will require transporting millions of tons of cargo. According to Musk, the construction and maintenance of such a city will be carried out using Starship, possibly its future 142-meter version. During periods of Earth-Mars alignment, thousands of upper stages of the spacecraft will be able to arrive and depart.

**The moon: Why we want to go back**
NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole, called Artemis Base Camp, and launch a new space station, Gateway, into the moon's orbit. A joint China-Russia project, the International Lunar Research Station, also plans to build a moon base by 2035. The moon's resources, including water, regolith, and helium-3, make it an attractive destination for future space missions. These resources can be used to sustain lunar bases, extract minerals from asteroids, and even provide fuel for nuclear fusion power. The moon's distance from Earth also makes it an ideal location for testing technologies and equipment for future Mars missions. According to Sara Pastor, ESA's Lunar and Gateway Program Manager, 'Humans have had a continued presence in space for the past 20 years aboard the International Space Station. But the ISS is only 250 miles away in low-Earth orbit, which is as little as four hours after launching from Earth. The moon is 250,000 miles away -- about three days' spaceflight -- and a far riskier journey for astronauts.' The first research on the moon aims to make that journey safer and easier, and to determine how human activity affects the lunar environment. 'ESA is developing instruments for radiation environment measurements, drilling and in-situ sample analysis, geophysics and lunar space weather,' Pastor said. The long-term goal of building surface and orbital moon bases is to serve as a staging post for more distant space travel, and to provide a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration, as Pastor noted, 'A colony on the moon will be extremely useful and a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration.'

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**Historic Sites on the Moon: Protecting Them Before It's Too Late**
The World Monuments Fund (WMF) has added the Moon to its 'Watch 2025' list, a selection of the world's most endangered sites. This move aims to raise awareness about the need to protect the first signs of space exploration, from the iconic Apollo 11 site to new missions that often leave behind mechanical remains and valuable equipment for future studies. Jonathan Bell, WMF vice president, compares the situation to the Antarctic Treaty, which protects historic sites in extreme environments. 'It's time to develop similar policies for the Moon, considering past missions as part of humanity's collective heritage,' he says. Justin Holcomb, a geologist at the University of Kansas, notes that it's now possible to speak of a 'Lunar Anthropocene.' Human activity has left a tangible mark on the Moon, including astronaut footprints and technological fragments left during landings. 'Recent missions like Firefly or Intuitive Machines are creating new archaeological sites, and this requires awareness and responsibility,' Holcomb says.

**Elon Musk targets 2026 for first space mission to Mars**
Elon Musk aims to launch the first space mission to Mars by the end of 2026, but acknowledges that overcoming technological hurdles, particularly in-orbit refueling, is crucial for the long journey. A favorable planetary alignment in late 2026 provides a unique opportunity for a relatively short transit between Earth and Mars. If Starship is not ready by then, a new mission in 2028 would be targeted. The first mission would consist of -built Optimus humanoid robots. Despite failed test flights, including a fuel leak and uncontrolled spinning on the ninth test flight, Musk remains optimistic, citing each failure as valuable data for accelerated testing. NASA relies on Starship for its Artemis program, which aims to send astronauts to the moon as early as 2027, a stepping stone to possible human missions to Mars in the 2030s. Musk's ultimate vision is to launch up to 2,000 Starships every two years to establish a permanent and self-sustaining human settlement on Mars.

**Musk retains plan to fly Starship to Mars in 2026 despite setbacks**
Elon Musk has reaffirmed his plan to send Starship to Mars in 2026, despite recent setbacks in test flights. Musk stated that the success of this mission depends on Starship's ability to accomplish several challenging technical feats, including a post-launch refueling manoeuvre in earth orbit. He gave SpaceX a 50% chance of meeting the deadline. If not, the company will wait two years before trying again. Musk envisions launching 1,000 to 2,000 ships to Mars every two years to establish a self-sustaining human settlement. NASA plans to return humans to the moon aboard Starship in 2027, with the goal of launching astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. Musk has previously aimed to send an uncrewed vehicle to Mars by 2018 and a crewed mission by 2024, but has since pushed back the timeline.

**3.7 Billion-Year-Old Organic Molecules on Mars: A Step Towards a New Era of Life?**
NASA and private space companies are in a priority race, while organic molecules discovered on Mars have caused excitement in the scientific community. Andy Weir's 'The Martian' novel and film, which has become a reality, is a step-by-step process. What does this mean for humanity and our world? In recent years, Mars has become the biggest excitement for the scientific community and space enthusiasts. Mars, being a neighbor to Earth, has a potential for new life and exploration. Searching for life signs on Mars, solving the planet's past climate, and establishing permanent settlements, are considered important milestones for humanity's future in space. The Martian film, which was adapted to the big screen in 2015, detailed and realistically portrayed NASA's plans to send humans to Mars by 2035. The film tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, who is left behind on Mars after a storm and must survive with limited resources. NASA also makes a great effort to rescue him. The Martian has turned into a reality. In the US, there is a debate about whether Mars or the Moon should be prioritized. Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman thinks that Mars should be prioritized. However, Elon Musk's priority is also Mars, but he has been criticized for his approach. China's increasing activity on the Moon is also affecting the US's strategic decisions. Trump and Musk's priority on Mars can be interpreted as follows: 'Mars, although it seems like both of their priorities, has not been left out of the equation. Ultimately, Mars is a difficult road, and the Moon is an important station. It's a destination, as well as a stopover.' 'Of course, Mars is much more important and has a much greater return. Both scientifically and technologically, Mars travel requires significant investments. The work done will result in technologies that can be adapted to daily life on Earth, changing our lives in different forms.' 'Even if humans are not on Mars by 2031, they will be very close to it in the 2030s.' Elon Musk has announced that he will send an 'unmanned' spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026 and that humans can go to Mars by 2031. Do you think humanity is close to achieving this goal? 'Because this work has long exceeded the realm of imagination. This process can be described as 'a very ambitious goal.' The fact that large companies are investing so much in this indicates that they have significant commercial expectations. The timeline may be a bit behind schedule. Humans may not be on Mars by 2031, but they will be very close to it in the late 2030s.' 'The fact that Mars has signs of past life, which may indicate that the necessary conditions for life exist there, is a significant discovery.' Sabancı University Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Astrofysics Professor Ersin Göğüş recently discovered large organic molecules on Mars. This has raised questions about biological activity on Mars. The molecules found on Mars are similar to those produced by life on Earth and have remained intact for approximately 3.7 billion years without being affected by geological activity, moisture, or heat. This suggests that the molecules on Mars are as old as life on Earth. What does this mean? Can Mars give us clues about our world's past and future? 'Of course, it can.' 'We know that the first signs of life appeared on Mars and Earth around the same time, approximately 4 billion years ago. We also know that Mars lost its atmosphere due to extreme solar winds, which could have led to the end of life. Although this is not a risk for Earth, humanity's excessive use of the planet could have negative consequences.' 'The Mars mission is motivating the development of new technologies.' Some people criticize the billions of dollars spent on sending humans to Mars, saying that 'it's a luxury to invest in space while solving problems on Earth.' Do you think this criticism is justified?

**Mars Settlement: A Step Closer to Reality**
According to Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, the first human landing on Mars is likely to occur in the late 2030s or early 2040s. NASA has also announced plans to send three manned missions to Mars by 2035, with the goal of developing systems that allow astronauts to return safely to Earth. Engineers and scientists are working on designing advanced technologies that will enable humans to live and work on Mars for extended periods. Mars is not just a distant goal for human settlement, but also a potential site for life, and studying the planet could provide new insights into the history of Earth. The exploration of Mars is expected to drive the development of advanced space technologies, similar to those developed during the moon landing missions, and could enable humanity to expand its presence in space. However, Shkaplerov notes that humans need to be properly equipped with protective gear and equipment to survive in space, saying, 'A person cannot stay in space without a spacesuit and special equipment... this is essential for ensuring their safety.'

**Russia and China to Build Autonomous Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon**
Russia and China have signed an agreement to build an autonomous nuclear power plant on the Moon. The plant will be constructed without human presence. The Moon is expected to host a lot of activity in the coming years, with multiple projects aiming to return humans to its surface. The NASA plans to establish a human settlement on the Moon by 2040, but Russia and China are also working on their own International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). The ILRS will be powered by a nuclear power plant, which will be built using autonomous construction methods. According to Roscosmos director Iouri Borissov, the construction will be done 'de manière autonome', but the technical details are not yet clear. The ILRS is expected to be completed by 2036 and will be used for fundamental space research and testing of long-term operations without human presence. Currently, 17 countries are participating in its construction, with China responsible for the foundations during the Chang'e-8 mission in 2028.

**Elon Musk's Plan for a Human Settlement on Mars: An 'Insurance Policy for Humanity'**
Elon Musk has reiterated that Mars is the salvation for the human species, calling it an 'insurance policy for humanity'. He made this statement during an interview on Fox News, emphasizing the need for a self-sufficient and sustainable human settlement on the red planet. Musk believes that Earth will not be habitable forever due to the Sun's expansion, which will eventually engulf our planet. According to NASA data, the Sun has approximately 5 billion years of life left, but its expansion will eventually consume everything around it, including Earth. 'The Sun is slowly expanding. Eventually, life on Earth will be wiped out', Musk said. 'To ensure the continuity of life, we must become a multi-planetary civilization'. Musk's plan is to build a city on Mars that can survive without Earth's aid, highlighting the importance of becoming independent from our home planet. He has previously stated that the Starship rocket could launch as early as 2026, carrying the Optimus robot, and potentially leading to a human landing on Mars by 2029 or 2031, depending on the success of the test missions.

**Elon Musk's Vision for a Multi-Planetary Species: A 'Seguro de Vida' for the Collective Life**
Elon Musk has reiterated his vision of making humanity a multi-planetary species, citing the 450 million-year window before the Sun makes life on Earth impossible. Musk's justification for colonizing Mars has evolved over time, from a 'base autosostenible' as a refuge from immediate threats to a 'seguro de vida' for the collective life. He believes that 'eventually all life on Earth will be destroyed by the Sun' as it 'is expanding gradually'. According to Musk, there are approximately 450 million years before the Earth 'will be so hot that life will be impossible'. Despite this distant timeline, Musk sees it as a reason to start developing a multi-planetary civilization now. Musk's vision for Mars is not just about landing and planting flags, but creating a self-sustaining city that can 'grow on its own if the supply ships from Earth stop coming for any reason'. This self-sufficiency is the real challenge, as Musk emphasizes that 'if the supply ships are necessary for Mars to survive, then we haven't created a life insurance for collective life'. The vehicle for this ambition is Starship, the reusable megacraft that Musk believes will make Martian settlement economically viable. However, the project faces significant technical challenges. Musk's predictions have been adjusted, and he now expects a possible uncrewed landing in 2026, with human presence before 2030, which many experts consider overly optimistic. The scientific community is not aligned with Musk's apocalyptic vision of the end of life on Earth, and some experts question the need for a Martian colony as a solution to long-term threats.

**China and Russia Plan to Build Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon**
According to a report by the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA), China and Russia are planning to build a nuclear power plant on the surface of the moon as part of their International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) project. The goal is to establish a human settlement on the moon in the future. Since solar panels cannot provide enough power for a lunar base, nuclear energy is a viable option. Russian National Space Group President Borisov confirmed the plan, stating that Russia and China have been jointly conducting lunar research and that Moscow can utilize its expertise in 'nuclear space energy' to contribute to the project. Borisov said, 'We are seriously considering a project to transport and install a power source on the lunar surface around 2033-2035 with our Chinese partners.' He emphasized that solar panels cannot provide enough power for a future lunar settlement, but nuclear energy can. This ambitious plan is a significant challenge, but it also represents a new stage in humanity's exploration and development of space. If successful, it will have a profound impact on human scientific development and social economic progress.

**The Moon Village: A Sustainable Future for Humanity**
Experts say that this project has the potential to create a sustainable living space using the regolith (Ay toprağı) on the Moon. The project, part of the Artemis program, could enable humanity to take a step towards a permanent future in space. At the heart of the project is the Olympus 3D printing system developed by the Texas-based ICON company, which is supported by NASA's $57.2 million investment. This technology plans to melt the regolith material on the Moon's surface to build landing pads, roads, and habitats. According to Ballard, 'I love the idea of astronauts building walls on the Moon one day. This is not just a structure for humans, but the beginning of a new way of life.' The construction on the Moon could start with the first test in 2026. Scientific studies are providing data supporting the idea of a Moon village. A study published in the Progress in Aerospace Sciences journal in 2023 found that the Moon's low gravity and local resources make it possible to build using 3D printers. 'We are getting a material similar to concrete by processing the regolith. This is the key to building a village from scratch on the Moon,' said Chiang. 'This technology is laying the foundation for sustainable life in space. The Moon village could be the first stop on the journey to Mars,' Chiang added. The project also highlights the use of robotic systems. '3D printers and autonomous robots will work on the Moon without human intervention. This increases security and reduces costs,' Skonieczny said. NASA is preparing to test these systems in 2024 by simulating Moon conditions in a test facility in Huntsville. UNESCO's science advisor Dr. Mechtild Rössler emphasized the significance of the project for humanity: 'The Moon village is not just a technological achievement, but a symbol of humanity's will to live together in space. This is a legacy for future generations.' Rössler also noted that the project could open doors for tourism and scientific research. The Moon village is preparing the first infrastructure for the astronauts who will return to the Moon in 2025 as part of the Artemis III mission. NASA's goal is to establish a fully functional settlement by 2040. The equipment and ICON's 3D printers, which will be transported by SpaceX's Starship rockets, are ready to turn this dream into reality. The rising structures on the Moon will prove that humanity belongs not only to Earth, but to the stars as well.

**China's Ambitious Plan to Establish a Human Settlement on the Moon**
China is working on a comprehensive plan to establish a human settlement on the Moon by 2035. To make this goal more feasible, researchers are experimenting with producing building materials, such as bricks, from lunar dust. According to Huo Jun, a researcher at the Chinese Space Agency, using local resources would be 'definitely easier and more economical' than transporting materials from Earth. The Moon's dust is believed to be a suitable material for building, and robots will eventually be used to press the bricks from the dust. China's long-term goal is to use the Moon as a stepping stone for missions to Mars. The country has made significant progress in space exploration in recent years, including landing on the far side of the Moon and establishing a space station. The US is also planning to establish a lunar base, and Andrew Jones, a space journalist, believes that China's success in building a lunar base could give it an advantage over the US in setting the rules for future space exploration.

**Elon Musk's Ambitious Plan to Establish a Sustainable City on Mars**
Elon Musk plans to establish a sustainable city on Mars, not just for humans, but for the survival of the human species in case of a catastrophe or disaster. SpaceX is working on building a reusable rocket, the Starship, which will be used to transport humans to Mars. Musk estimates that the first colonies will be established on Mars within 20 years, and that it will take 1,000 Starship rockets and 20 years of continuous missions to transport humans to the planet. The city on Mars is expected to have a population of one million people and will be self-sustaining. Musk believes that it is essential for humanity to become a multi-planetary species to ensure its survival. He also mentions that other planets, such as Venus, the Moon, and the gas giants, are not suitable for human habitation due to their extreme conditions. Mars, on the other hand, has a relatively stable environment and is considered an ideal candidate for human settlement. Musk predicts that the city on Mars could be established as early as 2050, with the first launch window opening in 2028. He also mentions that the Starship rocket has already completed three orbital test flights and is expected to achieve a 90% success rate in recovering the first stage of the rocket using the Mechazilla tower.
