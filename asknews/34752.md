**2024 warmest or second-warmest year on record for Africa: State of Climate in Africa**
The World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) State of Climate in Africa 2024 report reveals that 2024 was the warmest or second-warmest year on record for Africa, with devastating floods, droughts, and marine heat waves. The report attributes the warming to the El Niño event of 2023-2024, global warming, and climate change. The average annual surface temperature across Africa was 0.86°C above the 1991-2020 average, with the strongest warming in North Africa, which was 1.28°C above the average. Extreme temperatures impacted agriculture and livelihoods in many parts of Africa, with record-breaking temperatures in North Africa and unprecedented heat waves in Sudan and Somalia. Sea surface temperatures were also record high, with almost the entire ocean area around Africa under marine heat waves of 'strong, severe, or extreme intensity'. Many African countries suffered from either excessive rainfall or lack of rainfall, leading to crippling floods in some regions and debilitating droughts in others. The report highlights the need for better forecasts and early warnings to build resilience and strengthen adaptation efforts in Africa.

**Weather Models Predict Extreme Summer 2025: Heatwave or Floods?**
Two leading weather models, the European ECMWF and the American NOAA-CFS, are predicting a summer of extremes for 2025, with dramatic consequences for the environment and human health. The ECMWF model forecasts a hot and dry summer, similar to 2018 or 2022, while the CFS model predicts a warm and wet summer, with tropical rainfall amounts that could lead to catastrophic flash floods. According to meteorologist Dominik Jung, the extreme scenarios can be explained by the different weather patterns. The ECMWF model shows a persistent high-pressure system over Central Europe, blocking low-pressure systems and leading to heat and drought. In contrast, the CFS model indicates an active westerly flow with warm and humid subtropical air, leading to a wet and stormy summer. Jung notes that the current data suggests that the jet stream plays a crucial role in determining the weather pattern, with a stable jet stream leading to heat and drought, and a meandering or sinking jet stream leading to heavy rainfall and flash floods. Both scenarios have their merits, with the ECMWF model predicting a 55-60% chance of a hot and dry summer, and the CFS model predicting a 35-40% chance of a warm and wet summer. A 'normal' summer is now unlikely, with less than 10% chance. Regardless of the outcome, both scenarios will have a significant impact on humans, agriculture, and infrastructure, with heat stressing the cardiovascular system and tropical rainfall increasing the risk of flooding, as seen in the 2021 Ahr Valley disaster.

**ECMWF Model Predicts a 'Höllensommer' for Germany in 2025**
According to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model, Germany is expected to experience an extremely hot and dry summer in 2025. The model predicts a high likelihood of hot and dry days, with some areas already showing signs of drought despite the summer not having begun yet. If the model's predictions are correct, it could lead to one of the hottest summers in decades, potentially defining the term 'Höllensommer' (Hell Summer) for Germany. Dominik Jung, a meteorologist, notes that the term 'Höllensommer' is not clearly defined, but typically refers to a combination of prolonged heat, extreme dryness, and tropical nights. While it is still uncertain whether the predicted scenario will occur, the ECMWF model suggests that it is at least possible.

**Europe Faces Severe Drought with Start of Summer 2025**
Europe is facing a severe drought with the start of summer 2025, with a gradual deterioration in the climate scenario since the beginning of 2025. The report 'Drought in Europe 2025' warns of a critical situation affecting various sectors: from agriculture and biodiversity to inland navigation and energy production. During the first three months of the year, Europe recorded higher-than-average temperatures, particularly in regions such as the Alps, eastern Europe, and northern Scandinavian countries, where temperatures rose by more than 3 degrees Celsius above natural levels. This thermal anomaly coincided with a significant decrease in rainfall, leading to a worrying decline in soil moisture and a rapid loss of water reserves. According to the Copernicus European Observatory, global temperatures remained high in April, continuing a unprecedented heat wave that has lasted for nearly two years worldwide, prompting scientists to question the speed of global warming. Samantha Berge, Director of the Copernicus Climate Program, said in a statement, 'April 2025 was the second hottest April on record, continuing a long series of months that have exceeded pre-industrial reference levels by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.' Berge noted that Europe experienced widespread flooding in 2024, the largest since 2013. The heat wave has also affected the world's oceans, with the average sea temperature reaching 20.96 degrees Celsius in March, making it the second warmest March on record. The sea ice is also at record levels, but decreasing, whether in the Arctic or Antarctic. For March, the sea ice in the Arctic was at its lowest level since 47 years of satellite records, 6% below average. The Rhine River, a key element of the economy and logistics services in central Europe, is one of the most representative cases. In Cologne, a level of only 1.54 meters was recorded on April 12, 2025, half the usual level at this time of the year, and this sharp decline in river flow has already had consequences for inland navigation, particularly in the upper and middle Rhine basins, hindering the transportation of goods and increasing logistics costs. In addition to the Rhine, there are other major European rivers showing signs of depletion, and Copernicus maps show that large areas of northern Europe, as well as parts of western Alps, western Russia, and eastern Mediterranean, are highly exposed to the risk of drought. In March 2025, Germany recorded the driest March on record, while regions such as northern Germany, Benelux, Denmark, southern Scandinavia, the UK, and Ireland experienced worrying drought conditions. South Ukraine, central and eastern Turkey, and northwestern Europe are also severely affected by the lack of rainfall. Despite some southern regions, such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of France, experiencing a wetter winter and spring, heavy rainfall has caused structural damage, fatalities, and damage to crops, indicating that climate change is generating severe drought and extreme weather events in short periods. The depletion of soil moisture is already having a negative impact on crop yields in many areas. Although the vegetation cover seemed to be in good condition at the end of March, especially in northern Europe, scientists warn that this early growth may be misleading, and if the drought continues, plants may face severe pressure during the growth phase, leading to reduced crop yields and impacts on natural ecosystems. Low river levels also affect hydroelectric power generation, which is essential in many European countries. In addition, major infrastructure such as ports, canals, and dams may require operational adjustments due to the lack of water flow, increasing the risk of forest fires, pests, and soil erosion.

**2024 Sets Record for Global Heat, Researchers Explore Solar Radiation Management**
2024 was the hottest year on record globally, with CO2 emissions continuing to rise and the impacts of climate change becoming increasingly evident. Despite the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C seeming increasingly unattainable, researchers are exploring the possibility of using 'Solar Radiation Management' (SRM) technologies to reflect sunlight back into space. SRM technologies, such as injecting aerosols into the stratosphere or brightening marine clouds, could potentially reduce global temperatures, but critics argue that they do not address the root causes of climate change and may have unintended consequences. The Swiss government has proposed a resolution at the UN Environment Assembly to create a group of experts to evaluate the risks and benefits of SRM, but it was withdrawn due to lack of consensus. The Swiss government does not actively adopt SRM in its national climate policy, but works internationally to provide access to existing information on risks and impacts. 'We need to study these technologies, including their potential negative effects, if we decide they are necessary,' says Claudia Wieners, a professor of climate physics at the University of Utrecht.

**'Striking': Global oceans are warming fastest in two specific regions - The Weather Network**
A recent study found that the world's oceans are warming at the fastest rate in two specific regions. According to the study, published in the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate, global sea surface temperatures reached record highs in 2023 and into 2024. The researchers analyzed ocean heat content (OHC) between 2000 and 2023, comparing it to baseline temperatures measured between 2000 and 2004. The results were described as 'striking' by the scientists, who found that these waters are warming faster than others. Abnormally warm waters in the Atlantic have driven active hurricane seasons for the past several years.

**Mapped: The World's Record Heat Waves**
Extreme heat waves are becoming more frequent, intense, and widespread across the world, with temperatures reaching record highs in various countries. According to NASA, there is 'unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate.' In April 2024, temperatures in Jaipur, India, and Shaheed Benazirabad, Pakistan, reached 44°C and 50°C, respectively. The Copernicus Earth Observation Program confirmed that July 22, 2024, was the hottest global average daily temperature on record, at 17.16°C. Countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar, Australia, and Uruguay have set new national heat records in the past six years, with temperatures reaching up to 48.2°C and 50.7°C. Even Antarctica experienced temperatures above 18°C in 2020, and Europe has seen repeated summer heatwaves break long-standing records.

**2025 May Be One of the Warmest Years in Recorded History, Says Russian Meteorologist**
Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, has predicted that 2025 may be one of the five warmest years in recorded history. According to Vilfand, global temperatures continue to rise due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, and the high temperature of the ocean also contributes to the warming of the atmosphere. 'There is a probability that 2025 will enter the top five warmest years,' Vilfand emphasized. He also noted that the exact ranking of 2025 among the record-breaking years will be determined in the second half of the year. Additionally, Vilfand warned Moscow residents of 'temperature fluctuations' during the day and night.

**Scientists predict 2025 will be the hottest year on record - Khaama Press**
Scientists predict that 2025 will be the hottest year on record, according to a report by 'New Scientist' magazine. January 2025 was the warmest January ever recorded, with temperatures 1.75°C higher than the average from 1850 to 1900. Climatic scientists had expected the trend of global warming to subside in 2025, but instead, global temperatures have continued to rise. Scientists warn that this unprecedented rise in global temperatures is alarming and emphasize the need to combat global warming. As the world faces increasingly severe environmental, social, and economic consequences, scientists and policymakers must work together to mitigate the impact of climate change and take immediate steps to reduce global warming, as stated by scientists. 'The continuing rise in global temperatures highlights the urgent need for effective climate action,' they said.

**January 2025: The Warmest Month Ever Recorded**
According to a climate report, January 2025 was the warmest month ever recorded, with a global temperature of 13.23 degrees Celsius, 1.75 degrees above the pre-industrial average for the month. This is despite La-Niña conditions in the tropical Pacific, which would normally have a cooling effect on global temperatures. Samantha Burgess from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), which operates the climate monitoring service, said, 'The January 2025 is another surprising month, continuing the record temperatures observed over the past two years.' The data is based on billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft, and weather stations around the world.

**January 2025 Sets Record for Warmest Global Temperature Ever Recorded**
January 2025 has broken the record for the warmest global temperature ever recorded, surpassing the previous record set in 2024. This is despite the presence of La Niña conditions in the tropical Pacific, which typically lead to a slight decrease in global temperatures. The average global temperature in January 2025 was 1.75C above preindustrial levels, according to the ERA5 dataset from Copernicus/ECMWF. Experts are still analyzing the factors that caused this thermal anomaly, including the possible influence of ocean warming, which has been occurring in recent years. The reduction of sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctica may also be accelerating the warming process. The evolution of global temperatures after the peak of the 2023 El Niño event shows an atypical behavior, with temperatures currently at the upper end of the historical range, even after adjusting for accelerated trends over the past 20 years. This phenomenon suggests that underlying climate mechanisms may be undergoing structural changes, making predictions more uncertain. Models indicate that the Earth may experience a decrease in temperatures in February as the Northern Hemisphere enters a more intense seasonal cooling phase. However, the occurrence of such a prominent record at the beginning of the year raises concerns about the possibility of 2025 being one of the three warmest years on record, contrary to initial predictions. Experts from the UK Met Office, NASA, Berkeley Earth, and Carbon Brief have been projecting global temperatures for 2025 using various climate models and comparing them to historical averages. While none of these projections anticipated a record in January, the new data are being incorporated into updated models that may provide a clearer picture of what to expect in the coming months.

**January 2025 Sets New Record as Warmest Month on Record**
January 2025 has set a new record as the warmest month on record globally, with a global average temperature of 13.23 °C, surpassing the reference average of 12.44 °C for this month from 1991-2020. This temperature also exceeded the pre-industrial values by 1.75 °C, according to data published in the Copernicus climate bulletin. This is the 18th consecutive month of temperatures above 1.5 °C above the pre-industrial average, a limit marked in the Paris Agreement. The past year has seen a global average temperature of 0.73 °C above the 1991-2020 average, and 1.61 °C above the estimated average of 1850-1900. These data come after a 2024 that was the warmest year on record globally, with a global average temperature of 1.75 °C above the 1.5 °C threshold of the Paris Agreement. The start of 2025 continues the trend of extreme temperatures, despite the onset of the La Niña phenomenon, which usually causes a temporary cooling of global temperatures. Samantha Burgess, climate responsibility at the ECMWF, said, 'January 2025 is another surprising month, continuing the record temperatures observed over the past two years, despite the development of La Niña conditions in the Pacific and its temporary cooling effect on global temperatures.'

**Year 2024 is the warmest on record, concluding a decade of unprecedented heat - GreentechLead**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has released a report stating that 2024 was the warmest year on record, concluding a decade of unprecedented heat. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described this as 'climate breakdown in real time,' urging immediate action. The report highlighted extreme weather events, including record-breaking rainfalls, catastrophic flooding, scorching heat waves, and devastating wildfires, exacerbated by climate change. In 2024, 41 additional days of dangerous heat were recorded, intensifying 26 of 29 studied weather events and causing significant human and ecological harm. Despite the crises, progress was made in discussions on climate finance at COP29 and the adoption of the Pact for the Future. Looking ahead, 2025 will focus on glacier preservation and monitoring greenhouse gas fluxes, while 2027 will target universal protection against environmental hazards through the Early Warnings for All program. WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo emphasized the urgency of global responsibility to act for a safer planet, saying, 'As WMO approaches its 75th anniversary, the time for action is now.'
