**EU Passes Resolution to Limit Chinese Companies' Entry into Medical Device Procurement Market**
The European Union (EU) has passed a resolution to limit the entry of Chinese companies into the EU's medical device procurement market in response to Beijing's discriminatory behavior against foreign manufacturers in public procurement. According to the Financial Times, the resolution, which was passed by EU member states, requires EU public institutions to exclude Chinese companies from participating in procurement tenders worth over €5 million within the EU for the next five years. This is the EU's first action under the International Procurement Instrument (IPI) to address Beijing's market discrimination in this field. The EU has pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party's policies force domestic hospitals to choose local suppliers. An investigation found that 87% of procurement cases involved 'direct or indirect discrimination', including banning imported medical devices from participating in tenders. The IPI was established in 2022 to promote a procurement environment consistent with the EU's market access principle, ensuring that foreign companies enjoy fair treatment in the EU public market. The EU launched an investigation into China's medical device procurement market in April last year and reported in January that Beijing's restrictions on European companies bidding for Chinese public procurement projects had increased in recent years. Despite multiple rounds of talks between the EU and Beijing, no solution was reached. According to Bloomberg, data shows that China's trade surplus in medical equipment has turned into a deficit in just one year. In 2019, China had a €1.3 billion deficit in this category, while in 2020, it turned into a €520 million surplus. The EU believes that this is not a natural competitive result, but rather a result of the Chinese Communist Party's 'Made in China 2025' policy, which requires Chinese companies to achieve a local market share of 85% in 'core medical device components' by 2025, 70% in high-end equipment by 2025, and 95% in high-end equipment by 2030. The EU criticizes this practice as causing market distortion and harming European companies. The Chinese Communist Party acknowledges its policy bias towards domestic products, but claims it has not made any international commitments on public procurement. According to the IPI, the EU's executive committee can take measures against foreign companies, including reducing scores or banning them from participating in tenders. The EU has taken various legal tools in recent years to address unfair trade practices, such as the Foreign Subsidies Regulation, which restricts companies receiving foreign government subsidies from participating in EU public contracts or mergers and acquisitions. Although these measures do not specifically target Beijing, they are mainly used to address issues related to Chinese companies.

**DJI drones and other Chinese makers could face new US ban**
The US government is set to announce executive orders that could lead to a ban on the sale of Chinese-made drones, including those from DJI and Autel, due to national security concerns. According to a report by The Washington Post, the orders will expedite existing reviews of these drones and require US intelligence agencies to assess their risks. Jonathan Rupprecht, a lawyer specializing in drone regulations, said, 'If listed, there will most likely not be new or updated DJI or Autel equipment to be sold on the market because the manufacturers will not be able to obtain FCC certifications for the wireless transmitters.' The orders also aim to boost the domestic drone industry and update drone regulations in the US, including relaxing restrictions on commercial drones and requiring FAA approval for private infrastructure owners. Additionally, the US government is reviewing whether routers from TP-Link, citing alleged links to China and anti-competitive behavior, should be banned from sale in the US.

**Trump Expected to Sign Executive Order Banning Chinese Drone Sales in US**
US President Trump is expected to sign an executive order that could ban the sale of Chinese-made drones in the US, including models from DJI and Autel. The move is seen as a response to the dominance of Chinese drone manufacturers in the global market, with many US manufacturers struggling to compete. According to reports, the executive order would update federal regulations on commercial drones, potentially making it harder for Chinese manufacturers to sell new models in the US. The order would also require drone manufacturers deemed a 'national security risk' to meet new licensing requirements. DJI and other Chinese manufacturers may be affected by the order, which could limit their ability to sell new models in the US. The US government may also be directed to support US drone manufacturers under the order. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has commented that China has cut drone sales to the West but continues to supply them to Russia.

**US Plans to Expand Tech Sanctions on China**
According to sources, US officials are working on a new policy that would allow the government to impose licensing requirements on companies that do business with Chinese companies majority-owned by entities already under US sanctions. This move is aimed at preventing China from circumventing US restrictions by creating new subsidiaries to deal with American companies. The new policy would require companies to obtain a license from the US government before engaging in business with Chinese companies that are majority-owned by entities on the US sanctions list. This could lead to further escalation of trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, particularly after US President Donald Trump accused China of violating the spirit of the recent Geneva talks. The US has imposed export restrictions to limit China's access to advanced semiconductors, which has sparked anger from Chinese officials, while China's strict export controls on critical minerals have also angered US officials. The new policy is expected to be announced in June, and sources say that the content and timing of the policy and related sanctions are still being finalized and may change. After the policy is published, the US is likely to impose new sanctions on major Chinese companies.

**China Challenges the US with Ambitious Quantum Plan to Lead Innovation in Chips and Metrology**
China has launched a national plan to strengthen its metrology, aiming to break technological barriers in strategic fields such as chips, quantum measurement, and precision devices. This move comes amidst growing rivalry with the United States. The Plan of Action 2030, published by the State Administration of Market Regulation, includes advancements in over 50 key technologies, the development of at least 100 new devices, and the construction of 20 world-class metrology centers. 'By 2030, we will have overcome the main bottlenecks in standards, traceability, and metrological precision,' states the official document released on May 16. The new plan focuses on critical areas such as nanometer-scale integrated circuits, chip frequency probes, and quantum gyroscopes, all fundamental components in the era of advanced computing. The new capabilities will allow China to measure physical phenomena that are impossible to track with traditional metrology, giving it an advantage in artificial intelligence, digital transformation, and advanced manufacturing. Additionally, the government announced the creation of a national network of metrological infrastructure with over 1,500 standard substances for key sectors such as energy, electromagnetism, environment, and nanostructured materials. This structure aims to close the gap with the United States and consolidate China's technological sovereignty in the face of Western restrictions, according to reports from the Science and Technology Daily newspaper. The plan also includes the development of metrology devices capable of operating in extreme conditions, from nuclear facilities to space, and the strengthening of measurement in rare earth magnets, a strategic resource in which China already dominates over 80% of the global supply and whose export has been restricted by Beijing following US tariff measures.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**US Lawmakers Propose Precise Restrictions on Visas to Distinguish Between CCP and Chinese Citizens**
US lawmakers from both parties agree that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is using students in the US for malicious activities, including pressuring some students to gather sensitive information and using students involved in sensitive research for espionage. The State Department has emphasized that canceling Chinese students' visas is part of its visa action framework to maintain US national security. However, lawmakers argue that banning all Chinese students from entering the US would be counterproductive, as it would deprive the US of its competitive advantage in attracting top talent. They propose precise restrictions on visas, distinguishing between CCP members and ordinary Chinese citizens. Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) stated, 'STEM fields pose a real national security risk, and we should take targeted action.' However, he also emphasized that 'banning all Chinese students would make us lose one of our greatest advantages - the world's top talent still wants to learn and stay in the US.' Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) warned that freezing all new student visa interviews would be 'reckless.' In 2024, there were approximately 277,000 Chinese students in the US. Lawmakers stress the importance of distinguishing between Chinese students who come to the US for research and those who may engage in malicious activities. Former Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) emphasized, 'It's crucial to constantly distinguish between the CCP and the Chinese people.' Former US State Department China expert Ryan Fedasiuk stated that while some Chinese students have been involved in espionage, intellectual property theft, censorship, and campus harassment, 'the vast majority of Chinese students are not involved in these activities.' Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) has advocated for allowing more Chinese students to stay in the US after graduation to contribute to the US tech industry. President Trump expressed his desire for foreign students to attend US universities, saying, 'We want excellent students, not troublemakers. We want students. I want foreign students. Harvard's ratio is nearly 31%, which is not a small number.' Hawkish figures believe that a second Cold War is underway and that the US should maintain its military and technological superiority, rebuild its manufacturing industry, and establish an independent and self-sufficient economy. They hope the government will make changes to the visa system, such as allowing Chinese citizens to see the US firsthand. Michael Sobolik, a senior research fellow at the Hudson Institute, said, 'In general, we want the Chinese people to see what the US is like.' He believes that strengthening visa checks is necessary, and if officials can execute it precisely, it could be a powerful countermeasure against China. 'If the government can expel and revoke the visas of known spies and personnel working for the embassy, that's great,' Sobolik said. 'We should get rid of them as soon as possible.' 'If these Chinese students are involved in sensitive research fields and sensitive areas, especially STEM fields, I also strongly support strict checks because allowing them to come to the US poses a great risk, especially if they are connected to the CCP and the Chinese military,' he added. Sobolik expressed his support for 'the US still providing channels for Chinese citizens to hold student visas to come to the US.' 'If they can see the US firsthand and understand what freedom is like, it's beneficial to us,' Sobolik said. 'Not only do they not have freedom in China, but in the Cold War era, freedom was one of our greatest assets.'

**China's Rapid Technological Advancements: A Threat to US Supremacy**
The US is struggling to keep up with China's rapid technological advancements, particularly in AI, which may be the next area to be surpassed. This has sparked intense debate between the government and industry. The White House has largely supported banning the export of high-tech chips and components to prevent China's progress, but Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and others argue that such policies will only accelerate China's development of its own tech ecosystem. China's electric cars are priced lower and outperform many American-made models, with self-driving cars already appearing on the streets of Wuhan and Beijing. China dominates the global market in consumer drones, solar panels, and batteries. The US currently maintains a narrow lead in advanced chips and AI, but the gap is rapidly closing. China is shifting towards developing and manufacturing its own chips, including those from Huawei, Hwawei, Longxin Storage, and SMIC. Since the US banned ZTE and Huawei in 2018, China's tech companies and government have invested heavily, and the US has tried to slow China's progress by banning the export of chip-making equipment and materials. Patrick Moorhead, a semiconductor industry analyst who spent 11 years as a high-ranking executive at AMD, believes that China's lagging behind or being forever behind is a misconception. He says, 'I've been in the tech industry for 30 years, and I've heard people say China can't do this. Now I think the only question is how fast they can do it.' Experts point out that China's unique advantages, such as its well-trained workforce and massive domestic market, are unprecedented in US trade history. Huang has repeatedly stated that 'half of the world's AI engineers are in China.' China's domestic market allows companies to test and refine their products before going global. Huang has recently strongly criticized the US's current export control ban, saying that it will only strengthen China's competitiveness and weaken the US's position. He predicts that by 2026, China's spending on AI chips and servers will reach $50 billion, and the new AI chip export ban will cost Nvidia a significant market share.

**China spacecraft aims to return with 'groundbreaking' asteroid samples**
China's Tianwen-2 probe, launched on Thursday, aims to collect samples from an asteroid near Mars and a main-belt comet, and return them to Earth in about two years. According to the China National Space Administration, the mission represents a 'significant step in China’s new journey of interplanetary exploration' and will 'yield groundbreaking discoveries and expand humanity’s knowledge of the cosmos.' Shan Zhongde, head of the CNSA, said, 'The Tianwen-2 mission will over its decade-long mission will yield groundbreaking discoveries and expand humanity’s knowledge of the cosmos.' The samples from the asteroid 2016HO3 are expected to provide clues into the formation of Earth, such as the origins of water. China has welcomed international cooperation, but any cooperation with the US hinges on removing an American law banning direct bilateral cooperation with NASA.

**China, Russia Team Up for Lunar Nuclear Plant, U.S. Faces Space Race Gap**
China and Russia have formed a partnership to build a nuclear power plant on the moon by 2036, which will power the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). The ILRS, a shared base planned for the moon's south pole, will support long-term human missions and enable scientific experiments, robotic operations, and potential stepping stones for Mars exploration. According to Dr. Elena Volkov, a lunar scientist at Moscow State University, 'This is a wake-up call for the U.S.,' as China and Russia are building infrastructure that NASA is only dreaming of. The lunar reactor will ensure steady energy for the ILRS, overcoming the moon's extreme temperatures and darkness. Analysts view the project as a geopolitical flex, with Russia countering Western sanctions and China eyeing space supremacy.

**U.S. Policy Still Reflects Anti-Chinese Sentiment, But What Do The People Think?**
The U.S. has a history of anti-Chinese sentiment, with policies such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Wolf Amendment limiting NASA's collaboration with Chinese space programs. Recent legislation, including a 10% tariff on foreign imports and a ban on U.S. government personnel from having romantic or sexual relationships with Chinese citizens, has further strained relations between the two nations. However, a recent study by Pew Research Center shows that public perception of China is shifting, with 77% of the population having an unfavorable opinion, but a decrease in strongly negative views from 2024 to 2025. Social media influencers, such as IShowSpeed, are challenging anti-Chinese narratives and promoting cultural exchange, which may be a step towards dismantling the anti-Chinese sentiment ingrained in U.S. policy and perspective.

**US space agency Nasa will not fund study on China's moon sample, says scientist**
A scientist's study on China's moon sample will not be funded by Nasa due to the Wolf Amendment, a congressional restriction that bars direct cooperation with Chinese government entities. Despite this, the scientist, Glotch, is grateful to his institution for providing funds to travel to China and collaborate with researchers from the University of Hong Kong and San Francisco State University to analyse the samples. However, Stony Brook's officials must still sign a loan agreement with CNSA before the samples can be shipped.

**China Opens Up to International Cooperation in Space Exploration**
China's National Space Administration has announced the results of the 'Chang'e 5' lunar sample international borrowing application, approving seven institutions from six countries, including two US universities supported by NASA - Brown University and Stony Brook University. However, due to the 'Wolf Amendment', a US law that prohibits NASA from collaborating with Chinese institutions, it is unclear whether the US institutions will be able to obtain the samples. Chinese experts have criticized the US for being 'closed off' while China is 'open'. According to a report by Observer Network, on April 24, China's National Space Administration announced the results of the 'Chang'e 5' lunar sample international borrowing application, approving seven institutions from six countries. The report also mentioned that the US institutions, Brown University and Stony Brook University, are among the approved institutions. Wu Weiren, a Chinese engineer and the chief designer of the Chang'e program, said, 'Now it's China that is open, while the US is becoming increasingly isolated.' He added that the US's growing 'isolationism' will not help it achieve its 'space ambitions.' China became the third country to collect lunar samples after the US and the Soviet Union in 2020, and the first country to bring back samples from the far side of the moon in 2022.

**Geopolitical Tensions and Budget Cuts Threaten Space Exploration, Says Astrobiologist**
The principal astrobiologist of the mission to explore Saturn's largest moon, Catherine Neish, has stated that geopolitical tensions and budget cuts in the United States are threatening space exploration. Neish, a Canadian, noted that the distrust between the US and China has been ongoing for a long time, and that 'the law prohibits American scientists from working directly with Chinese scientists, which is terrible.' However, she also mentioned that tensions have been escalating, particularly due to the new US government's trade war and increased scrutiny of Chinese scientists in the US. Neish is the leader of the astrobiology team of the NASA's Dragonfly mission, which is set to launch in 2027 and will explore the moon Titan, which may have conditions suitable for life. She expressed concerns about the US government's proposal to cut NASA's scientific research funding by 47% in 2026. Song Kai, a researcher from the Harbin Institute of Technology in China, argued that 'geopolitics cannot interfere' with space research. He cited the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975 as an example of successful collaboration between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Neish agreed that 'we can start to gain trust and this may lead to collaboration on future space missions.' She pointed out that the sharing of knowledge through accessible databases is a step in the right direction. Song Kai also emphasized the importance of collaboration, citing the example of the Indian space program, which has made progress despite having lower budgets due to modular and reusable satellite designs. Neish suggested that the budget cut in the US 'may open a window of opportunity' for special programs in China, India, and Japan, which have also sought greater cooperation with Canada and the EU.

**China lunar chief accuses US of interfering in joint space programmes with other nations**
China's lunar exploration programme chief designer, Wu Weiren, accused the United States of interfering in Beijing's attempts to cooperate with Europe and other foreign partners in space programmes. Wu stated that China pursues a policy of open space diplomacy, in contrast to the U.S., and remains open to cooperating on lunar exploration with developing and developed countries. He noted that the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), an initiative led by Russia and China, has 17 countries and international organisations signed up as members, but suggested that China has not been able to attract as many lunar project partners as the U.S. due to U.S. interference. Wu said, 'The ILRS' development trend is very good but compared to the U.S.' Artemis Accords, ours is much smaller in terms of countries because the U.S. is always interfering in our cooperation with other countries, including with Europe.' The Artemis Accords are a U.S.-led multilateral agreement with over 50 signatories. Wu also stated that China and Russia cooperate well with each other and look forward to further cooperation on moon-based nuclear energy. China has recently carried foreign payloads from countries like Pakistan, Thailand, Italy, and France on its unmanned missions to the moon, raising the profile of Beijing's space diplomacy. Hernan Merino Choque, a deputy director at the Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization, said, 'ILRS is the sole mission in the world that provides equal opportunities for any country to be accepted and to participate actively by proposing payloads and satellites.' However, the European Space Agency (ESA) has ruled out joining the ILRS due to Russia's involvement, and U.S.-China space diplomacy has been limited by the Wolf Amendment, a U.S. law passed in 2011 that banned NASA from collaboration with 'China or any Chinese-owned company unless such activities are specifically authorised.'

**China Takes the Lead in Space Exploration as US Steps Back**
China is set to receive its first international astronaut from Pakistan, marking a shift in the country's space program. The agreement between China and Pakistan will allow Pakistani astronauts to be trained in China and participate in short-term missions to the Tiangong space station. This move comes as the US is closing its doors to international cooperation in space, prohibiting the NASA and CNSA from collaborating directly. China's decision to develop its own space station, Tiangong, was a response to this prohibition. The station has been continuously occupied since 2022, with rotating crews of astronauts. The US's Estación Espacial Internacional (ISS) has been the pinnacle of international cooperation in space, but its structural fatigue and increasing maintenance costs have led to a plan to maintain it until 2030 and then de-orbit it. China is taking advantage of this opportunity to establish itself as a leader in space exploration, with plans to expand its Tiangong space station to six modules and host astronauts from other countries. This marks a significant shift in the balance of power in space, with China filling the void left by the US.

**A red moon: Will the next 'Sputnik Moment' be made in China?**
The United States is facing a new 'Sputnik Moment' as China is rapidly advancing its lunar program, with plans to land Chinese 'taikonauts' on the lunar surface before 2030. NASA's Artemis program is behind schedule, with a first planned landing mission, Artemis 3, now set for no earlier than mid-2027. China's lunar ambitions are driven by a focus on economic development and resource exploitation, with the moon's south polar region being a key target. The U.S. risks being caught flat-footed if it fails to follow through on its commitment to return humans to the moon by 2024, with potential consequences for global leadership and space governance. To avoid ceding ground to China, the U.S. government needs to streamline and simplify launch licensing, and clear the regulatory and bureaucratic underbrush to accelerate Artemis. 'We better watch out … It is not beyond the realm of possibility that they [China] say, 'Keep out, we're here, this is our territory,' cautions former NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. 'There is no reason to believe they will not be first to send a crewed mission to the lunar south pole,' writes Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's former head of science.
