**'No one like him' ... Joe Rogan questions how Sean O'Malley gets past 'superhuman' Merab Dvalishvili at UFC 316**
Sean O'Malley will face Merab Dvalishvili in the main event of UFC 316 on June 7th, a rematch of their fight at UFC 306 where Dvalishvili won by decision. Dvalishvili is riding a 12-fight win streak and is considered the greatest bantamweight of all time by Henry Cejudo and O'Malley's head coach Tim Welch. UFC commentator Joe Rogan expressed concern for O'Malley, saying 'No one like him' can get past Dvalishvili's 'superhuman' abilities, citing his pressure-heavy wrestling and seemingly unbeatable gas tank. O'Malley is known for his striking, but many predict Dvalishvili's skills will be too much for him, with Dvalishvili being a 3-to-1 betting favorite.

This fight will be financially beneficial for me, as O'Malley is the most popular fighter in the division. I think he'll start with body shots, for example. After the rematch, I want to stay active. I'm planning to have two more fights this year, maybe in Guadalajara and New York. I'm in good shape and want to stay busy to avoid distractions,' Dvalishvili said. The title fight between O'Malley and Dvalishvili will headline UFC 316, which will take place on June 7-8 in Newark, New Jersey.

**Merab Dvalishvili's Injury Raises Concerns Ahead of UFC 316**
Merab Dvalishvili, a Georgian mixed martial artist, has suffered an injury to his right foot, just two weeks before his highly anticipated fight against Sean O'Malley at UFC 316. Dvalishvili shared a photo of his foot on Instagram, joking, 'It's okay, I'll just cut it off.' This is not the first time Dvalishvili has suffered an injury before a big fight, but he has always managed to push through. The injury occurred during a sparring session with undefeated boxer Cameron Sandoval. Dvalishvili joked, 'Why did you break my little toe, friend?' Sandoval replied, 'You did! You kicked me in the head and broke your own toe. It's your fault.' Although both fighters took the incident lightly, it could potentially affect the UFC 316 event. If Dvalishvili is forced to withdraw, the UFC would need to find a new main event at short notice. Dvalishvili previously defeated O'Malley in September, dominating the fight with a unanimous decision. He also defeated Umar Nurmagomedov in January, who was considered a major threat. However, Dvalishvili's foot injury may now threaten his chances of winning against O'Malley at UFC 316.

**Merab Dvalishvili comes clean on rematching "humble" Sean O'Malley at UFC 316**
Merab Dvalishvili is set to defend his bantamweight title against Sean O'Malley at UFC 316 on June 7. Dvalishvili, who dominated O'Malley in their first fight at UFC 306, is aiming for a definitive finish in the rematch. According to Dvalishvili, O'Malley has become 'humble' and is no longer talking disrespectfully, but Dvalishvili is looking to win with even more dominance.

Dvalishvili last competed at UFC 311 in January, where he secured a unanimous decision victory over Umar Nurmagomedov, marking his first successful defense of the bantamweight title.
