**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**Innovative Solutions to Combat Chronic Pain**
New technologies are being developed to combat chronic pain, a disease that affects 25.9% of the adult population in Spain, according to a 2022 study by the Fundación Grünenthal España and the Observatorio del Dolor de la Universidad de Cádiz. The study found that chronic pain costs the Spanish economy 2.5% of its GDP and affects 28.6% of patients, causing them to take time off work. To combat this, companies and startups are developing innovative solutions such as virtual reality, sensors, and wearable devices to monitor patients and provide personalized treatment. For example, DynamicsVR has developed a software that uses virtual reality to reduce pain in patients with chronic pain, while Broomx Technologies has created a platform that uses immersive reality to improve the physical and emotional well-being of patients with chronic pain. Other companies, such as Quantic Nanotech and Brainguard, are developing wearable devices that use micropulses and artificial intelligence to predict and prevent migraines and other types of chronic pain. Spinally, a startup from Valencia, is working on a new type of electrode that can be implanted in the spinal cord to stimulate the nerves and reduce pain. These innovative solutions have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of chronic pain and improve the quality of life for millions of people.

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**God of War's Next Game Can't Close One Pandora's Box Ragnarok Opened**
The Valhalla DLC for God of War: Ragnarok was a creative pivot that introduced roguelike progression and introspective storytelling to the series. This type of experience should be included from the start in future God of War games, not as a post-launch bonus. The next game could be set in Egypt, Greece, or a new location, but it should build on the roguelike formula introduced in Valhalla. This would raise the baseline expectations and make the roguelike system feel like an essential design feature. The article suggests that the next God of War game should focus on emotional reckoning and legacy, using the roguelike format to explore themes of failure and growth. Santa Monica Studio should embrace Valhalla as a core feature going forward, rather than leaving it behind as a one-time success.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population ‘the size of UK’ by 2300 & turn entire countries into apocalyptic wastelands**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak warns that AI will lead to a population collapse, shrinking the world's population to 100 million by 2300, which is roughly the size of the UK's current population. He believes that AI will replace 'literally everything' that humans do, including decision-making in offices, leading to a devastating impact on society. Kak points out that demographers are predicting a population collapse due to AI, and that the great cities of the world will be abandoned if the population shrinks to 100 million. He also notes that birth rates are already plummeting due to people's reluctance to have children who will likely be unemployed in adult life. Kak refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, and suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing space may be a viable option to ensure humanity's survival.

**We're The First 0.5% in Human Species  --  What We Owe The Future by William MacAskill**
William MacAskill's book 'What We Owe The Future' suggests that humans have only lived for 0.5% of their potential lifespan, which is one million years. This means that the next 99.5% of human civilization depends on how we act today. MacAskill argues that we have a duty to consider the interests and needs of future people, even if they may not exist or may be far in the future. He also discusses the importance of living in a 'high plasticity period', where our actions can have a significant impact on the far-distant future. MacAskill identifies three possible scenarios for the future: extinction, collapse, and stagnation. He argues that we need to take action to avoid these scenarios and ensure a bright future for all humans. One of the key insights from the book is that a larger population can lead to more opportunities for innovation and progress. MacAskill recommends effective altruism, which involves taking action to benefit future people, not just by being vegan or reducing plastic, but also by doing elections and donating.

**The Alarming Question of Jordi Wild: 'We are too dependent' on a Hypothetical Global Blackout**
Streamer Jordi Wild recently discussed a hypothetical global blackout with survival expert Basquecraft, asking what would happen to society if the power grid collapsed. Basquecraft responded, 'If the electrical system collapses, civilization would likely collapse completely, and there would be a huge extermination of humans, with around 80% to 90% of the population not surviving.' Basquecraft also highlighted the importance of being prepared, stating, 'Many people are not aware that gasoline expires within a year, unlike in movies.' He recommended that in a situation like this, people should seek refuge in a village where they can rely on neighbors and family for support and resources. 'We are too dependent,' Wild said, echoing Basquecraft's concerns about the consequences of a global blackout.

**Iran on the Brink: A Potential War with the US and Israel**
The situation on the Middle East is nearing a critical point, with ongoing conflicts in Syria, Turkey, Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen. The 'Iranian question' is a concern for the US administration, with some sources suggesting that Washington and Tel Aviv are planning a massive strike against Tehran. If this happens, the region will be plunged into chaos, according to some analysts. A senior official in the White House has stated that the US plans to complete a military operation in Iran by the fall, if Tehran does not begin dismantling its nuclear program. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot has warned that 'war with Iran is almost inevitable' if a nuclear deal is not reached soon. Israel, which has been given a free hand by Trump, is adding fuel to the fire. Iran's military has reportedly warned potential opponents that it will retaliate with a pre-emptive strike against a joint US-British base in the Chagos Islands if necessary. This would be an attempt to keep Trump from launching a military attack on Iran. The US is seriously considering nuclear talks with Iran, according to Axios. For Russia, which has Iran as its main strategic partner in the region, a war between its ally and the West would be a 'catastrophic' event. Russia has warned that such a conflict would lead to 'irreversible catastrophe', according to The Sun. Political analyst Dmitry Rodionov believes that the situation is on the brink of disaster, with Iran's well-developed system of bunkers making it difficult for the US to inflict significant damage. Rodionov warns that Iran could retaliate with a serious attack, potentially reaching as far as the US base in San Diego. He also believes that a war would have catastrophic consequences for the global economy, including a sharp increase in oil prices and a global financial crisis. This would be a 'true Ragnarök', a scenario in which the world is plunged into chaos and destruction. Rodionov is skeptical about Trump's willingness to risk such a conflict, but believes that it is a real possibility. 'This will be a test not only for the US, but for the whole world, which will face serious shocks in politics and economics. It's hard to imagine that Trump or his team, which advocates for war, are so confident. It's unclear if they are willing to take the risk. In the current circumstances, this war will drain the US of all its strength,' Rodionov said. 'It's possible that Trump will become the one who organizes Ragnarök.'

**Nanotechnology: A Key to Solving the Global Water Crisis**
According to the World Bank, approximately 2 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed drinking water services, 3.6 billion people do not have access to safely managed sanitation services, and 2.3 billion people lack basic handwashing facilities. This water crisis has significant implications for the health, security, and well-being of millions of people. The lack of clean water can lead to the spread of deadly diseases such as cholera and dysentery, and also affects food production, leading to hunger in vulnerable communities. The use of nanotechnology can help address the problem of water treatment and management globally. Nanomaterials have a high surface-to-volume ratio, making them highly reactive. They can be used in desalination, water purification, and as sensors in MEMS. The high adsorption properties of these materials are also very interesting. They have a great potential for novel decontamination processes, being more efficient and faster, and useful for the elimination of organic and inorganic contaminants such as heavy metals and micropollutants. The nanotechnology is also transforming desalination, making it more efficient and less expensive. The use of nanotechnology in water treatment reduces the dependence on harmful chemicals and can decrease the generation of secondary waste. The future of water and, therefore, the future of humanity, will be linked to the advancement of new tools such as nanotechnologies. In the near future, it is expected that water treatment will use more nanomaterials with improved performance compared to current methods, allowing compliance with increasingly strict environmental and health regulations. Thanks to this, the water crisis may one day be a thing of the past.

**The Importance of Death**
The article discusses the importance of death, arguing that it is a necessary and important part of the dialectic of change. The author notes that the physiological and neurological dysfunction that leads to death is a natural process that allows for the continuation of life. The article also highlights the individualism and egoism that drives humans to seek eternal life, but notes that this would lead to an unsustainable population. The author estimates that if the 117 billion people who have ever lived were still alive, the planet would be unable to support them, and that the population would increase by 42% daily. The article concludes that death is necessary for the sustainability of the human species. As the author states, 'La muerte se acicala como importante' (Death is acicalled as important). The article also mentions that if humans were able to live up to 500 years, it would lead to a chaotic overpopulation. The author wonders if the number of births will decrease or if the population will increase and longevity will be prolonged with the help of therapies with stem cells, nanotechnology, tissue engineering, or artificial intelligence.

**Scientists Warn of Three Hidden Threats to Humanity**
Scientists have identified three potential causes of a global catastrophe that seem unlikely but could lead to the extinction of the human species. The first threat is a demographic crisis, with the United Nations predicting that the global population will exceed 10 billion by 2050, leading to a severe resource shortage, famine, and subsequent collapse of civilization. The second danger lies in the development of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, which, although promising significant breakthroughs, may get out of control. As John Skelton and Craig Wheeler from the University of Texas point out, powerful gamma-ray emissions from supernovae explosions could cause significant damage to the Earth's biosphere. If such a burst were directed towards Earth, the consequences would be catastrophic. Researchers from the University of Otago have also considered the worst-case scenario of a global catastrophe - a possible nuclear winter. They believe that only five countries would be able to survive in such conditions. 'We should consider not only obvious risks but also less predictable factors to ensure our future,' says the 'MediaPotok' news outlet.

**The True Threat: Overpopulation, Not Climate Change**
A 1960 study by physicist Heinz von Foerster and his team predicted that the world would reach a critical point on November 13, 2026, due to exponential population growth. According to their projections, the growth of the world population would be so significant that humanity would experience a collapse, not due to natural disasters or pandemics, but due to its own decisions and actions. The study, titled 'Doomsday: Friday, 13 November, A.D. 2026', argued that even if a constant food supply and the avoidance of natural disasters were achieved, overpopulation could trigger the collapse of social and environmental systems. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that demographic growth has reached a pace that technological advancements cannot mitigate adequately. As a result, addressing this phenomenon is imperative to ensure a sustainable future. According to the model used, overpopulation will lead to extinction due to resource scarcity and the environmental impact of human activities. The research warned that if the world population continues to grow at this rate, we will reach an unsustainable threshold where societies cannot preserve their stability or sustainable development. Although this prediction is now viewed with skepticism, especially due to the stabilization of population growth rates, the dialogue about the limits of human growth remains relevant. The UN has estimated that the world population could reach 11.2 billion by 2100, raising questions about the management of the planet's resources and environmental protection in a world with a constantly increasing population.

**Three Possible Reasons for the Extinction of Humanity**
Experts in the field of science have identified three possible reasons for the extinction of humanity. At first glance, they seem unlikely and pose no danger. According to vm.ru, these reasons include a demographic collapse, where the world's population could reach 10 billion by 2050, leading to a global shortage of resources and ultimately, the death of humanity. Additionally, the development of nanotechnology could lead to the loss of control over artificial intelligence, and gamma radiation, which has been shown to affect the Earth's biosphere. As John Skelley and Craig Wheeler from the University of Texas discovered in the early 2000s, gamma bursts can have a significant impact on the planet's ecosystem. As John Skelley said, 'We cannot rule out the possibility that gamma radiation could have a profound impact on the Earth's biosphere.'
