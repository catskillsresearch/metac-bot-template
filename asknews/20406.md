**Trump asks Supreme Court to clear way for federal job cuts**
The Trump administration has asked the US Supreme Court to allow sweeping federal workforce cuts, arguing that lower court rulings have unlawfully blocked a core presidential power. The administration disputes a 2-1 ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which cited potential 'irreparable harm' to critical government services. Trump argues that his 2024 election victory gave him a clear mandate to overhaul the federal bureaucracy, and more than 75,000 federal workers have already exited through a deferred resignation program. US District Judge Susan Illston's order directs numerous federal agencies to halt acting on the president's workforce executive order, but the Supreme Court has set a deadline for a response from the unions and cities. 'Explicit statutory authorisation from Congress' is required for such large-scale reductions, according to Illston, a finding that Solicitor General D. John Sauer blasted as an 'indefensible premise'.

**Why On-And-Off Voters Who Backed Trump May Be GOP's Midterm Silver Bullet | CDN**
A recent study by J.L. Partners found that many Americans who voted for President Donald Trump in the past are now feeling unmotivated to vote Republican in the 2026 midterm elections. Analysts believe that motivating these low-propensity voters could be crucial for the Republican Party to maintain control of Congress. Sam Kay, a pollster at OnMessage Inc., said, 'Republicans will have a hard time surviving the 2026 midterms without figuring out how to engage the low-propensity Trump voter.' Kay added, 'If we want low-propensity Trump voters to turn out in 2026, we need to make this election about protecting President Trump's agenda.' James Johnson, pollster and co-founder of J.L. Partners, said, 'Most (64%) would still vote GOP if the election were held tomorrow, but lack a clear reason to do so.' Johnson believes that these voters are motivated by the idea that voting for a Republican-controlled Congress in 2026 will help the Republicans win the presidency in 2028. Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, said, 'Midterms should be considered separately from presidential elections.' Kondik noted that presidential elections have higher voter turnout than midterms and that the outcome of midterms does not necessarily predict presidential outcomes.

**Trump's Potential Win Could Bring About Significant Reform**
Donald Trump's potential win in the 2024 US presidential election could bring about a significant reform, according to Patrick Rosenstiel, a leading advisor to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. The compact is a agreement between states to give their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the most popular votes nationwide, not necessarily the winner in their state. Rosenstiel said, 'It will be the most important political reform of my life, if it happens.' The compact has been adopted by 17 states and the District of Columbia, with Maine potentially opting out. Proponents like Rosenstiel see it as a solution to the country's political problems, helping to heal mistrust in the system, reform presidential elections, and make every voter relevant again. Critics, however, argue that it is constitutionally questionable and could lead to a constitutional crisis if implemented. Rosenstiel acknowledged Republican skepticism, saying, 'It begins to normalize,' and that 'there is a movement of American voters who support a national popular vote for president, and I think there's only one way to get one, and that's with our plan.'

**Headlines of the Day: May 26, 2025 - The Federal Observer**
The Supreme Court has sided with President Trump in revoking legal status from 300,000 Venezuelans. Meanwhile, Trump's executive order aims to lower drug prices by brokering deals with the Department of Health and Human Services. A recent report shows that deportation flights to Venezuela have soared, with more Venezuelans being deported in four months than in the previous four years combined. Additionally, Democrats are pushing to strip Trump of power over the U.S. Marshals, citing threats to federal judges. Furthermore, a Colombian woman, Lina Maria Orovio-Hernandez, has been charged with illegally voting in the 2024 election and stealing $400,000 in taxpayer-funded benefits.

**Trump Calls for Removal of 21 Million Undocumented Immigrants, Warns of 'Third World Country'**
US President Donald Trump has claimed that the US has been 'invaded' by 21 million undocumented immigrants and has called on the US justice system to 'remove them' or else the US will become a 'third world country'. Trump made the statement on his Truth Social account, criticizing courts that have ruled against his immigration policies. He wrote, 'If we don't get to remove them, the US will rapidly become a third world country, filled with violence and crime, and will never be great again.' Trump also reminded that he won the 2024 presidential election 'in a landslide' and urged the government lawyers to 'state this truth' in the courts, including the Supreme Court. He added, 'If we don't get to do our job, there will no longer be a country. Make America great again!' Trump had previously started a campaign against undocumented immigrants through executive orders he signed on his first day in office.

**Donald Trump 'will run for a third term' as US President - 'he will win'**
Steve Bannon, former White House Chief Strategist, believes that Donald Trump could secure a third term in office. Trump's company has started selling red hats with 'Trump 2028' emblazoned on them, hinting at his future plans. Bannon stated, 'There are methods which you could do it. President Trump is going to be eligible, is going to run again, and will win again.' He predicted that Trump will be in the White House signing executive orders on January 20, 2029. Bannon also claimed that Trump's burning conviction that he had won the 2020 election, which he believes was stolen, is the reason he will run again.

**Trump Hints at Running for Third Term in 2028, Merchandise Sparks Speculation**
US President Donald Trump has hinted at running for a third term in 2028, despite the US Constitution limiting a president to two terms. Trump's team has released a series of merchandise with the phrase 'Trump 2028' on it, sparking speculation about his potential candidacy. When asked about the merchandise, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, 'It's a really cool hat, I think it will be very popular,' and suggested that the media contact Trump's team for more information. Trump has a history of dramatic politics, having first been elected in 2016, losing his re-election bid in 2020, and then returning to the White House in 2024. According to the US Constitution's 22nd Amendment, a president can only be elected twice, but Trump has said that this limit can be overcome. Some speculate that Trump's strategy may be to support his vice president JD Vance in the 2028 presidential election, and then take over as president if Vance wins and chooses to resign. However, Trump's policies, including reducing government size and increasing tariffs, have caused market fluctuations and public backlash. Recent polls show that Trump's approval rating has dropped to 42%, a new low since his return to the White House.

**Democrats Are Down, But Not Out**
The 2024 presidential election was a historic comeback for Donald Trump, but the Democrats are not out of the running for the 2028 election. Trump's favorability is low, and without him, the Republican Party will struggle to find a replacement. The party's reliance on the MAGA movement, which is deeply tied to Trump, will make it difficult for them to win without him. Additionally, the Republicans have not been able to win the presidency when nominating a member of the incumbent party who is not the president, a feat that has only been accomplished twice in the past century. The Democrats, on the other hand, have a strong lineup of potential candidates, including Josh Shapiro, Andy Beshear, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. With the pendulum of American politics swinging back and forth between the two parties, the Democrats are well-positioned to take back the White House in 2028. The performance of the second Trump administration will be crucial in determining the outcome of the election, but with strategic campaigning and candidate choice, the Democrats have a route to success regardless of how the administration performs.

**Trump's Quest for Power: Exploring Possible Scenarios**
Donald Trump has expressed interest in staying in power after his second term as president, despite being prohibited by the US Constitution from being elected more than twice. Trump has hinted that there are 'methods' to achieve this, and some have speculated about possible scenarios. One possibility is that Trump could be elected vice-president in 2024 and then assume the presidency in 2028 when the current vice-president, Mike Pence, retires. Another possibility is that Trump could be appointed to a position in the executive branch, allowing him to continue exercising power without being president. Additionally, Trump could try to follow the example of Vladimir Putin, who remained in power despite being term-limited, by appointing a loyal subordinate to the presidency. Finally, Trump could try to follow the example of George and Lurleen Wallace, who used a similar tactic to stay in power in Alabama. Trump's wife, Melania, is not eligible to be president, but he could try to appoint a loyal family member or associate to the presidency in 2028, allowing him to continue exercising power without being president. 'There are methods to achieve this,' Trump said in an interview, leaving many wondering what he has in mind.

**Schumer's Activist Judges**
As President Trump works to implement his campaign promise of deporting gang members and foreign terrorists, leftist judges are issuing unprecedented injunctions, undermining democracy. Despite Trump's electoral college win and securing the popular vote in the 2024 national election, judges are disregarding his authority. Analysis from Blue Rose Research shows that if every registered voter had participated, Trump would have won the popular vote by 5 points. Democrats are suffering a catastrophic shift away from their party, but are using lawfare to thwart Trump's agenda. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer admitted that they packed the judiciary with progressive judges to rule against Trump, saying 'The good news here is we did put 235 judges, progressive judges, judges not under the control of Trump on the bench last year and they are ruling against Trump.' White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller criticized the strategy, saying 'It takes 5 Supreme Court justices to issue a ruling that affects the whole nation. Yet lone District Court judges assume the authority to unilaterally dictate the policies of the entire executive branch of government.'

**Imane Khelif Challenges Trump, Vows to Defend Olympic Title**
Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, the gold medalist at the 2024 Paris Olympics, has challenged US President Donald Trump after he signed an executive order banning transgender athletes from competing in women's sports in the US last month. Trump described Imane as a 'male boxer' in his speech after signing the order. Imane Khelif has reaffirmed her commitment to defending her title at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, stating that she will work to win the gold medal again on American soil. In an interview with ITV, Imane said, 'I'll give you a clear answer, I am not transgender... this decision does not concern me, does not scare me, and does not matter to me.' The IOC Executive Committee recommended on Monday that boxing be included in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, allowing Imane to dream of retaining her title in California. Imane said, 'I will defend my gold medal with all my might in America.' She added, 'I believe that if I worked in the past with half my abilities, I would be more motivated and determined today.' The International Boxing Federation excluded Imane from the 2023 World Championship, citing her nationality issues after she underwent a test. However, the International Boxing Federation lost its Olympic recognition due to governance issues, allowing the IOC to allow Imane to compete in Paris. Imane defended her position strongly after severe criticism, stating that she is a full woman and eligible to participate in women's competitions. The International Boxing Federation's rival, the World Boxing Council, received temporary recognition as the new governing body of the sport last month. The recommendation needs final approval from the IOC in a meeting in Greece. Imane said, 'At this stage, I can say that the International Boxing Federation has become part of the past, just like we say in Algeria, those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear.' The debate over including transgender athletes in women's sports was a major issue in the Olympic Committee presidential election, with elections scheduled for Thursday. Imane concluded her statements by saying, 'I hope the next IOC president will be a true sportsman, committed to Olympic values, and will maintain the principles of fair play.'

**Looking ahead at Trump's endgame**
Donald Trump has been making strategic moves to ensure his re-election in 2028, according to experts. Trump has stated, 'They're not just after me, they're after you -- I'm just standing in their way.' He has 47 months to rebuild the federal government in his image and will likely double down to help the Republican Party stay in power. Trump's goal is to secure his legacy and ensure that Republicans win the 2028 election. He may resort to 'competitive authoritarianism,' where democratic institutions are abused, to achieve this end. Democrats are predicting the worst, but they should acknowledge their role in changing the stakes of the game for the republic. Trump has already demonstrated his willingness to take drastic measures, such as using executive orders and 'popular' policies to reshape the country in his image. The clock is ticking, and the game's expiration date is less than four years away.

**US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 2024**
In the 2024 US presidential election, Republican candidate Donald Trump won by defeating Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, receiving 312 electoral votes to her 226. Trump's victory included more votes in key swing states and gave the Republican Party control of the Senate. Harris graciously accepted her defeat, saying 'I congratulate President-elect Trump on his victory.' President Joe Biden also called to congratulate Trump. The international community, including Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, welcomed Trump's victory, which saw a positive reaction in stock markets, leading to a surge in the US currency and government bonds.

**Trump Bans Transgender Athletes from Competing in Women's Events**
US President Trump has signed an executive order authorizing the Department of Education to investigate how schools across the country are implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in schools receiving federal funding. Trump said, 'If they allow men to take over women's teams or enter women's locker rooms, they will face an investigation for violating Title IX and risk losing federal funding.' The US government will 'do everything in its power to prevent transgender athletes from competing in women's events held in the US,' Trump said, adding that the executive order will also apply to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Trump stated, 'If men beat women in 2028 in Los Angeles, my government won't just stand by.' Trump has repeatedly attacked the LGBTQ community during his election campaign, accusing them of being 'transgender crazy' and criticizing Democratic candidate Kamala Harris for supporting the community. After signing the executive order on February 5, Trump again claimed that Iman Khalif, the Algerian boxer who won the women's boxing gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, was actually a man. Khalif has a condition that makes him physically stronger than average women, which sparked controversy when he won the gold medal. Trump also stated that 'men who try to impersonate women to enter the US' will have their visa applications rejected after the executive order takes effect. A Republican-backed bill was passed in the US House of Representatives in January to strictly limit transgender athletes from competing in university women's sports.

**US Presidential Election 2024: How it Works**
The US presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024. The winner of the election will be determined by the Electoral College system, where the candidate who wins the most votes in a state gets all of that state's electoral votes. In most states, the candidate who wins the most votes gets all of the state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, where the electoral votes are allocated proportionally. To be eligible to vote in the US, one must be a US citizen and at least 18 years old. The candidates will finance their campaigns through donations and the 'Citizen-United-Urteil' allows for indirect campaign support with few restrictions. The election process is complex, with multiple stages, including the nomination convention, debates, and the final election. The winner of the election will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. As of now, the candidates for the election are Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, with the first debate scheduled for September 10, 2024. The election will be a crucial moment in US history, with the winner determining the course of the country's future.
