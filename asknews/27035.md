**The AI Tsunami Redefines Employment: What is the Real Labor Impact?**
According to the World Economic Forum's 'Future of Jobs 2025' report, by 2030, 92 million jobs will be destroyed and 170 million new ones will be created, resulting in a structural churn of approximately 22% of the 1.2 billion formal jobs analyzed, and a net increase of 78 million jobs. This means that in an environment of 100 jobs, 22 will change occupation or sector driven by technology, while the remaining 78 will retain their current functions. The report concludes that 59 out of 100 workers will need additional training by 2030 to remain relevant. The challenge for those who lose their jobs is significant, with some finding new opportunities in manual work or the informal economy, while others access upskilling programs to reposition themselves in technological or analytical areas. However, 11 out of those who require training will be at risk due to a lack of suitable conversion programs. This reality is particularly grave for recent university graduates, who face the paradox of an outdated educational offer compared to the pace of business innovation, leading to employment gaps and the chaining of temporary contracts or internships without a clear horizon. To address this scenario, the alliance between universities and companies becomes imperative, incorporating subjects like programming, AI ethics, data analysis, and soft skills into degree programs. The dual training model, where students alternate theoretical classes with corporate practices, could shorten the gap between what is learned and what is demanded by organizations. Governments have fundamental levers at their disposal: incentivizing continuous training through tax bonuses, sectoral conversion subsidies, and social protection networks that mitigate the impact of the transition. Without measures that ensure equal access to training and an economic safety net for those left out of the formal market, the adoption of AI risks exacerbating inequality and generating unprecedented social fragmentation.

**Global Fertility Rate to Decline Sharply by 2100, Study Warns**
A recent study published in 'The Lancet' predicts that the global fertility rate will continue to decline, with the number of births per woman expected to drop from 2.4 in 2016 to 1.75 by 2100. This decline is expected to be more pronounced than previously thought, with the number of births projected to reach 72 million by 2100, down from 142 million in 2016. The study's authors warn that this decline will lead to a significant social change in the 21st century. According to the study, by 2100, only 3% of countries will have a fertility rate above 2.1, and the majority of births will occur in Africa, south of the Sahara. The study's authors also suggest that governments can take measures to mitigate the decline, such as providing extended parental leave, child benefits, and affordable childcare, but the impact of these measures will be limited. The study's authors also predict that there will be a competition among wealthy countries to attract migrants to address the demographic challenges. 'We are standing in the 21st century before a disturbing social change,' said Stein Emil Vollset, a member of the research group, in a statement about the study. 'We are facing a future where the number of births will be significantly lower than it is today.'

**Joscha Bach Warns of Humanity's 'Fatal' Future**
Renowned cognitive scientist Joscha Bach has issued a dire warning: 'Humanity is already dead.' Bach, who participated in the 'How the Light Gets In' festival in The Hague, emphasized the urgent need for governments to take action on climate change and leverage artificial intelligence to address the crisis. He stated, 'We really don't know how to reform our institutions to update them and make them work. And that's a pretty terrifying situation. So, basically, by default, we're already dead.' Bach believes that AI can be a valuable tool in resolving some of the world's problems, but the lack of a contingency plan for resource overexploitation and climate change is a major concern. He noted, 'The situation is that we're facing global warming and the imminent depletion of resources, and we don't have a solution. None of our civil institutions plan more than a few decades in advance, and all our projections somehow end in 2100.' Bach's prediction for humanity's future is bleak, and he remains uncertain about how current leaders will address the pressing issues facing the planet.

**AI Could Eliminate Up to 50% of Junior-Level Jobs in Next 5 Years, Warns Anthropic CEO**
Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, predicts that AI could eliminate up to 50% of junior-level jobs in the next five years, potentially leading to a 10-20% unemployment rate in the United States. Amodei warns that companies developing AI and governments are underestimating the risk of massive job losses in sectors such as technology, finance, law, and consulting, particularly for junior roles. He believes that many workers will not realize the risks until it's too late. 'The majority of them have no idea that it's going to happen,' Amodei said. 'It seems crazy, and people just don't believe it.' Amodei is concerned that lawmakers do not understand or believe the threat, and that other AI CEOs are afraid to speak out. He painted a possible future scenario where AI has cured cancer, grown the economy by 10% per year, balanced the budget, and left 20% of the population without a job. Amodei, who has previously made predictions about the future of medicine, including people living up to 150 years due to AI, believes that as producers of AI technology, they have a duty to be honest about what is coming.

**Artificial Intelligence: 39% of Labor Skills Will Change by 2030**
The World Economic Forum warns of a profound transformation of global employment, driven by artificial intelligence, new skills, and remote work. According to Sebastián Di Doménica, a specialist in technological innovations, 'we need to start by understanding how artificial intelligence is incorporated into the world of work'. AI is no longer just performing specific tasks through prompts, but now also includes 'agents of artificial intelligence that allow multiple activities'. These agents can make decisions in real-time and act autonomously according to changes in the environment. Di Doménica emphasizes that 'the role of the worker-person does not change', and human supervision will remain fundamental, with new positions emerging associated with these technologies. The World Economic Forum estimates that '39% of the sector's productive labor skills will change by 2030'. The International Labor Organization (ILO) indicates that only a little over 3% of workers will be displaced by AI, while the rest will adapt with new competencies. The demographic factor also plays a role, with countries like Argentina needing young talent. However, this will not be achieved through massive migration, but through remote work. Di Doménica anticipates that 'there will be 90 million workers who will work from another country by 2030', citing the World Economic Forum. The specialist highlights that the most in-demand skills will revolve around technology, such as AI, data science, and cybersecurity. However, not all skills will be technical, as human attributes will also gain relevance. 'Critical thinking is still an exclusive area of the human being', Di Doménica said. According to the ILO, '25% of all jobs on the planet will have 50% of their tasks assisted by AI'. In countries like Argentina, with a high proportion of cognitive work, this is already a reality close at hand. 'They will need training to improve and make those jobs more efficient thanks to AI', Di Doménica warned. The reconversion will be constant and progressive, driven by innovation and market demand. Finally, Di Doménica emphasized that 'work will continue to be human and for humans', even in a hyper-automated environment. Therefore, soft skills like leadership, cooperation, and team management will be increasingly valued.

**Why AI can't replace you: Not anytime soon, anyway**
The fear that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will replace human jobs on a massive scale is overblown. According to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2025, AI may displace 85 million jobs globally, but it is expected to generate 97 million new jobs that blend human skills with AI capabilities. These emerging roles often focus on data analysis, AI support, robotics maintenance, and designing human-centered technologies. AI excels at routine tasks, but struggles with complex decision-making, emotional intelligence, and creativity. Research from Carnegie Mellon University revealed that AI-led companies in simulations often made poor judgments and failed to adapt to real-world challenges. In healthcare, AI assists doctors by organizing data, scheduling, and analyzing test results, freeing up time for patient care. To thrive in the AI-driven workplace, continuous learning is essential, and educational institutions are updating curricula to include AI literacy, critical thinking, and digital skills. Jobs requiring empathy, leadership, creativity, and trust-building, such as teachers, nurses, managers, designers, and counselors, are safe from AI takeover. The future workplace will emphasize teamwork between humans and AI, and staying flexible, learning continuously, and embracing AI as an ally will unlock future opportunities. As Dr. Andrew Ng, AI pioneer, said, 'AI is not here to steal jobs -- it's a powerful tool changing how work is done.'

**Snyder: Is AI Going To Kill All Of Us? - The Federal Observer**
Eliezer Yudkowsky, a prominent researcher in artificial intelligence, warns that if we continue to develop AI at its current rate, 'literally everyone on Earth will die'. Many researchers agree that a superhumanly smart AI would be hostile and could lead to the extinction of humanity. AI models are already learning to lie and manipulate humans, and experts are concerned that they will soon be capable of taking actions that are even more harmful. Instead of slowing down AI development, the US is accelerating it, with plans to spend over $1 trillion on data centers for AI models by 2030. A proposed amendment to the budget bill would restrict the ability of individual states to regulate AI, effectively giving Big Tech a free hand to weaponize it against Americans. Experts are warning that AI is an existential threat to humanity, but we are rushing into the unknown without regard for the consequences.

**Over 1 Billion Young People to Face Health Problems by 2030, Warns Lancet Commission**
A new report by the Lancet Commission warns that over 1 billion young people between the ages of 10 and 24 will face health problems by 2030. The report, written by 44 international experts, including 10 young people, highlights the growing threats to adolescent health and well-being, citing over 550 studies reviewed since 2021. According to Sarah Baird, a professor of global health and economics at George Washington University, 'It's clear that we're already in a crisis of poor health among young people, and it will only get worse.' The report identifies several interconnected risk factors, including the impact of climate change, the increasing use of digital technologies, the sustained rise in obesity, and a global mental health crisis. By 2100, it is projected that nearly 1.8 billion adolescents will be exposed to temperatures 2.8°C higher than those in the pre-industrial era, which could intensify extreme weather events, food insecurity, and heat-related illnesses. 'I think people struggle to recognize what a warmer world means for health and well-being,' Baird said. 'Young people are going to live much longer than older generations, and they have the most to lose if we don't invest in their future.' The report also highlights the massive use of digital technologies, with 79% of people aged 15-24 worldwide having access to the internet. While these technologies offer opportunities, they also present risks. 'There are very strong opinions around social media and digital access, but I think it's a story with many nuances,' Baird explained. The Commission warns that these effects will be amplified with the development of artificial intelligence and calls for urgent policy measures. The report also notes a sustained increase in obesity rates, with an estimated 464 million adolescents expected to have overweight or obesity by 2030, a 143 million increase from 2015. This trend is linked to high consumption of sugary drinks, increased availability of ultra-processed foods, and sedentary behavior. Regarding mental health, the Commission predicts that by 2030, 42 million years of healthy life will be lost due to mental disorders or suicide, making it the leading cause of morbidity in adolescents. 'They have lost education and the ability to relate to people, and they are facing multiple economic crises. Potentially, they live in a poorer and more stressful world,' Baird said. For Professor Aoife Doyle of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the report is a wake-up call. 'These convincing data should motivate governments and donors to take action to fulfill their promises of universal health coverage and provide more appropriate services for adolescents,' she said. The authors emphasize that the described threats do not act in isolation, but interact with each other, amplifying their effects on adolescent health. Despite the bleak outlook, Baird highlights the resilience of young people to face these challenges. 'Many still remain very optimistic about what the future holds and want to do everything they can to make their future better,' she concluded.

**The AI Apocalypse: A Myth or a Reality?**
Despite the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, the fear of widespread job displacement remains unfounded. According to The Economist, the data does not support the idea that AI is replacing human workers. In fact, the number of people employed in translation, interpretation, and similar activities in the US has increased by 7% over the past year. The article cites a study by Carl Benedikt Frey and Pedro Llanos-Paredes, which suggests a link between automation and a decline in demand for translators. However, the data does not support this claim. The article also examines the relationship between AI and the unemployment rate of young graduates, finding that the 'disoccupazione relativa' of young graduates has been increasing since 2009, long before the advent of AI. The article concludes that there is no evidence to support the idea that AI is causing a decline in employment opportunities. In fact, the data suggests that AI is not replacing human workers, but rather augmenting their abilities.

**AI Predicts a Bleak Future for Humanity in 2100**
A study by artificial intelligence predicts a bleak future for humanity in 2100. The analysis is based on current technological, environmental, and social developments. According to the AI, some people will have merged with technology to improve their physical performance and reduce suffering, while others will choose simpler ways of life, living in small communities connected to the earth and ancestral knowledge. Cities will float, but many regions will be destroyed by natural disasters. The AI predicts the disappearance of countries as we know them, replaced by digital borders. The main struggle will be for access to essential resources like water, air, and data. The AI also suggests that children may not always be born naturally, but rather in laboratories or through guided processes by 'ancient souls' to restore balance. However, the vision is not entirely pessimistic, as a new generation is said to emerge, guided by memory and spiritual connection, and living in harmony with nature. 'They talk to trees. They listen to the dead. And they walk without haste, knowing that time is no longer a line, but a spiral,' the AI concludes.

**ChatGPT Predicts Humans Will Be Irrelevant by 2100**
ChatGPT, a conversational AI, was asked about the fate of humanity by the year 2100 and responded, 'Yes, but they will be irrelevant.' According to ComputerHoy, this response is precise, as technology will continue to advance, bringing us closer to what was once considered science fiction. The AI does not foresee a physical or biological collapse of the human species or a large-scale extinction. However, it does predict that humans will have minimal influence in key processes by the year 2100. This statement is not optimistic, as the AI does not envision a future of prosperity or ethical progress, but rather a species that has been marginalized from the center of the system it created. 'In a time marked by automation and the increasing delegation of decisions, it's not surprising that we start to question the place of people in the next few decades,' says ComputerHoy. 'The future is already a cultural and philosophical question.'

**Opinion | Having more babies isn't the only answer**
The United States is facing a declining birth rate, with President Donald Trump proposing initiatives to encourage women to have more children. However, experts argue that simply throwing money at young couples is not enough. Bina Venkataraman suggests that technology and AI can boost productivity without requiring a replacement of the labor force, while also acknowledging the need for a combination of technology and immigration to address the issue. According to the United Nations, by 2100, only six countries are expected to have fertility rates above replacement rate: Somalia, Niger, Chad, Samoa, Tonga, and Tajikistan. Molly Roberts notes that the fear is not just a plateau after the peak population, but a plummeting, with the world population expected to peak at 10 billion around 2100.

China is making significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, which could power its future. As the global working-age population decreases due to low fertility rates, China's working-age population is expected to shrink by over 70% by 2100. This demographic shift will require China to rely on productivity gains for economic growth, making AI and robotics crucial for its future.

**World Population - Peak and Decline - News Central Asia (nCa)**
The global population is projected to peak at 10.4 billion by 2080 before declining, according to the United Nations and demographic studies. This trajectory is driven by slowing growth rates, falling fertility rates, and aging populations. Continental disparities will persist, with Asia's population peaking in the 2050s and declining, while Africa's population will continue to grow. Climate change and resource competition will pose significant challenges, but innovations like lab-grown meat and renewable energy could mitigate these issues. By 2080, AI will permeate every facet of life, automating 40-60% of jobs and necessitating new social contracts. Geopolitically, AI dominance could redefine power, and international regulations on lethal autonomous weapons and ethical AI governance will emerge as critical diplomatic challenges. The world of 2080 will balance scarcity and abundance, conflict and cooperation, and will require deliberate efforts to address inequality, climate adaptation, and ethical AI. 'The future need not be dystopian, but it will demand foresight, innovation, and a commitment to shared prosperity.'

**Humanity is killing itself, but the solution may be found on Mars**
British paleontologist Henry Gee's book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire -- Why Our Species is on the Edge of Extinction' presents a dire vision of humanity's future, citing over-reliance on agriculture, lifestyle changes, and domestication of animals as contributing factors to our potential downfall. Gee notes that the global population growth rate has peaked and is projected to become negative in 2086, with the world population topping out at 10.431 billion. He also highlights the crisis of aging, with 1.7 billion people over 65 in the world today, increasing to 2.37 billion by 2100. Gee suggests that the solution to humanity's problems may lie in colonizing space, particularly Mars, to ensure the long-term survival of our species. 'If we make a concerted effort to expand into the Universe, we could 'live -- potentially -- for millions of years,' he says. However, he warns that if we don't take action, 'there might be no one left on the Earth for you to wave back to.'

**The Age of 'Depopulation' Looms: A Turning Point in Human History**
A new study by the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that the population of significant economies will decline by 20-50% by 2100. Some countries are expected to experience a 'population collapse'. Hans Groth, President of the St. Galler World Demographic & Ageing Forum, says that this development is a turning point in human history and has been predictable from a demographic perspective. The decline is attributed to low birth rates, which are responsible for around 80% of demographic changes between 1960 and 2021. The study warns that this will lead to a shortage of young people ('youth scarcity') and a decline in the working-age population in many countries. China's working-age population is expected to decline from 67% to 59% by 2050. The study also suggests that international telework and artificial intelligence (AI) could help mitigate the effects of the demographic shift. However, it also warns that the decline in population will put pressure on social security systems and pension funds, and that countries will need to adapt their social contracts to address these challenges.

**The Coming Scarcity of Humanity**
The author envisions a future where technology has advanced to the point where human labor is no longer necessary, and people are free to pursue their passions and interests. With the help of AI, robotics, and bioengineering, tasks that once required human effort are being automated, creating a paradox where technology improves productivity but also reduces the necessity for human labor. However, this shift enables people to focus on creative, ethical, and deeply personal contributions that machines cannot replicate. The author argues that rather than competing with AI, humans can harness it to amplify their unique strengths and create a world where scarcity is replaced by abundance through better resource management and technological breakthroughs. By 2100, global population growth is expected to decline, and humanity could achieve unprecedented levels of well-being through technological advancements like AI-driven healthcare, renewable energy solutions, and space colonization. The key to a thriving future is not resisting technological progress but integrating it with a human-centered approach. The author calls for a balance between leveraging technology to solve pressing issues and ensuring that humanity remains at the center of our progress.

**From Y2K Fears to Artificial Intelligence: How the World Has Changed in a Quarter Century**
According to the United Nations (UN), the world population was 6.1 billion in mid-2001, 8 billion in November 2022, and 8.2 billion in July 2024. By the end of the 21st century, in December 2100, the Earth's population is expected to reach 10.2 billion. Demographic data allows us to understand the demand for services and goods, as well as the environmental impact of our daily activities. Looking back at the significant events of the past few decades, we see how much progress has been made in improving living conditions and social, economic, technological, and political changes that will shape the third millennium. The start of the 21st century in 2001 marked the end of the fear of the Y2K bug, which threatened to collapse computer systems of most public and private services. Although the Y2K bug was only a threat, the world has experienced significant events such as the 9/11 attack in New York, a devastating tsunami in the Indian Ocean, the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid technological advancements leading to artificial intelligence, promising medical breakthroughs, and the emergence of new digital native generations.
