**Goldman Sachs Predicts Top Economies by 2075: Spain's Position Disappoints**
According to a report by Goldman Sachs, China, the United States, and India will be the top three economies by 2075, with seven of the top ten economies coming from emerging markets. China is expected to have a GDP of 57 trillion euros, followed by India with 52.5 trillion dollars and the United States with 51.5 trillion dollars. Spain, however, is expected to drop out of the top 15 by 2075, having peaked at 10th place in 1980 and fallen to 15th place in 2022. The report notes that the shift in the global economic balance is driven by the demographic growth of developing economies, particularly in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Egypt. Goldman Sachs acknowledges that making projections 50 years in advance is inherently uncertain, but believes that the long-term trends in population, capital, and technology will shape the future GDP.

**Canary Islands to Lead Spain's Economic Growth in 2025**
Canary Islands are expected to lead the economic growth in Spain in 2025 with a 3.4% increase in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), according to BBVA Research. The entity also forecasts the creation of 37,000 new jobs in the next two years. The economist chief, Miguel Cardoso, attributes this growth to the strong tourism sector and the good behavior of internal demand. However, he warns of a potential slowdown in 2026 due to external factors such as the uncertainty of US commercial policy, EU fiscal consolidation policies, and the volatility of financial markets. Cardoso also notes that the construction sector can only cover 20% of the demand for housing in the archipelago, which will continue to drive up prices. He suggests that an exhaustive analysis by sectors and support for companies to absorb the additional costs would be 'recommended'.

**Real Wage Growth in Europe: Turkey Leads the Way**
According to the OECD report 'Taxation of Labour Income in 2025' and Eurostat data, Turkey had the highest nominal wage growth in 2024, with a 82.9% increase compared to 2023. However, when adjusted for inflation, the real wage growth was 15.5%. The high inflation rate of 58.3% in Turkey contributed to this growth. Rumania followed Turkey with a nominal wage growth of 20.9% and a real wage growth of 14.3%. Bulgaria had a real wage growth of 9.2%, with a nominal wage growth of 12% and an inflation rate of 2.6%.

The UK had a growth of 1.6%, while France had the lowest growth at 0.7%. Four countries had a negative real wage growth, meaning that wages did not keep pace with inflation. The largest decline was in Belgium, with a 1% decline in 2024. Finland and Iceland also had a negative growth, with a decline of 0.9% and 0.7% respectively. Luxembourg had a small decline of 0.4%.

**Spain's Economic Growth Masks a Troubling Reality**
Spain's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew a modest 1.1% in the first quarter of 2025, but the data hides a concerning reality: 6 out of 10 major economic sectors are in decline, with their nominal GDP decreasing. The industry and agriculture sectors are holding up, while commerce and hospitality are contributing to growth. However, key sectors such as finance, IT, professional services, and public administration are falling sharply. Is Spain growing on the surface, but weakening from within?

**Economic Hotels Surge in Spain, Surpassing Luxury Segment**
The economic hotel segment in Spain has seen a surge in investment, surpassing the luxury segment for the first time since the pandemic. According to CBRE, the first quarter of 2025 saw transactions worth €96 million, accounting for 17% of the total €564 million invested in the sector between January and March. This is a significant increase from the same period in 2024, where the economic segment received €24 million. The strong growth of economic hotels can be attributed to the rising hotel prices in Spain, with an average nightly rate of €160 in 2024. Investors have accelerated their expansion plans in Spain to capture the growing demand for affordable alternatives. Accor, B&B, and Easyhotel are among the companies leading the charge, with Accor having the largest presence in Spain with 76 economic hotels. CBRE predicts a strong year for the hotel sector, with 220 hotels and 23,000 rooms expected to be added, with 25% of them being luxury and 50% concentrated in Málaga, Madrid, Canarias, and Cádiz. 'The hotel sector confirms its dynamism in the first quarter, both operationally and in terms of investment,' said Jorge Ruiz, CBRE's hotel expert in Iberia. 'The recent drop in interest rates is expected to attract more institutional investors to the market, which will undoubtedly bring more dynamism to the sector.'

In Europe, we need larger companies and startups, that's why one of the big news of this year in South Summit is our Growth Camp, a meeting point for those who shape the innovation of tomorrow.' The mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, described the event as 'the best window of Madrid to the world in the field of innovation and entrepreneurship.'

**US to Release Key Economic Data This Week, Focusing on Inflation Indicators**
The US will release several important economic data this week, with a focus on inflation indicators. The three major US stock indexes fell last week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.16%, the S&P 500 down 0.47%, and the Nasdaq down 0.27%. International oil prices rose sharply, with US oil prices up 4.68% and Brent oil prices up 4.27%. The UK and US have reached a trade agreement, easing trade tensions between the two largest oil-consuming countries. However, the geopolitical situation remains tense, with the US imposing further sanctions on Iranian oil, leading to concerns about oil supply shortages. These factors have driven up oil prices. The precious metals market also performed strongly last week, with international gold prices rising over 3%. The market is still watching the US's trade talks with major trading partners, as well as the decline in the US dollar index and the increase in risk aversion sentiment, which have driven up international gold prices. This week, the US will release several key economic data reflecting inflation levels, including the April consumer price index (CPI) on Tuesday. Although the US CPI data unexpectedly cooled last month, analysts believe that US government policies, such as tariffs, may push up inflation in the coming months, affecting the Federal Reserve's monetary policy path. The US will also release the April producer price index (PPI) and retail sales data on Thursday. The 3% growth in US retail sales in March, driven by panic buying due to tariffs, is expected to be unsustainable, with labor market weakness likely to emerge soon, according to a report by Citigroup. The eurozone will release its first-quarter GDP data on the same day, as well as the UK's first-quarter GDP data. According to preliminary data released by the European Union's statistics office, the eurozone's GDP grew 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter, with Germany's GDP growing 0.2% as expected, and France, Spain, and Italy's GDP growing 0.1%, 0.6%, and 0.3% respectively. Economists believe that the eurozone's economic confidence will continue to decline in April, and that US tariffs will impact the global economy, potentially leading to a slowdown in the eurozone's economic growth over the next six months.

**Immigration Drives European Economic Growth, Says European Central Bank**
The European Central Bank (BCE) has stated that immigration has driven the growth of the European economy since 2019, particularly in Spain. According to the BCE, the population of foreign workers has increased from 11.6% of the total population at the beginning of the period to 13.8%. This trend is relevant as it has sustained economic growth and job creation, especially in sectors affected by labor shortages. The BCE's report highlights that foreign workers have contributed significantly to economic growth, with their employment rates increasing and their unemployment rates decreasing since the COVID-19 pandemic. The report also notes that foreign workers are more likely to have temporary contracts, which may indicate difficulties in securing permanent employment. The BCE emphasizes the importance of aligning the qualifications of foreign workers with labor market requirements to improve their job stability and productivity. The report concludes that the growth of the European economy would have been much slower without the presence of foreign workers. In Spain, the influx of foreign workers has contributed significantly to economic growth, complementing the positive contribution of the national population in the labor force. The report highlights the importance of the sectors related to care, which are more resilient to economic fluctuations and may mitigate the impact of future crises on immigrant employment and public opinion.

**European Economy Grows 0.4% in Q1 2025, Spain's Economy Among the Fastest Growing**
The European economy grew by 0.4% in the eurozone and 0.3% in the EU in the first quarter of 2025, according to the first estimate published by Eurostat. In the last quarter of 2024, the expansion of the economy was 0.2% lower in the eurozone, while in the EU it was 0.1% higher. Compared to the first quarter of last year, the PIB grew by 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively. Spain's economy was the second to grow the most between January and March, with a 0.6% increase in its PIB, just behind Ireland (3.2%) and equal to Lithuania (0.6%). The German economy grew by 0.2% after a 0.2% decline between October and December 2024, while the Italian economy grew by 0.3%, 0.1% higher than in the last quarter of the year. The French economy also performed better, growing by 0.1% after a 0.1% decline in the last quarter of 2024, while the Dutch economy's growth slowed to 0.1%, 0.2% less. The European economy's growth is in line with the expectations of the European Central Bank, which predicted a 'modest' growth in the first three months of the year, but warns of increased risks for the eurozone due to the 'exceptional uncertainty', especially due to trade tensions, according to its vice-president, Luis de Guindos. The ECB expects the impact of the trade tension to be mainly felt in terms of growth, rather than inflation, and last month reduced its forecast for the PIB growth in the eurozone for 2025 by 0.2%, to 0.9%. The International Monetary Fund also reduced its projection by 0.2%, to 0.8%, and lowered its forecasts for France (0.6%), Italy (0.4%), and Germany, whose economy is expected to stagnate this year. The exception is the Spanish economy, for which it raised its projection to 2.5%.

**Spanish Economy to Grow More Than Expected in 2025**
The Bank of Spain has announced that the Spanish economy will grow more than expected in 2025, continuing a very expansive cycle that puts our country at the forefront of growth in the EU. While most countries are revising their growth forecasts downwards, Spain is expected to grow more than initially estimated. In contrast to Germany's stagnation, with a forecast growth of 0.3%, and a weak growth in the eurozone of 1.1%, Spain's GDP is expected to grow by 2.7%, nearly three times the European average. According to the Bank of Spain, this growth is driven by employment, which is a positive sign for the Spanish economy.

**Spain's Economy to Grow 2.4% in 2024, Eight Times Faster than Germany**
Mapfre's economic studies predict that Spain's economy will continue to grow, with a 2.4% increase in GDP this year, eight times more than Germany's 0.3% growth. The main factors behind this growth are the strong demand for credit, the increase in hotel prices, and the indexing of salaries. The inflation rate is expected to be around 2.5% this year, but will decrease to 1.9% by 2026, below the European Central Bank's target of 2%. The Spanish economy is expected to grow 1.7% in 2026, while the Eurozone will experience a weak performance, with a 1.1% growth in GDP this year and 1.4% in 2026. The US economy, on the other hand, is expected to grow 2.5% in 2025 and 2% in 2026, driven by a strong labor market, robust consumption, and firm investment. However, the Trump administration's economic policies are a source of uncertainty, particularly with regards to trade tariffs.

**Spain's Economy Expected to Grow 2.3% in 2025, Making it a Key Driver of the Eurozone**
According to the Barómetro de Riesgo País y Sectorial de Coface, Spain's economy is expected to grow by 2.3% in 2025, making it one of the main drivers of the eurozone. This is an improvement of two-tenths from the previous year's growth rate of 2.1%. The Spanish economy is expected to show strength this year, although at a lower rate than in 2024, when the PIB ended the year with a 3.2% increase. Coface predicts a slight improvement in global growth for 2025, reaching 2.7% (up from 2.6% in the previous estimate). This revision is mainly due to the unexpected resilience of the US economy, which compensates for the persistent weakness of the eurozone. However, 2025 does not seem to be a calmer year than 2024. According to analysts, although the electoral uncertainties of last year have dissipated, the horizon is far from being clear and the risks 'have rarely seemed so high'. The US economy is expected to grow by 2.2%, China by 4.3%, and Japan by 1.4%. Emerging countries, such as Brazil, are expected to grow by 2%, and India by 5.9%.

**Spain’s economy far outperforms eurozone peers to grow 3.2% in 2024**
Spain's economy has outperformed its eurozone peers, growing by 3.2% in 2024, driven by strong exports, tourism, and consumer spending. According to Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo, 'Spain keeps leading the eurozone growth, with a GDP increase four times higher than the eurozone as a whole.' The government has raised its forecast for this year from 2.4% to 3.2%, and the Bank of Spain has raised its 2025 growth forecast to 2.5%. The IMF predicts Spain will expand faster than other advanced economies, including Germany, Japan, France, Britain, and Italy. However, analysts also point to Spain's below-par GDP per capita in Western Europe and its snail-paced growth since 2007.

**Spain's economy far outperforms eurozone peers to grow 3.2% in 2024**
Spain's economy has outperformed its eurozone peers, growing 3.2% in 2024, driven by strong exports, tourism, and consumer spending. According to Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo, 'this is a reason for everyone to be proud, even more so in this uncertain context.' The government has raised its forecast for this year from 2.4% to an expected 3.5% growth, with exports and household consumption growing 3% and 3.7% respectively in the final quarter of 2024. The service sector also performed strongly, with a 3.9% year-over-year increase. Tourism, which represents 13% of the economy, has driven the sector, with a record 94 million tourists visiting Spain last year. Analysts predict that Spain's economy will maintain its growth in 2025, with a tight labor market and high growth in real household income, but warn that international trade tensions and domestic political instability may temper optimism.

**Spain's Economy Leads Eurozone Growth with 3.2% Increase in 2024**
Spain's economy led the growth in the eurozone in 2024, with a 3.2% increase in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), five tenths more than in 2023. The GDP grew 0.8% in the fourth quarter, according to the National Institute of Statistics (INE). This marks the fourth consecutive year of growth for the Spanish economy, exceeding the government's projections of a 2.7% growth. The Ministry of Economy stated that 'the growth of the Spanish economy remains balanced, with positive contributions from both domestic and external demand.' They added that 'the growth has been driven by domestic demand, which contributed 2.8 points to the GDP growth, and the good performance of the external sector, which added four tenths to the annual growth.' The data reflects the strength and balanced growth of the Spanish economy, which is being confirmed by major national and international organizations. Spain continues to lead the growth in the eurozone, with a GDP increase that is four times higher than the eurozone's.

**Spanish Economy Surpasses Expectations with 3.2% Growth in 2024**
The Spanish economy has exceeded expectations, growing by 3.2% in 2024 due to the strong impact of tourism and exports. According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the data confirms the government's predictions of a 3.1% increase in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The government expects the economy to grow by 2.4% in 2025, which would be a slight deceleration compared to the strong performance in 2024. However, this would still be a significant growth rate compared to Spain's European partners. The economy grew by 0.8% in the fourth quarter, following a 0.8% growth in the second and third quarters, and a 1% growth in the first quarter. The data from the National Accounts confirms that Spain is consolidating its position as the locomotive of Europe, with the GDP growing three times faster than the eurozone in 2024. The value of the GDP at current prices for the entire year 2024 was 1.593.136 million euros, a 6.3% increase from 2023. The strong growth in 2024 was also influenced by the carryover effect from 2023. The INE revised its calculations in mid-year, increasing the growth rate for 2023 from 2.5% to 2.7%. The productivity of the economy is a negative aspect of this high growth, as it is largely driven by the services sector, which is not characterized by high productivity. Spain's productivity level remains below pre-pandemic levels, despite the increase in employment. The investment of companies has had a worse evolution than expected, despite European funds, although it improved in the last quarter. Household consumption has continued to drive the economy, with domestic demand contributing 2.8 points to the economic growth of 2024, a 1.1 point increase from the previous year. The Minister of Economy, Carlos Cuerpo, stated that 'Spain continues to lead the growth in the eurozone, with a GDP increase that is four times higher than that of the eurozone'. The minister added that the data published by Statistics 'reflects the strength and balanced growth of the Spanish economy, which is being corroborated day by day by the main national and international organizations.'

**Spain's Economy Grows 3.2% in 2024, Solidifying its Position as the Locomotive of Europe**
Spain's economy grew by 3.2% in 2024, solidifying its position as the locomotive of Europe. This growth is a continuation of the 2.7% in 2023 and 6.2% in 2022. The government has already announced that the PIB (GDP) will exceed 2.5% in 2025. The growth is attributed to the country's openness to the outside world, with tourism as a key driver, as well as the increase in exports of high-value-added services. Additionally, the arrival of immigrants and their incorporation into the labor market, as well as the government's economic policies, have contributed to the growth. The Minister of Economy highlights that Spain is leading the growth of its partners, with a PIB increase that is four times higher than that of the eurozone. The country's labor market is also performing well, with a 2.19% increase in employment and a 10.6% decrease in unemployment. The government's policies, such as the increase in the minimum wage and the reduction of temporary contracts, have helped to mitigate the effects of the energy crisis and inflation. The European Union's recovery plan has also contributed to the growth. However, some experts point out that the growth masks underlying issues of precarity and vulnerability, and that the government's policies have not addressed these issues sufficiently.

**Spain's Economy Expected to Grow 3.1% in 2024, Four Times Faster than Eurozone**
The Spanish government has welcomed the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) decision to improve its growth forecasts for Spain in 2024 and 2025. According to the IMF, Spain's economy is expected to grow by 3.1% in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025. This is a significant improvement, especially considering that the IMF has lowered its growth forecasts for Spain's main European partners. As a result, Spain has solidified its position as the developed country with the highest growth rate last year, surpassing the growth rates of economies like the US and the main European countries. The government has also emphasized that Spain will continue to be the largest economy in the eurozone with the highest growth rate in 2025 and 2026, with its growth being nearly four times higher than that of the eurozone in 2024. 'This improvement in prospects for Spain occurs in a context where the IMF revises downward its forecasts for our main European partners,' said the Department led by Carlos Cuerpo. 'In fact, Spain's growth would have been almost four times higher than that of the eurozone in 2024 and will continue to lead in 2025 and 2026,' highlighted the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Enterprise.
