**Trump's 2030 Plan: A Complex and Ambitious Agenda**
According to Minister Cossío, a recently discovered book, 'Project 2025, Mandate for Leadership, a conservative promise' (Heritage Foundation), reveals the goals of the group that directs Trump for 2030. The book, a collection of strategic essays, is extensive and time-consuming to read, but necessary to understand the current situation. Cossío notes that the Trump of 2025 is more ambitious and complex than the one in 2016-2020, with plans to attack top American universities, repeat the 'reloaded' narrative with Mexico, and implement a new global tariff project. The book, which repeats the phrase 'Mexico's moment of glory ended with the triumph of narco-trafficking,' aims to portray Mexico as a migration problem, not a commercial partner. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has detailed a plan to regain control of the US, with the voice of Steve Bannon, a former advisor to Trump, in the background. Cossío suggests reading and studying the book to understand the enemy's plan and to form groups of thought, write, and discuss the implications.

**Trump's Cuts to USAID Will Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under the age of five. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.'

**Threatening Letter to Trump: A Mexican Man's Detention and the Unlikely Culprit**
A Mexican man, Ramón Morales, was detained and imprisoned after a threatening letter was sent to Donald Trump, allegedly written by Morales. However, an investigation by CNN revealed that the letter was likely a trap set by someone else, who had been a victim of a robbery and assault and was trying to get Morales deported before their trial. The person, who is currently in prison, called from jail to ask for the specific addresses where the letters were sent. The Milwaukee Police Department is investigating a case of identity theft and intimidation of a victim related to this case. Morales has a history of entering the US illegally, with nine instances between 1998 and 2005. His criminal record includes arrests for hit-and-run, property damage, and disorderly conduct with a domestic violence aggravation. Morales' lawyer, Noem, initially posted his picture and wrote, 'All politicians and members of the media should take note of these repeated threats against President Trump's life and tone down their rhetoric.' However, after the investigation, Noem did not comment further. 'We do not consider the threat to be credible', said the investigators. Morales remains in prison.

**Bolsonaro Claims He Will Win 2026 Election with Trump's Help**
Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro stated that he will win the 2026 election with the help of US President Donald Trump. Bolsonaro compared his loss in the 2022 election to Trump's loss in 2020 and celebrated Trump's return to power. He said, 'We will win with the help of God and also the help of another country from the north. Those who think we are the only ones who can reverse this system are wrong. We need help from third parties and it has come at the right time.' Bolsonaro is currently ineligible to run for office until 2030 due to a conviction in the Electoral Court, but he insists he will run in the next year. He also faces a trial related to the 2022 coup plot and could face over 40 years in prison if convicted. Bolsonaro defended his son, Eduardo, who left the country in March, saying he would be imprisoned if he stayed in Brazil. Eduardo is being investigated for possible crimes of coercion, obstruction of investigation, and violent abolition of the democratic state of law.

**Savannah Chrisley slams 'sex' rumors as parents Todd and Julie are pardoned by Trump**
Savannah Chrisley, 27, has denied rumors that she slept her way to get a presidential pardon for her parents, Todd and Julie Chrisley. President Donald Trump pardoned Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of a $30 million bank fraud and tax evasion scheme, freeing them from prison after nearly two and a half years. Savannah said, 'the biggest misconception right now is I either paid for a pardon or slept for a pardon.' She explained that she spent countless hours and money to advocate for her parents' release, saying, 'I was never too good to ask' and that she had to 'fight' and be 'relentless' to make it happen. Savannah rejoiced as Trump personally called her to let her know her parents will be freed, with Julie set to be released in 2028 and Todd in 2032.

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**'It behooves us to be prepared': Gov. Walz, other Minnesota agencies weigh in on rumors Trump will pardon Derek Chauvin**
Minnesota officials, including Gov. Tim Walz, are preparing for the possibility that President Donald Trump could pardon former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin's federal conviction in connection with the murder of George Floyd. Walz stated, 'If Donald Trump exercises his constitutional right to do so, whether I agree -- and I strongly disagree with him -- if he issues that pardon we will simply transfer Derek Chauvin to serve out his 22-and-a-half years in prison in Minnesota.' Chauvin is serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison and a 22.5-year sentence in Minnesota state prison. His expected release from federal prison is in November 2037, and from state custody is set for December 2035. Minneapolis officials have acknowledged the rumors of a potential pardon and are being cautious in preparing for any civil unrest that could erupt. They have stated that Chauvin would remain behind bars serving his state sentence even if his federal charges are pardoned.

**We sat down with Jair Bolsonaro. Facing prison, he's pining for Trump.**
Jair Bolsonaro, the former president of Brazil, is facing trial for allegedly plotting to assassinate his rivals and stay in power after his 2022 election loss. Despite being out of power and unable to run for office until 2030, Bolsonaro remains confident that he will find a way back to power. He has been trying to galvanize mass support for another presidential bid and pressure the electoral authorities into overturning his political disqualification. Bolsonaro has also been trying to reconcile his own downfall, scared of prison and death, and has been seen as a man reckoning with his own downfall. He has been described as 'bereft, orphaned' when talking about his former ally, Donald Trump, who has yet to mention him since his return to the White House. Bolsonaro has said that he believes he can beat the charges against him and has a strategy forming, a belief that his arguments are better suited for the streets than the courtroom. He has returned to holding large rallies and has demanded legal amnesty, contested his political disqualification and announced plans to run again in 2026.

**Steve Bannon Predicts Trump's Imprisonment if Democrats Win in 2028**
Steve Bannon, a former advisor to President Donald Trump, predicts that Trump will go to prison if the Democrats win in 2028. Bannon also believes that Trump will seriously consider running for a third term. Bannon, who was convicted in October 2024 of contempt of Congress and is expected to go on trial in February 2025 for fundraising for the border wall, said, 'Dios no permita que no ganemos' (God forbid we don't win) in 2028. He attributes Trump's declining popularity to his 'destructor' strategy for the federal government, increasing tariffs, and his obsession with annexing Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal. Bannon also thinks that if Trump's popularity continues to decline, especially in the economy, the Democrats may regain control of Congress. Trump has announced plans to create a 'tarjeta dorada' (golden card) to attract millionaires to the US. Bannon believes that the Democrats are doing everything they can to stop Trump, including trying to impeach him and take control of the House of Representatives.

**Trump May Stay in Office Until 2037 Using Constitutional Loopholes**
According to the Daily Mail, US President Donald Trump may remain in office until 2037 using constitutional loopholes. 'In reality, the possibility for Trump to stay in office for a third term - and potentially a fourth by January 2037, when he will be 90 years old - is not only possible but also simple, thanks to the glaring loophole in the amendment', writes the Daily Mail. The 22nd amendment to the US Constitution allows for a loophole that bypasses the restriction on a person holding the presidency for more than two consecutive terms. The amendment explicitly prohibits the re-election of presidents who have already served two terms, but does not establish restrictions on returning to power through other circumstances, such as resignation or death of the incumbent leader. According to the tabloid, for Trump to occupy the presidency for a fourth term, he would need to resign from the presidency before the 2032 elections and then enter the electoral process as a candidate for vice president in a pair with another nominal candidate, for example, with the current Vice President JD Vance. Former US President advisor Steve Bannon expressed the opinion that Trump may face the threat of imprisonment if the Democratic Party candidate wins the next presidential election. He noted that despite the enthusiasm of Republicans after their victory in the elections, Trump's prospects may be unfavorable, reports RT.

**Bolsonaro Claims Being Barred from 2026 Presidential Election is 'Denial of Democracy'**
Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing a trial for a suspected coup d'etat and is ineligible to run for office until 2030, has claimed that being barred from running in the 2026 presidential election is 'a denial of democracy.' 'I want to tell those who don't like me in Brasilia: elections without Bolsonaro is a denial of democracy in Brazil,' he said, standing on a stage with a poster of US President Donald Trump, who was also a victim of an attack during the 2024 US presidential campaign. Bolsonaro's supporters are calling for amnesty for those convicted of participating in the January 8, 2023 riots in Brasilia, in which thousands of supporters stormed and vandalized the presidential palace, parliament, and the Supreme Court. The riots were one of the reasons why Bolsonaro was charged with a suspected coup d'etat in February. He is accused of being the leader of a 'criminal organization' that conspired to maintain him in power and faces a sentence of over 40 years in prison. Bolsonaro claims he is a victim of political persecution and hopes to have his ineligibility overturned or reduced so he can run for president again. 'For now, I am a candidate,' he said. 'Why should I deprive myself of my political capital to support another candidate? I will wait for the right moment.' He hopes to stage a comeback like Donald Trump, who returned to the White House despite his legal troubles, and is counting on Trump's influence to help him.

**Nation | Theranos fraudster Elizabeth Holmes loses her appeal**
Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has lost her appeal of her fraud conviction. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit upheld lower court rulings finding Holmes guilty of felony fraud, sentencing her to more than 11 years in prison and ordering her to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in restitution. Holmes' lawyers argued that the trial judge improperly allowed some testimony and prohibited other testimony, but the panel rejected these claims on a point-by-point basis. Holmes is currently incarcerated at a federal minimum-security prison camp outside Houston and is scheduled to be released in March 2032. Her lawyers did not immediately respond to questions about whether Holmes planned to appeal or seek a pardon from President Donald Trump.

**Bolsonaro Manoeuvres to Avoid Prison and Run for President Again**
Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is trying to avoid prison by manipulating the law and seeking the support of the Congress. He has been accused of leading a coup attempt in 2023 and is facing several charges, including corruption and abuse of power. Bolsonaro has said that the accusations against him are 'vague' and that 'the world is watching what is happening in Brazil.' He is trying to modify the 'clean slate' law, which he previously supported, to avoid being prosecuted. He is also pushing for amnesty laws to pardon those involved in the coup attempt. The former president is facing a maximum penalty of 43 years in prison and is currently banned from running for office until 2030. President Lula has said that if the judge finds Bolsonaro guilty, he will have to pay for his mistakes. Bolsonaro's allies, including Donald Trump, are also trying to pressure the judge and the Congress to support him. Trump's media company has filed a complaint against the judge, Alexandre de Moraes, in the US, accusing him of censorship. Bolsonaro's plans to avoid prison are seen as a 'notable contorsionism normativo' and are not new in Brazil, where corruption cases have been annulled in the past.
