**Keegan Bradley overtakes Tommy Fleetwood, wins 2025 Travelers Championship on final hole**
Keegan Bradley won the 2025 Travelers Championship on the final hole, overtaking Tommy Fleetwood. Bradley's comeback was sparked by Fleetwood's bogey on the 18th hole, and he sank a birdie putt to secure his second win at the event in three years. Bradley finished 15-under through 72 holes, claiming the $3.6 million prize and 700 FedExCup points. Fleetwood, who had a three-shot lead going into the final round, bogeyed the 16th and 18th holes, while Bradley picked up a stroke with a 36-foot birdie putt on the 15th hole. 'Really, really crazy,' Bradley said. 'I felt like I was just too far behind the whole day. I was just chasing, chasing. And then after that bogey on 15, I just - you know, thought 'I don't know, anything can happen around here.' I just had that feeling that I was just too far behind the whole day, but I came in here and made the putts when I needed to.' Fleetwood said, 'Search goes on, I guess. When (the first win) happens it will be very, very sweet. I don't know, really. I said yesterday, and I know I keep saying it but I haven't really been in a position where I've really been in contention to really worry about when my win might come.'

**Wimbledon 2025: A Rich Edition of Novelties and Technology**
Wimbledon 2025 promises to be a rich edition of novelties and technology, with a renewed rivalry between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. While maintaining its traditional rules and customs, such as the requirement for players to wear 'predominantly white' uniforms, this year has seen several changes, including the final matches no longer being held at 2 PM local time, but two hours later (5 PM Italian time), and the introduction of Electronic Line Calling (ELC) technology, which will signal out-of-bounds even during rallies, not just on serves. The prize money will be the highest in Wimbledon's history, increasing by 7% from the previous edition, with the winner receiving over 3.5 million euros. If Alcaraz repeats his victory from last year, he will earn an additional 350,000 pounds (over 400,000 euros) compared to 12 months ago. The same prize money will be awarded to the women's singles winner, with a total prize fund of 62.6 million euros. Even those who do not have success on the Church Road courts will receive generous consolation prizes, with losers in the first round receiving over 77,000 euros. Two digital innovations based on artificial intelligence will also be introduced, including the 'Match Chat' assistant, which will respond in real-time to fans' questions, and the 'Likelihood to Win' tool, which will update the predicted win percentage for each player in real-time. The tournament will also have a strong focus on the public, with around 40,000 spectators expected each day during the two weeks of the Championships. However, one individual, who was previously banned from approaching Emma Raducanu, was denied entry to the tournament after attempting to purchase tickets. Alcaraz, the defending champion, and world No. 1 Jannik Sinner are the most anticipated players, with Sinner looking to improve on his performance from last year, when he was eliminated early at Halle. However, he is confident that the slower grass courts of Wimbledon will suit him better than the faster courts in Germany.

**2025 Truist Championship scores, takeaways: Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas reach top five entering Moving Day - CBSSports.com**
The 2025 Truist Championship is underway, with Keith Mitchell leading the pack at 12 under par after the second round. Mitchell shot a 67 on Friday to maintain his lead, while Shane Lowry moved into second place with a 5-under 65. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas are tied for fourth at 7 under, five shots back of Mitchell. The course record is 65, but calm conditions on Thursday allowed 10 players to beat that number. Friday's rain-soaked second round proved more challenging, with the average score increasing by more than three shots. Lowry took advantage of an early tee time and got off to a hot start before the rain picked up, while Mitchell held down the back nine to maintain his lead. The leaderboard is condensed, with 30 players from 4-under to 7-under, setting up a volatile moving day on Saturday.

**New ARC-AGI 2 Benchmark Challenges AI Models to New Heights**
The benchmark ARC-AGI, used to measure the intelligence of AI models, has become so challenging that its original test is no longer sufficient. The creators have developed a new version, ARC-AGI 2, which is designed to be even more difficult for AI models while remaining accessible to humans. The new benchmark includes 120 tasks, an increase from 100, and has eliminated tasks that can be solved using brute force or pre-defined algorithms. It also includes tests that address key aspects of logical thinking, such as symbolic interpretation, compositional reasoning, and contextual rule application. François Chollet, creator of Keras, introduced the ARC-AGI benchmark in 2019, and it has since become a reliable test for measuring AI intelligence. The ARC Prize competition will be held in 2025, with a new set of challenges that will push AI models to their limits. The competition has seen significant improvements, including a increased prize of $700,000 for the winner, doubled computational resources, and a longer participation period from March to November 2025. Despite the advancements in AI, the current models struggle to achieve high scores on the benchmark, with even the most advanced models like o3 from OpenAI only reaching a 5% score. In contrast, humans can solve the tasks with ease, highlighting the gap between human and AI reasoning.

Spaun, on the other hand, finished with birdies on two of his final five holes after scoring three bogeys across his first 11. The playoff will take place at TPC Sawgrass, with the winner to be determined by an aggregate score across three holes. McIlroy has a 3-2 record in playoffs, but Spaun is looking to take down the multi-time major champion in his first go at extra holes.
