**Portugal to Import More Energy from Spain, but Only Outside of Daylight Hours**
The REN (Redes Energéticas Nacionais) has decided to increase the limit of electricity imports from Spain, but only outside of daylight hours. According to the latest decision, the capacity of interconnection between Portugal and Spain, in the import direction, will remain limited to 1,000 MW between 09:00 and 19:00. However, this limit is extended to 2,200 MW in the remaining hours, from May 12 to 19. This measure is part of the ongoing process of stabilizing the Iberian electricity market (Mibel), following the general blackout that left Portugal, Spain, and part of France without electricity. The ENSO-E (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity) has announced the creation of a committee to investigate the causes of the blackout, which was classified as 'exceptional and severe'. The expert panel will prepare a factual report that will serve as the basis for the final report by October 28, 2025. The final report on the investigation will be published by September 30, 2026.

**US Aims to Accelerate Nuclear Power Development with 400% Capacity Increase by 2050**
According to a draft executive order obtained by The New York Times, US President Donald Trump is considering revising safety regulations to increase nuclear power capacity by 400% by 2050. The current capacity is 100 gigawatts (GW), and Trump aims to expand it to 400GW. The draft executive order includes plans to accelerate nuclear construction by revising federal safety regulations, and to make a decision on new reactor approvals within 18 months. The order also calls for a review of radiation exposure safety standards. Additionally, the US military will be required to support funding for next-generation reactors, and AI data centers will be designated as a core defense infrastructure. The order emphasizes the need for 'swift and decisive action to restart the nuclear renaissance in the US.'

**UBS Forecasts Significant Growth in GenAI Inference Demand**
UBS estimates that the demand for computation for GenAI inference will grow significantly across all sectors, despite investor concerns about tariffs and excessive AI infrastructure spending. According to the bank, the main US technology companies have reaffirmed their investment plans and highlighted that the demand for computation continues to outstrip supply. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, stated, 'The amount of computation we need due to agentive AI and reasoning is easily 100 times more than what we thought necessary at the same time last year.' UBS notes that the emergence of more complex methods such as Chain of Thought (CoT) is a key driver of increasing computational intensity. The bank defines four categories of use cases for GenAI: chatbots, enterprise AI, agentive AI, and physical AI. For chatbots like ChatGPT, the demand for computation is expected to grow from 10 exaFLOP/s in 2024 to 200 exaFLOP/s by 2030. For enterprise applications, such as fraud detection and contract synthesis, the needs for inference are expected to grow even more rapidly - from 15 to 440 exaFLOP/s over the same period. The most spectacular growth is expected from agentive AI, which includes autonomous customer support and workflow automation. UBS estimates that the demand for this segment could reach 14 zettaFLOP/s by 2030, marking a 'huge leap' compared to current needs, which are estimated to be in the hundreds of exaFLOP/s. Physical AI, which includes robotics and autonomous vehicles, may eventually require a computational power of the order of yottaFLOP/s as it evolves to replicate certain aspects of human cognition. The current installed GPU computing capacity is estimated to be around 4,000 exaFLOP/s (reaching 5,000 with Google's TPU), but UBS notes that a significant portion remains underutilized. 'Inference is often limited by GPU memory, meaning that the FLOP/s a chip can provide are well below its theoretical maximum - memory limitations leading to chips functioning at only 25% of their nominal FLOP/s,' explains the note. 'Even with these limitations, the available capacity might be sufficient for current chatbot needs, but far short of what will be needed for agentive and physical AI, which will require a completely different order of magnitude of computational power,' adds the note. In conclusion, UBS concludes that the growing role of inference in AI adoption, combined with increasing material requirements, supports continued investment in AI infrastructure. For investors, the bank considers 'any retreat from our 'AI' and 'Energy and Resources' stock picks as attractive entry points.'

**Data Centers in Orbit Could Make a Lot of Sense**
Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, suggests that acquiring Relativity Space aims to put data centers in orbit. This idea makes sense, given the rapidly increasing demand for computing capacity, mainly driven by AI developments. Current proposals, such as Google and Microsoft's nuclear plants, will come at a high energy cost of trillions of dollars and have a significant environmental impact. A McKinsey report estimates the cost of compute to be a $7 trillion race to scale data centers. The operation of AI data centers has a huge environmental impact, with heat dissipation being a major concern. A single data center can dissipate up to 50 MW of heat, equivalent to 438,000 MWh of heat in a year, highlighting the need for more sustainable solutions.

**MIDF positive on US intention to scrap curbs on AI chip exports - TNGlobal**
MIDF Research views the US intention to scrap curbs on AI chip exports as a positive development for the data center value chain. According to MIDF, the removal of the 7% restriction on AI computing power allocation by tech giants will allow for more AI capacities to be planned in countries like Malaysia. However, the research house notes that the outcome of government-to-government (G2G) negotiations will determine the country-based allocations for Malaysia. The AI Diffusion Rule, which sets a cumulative maximum installed base allocation of 790m total processing performance (TPP), may be doubled to 1.58b TPP under certain circumstances. MIDF views the removal of the 3-tier country system as a positive development, allowing tech giants to better plan their AI-enabled data center allocations without restrictions. The Trump administration plans to rescind some AI chip curbs introduced by the Biden administration and is drafting its own version of the rules, which may focus on direct negotiations with nations like the UAE or Saudi Arabia.

**EU eases gas storage targets amid concerns over energy prices**
The European Parliament has approved a measure to ease the EU's rules on filling gas storage facilities. This decision aligns with the concerns expressed by several member states that the current strict targets for gas storage could lead to an increase in energy prices across the bloc, according to a Reuters report. The adjustment of the rules reflects the ongoing debate within the EU about balancing the need for secure energy supplies with the necessity of managing energy costs for consumers and businesses. The EU's gas storage regulations were established in 2022 as a direct response to the energy crisis triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The subsequent supply shock caused unprecedented volatility and a dramatic increase in gas prices across Europe, raising concerns about the availability of fuel for heating and industrial processes during the winter months. The EU acknowledged the vulnerability revealed by this disruption and introduced mandatory gas storage requirements to create a strategic reserve. The main goal of these regulations was to ensure that member states maintain a minimum level of stored natural gas, thereby serving as a crucial buffer against potential future supply disruptions and price spikes. The stored fuel is intended to guarantee a stable energy supply for households and businesses throughout the winter season and mitigate the economic consequences of energy shortages. The regulations prescribe specific filling targets for gas storage facilities within established deadlines before each winter, with the aim of strengthening the EU's overall energy resilience and reducing its dependence on potentially unreliable suppliers. Governments supported a proposal last month to ease the rules for gas storage before winter. This decision was based on concerns that the existing requirement to reach 90% storage capacity by November 1 would drive up prices. The rule signaled to the market that European buyers needed to purchase significant gas volumes to meet this deadline. New gas storage target The European Parliament has approved a reduced target for gas storage filling at 83%. Member states will have the flexibility to reach this target at any time between October 1 and December 1. Legislators have said that countries should be allowed to deviate from the 83% target by up to four percentage points if unfavorable market conditions, such as high gas prices, arise. Thursday's vote suggests a greater likelihood of the EU's winter targets being eased. Subject to approval in the coming months, updated EU targets for storage filling for 2026 and 2027 will come into effect. These changes may also apply to the November target for the current year if they are approved in time. Negotiations between the EU and Parliament The Parliament and EU countries will negotiate the final regulations, with the aim of agreeing on a final agreement by July. The EU countries' negotiating position aligns with the amendments proposed by the Parliament on Thursday. Both parties advocate for a 10% reduction in the 90% target under challenging market conditions. Concerns over the economic consequences of US President Donald Trump's trade war and efforts to reduce Europe's gas storage needs have contributed to a decline in the EU's gas prices as a benchmark. Prices fell to their lowest level in nearly nine months last month, marking a continued decline since February.

**AICM seeks to increase its capacity before the 2026 World Cup**
The airlines are asking for priority to be given to infrastructure and lifting operational restrictions at the Mexico City International Airport (AICM) for the 2026 World Cup. The president of the National Chamber of Air Transport (Canaero), Cuitláhuac Gutiérrez, stated that for now, the priority is for the airport to be ready for the World Cup celebration, regardless of the increase in air operations. 'We believe that the airport, as they have announced, will seek to increase operations for everyone, also crossing very important works, which is the priority at the moment. As Canaero, we are requesting that they focus on the works that will take a long time,' said Gutiérrez in an interview. The Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste (ASUR) expects the restrictions on departure and arrival times to be reversed during the second semester of the year. Adolfo Castro, general director of ASUR, stated that national traffic has decreased significantly due to the limitation in the capacity of the AICM, a measure that is expected to end in the second half of the year. The AICM has requested authorization from the aeronautical authority to increase the number of allowed slots, this in the face of a greater demand for air travel and the proximity of the 2026 World Cup in Mexico, the United States and Canada. 'In my opinion, this restriction is excessive, considering that we have a runway and a half. A runway can support 50 operations per hour, so if we say a runway and a half, they should be 75. Today, with 43, the capacity is very low. That is a key factor,' detailed Castro in a call with analysts. Castro recalled that at the end of 2024, the government eliminated the restrictions on the growth of the Toluca airport, which was positive, since the Valley of Mexico generates 50% of the national traffic captured by ASUR. 'I think that by the end of the third quarter, the government will eliminate or change this restriction to at least return to the 52 operations per hour that we had at the end of 2023. Also, we have to take into account that next year we will have the World Cup in Mexico and it will be extremely important to have the connectivity of Mexico City,' added Castro. The representative of the World Cup organization for Mexico, Gabriela Cuevas, assured that the airport committee is analyzing all the options to improve the experience of travelers, including the increase in departure and arrival times. 'We are working in this group, with the Secretary of Tourism, with the AICM. What we are working with the authorities are the conditions and all the activities that will be carried out around it,' added Gutiérrez. Additionally, the airports of Guadalajara and Monterrey are experiencing expansion processes, rehabilitation of their passenger buildings, as well as the construction of other terminals. The government is also working on a series of attractions for travelers who arrive in the country not only to stay in the three World Cup host cities, but to distribute throughout the country.

**Trump Administration Plans to Lift Chip Export Restrictions for AI**
According to Bloomberg, US President Donald Trump plans to lift restrictions on the export of chips for artificial intelligence (AI), imposed by the Biden administration. The restrictions, set to take effect on May 15, would have limited chip exports to 120 countries, including China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, while allowing unrestricted exports to 17 US allies and Taiwan. However, the Trump administration plans to lift these restrictions as part of a broader effort to review export controls on semiconductors, which have been met with strong opposition from major tech companies and foreign governments. As stated in the report, 'The Trump administration will not apply the so-called AI rule when it takes effect on May 15.' A source close to the matter suggests that the US government may announce its decision as early as Thursday, May 8. This move comes after a Reuters report that AMD would lose $1.5 billion in 2025 due to chip export restrictions to China.

**AMD Confirms $1.5 Billion Revenue Decrease Due to US Export Restrictions**
AMD recently released its strong quarterly report, with a 36% year-over-year increase in revenue to $7.4 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. The data center department saw a 57% increase in revenue, while PC-related sales grew by 28%. However, AMD executives warned that the US export restrictions on China will result in a $1.5 billion revenue decrease for the company this year. AMD's CFO Jean Hu stated that due to the new round of export restrictions in April, the company expects a $1.5 billion revenue decrease in 2025. AMD's CEO Lisa Su also noted that the majority of the impact from the US-China chip export restrictions will be seen in the second and third quarters of this year, but she still expects the company's data center business to achieve 'strong double-digit' growth in AI chip revenue this year. Su emphasized that while the export restrictions present challenges, she remains optimistic about the overall demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure and expects the upcoming new chip products to boost sales in the second half of the year. She said, 'We're excited about the entire artificial intelligence business, and I think we'll continue to see its strength. Although there are some uncertainties, from an infrastructure perspective, this is one of the areas where we continue to invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure. Therefore, we expect strong growth in the second half of the year.'

**Intel Defies Trump's Restrictions, Continues to Serve Chinese Market**
According to a report by The Economist, Intel's CEO, Jensen Huang, visited Beijing last month with a clear message: the company will continue to serve the Chinese market without hesitation, but Washington was not pleased. Before his visit, the Trump administration imposed new restrictions on the export of AI chips, effectively banning the sale of Intel's latest H20 chip to China. Over the past few years, the US has intensified efforts to limit China's access to advanced semiconductors, particularly those used in AI applications. Since 2022, the restrictions have focused on high-performance chips with high processing power and data transfer capacity, which are essential for training AI models. Intel responded by releasing a special Chinese model, H800, which meets the allowed limits. However, after tightening the rules again in 2023, Intel developed the H20 chip, which is now also banned. Despite these restrictions, Chinese AI companies are still obtaining these chips. A global, hidden supply chain has emerged to circumvent export regulations. Some companies rent servers in external data centers, while others use mysterious intermediaries to purchase them. The new round of restrictions, which will take effect on May 15, targets not only hardware but also cloud service providers. However, the challenges of implementation remain. For example, the Johor region in southern Malaysia, near Singapore, has become a hub for data centers due to low electricity costs and ease of obtaining licenses. Major US tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle have invested there. According to Night Frank, the total capacity of data centers in Johor has increased from 10 megawatts in 2021 to over 1,500 megawatts by 2024. Johor has become a backdoor for Chinese companies, such as ByteDance (owner of TikTok), which has rented cloud capacity there, allowing them to access banned Intel chips. By 2027, SemiAnalysis estimates that about half of Johor's planned data center capacity will contain AI chips like those produced by Intel. Trade data supports this trend. Intel's advanced chips are produced in Taiwanese TSMC factories. In the first quarter of 2024, Taiwan exported graphics processing units to Malaysia worth $3.6 billion, roughly equal to the country's total exports in 2023. In March alone, exports reached $1 billion, three times the previous month. There are also direct smuggling operations, where chips are transferred through third countries not covered by US restrictions, and documents are forged to bypass customs, such as changing classifications or using fake companies. Eric Grunwald from the Artificial Intelligence Policy and Strategy Institute estimates that smuggled American chips accounted for 10% to 50% of China's AI model training capacity in 2023. Before the restrictions in 2022, China accounted for 22% of Intel's revenue, which dropped to 13%. In February, Singaporean police arrested three men for selling servers containing Intel chips worth $390 million, which were later believed to have been transferred to Malaysia. It is unclear if they ended up in China, but the financial incentive is present. Banned chips are now sold at a price difference of 30% to 50% in the gray market. Despite Intel's auditing efforts, it is extremely difficult to track the end-user of each chip, according to industry insiders. Implementing laws also faces familiar challenges. The Industry and Security Office, responsible for enforcing them, suffers from a lack of resources, with only one person managing the Southeast Asia and Australia region, despite being a key hub for gray trade. Moreover, the office faces a 12% budget cut this year. The report concludes that if the US wants to remain at the forefront of the AI race, it needs to accelerate innovation rather than tighten restrictions.

**Argentina Lifts Currency Restrictions, Allowing Citizens to Buy Gold Without Limits**
The Argentine government has lifted the currency restrictions, allowing citizens to buy gold without limits. Gold is considered a foreign currency, like the dollar or euro, and can be purchased without restrictions. This means that individuals can buy as much gold as they want without any limits. Gold is a safe-haven asset that can be used to protect savings during times of uncertainty. It can be purchased from banks, such as Banco Ciudad, or from traditional exchange houses. The current price of gold is around $144,000 per gram. According to a Bank of America report, the price of gold is expected to reach $3,350 per ounce in 2026, representing a significant increase. However, investing in gold has some challenges, including storage costs, liquidity issues, and price volatility. Investors can consider alternative options, such as gold ETFs or funds, which replicate the value of gold without the need for physical storage.

**US Copper Industry Calls for Export Restrictions to Promote Domestic Production**
According to a report by Reuters, the UK government announced that the UK's energy regulator expects to confirm major reforms to the grid connection this week to promote investment in clean energy and infrastructure projects. The new system, drafted by the National Grid operator and the energy industry, is expected to unlock up to $52.8 billion in grid investment annually. A Street View fund manager analysis suggests that with clean power supply nearing its annual peak and overall electricity demand easing during the spring period, the US power system is expected to reach a new milestone in energy transition in April. Data from energy think tank Ember shows that clean energy accounted for more than half of the US power supply in March, at 51% of all utility-scale power generation. Vietnam has revised its national power plan, aiming to significantly increase its power generation capacity by 2030 and focus on renewable energy. The Vietnamese government stated that to achieve these goals, Vietnam needs a total investment of $136.3 billion by 2030, equivalent to more than a quarter of its 2024 GDP. According to the new plan, solar power generation is expected to account for 25-31% of total power capacity by 2030, while onshore and offshore wind power generation is expected to rise from nearly zero to 14-16%. Notably, major US copper industry participants have called on US President Trump to restrict copper ore and scrap copper metal exports, rather than imposing tariffs on imports, to promote domestic production. A study by Citigroup shows that the US scrap copper supply is approximately 600,000 tons in 2024, equivalent to the production of some of the world's largest copper mines. Over half of it is directly shipped to the mainland for processing. However, any severe restrictions on US scrap copper supply would reshape the scrap copper market, which accounts for nearly a third of global copper supply.

**EU Countries Agree to Relax Gas Storage Regulations**
The European Union (EU) countries have agreed to relax the regulations on storing natural gas reserves before the winter, citing concerns that the current restrictions will drive up gas prices. According to the plan, EU countries will be allowed to fill their gas storage facilities to 90% of their capacity before the winter, with a 10% margin for flexibility. The final regulations will need to be negotiated with the European Parliament and will apply to the years 2026 and 2027, or as early as November this year if approved before the deadline. 'The current regulations are too restrictive and will lead to high gas prices,' said the EU ambassadors, who approved the plan at a meeting on April 11. The EU countries imported a record amount of gas from Russia in 2024, with 17.8 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) arriving in European ports, a 2 million ton increase from 2023, according to Rystad Energy data.

**USTR Report Criticizes Mexico's Trade Barriers and Restrictive Customs Practices**
The U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) annual report on foreign trade barriers highlights Mexico's restrictive customs practices as a significant obstacle for U.S. exporters. The report cites inconsistent implementation of customs procedures, lack of prior notice for regulatory changes, and specific import restrictions by port as major issues. A new regulation that requires suppliers to collect the Federal Taxpayer Registry (RFC) of recipients for low-value shipments (under $2,500) is incompatible with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (T-MEC) and disproportionately affects small U.S. exporters. The report also criticizes delays in approving health certificates and import permits for medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals, which can take 18-24 months due to COFEPRIS's lack of personnel and operational capacity. This uncertainty hinders business planning. In the energy sector, the USTR accuses Mexico of favoring state-owned companies, CFE and PEMEX, through the recent energy reform promoted by President Claudia Sheinbaum in January 2025, which requires CFE to control at least 54% of electricity generation, a barrier to private investment and potentially in conflict with the T-MEC. The report also mentions digital sector obstacles, including complex approval processes for cloud infrastructure based in the U.S. and informal pressures to use local data centers, which could be discriminatory. In telecommunications, the USTR warns that the dissolution of the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) in December 2024 could violate T-MEC commitments, as the treaty requires independent regulatory bodies. The report highlights agricultural trade restrictions, including the ban on glyphosate without scientific justification under WTO rules, and mentions that a T-MEC panel ruled in favor of the U.S. in December 2024, forcing Mexico to revoke restrictions in February 2025. The U.S. government has emphasized its commitment to closely monitoring the situation to ensure Mexico complies with its trade commitments and removes barriers affecting U.S. exporters.

**Ukraine to Implement Power Capacity Restrictions on February 28**
Ukrainian energy company Ukrenergo announced that on February 28, 2025, they will implement measures to limit power capacity, affecting industry and business. According to the company, household consumers are not expected to be disconnected. The restrictions are due to damage to energy infrastructure caused by Russian drone attacks. Ukrenergo urges consumers to use electricity sparingly due to the complex situation in Ukraine's energy system. This is not the first time such restrictions have been implemented, as on February 25, 2025, similar measures were introduced in the Odessa and Poltava regions. 'The time of application and the volume of restrictions may change throughout the day,' Ukrenergo noted.

**Ukrenergo: Measures to Limit Power Capacity for Industry and Business on February 28**
On Friday, February 28, Ukraine will implement measures to limit power capacity for industry and business. Disconnections for household consumers are not currently forecasted. According to the announcement, '28 лютого будуть застосовуватись заходи обмеження потужності для промисловості та бізнесу. Час застосування обмежень: 05:00 — 10:00 та 16:00 – 22:00. Відключення побутових споживачів наразі не прогнозується', — йдеться у повідомленні.' The reason for the temporary introduction of restrictions is damage to energy infrastructure due to Russian missile and drone attacks. 'Час застосування та обсяг обмежень протягом доби можуть змінитись. Стежте за інформацією на сайті чи офіційних сторінках обленерго вашого регіону у соцмережах. Будь ласка, споживайте електроенергію ощадливо', — зазначили у компанії.

**Ukraine to Implement Power Capacity Limitations Due to Energy System Damage**
Ukrenergo announced that on Friday, February 21, Ukraine will implement measures to limit power capacity for industry and business due to damage to the energy system. According to the company, the restrictions will be in place from 05:00 to 21:00, with no planned power outages for household consumers. The reason for the temporary introduction of restrictions is the damage to energy facilities caused by Russian drone and missile attacks. The company stated, 'We are working to restore the damaged equipment as quickly as possible.' The company also noted that the time and scope of the restrictions may change, but the need for energy-saving consumption will remain throughout the day.

**US Tightens Rules on Export of AI Chips**
The outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden has introduced new restrictions on the export of American chips for training neural networks and AI developments. The export rules, which will take effect in 120 days, set limits on the total volume of sales of computational power of graphics processing units (GPUs) to most countries in the world. The restrictions aim to control global access to AI and expand restrictions on modern GPUs, which are necessary for creating high-performance computing clusters used in AI work. The first group of 18 countries, including the US, will be affected, but only indirectly. Companies and organizations in these countries will be allowed to place no more than 50% of their AI computing power outside the US and no more than 25% outside the first group of countries. The second group of around 120 countries, including Singapore, Israel, and the UAE, will face stricter restrictions, with a limit of 790 million total processing performance (TPP) by 2027, equivalent to about 50,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. The third group, which includes Russia, China, and Iran, will be banned from buying advanced chips necessary for creating powerful computing clusters. According to analyst Alexei Boyko, the new restrictions will affect Russian companies working in high-performance computing and AI, making it harder for them to buy necessary foreign microchips. However, Boyko notes that the ban on imports has existed before and is unlikely to be fully enforced. NVIDIA's leadership has criticized the decision, saying it will harm the global computing industry and push the world towards alternative technologies. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, has previously stated that the restrictions will only lead to NVIDIA losing the Chinese market to new players from China. The future administration of President Donald Trump is expected to maintain similar views on the competitive threat from China, including in AI technologies.

**US Imposes New Restrictions on Chip Export**
The United States has imposed new restrictions on the export of chips, particularly those related to artificial intelligence (AI). The new rules aim to limit the export of these chips to countries like China and Russia, but also affect other nations such as Brazil. The US government has divided the world into three groups, determining the level of access to technology each country will have. 18 allied countries are exempt from the new rules and can import US-made chips without restrictions. Other countries, including Brazil, will have limited access to graphics processing units (GPUs) made by US suppliers. They can buy up to 50,000 GPUs, but agreements between governments may increase the limit to 100,000 GPUs if they align with US objectives on export control, renewable energy, and technological security. The US has also designated about 120 countries as 'countries of no concern', where entities can obtain a 'National Verified End User' (NVEU) status, allowing them to buy a limited amount of computing capacity, subject to 'high security standards'. Countries considered 'concerning' to US security, such as Russia, China, North Korea, Syria, and Iran, will have a total block on access to US technology. The US aims to prevent the misuse of advanced AI systems, which could exacerbate national security risks, including the development of mass destruction weapons, cyber operations, and human rights abuses. The new policy includes a 120-day comment period, during which companies and stakeholders can review and provide feedback. However, it is expected that the rules will take effect before the end of this period. The incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump will have time to evaluate and comment on the policy before it takes effect. Reactions from US companies have been mixed, with Nvidia expressing concerns that the new rules will harm global progress in AI and question the justification provided by the Biden administration. Microsoft, on the other hand, has stated that it is confident it can meet the high security standards of the new rules and meet the technological needs of countries and clients around the world.
