**Measles Alert Issued After Shakira Concert in New Jersey**
Health authorities in New Jersey, USA, issued a warning about a possible measles outbreak that may have originated from a Shakira concert at the MetLife Stadium. According to reports, a person with measles attended the event, prompting the alert. Authorities advise anyone with symptoms to contact health services before visiting a healthcare facility. 'Measles is one of the most contagious viral infections, which can evolve into a serious condition,' says the CUF health network website. 'It transmits when a person inhales micro-droplets in the air after being expelled by an infected individual.' The disease is contagious two to four days before the rash appears and remains so until it disappears. The transmission is only between humans, and vaccination is the best form of prevention. In Portugal, the vaccine is free and part of the National Vaccination Program. However, there is concern about imported cases, with 35 cases reported in 2024 and 14 cases in the first four months of 2025, according to the Directorate-General for Health. In the US, a high number of people are not taking the vaccine due to religious or other reasons, leading to increased outbreaks. Since the beginning of the year, the country has reported over 1,000 cases in 30 states, according to the Associated Press.

**Measles cases reach 1,024 in the US as infections confirmed in 30 states: CDC**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 1,024 measles cases in the US, with cases confirmed in 30 states. The CDC notes that 13% of measles patients have been hospitalized, with the majority under the age of 19. Dr. Roy Gulick, chief of infectious disease at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine, stated, 'The key thing about all of this is that the cases of measles that we're seeing today and that typically see are nearly 100% in people who have not received the vaccine.' The CDC reports that 96% of cases are among people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. Dr. Gulick emphasized, 'The thing to know about measles is that it is almost entirely 100% preventable and that's by receiving [a] measles vaccination.' The CDC recommends two doses of the MMR vaccine, with one dose being 93% effective and two doses being 97% effective against measles. Measles was declared eliminated from the US in 2000, but vaccination rates have been declining in recent years, with 92.7% of kindergartners receiving the MMR vaccine during the 2023 to 2024 school year, lower than the 95.2% seen in the 2019 to 2020 school year.

**Mexico Reports 1,629 Measles Cases and Four Deaths**
As of May 21, 2025, Mexico has reported 1,629 confirmed cases of measles and four deaths. Chihuahua accounts for 93% of the cases, with 1,537 confirmed cases, including 47 in the last 24 hours, according to the General Directorate of Epidemiology (DGE). The DGE notes that 'cases of severe illness are especially common in malnourished young children, and especially in those with weakened immune systems.' Complications of measles can include otitis media, pneumonia, laryngotracheobronchitis, and encephalitis. The first symptoms of measles typically appear between 10 and 14 days after contact with an infected person and include fever, nasal discharge, joint pain, and red, inflamed eyes. The DGE recommends that travelers to the US and Canada ensure they have an up-to-date vaccination schedule, including the measles vaccine, due to outbreaks in those countries.

**Shakira's Concert in New Jersey Raises Measles Concerns**
Shakira's concert in New Jersey, USA, on May 15, 2025, attracted nearly 80,000 fans, but a recent outbreak of measles has raised concerns about the spread of the virus. According to the US health authorities, a measles patient was present at the concert venue during the infectious period, putting thousands of people at risk of exposure. The New Jersey State Health Department warned that the virus can survive in the air for up to two hours, and people who have not been vaccinated or have not been infected are at high risk. Symptoms of measles include fever, dry cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash, which can be severe and even life-threatening. The health department advised concert-goers to contact their doctor immediately if they experience any of these symptoms, but not to rush to the emergency room to avoid infecting others. The US has seen a significant increase in measles cases this year, with over 1,000 reported cases in 31 states, resulting in three deaths, the highest number since 2019.

**How much worse could America's measles outbreak get?**
The current measles outbreak in the US, with over 1,000 cases and 3 deaths, is a warning sign of worse to come. Falling vaccination rates and cuts to public-health services could make outbreaks more frequent and difficult to control, potentially making measles endemic in the country again. Currently, measles is considered 'eliminated' in America, but imported cases can lead to outbreaks if vaccination rates are low. The hotspot of the current outbreak is a Mennonite community in Texas, where only 81% of children have received the vaccine. Researchers have found a widespread decline in vaccination rates, with two-thirds of counties having rates lower than 95%. A study estimates that if current vaccination rates remain unchanged, there will be 850,000 measles cases and 850 deaths in the next 25 years. However, if vaccination rates fall by 10%, the point when measles becomes endemic will arrive earlier, and there could be 11 million measles cases and 11,000 deaths in the 25-year period.

**Measles Outbreak in New Jersey: Authorities Investigate Possible Exposure at Shakira's Concert**
The New Jersey Department of Health has raised concerns about a possible mass exposure to the measles virus after a person infected with the virus attended Shakira's concert at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford on May 15. According to the official statement, the affected person does not reside in New Jersey and was present at the venue between 7:30 p.m. and 1:00 a.m., coinciding with the concert and the exit of the public. The MetLife Stadium, located on the outskirts of New York, has a capacity of 82,000 people and hosted Shakira's second show of her Las mujeres ya no lloran tour. Although no new cases have been reported linked to the event, health authorities have recommended that those who attended the concert remain vigilant for possible symptoms and contact their doctor in case of suspicion, to avoid further spread of the virus. 'Measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads through the air and can cause serious complications, especially in young children and unvaccinated individuals,' warned the state health department. Symptoms include high fever, nasal discharge, eye inflammation, cough, sore throat, and a characteristic red rash, which usually appears between 10 and 14 days after contact with the virus. This new episode occurs in the midst of the most severe measles outbreak in the United States since 2000, when the country had declared the elimination of endemic transmission of the virus. According to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 111 new cases reported in the week of March 30, surpassing the weekly record of the 2019 outbreak, which was 102. In the first five months of 2025, the United States has confirmed at least 935 cases of measles, with a focus in Texas and neighboring states. Three people have died and nearly 13% of those infected have required hospitalization. In comparison, Canada has confirmed over 1,000 cases in 2025, but without deaths and with a hospitalization rate of 7%. Experts in public health warn that the actual number of cases could be higher due to undiagnosed or unreported cases. Additionally, they emphasize that the decline in vaccination rates in some sectors of the population is facilitating the reappearance of preventable diseases like measles. In response to this situation, authorities are making an urgent call for complete vaccination with the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. 'Maintaining high vaccination coverage is essential to prevent outbreaks like the current one,' emphasized the CDC. 'El sarampión es una enfermedad altamente contagiosa que se propaga por el aire y puede generar complicaciones graves, especialmente en niños pequeños y personas no vacunadas,' advirtió el Departamento de Salud estatal. 'Mantener las coberturas de vacunación altas es fundamental para prevenir brotes como el actual,' recalcaron desde los CDC.

**Measles Outbreak Feared After Shakira Concert**
Up to 50,000 people attended Shakira's highly anticipated concert at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Thursday. However, a person who attended the concert was found to be carrying the measles virus, according to the New Jersey health authorities. As a result, thousands of people may have been exposed to the virus, explains USA Today. Anyone who was present at the stadium between 7:30 PM on Thursday and 1 AM on Friday may have potentially contracted the virus. The area where the infected person was seated and the entrances and exits they used have not been specified. Although the concert took place in an uncovered stadium, the risk is still real, as the measles virus can survive in the air for two hours and is highly contagious, especially among unvaccinated individuals. The New Jersey health department has advised people who may have been exposed to contact their doctor as soon as possible. This potential outbreak comes as the US is expected to experience its largest measles outbreak in 25 years in 2025, with 1,024 cases already diagnosed in 30 states and three deaths reported. 96% of recent patients were not vaccinated.

**Andalusia Fights Against Measles Outbreak**
Rocío Hernández, the Andalusian Health and Consumption Councilor, has called on the Andalusian population to collaborate in the vigilance against measles to control the outbreaks detected so far. She emphasized that 'this control passes through vaccination.' Although she stated that 'the situation is not worrying,' she appealed to the collaboration of all to prevent the spread of the disease, which has already registered 79 cases in Andalusia, two more than last week. The cases are distributed as follows: 24% are imported, with 17 cases from Morocco, one from Belgium, and one from Denmark. Of the non-imported cases, 20 are isolated cases where the source of infection is unknown. Eight cases are in children under one year old. The 33% of cases are under 15 years old, and the 67% are adults (15-70 years old). Only three cases (4%) had documented vaccination, the rest of the cases were not vaccinated or their vaccination status could not be known. The 32% of cases required hospitalization. There are currently seven active outbreaks in Andalusia, with three already closed. The Andalusian Health and Consumption Council recommends vaccination of minors in the established schedules and of adults who do not have proof of vaccination to protect those who cannot be vaccinated. The epidemiological situation in the Andalusian environment, the presence of susceptible groups, and the seasonal nature of measles (spring) make it predictable that new outbreaks will occur in the coming weeks and months. According to the World Health Organization, the risk is medium in Morocco, and there are no travel or trade restrictions due to the outbreak. The United States has reported 1,001 confirmed cases of measles, including three deaths, in 31 jurisdictions in 2025. Vietnam is also experiencing a measles outbreak, with new cases reported in areas that had not been affected before.

**US Reports 800 Measles Cases in 2025, 96% of Infected Individuals Not Vaccinated**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been at least 800 cases of measles reported in the United States this year, affecting 25 states. The 94% of cases (751 of 800) are linked to 10 active outbreaks, defined as three or more related infections. This number far exceeds the 285 cases reported in 2024, where only 69% of infections (198) came from outbreaks. Demographically, 31% of patients are under five years old, 38% are between five and 19 years old, and 29% are over 20 years old. Notably, 96% of infected individuals are not vaccinated. Recent cases include an unvaccinated adult in Louisiana, currently isolated, and two children in Virginia and Missouri. Measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads through the air and poses a particular risk to unvaccinated children, with potential for severe complications that can be fatal. The US was declared measles-free in the past, but has seen many imported cases in recent years due to vaccine rejection. As of 2025, there have been three reported deaths associated with the disease, two of which have been confirmed and one is under investigation. As the CDC states, 'at the end of 2024, a total of 285 measles cases had been reported in 33 jurisdictions, with 16 outbreaks accounting for 69% of the cases (198 of 285).'

**Measles Outbreak in the US: 308 Cases Reported in First Two Months of 2025**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States reported that the number of measles cases in the country has surpassed the total number of cases in 2024, with 285 cases, and has reached 308 cases in the first two and a half months of 2025. As of March 6, the measles outbreak had affected 222 people, mostly children, and 86 new cases were reported in the following week, bringing the total to 308. The outbreak is mainly concentrated in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, but cases have also been reported in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New York City, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington. The CDC is investigating a second death, that of an adult in New Mexico, who was not vaccinated against measles. According to the CDC, the outbreak is occurring in a context where the anti-vaccination movement is gaining strength in the US population, particularly under the support of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has recanted his previous extreme views since taking office. This is the third year in which a measles outbreak has caused more than 200 cases, following outbreaks in Disneyland in 2014 and in New York in 2019, which lasted for almost a year. Since measles was declared eradicated in the US, there has been an average of 179 cases per year and eight outbreaks. Meanwhile, in Mexico, the number of measles cases has also increased, with 416 probable cases reported in the first ten weeks of 2025, triple the number of cases reported in 2024. 'It is a concerning trend,' said the CDC. 'We urge everyone to get vaccinated against measles to prevent further outbreaks.'

The United States has reported 308 cases of measles in 2025, surpassing the total number of cases for the entire previous year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cases have been reported in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New York City, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington. This is the third year in a row that a measles outbreak has resulted in over 200 cases, with the previous two instances being a 2014 outbreak at Disneyland and a 2019 outbreak in New York City's Orthodox Jewish communities. Since measles was declared eradicated in the US, there has been an average of 179 cases per year and eight outbreaks. As of now, the outbreak has claimed the life of one unvaccinated child in Texas, and the CDC is investigating a second potential death of an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico, as stated by CNN. 'This is a serious public health concern,' said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 'and it's essential that we take action to prevent further outbreaks.'
