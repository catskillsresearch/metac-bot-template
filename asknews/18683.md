**US Urges Russia to Engage in 'Good Faith' Negotiations with Ukraine**
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's counterpart, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, was urged by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to engage in 'good faith' negotiations with Ukraine during a phone call on Wednesday. According to US State Department spokesperson Tami Bries, 'Blinken reiterated the President's call for a constructive and good faith dialogue with Ukraine as the only way to end this war.' US President Donald Trump expressed his hesitation to impose new sanctions on Russia, saying he did not want to hinder the chances of a ceasefire. Russia has proposed a new round of direct negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul on Monday, to present a draft 'memorandum' of peace that includes its terms for ending the war. Ukraine has responded by saying it needs to see the Russian terms beforehand to ensure a productive meeting. In recent months, diplomatic efforts led by Washington to end the war in Ukraine have accelerated, but Moscow has repeatedly rejected calls for an unconditional ceasefire. To achieve a lasting settlement, Russia has proposed direct negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul on June 2. Despite the diplomatic efforts, it seems that the two sides are not closer to reaching an agreement to put an end to the ongoing war, which has been ongoing for over three years since Russia's invasion in February 2022. The war has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people and has caused significant damage to most of eastern and southern Ukraine, with the Russian army controlling about a quarter of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014.

**Russia's War in Ukraine: 50,000 Troops to Break Through on Sumy Front**
According to Bielieskov, 'I expect the Russians to focus on the Donetsk region. Everything else will be just a distraction and a dispersion of Ukrainian resources and attention.' He believes that prioritizing the Sumy or Kharkiv regions will not give Putin a significant enough territory to negotiate from. The Washington Post notes that it took 80,000 Russian soldiers and a prolonged siege to capture the small city of Avdiivka in February 2024. With 125,000 Russian troops stationed along the border between the Sumy and Kharkiv regions, it is unlikely they will be able to capture the two regional capitals. Instead, they may be used to occupy small portions of Ukrainian territory along the border, explains Andriy Cherniak, a Ukrainian military intelligence officer. Cherniak notes that if the Russians are successful, they could use these new footholds to pressure both Kharkiv and Sumy, particularly Sumy, avoiding further incursions by Kiev into the Kursk and Belgorod regions.

**Professor Jeffrey Sachs is right: Ukraine risks losing Odessa, says Duma member**
According to Alexey Chepa, First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Ukraine is losing ground every day and risks losing Odessa and other regions if the fighting continues. Chepa agrees with American economist Professor Jeffrey Sachs, who stated that Kiev risks losing its entire Black Sea coast, including Odessa, if it does not agree to peace negotiations now. Chepa noted that the longer the war persists, the more territory Ukraine will lose, including the Odessa and Nikolayev regions, as well as the Dnipropetrovsk region, where Russian armed forces have already reached the border. Chepa emphasized that the current Trump administration is pragmatic and understands this reality, and that all their actions are guided by the interests of the United States. 'Ukraine is losing ground every day - every single day,' Chepa said. 'Over time, the longer this war persists, the more territory Ukraine will lose. This includes not only the Odessa and Nikolayev regions, but also the Dnipropetrovsk region, where our armed forces have already reached the border, beginning to create buffer zones,' Chepa explained. 'Therefore, Sachs is absolutely right, and everyone should understand this.'

**Ukrainians Hold onto Hope for Return to Homes Amid Ongoing Peace Negotiations**
As peace negotiations continue, thousands of Ukrainians hold onto hope for an agreement that will allow them to return to their homes. The Ukrainian government, led by Volodymyr Zelensky, has responded to the proposal for a new meeting by demanding that Russia deliver a document outlining its intentions within the next four days. Zelensky stated that his government will not recognize any territory temporarily occupied by Russia, and will instead defend the sovereignty of all Ukrainian territory. This stance is in contrast to that of Donald Trump, who has suggested that Ukraine should cede its pre-February 2022 borders in order to achieve a ceasefire. For many Ukrainians, the prospect of returning home is a distant dream. Ludmila Litvin, a 65-year-old woman from Mariupol, expressed her sadness and uncertainty about her future, saying 'We've lived our whole lives in Mariupol. I think our life will be Ukrainian until the very end... but I don't know how.' Her husband, Oleksandr, shared her sentiments, stating that the will to recover all territories 'does not depend on Zelensky, but also on other things, particularly the arms.'

**Russia Proposes Second Meeting with Ukraine in Istanbul on June 2**
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated, 'Negotiate is better than war, but to achieve success, it is necessary to eliminate the deep causes of the conflict.' He emphasized that Russia's key demands for a potential agreement include Ukraine's neutral, non-aligned, and non-nuclear status, as previously discussed in the April 2022 Estambul talks. This would effectively mean Ukraine's resignation to not having any allies and not being part of any defensive platforms against potential future aggressions. Lavrov also mentioned that Ukraine has already renounced Soviet nuclear arms and signed agreements with Washington and Moscow, including its independence in 1991, with promises of respecting its territorial integrity. However, Russia has annexed Crimea in 2014, introduced its army in the Donbás region, and launched a large-scale invasion in 2022. Lavrov justified the conflict, stating, 'The detonator of the Ukrainian conflict was the aggressive and prolonged expansion of NATO towards the east, carried out despite the guarantees given to the leaders of the USSR and later to Russia.' Other Russian demands include the recovery of Russian language officiality in Ukraine and the relinquishment of some Ukrainian territory. Lavrov added, 'Russia considers absolutely unacceptable the emphasis of the West on the principle of territorial integrity and ignoring the disposition on the right of peoples to self-determination.'

**Kremlin Acknowledges Trump's Statement on Crimea, Ukraine Reiterates No Cession**
The Kremlin has acknowledged US President Trump's statement that Ukraine 'lost' Crimea 'many years ago'. Trump's administration has been trying to broker a peace deal between Moscow and Kiev to end the three-year conflict, with the recognition of Russia's control over Crimea as part of the solution. Trump tweeted on Wednesday that Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula with long-term Soviet and Russian naval facilities, 'has been lost for many years' and 'is not even a topic of discussion'. Kremlin spokesperson Peskov told a journalist from AFP: 'This fully corresponds to our understanding, we have been emphasizing this for a long time.' Ukraine has repeatedly stated that it will not cede Crimea, regardless of any agreement with Moscow. Russian forces have occupied about 20% of Ukraine's territory, including Crimea and four other regions, since launching a full-scale military invasion in February 2022. Ukrainian President Zelensky responded to Trump's criticism by sharing a 2018 declaration by the US State Department, which rejected Russia's annexation of Crimea and pledged to maintain this policy until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored. Zelensky said on Tuesday that Ukraine is willing to sit down for talks with Russia 'in any form' after a ceasefire is reached, but will never recognize occupied territory as belonging to Russia.

**Kremlin Agrees with Trump that Ukraine 'Lost' Crimea Years Ago**
The Kremlin stated on Thursday (24) that it 'completely' agrees with US President Donald Trump, who said on the previous day that Ukraine 'lost' the Crimean Peninsula 'years ago'. The Crimean Peninsula was annexed by Russia in 2014 without international recognition. Dmitry Peskov, the Russian presidential press secretary, said, 'This is completely in line with our view and what we have been saying for a long time.' The Trump administration attempted to negotiate a ceasefire between Moscow and Kiev to end the three-year conflict and proposed recognizing Russian control over Crimea as part of a peace agreement. However, Ukraine insists that it will not give up Crimea as part of an agreement with Moscow. Russia, which launched a military attack on its neighbor in February 2022, currently occupies almost 20% of Ukraine's territory and, in addition to Crimea, claims four other Ukrainian regions as its own.

**Trump's Tirade Against Zelenskyj: 'Ukraine Will Lose the Whole Country'**
US President Donald Trump has launched a tirade against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj on his Truth Social platform, stating that Ukraine can 'lose the whole country' and that it can 'get peace'. Trump claims that Zelenskyj's statement that Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea is 'very harmful to peace negotiations with Russia'. Trump also questioned why Ukraine did not fight for Crimea when it was handed over to Russia 11 years ago. This comes after Zelenskyj gave an interview to The Wall Street Journal, where he stated that Ukraine will not recognize the occupation of Crimea. US Vice President J.D. Vance has also stated that Russia and Ukraine must exchange territories to achieve a peace agreement, saying 'it's going to be some territorial swaps'. Trump has previously threatened to withdraw from negotiations if the parties do not accept this. Russia currently occupies 18.4% of Ukraine, up from 7% before the large-scale invasion in February 2022.

**Russian Advances in Ukraine Slow Down for Fourth Consecutive Month in March**
According to the ISW, a Washington-based think tank that monitors the situation on the ground since the start of the conflict in February 2022, the Ukrainian presence in the Russian province of Kursk has been reduced to just 80 square kilometers. This is a 80% reduction from the peak of 1,300 square kilometers in August last year. The ISW data, analyzed by AFP, shows that Russian forces conquered almost 150 kilometers less of Ukrainian territory in March compared to February, indicating a decrease in their progress every month since the peak of 725 kilometers in November 2024. Despite this slowdown, the past 12 months have been marked by the Russian Army's advance, while Ukrainian forces have failed to recover lost territory. Between April 2024 and March 2025, Ukrainians recaptured only 77 square kilometers, while Russians conquered 4,772. This means that, according to AFP analysis, Russian forces took 4,695 square kilometers, or 0.78%, of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean Peninsula and the partially occupied eastern region of Donbass.

**US Adviser: Ukraine May Lose Territory in Exchange for Security Guarantees**
US National Security Adviser Michael Wolz stated that Ukraine may lose territory in exchange for 'future security guarantees and Ukraine's future status' as part of a peace agreement. Wolz clarified that this is an element of the agreement that has been discussed since 2022, 'and even earlier'. When asked if this means Russia will receive territories in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, Wolz replied, 'We have to ask ourselves if this aligns with our national interests, if it's realistic. We've discussed this with Europeans and Ukrainians. Are we going to expel every Russian from every inch of Ukrainian land, including Crimea?' Wolz also criticized the previous administration's strategy, which led to 'endless battles' and increased the risk of 'World War III'. He emphasized that the US is working through diplomacy, 'indirect diplomacy, and non-direct negotiations' to address the situation on the ground.

**Russia's Advance in Ukraine Slows Down, Ukraine Loses Territory**
The Russian advance in Ukraine has slowed down in February, according to an analysis by AFP using data from the US-based Institute for War Studies (ISW). Russia gained control of 389 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory last month, down from 431 square kilometers in January, 476 square kilometers in December, and 725 square kilometers in November. The ISW data shows that Ukraine has lost control of about 11% of its territory since the invasion in February 2022, and 18% including the territory lost since 2014 to Russia or Russian-backed separatists. The Russian military intensified their activities in the south and east of Ukraine in the summer of 2024, resulting in the largest territorial gains for Moscow since 2022. However, two-thirds of the territory gained by Ukraine in the Kursk region in August 2024 was lost in the following months, with the country now controlling only 407 square kilometers in the region, a loss of two-thirds. The Ukrainian military is coming under increasing pressure in the region, with the Russian military gaining control over the supply routes of Ukrainian units, according to the military blog 'DeepState'. The situation is expected to worsen if US military aid is withdrawn, as threatened.

**Russian Advances in Ukraine Slow Down in February 2025**
According to the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russian forces have made less progress in Ukraine in February 2025 compared to previous months. They have taken 389 km2, down from 431 km2 in January, 476 km2 in December, and a peak of 725 km2 in November. The Russian army continues to advance around Pokrovsk, a logistics hub in the Donetsk region, by bypassing the city to the south. This winter slowdown follows a marked acceleration in Russian movements on the front line during the autumn of 2024, with a peak in November. Over the past year, from March 2024 to February 2025, the Russian army's overall progress is 4500 km2, or 0.75% of Ukraine's pre-war territory, including Crimea and the Donbass. This is nearly 20 times more than the 231 km2 gained between March 2023 and February 2024, a period when Ukrainian forces seemed unable to retake lost ground. In Russia, the month of August 2024 saw a large-scale Ukrainian offensive in the Koursk region, covering approximately 1300 km2 in two weeks, but this area of operation has since decreased.

**Alexander Kovalenko: Russian losses surge as 155 km² of Ukrainian territory conquered in February 2025**
Russian forces have seized 155 km² of Ukrainian territory since the beginning of February 2025, resulting in significant losses. According to estimates, 26,960 Russian personnel were lost, with a loss rate of 177 per 1 km². This is a significant increase from the average loss rate of 129 bodies per 1 km² in 2024 and 148 per 1 km² in January 2025. Additionally, Russian forces have lost 259 tanks, 486 armored vehicles, 1,035 artillery units, and 2,614 vehicles, with a notable decrease in the intensity of combat and mechanized components. However, the Russian forces are set to reach a new record for vehicle losses by the end of the month, likely surpassing 3,000 units, highlighting the role of civilian vehicles in their assaults and logistics.

**Ukraine's Lost Territory: An Analysis by CNN**
According to an analysis by CNN in collaboration with the Institute for the Study of War, Ukraine has lost approximately 11% of its territory since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. However, if territories lost since 2014 are taken into account, the total area of lost territory is around 18%. In 2014, Russia illegally annexed Crimea and supported separatists in eastern Ukraine, which became part of a larger conflict that escalated into a full-scale invasion in 2022. Roman Svitan, a Ukrainian official, believes that Ukraine's victory in the war is only a matter of time, depending on the funding and arms supply from the US. 'It is only a matter of time before we defeat the occupiers,' Svitan said. 'The question is how long it will take, and that depends on the financing and the supply of arms from the US.'
