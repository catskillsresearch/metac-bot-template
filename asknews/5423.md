**Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Company Will Be Worth Over $5 Trillion in 10 Years**
Nvidia is expected to reach a market value of over $5 trillion in 10 years, according to a prediction. The company's revenue grew by 114% to $130.5 billion in fiscal 2025, and is forecast to increase by 52.8% and 23.9% in fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027, respectively. Nvidia's dominance in the AI market has allowed it to steadily expand its margins, with a net income margin of 55.8% in fiscal 2025. The company's software ecosystem, including its CUDA parallel programming platform and TensorRT software package, has become a strong moat, making it difficult for competitors to switch to their chips. Nvidia has also partnered with Humain and is playing a key role in the Stargate Project, which could be significant growth catalysts for the company. With its upcoming AI initiatives, such as Sovereign AI, agentic AI, and physical AI, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue growing and reaching new heights. 'It is reasonable to expect Nvidia to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next decade,' according to the prediction. 'If it does, it would wind up with about $808 billion in revenues in its fiscal 2035.' With a top line of $808 billion, Nvidia would produce a net income of around $225 billion that year. Assuming a valuation multiple of 23.5x for the next 10 years, the company can reach a market value of $5.29 trillion by 2035.

**USDC Issuer Circle Aims For $7.2B Initial Public Offering Valuation**
Circle Internet Financial is pushing forward with its public listing plans, now targeting a valuation of $7.2 billion as it gears up for an initial public offering. The company has increased the offering size to 32 million shares, priced at $27 to $28 per share, with expectations of raising as much as $896 million. This valuation is below the $9 billion mark it was set to achieve in a previously abandoned SPAC deal in 2022. Circle, the issuer behind USD Coin USDC/USD, the world's second-largest stablecoin, has seen growing financial strength, especially through returns on U.S. Treasury holdings. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, Circle earned over $557 million from these assets, a 55% jump compared to previous periods. According to Standard Chartered, the market cap for stablecoins could expand tenfold by 2028.

**Remittix: The Next Big Thing in Cryptocurrency Payments**
XRP's price is struggling to hold the critical support level of $2.40, having depreciated by 50% from its January peak. In contrast, a new payment token called Remittix (RTX) is gaining traction. Remittix has a disruptive strategy for cryptocurrency payments and has quickly gained attention, with early investors expected to see enormous gains when it comes to the forefront. Remittix allows for immediate cryptocurrency-to-fiat conversions for bank transfers, a unique feature. It has a seamless API that enables businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments that are settled in fiat currency, bypassing traditional intermediaries like Wise and Stripe. Additionally, it supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies. The project has attracted a large following to its presale, which has been a huge success, raising over $15.4 million with over half a billion tokens sold. Remittix has increased by 400% since its launch and is currently on a roll. With an entry price of $0.0781, Remittix promises to be an exceptional alternative for investment portfolios. It is expected to explode and start a 300% profit before the presale is over. When RTX is listed on exchanges, its price is expected to skyrocket. Institutional interest in Ripple is increasing, with the SEC dropping its lawsuit against Ripple in March 2025, paving the way for XRP to become widely accepted. However, XRP's price is currently struggling to hold the critical support level of $2.40, and a continued decline could lead to a drop below $1.90.

**Magnificent Seven Closed A Blockbuster May, Added Nearly $2 Trillion In Market Value Magnificent Seven Add $1.75 Trillion in May As Tech Megacaps Dominate Wall Street - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)**
The Magnificent Seven, a group of tech megacaps including Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Apple, delivered a historic performance in May 2025, adding $1.75 trillion to their combined market capitalization. Nvidia led the pack with a 24.2% gain, while Tesla jumped 21.5% and Meta rallied 19.4%. However, Apple fell 6% and wiped out $192 billion in market cap, marking its worst relative showing since 2018. Analysts, including Goldman Sachs' Ryan Hammond and Roundhill Investments' David Mazza, are bullish on the group, citing earnings strength and defensive appeal. However, Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research notes that valuations are stretching again, with the group's valuation climbing from 21.9 to 27.4. 'Supercap Tech will act as a 'defensive growth proxy,' and this is exactly what investors want during what will remain highly uncertain times,' Hammond said. 'These companies aren't speculative bets on future adoption,' Mazza said. 'They are the infrastructure of the real economy and, in some cases, staples within global consumers' lives.'

**Nvidia Predicted to Reach US$ 5 Trillion Market Value in 10 Years**
Analysts predict that Nvidia, the leader in artificial intelligence services, may reach a market value of US$ 5 trillion (R$ 28 trillion) in the next decade. This projection is based on the company's revenue growth, which increased by 114% in the first quarter of 2026, reaching US$ 130.5 billion (R$ 744 billion). The company's revenue is expected to grow by 52.8% and 23.9% in 2026 and 2027, respectively, indicating a growth rate of almost 20% per year for the next 10 years. According to analysts from the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, the company's stock is being traded at around 32.6 times its future earnings, and it is expected to reach a market value of US$ 5.29 trillion by 2035. Nvidia's recent GPUs, such as the Grace Blackwell 200 (GB200), allow organizations to execute computationally complex AI models with a performance 25 times greater and at a twentieth of the cost of the Hopper H100 chips. The launch of the Blackwell represented almost 70% of the company's data center computing revenue in the last quarter, according to the Nasdaq. Jensen Huang, the company's founder and CEO, who controls over 80% of the global market for AI chips, said, 'It is only the beginning.'

**XRP Struggles to Maintain Support Level as Remittix Surges in Popularity**
The price of XRP is showing warning signs as it struggles to maintain the crucial support level of $2.40. This is a 50% decline from its peak in January. In contrast, a new payment token called Remittix (RTX) is gaining popularity. Remittix has a revolutionary approach to cryptocurrency payments, allowing for direct conversions of crypto to fiat for bank transfers. The platform's seamless API enables businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments that are settled in fiat currency, bypassing traditional intermediaries like Wise and Stripe. With over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies supported, Remittix has attracted a large following to its presale, which has been a huge success, raising over $15.4 million. Remittix has already surged 400% since its launch and is currently extremely popular, with an entry price of $0.0781. It is expected to explode in value, potentially delivering a 300% profit before the presale is completed. Once listed on the exchange, the price is expected to skyrocket. Institutional interest in Ripple has increased significantly, with the SEC dropping its lawsuit against Ripple in March 2025, clearing the way for XRP's widespread adoption. However, XRP is currently struggling to maintain its support level, and analysts predict a short-term decline before a massive surge. A 'W'-pattern has been identified in the XRP price chart, suggesting a breakout above the neckline could send the price to $25, delivering significant profits for investors.

**Reevaluating Technology Stocks in a Post-Trump World**
The valuation of technology stocks is a complex and challenging task, as seen in the recent performance of Apple, which has fallen to third place in the global capitalization rankings. Microsoft has taken the lead with a market capitalization of $3.4 trillion USD, followed by Nvidia with $3.3 trillion USD. The arrival of Trump has led to a re-evaluation of globalization, which may impact the profitability of companies like Apple, which are still heavily dependent on China. The article suggests that the current underperformance of technology stocks may be an opportunity to enter the market at reasonable prices. The author also notes that the valuation of Tesla is particularly challenging, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, which is considered high. However, if we use the highest earnings estimates for 2029, the price-to-earnings ratio drops to 14, which is more reasonable. The article concludes that the current period is complex and full of opportunities, and that the author is becoming more positive on technology stocks, while being more cautious on luxury stocks, which are still heavily dependent on China.

**Stripe plans new share sale for US$85b valuation**
Stripe is considering an employee-share sale that would value the company at US$85 billion or more, according to The Information. This would be at least 20% higher than a previous employee-share sale in 2024 and would bring Stripe's valuation closer to its 2021 peak of US$95 billion. The plans follow a series of share buybacks, secondary sales, and fundraises that have helped the payments provider recover from its US$50 billion valuation in March 2023, when higher interest rates slowed e-commerce growth. Investor sentiment toward private fintech startups has improved as the Federal Reserve has begun cutting interest rates.
