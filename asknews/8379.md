**UK Announces Nuclear Submarine and Ammunition Factory Plans in Response to 'Russian Threat'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive rearmament plan for the UK, including the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and six new ammunition factories. The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate £15 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional £6 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.

**Britain to get defence boost to send message to Moscow  --  and possibly Trump**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with the UK building new nuclear-powered attack submarines and creating an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defence Secretary John Healey said the changes would 'transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment' and that the 3% goal is 'on track' to be met. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks. The UK will also invest £15 billion in its nuclear arsenal and increase its conventional weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons. Mr. Starmer said re-arming would create a 'defence dividend' of well-paid jobs, and the move is also a message to President Donald Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defence.

**UK to Introduce New Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarines by Late 2030s**
The UK government plans to introduce 12 new attack submarines powered by nuclear energy and equipped with conventional weapons by the late 2030s. The UK Ministry of Defence announced that it will replace the current 7 submarines with the new ones. The ministry also stated that the cost of the existing nuclear warhead development program, which was previously initiated, will be £15 billion. UK Defence Secretary John Healey said, 'We know threats are rising and we must act decisively against Russian aggression. Our cutting-edge new submarines patrolling the world's oceans and our own nuclear warhead program at home are making our country both safe at home and strong abroad.' The new submarines are reportedly being developed as a joint model with the US and Australia under the AUKUS security partnership.

**UK to Expand and Modernize Nuclear-Powered Submarine Fleet**
The UK plans to expand and modernize its nuclear-powered submarine attack fleet by adding up to 12 new-generation submarines by the end of 2030. These submarines will be able to carry conventional weapons and replace the current fleet. The submarines were developed as part of the Aukus security partnership between the UK, US, and Australia. Defence Minister John Healey emphasized that threats are increasing and the UK must take decisive action to counter Russian aggression. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other European government leaders aim to strengthen defence capabilities to take more responsibility for their own security.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**New twist in Russia-Ukraine war as Britain asks for US nuclear-capable fighter jets to..., Starmer govt accuses Putin of...**
The UK is reportedly in talks with the US to acquire a fleet of nuclear-capable fighter jets to enhance its nuclear deterrence against Russia. According to reports, the UK plans to equip US-made fighter jets with nuclear missiles, which could be the largest expansion in UK's nuclear deterrence capabilities. The move has the support of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who believes the world faces its worst nuclear threat since the Cold War era. The UK currently lacks the capability to launch nuclear strikes from the air, but acquiring the US-made F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter jets would allow it to do so. The deal would also enable the UK to launch nuclear strikes from air, vastly enhancing its deterrence capabilities. Additionally, the Starmer government plans to manufacture 7,000 long-range weapons and increase its defense spending to 3% of the country's GDP by 2034.

**UK Seeks to Acquire Fighter Jets Capable of Using Tactical Nuclear Weapons**
The UK government wants to purchase American fighter jets capable of using 'tactical nuclear weapons', specifically free-fall bombs, according to the Times newspaper. This acquisition would be the largest 'expansion in defense' for the UK since the Cold War. As reported by the Times, 'The UK wants to buy fighter jets that can apply tactical nuclear weapons... Defense Minister John Healey and Admiral (Chief of Defense Staff) Sir Tony Radakin... plan to acquire American-made fighter jets capable of launching smaller-yield free-fall bombs than standard nuclear bombs,'. The UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, has also supported these discussions, and the UK government has allegedly held talks with the Pentagon. 'High-ranking sources said the UK is considering purchasing the stealthy F-35A Lightning fighter jet from Lockheed Martin, but other types of aircraft are also being discussed,' the newspaper reports. Earlier, UK Defense Minister John Healey stated that the country will spend 3% of its GDP on defense by 2034.

**Top Gun! British fighter jets will soon carry nuclear weapons for the first time ever as part of biggest defence expansion since the Cold War | Daily Mail Online**
The UK government, led by Defence Secretary John Healey, is planning to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034, the largest sustained increase since the Cold War. This move includes purchasing US fighter jets capable of launching gravity bombs with lower power than conventional nuclear weapons. The goal is to increase the resilience of Britain in an 'ever more dangerous world.' The funding will be found by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI. Sir Keir Starmer said, 'In an ever more dangerous world, increasing the resilience of our country so we can protect the British people, resist future shocks and bolster British interests, is vital.' A Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated, 'This Government has announced the largest sustained increase to defence spending since the end of the Cold War.' The UK is also set to meet with NATO heads of government in The Hague next month to discuss defence spending targets, with NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte suggesting a high defence spend target of 5%.

**China crosses 600 operational nuclear warheads, to exceed 1,000 by 2030: US intel - BusinessToday**
According to a US Defence Intelligence Agency report, China has surpassed 600 operational nuclear warheads and is on track to have over 1,000 by 2030. The rapid buildup is part of China's effort to create a diverse and high-readiness nuclear force capable of delivering both low-yield precision strikes and large-scale intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) attacks. The report notes that China's current force modernization suggests that it seeks to have the ability to inflict far greater levels of overwhelming damage to an adversary in a nuclear exchange. The nuclear buildup aligns with China's broader goals of asserting dominance in East Asia, challenging US global leadership, pursuing reunification with Taiwan, and achieving technological self-sufficiency. Meanwhile, India and Pakistan continue to develop their nuclear arsenals, with India slightly expanding its nuclear arsenal in 2023 and Pakistan modernizing its nuclear command and control systems. As of June 2024, Russia had 4,380 warheads, while the US had 3,708, and India and Pakistan had 172 and 170 warheads, respectively.

**China Projected To Have 1,000 Nukes, Viewed As 'Primary Adversary' By India: US Report**
A US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) report states that China is rapidly advancing its military modernisation and is expected to reach at least 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030. China views the US as a global leader and aims to challenge its dominance, while India sees China as its 'primary adversary' and is focusing on countering Chinese influence. The report also states that China will continue to apply pressure on Taiwan through diplomatic, information, military, and economic means to advance its long-term objective of unification with Taiwan. According to the report, China's nuclear warhead stockpile has probably surpassed 600 operational nuclear warheads, and the country will continue growing its force until at least 2035. 'This supports the PLA's objective to achieve a more diverse nuclear force, comprising systems including low-yield precision strike missiles and ICBMs with multi-megaton yields, to provide a broader range of nuclear response options,' it said. China's approach to using nuclear force is based on the Army's 'deterrence' of an enemy first strike and 'counterstrike' against an adversary's military capability, population, and economy when deterrence fails. The report also states that India has reduced procurement of Russian-origin military equipment, but still relies on Russian spare parts to maintain and sustain its large inventory of Russian-origin tanks and fighter aircraft that help its military to counter threats from China and Pakistan.

**US Navy wants sea-launched nuke missiles to hold China at bay - Asia Times**
The US Navy is advancing its sea-launched, low-yield cruise missile, the SLCM-N, to address regional deterrence gaps with China. According to Vice Admiral Johnny Wolfe, the decision to proceed with the program will be made in Fiscal Year 2026, with a goal of delivery by 2034. The SLCM-N aims to provide a survivable and flexible nuclear strike option, but its development is facing challenges such as adapting a nuclear warhead to a conventionally designed cruise missile and ensuring compatibility with Virginia-class submarines. The US Department of Defense's 2024 China Military Power Report highlights China's growing nuclear capabilities, including 600 operational nuclear warheads and the development of advanced delivery systems. The report also notes that China's actions indicate it may resort to nuclear weapons use if conventional attacks threaten its nuclear infrastructure or the Chinese Communist Party's regime survival. The SLCM-N has been criticized for its high costs and potential redundancy with existing low-yield nuclear options. However, proponents argue that it provides greater availability and regional presence, and is survivable against pre-emptive attack and capable of penetrating air and missile defenses.

**Nuclear war has never been more likely. Here's what it would look like now**
The threat of nuclear war is increasing, with various flashpoints around the world. India and Pakistan have been involved in a conventional conflict, but both countries have significant nuclear arsenals. The region is considered a potential starting point for a nuclear apocalypse. In the Middle East, American and Iranian envoys will meet for talks on Tehran's nuclear program, and failure could result in a US-Israeli strike. China is projected to nearly double its nuclear arsenal to 1,000 warheads by 2030. North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, wants to expand his nuclear stockpiles exponentially. The United Nations General Assembly has established an international panel of scientists to assess the effects of nuclear war. The investigation will look at the physical effects and societal consequences of a nuclear war on a local, regional, and planetary scale. Experts warn that a nuclear war could lead to a 'nuclear winter,' with temperatures dropping below freezing and global food production collapsing. The world has about a 60-day food supply, and a war between India and Pakistan could kill one to two billion people from starvation. A war between the US and Russia and NATO could kill six billion people, most of the people on earth. The established nuclear powers have replaced their multi-megaton weapons with 'dial-a-yield' weapons that commanders can set to go off with varying force. However, experts insist that using nuclear warheads, even in a 'restrained' way, would be madness. The hope of being able to use such warheads in a 'restrained' way may have been on display when the players representing Israel in a 2023 wargame opted initially for a blast over the Iranian desert. When that failed to intimidate their opponent, they deliberately chose military targets and avoided bombing Tehran or other cities. The Iranian players similarly chose not to nuke Tel Aviv. However, all of those factors makes it almost impossible to predict what the outcome of an actual nuclear war would be.

**China Accelerates Nuclear Development, Arsenal Expected to Reach 1,000 Warheads by 2035**
China is accelerating its nuclear development, with its arsenal expected to reach 1,000 warheads by 2035. Currently, China has around 600 nuclear warheads, with many more in production. The country is also building three new missile silo fields for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). According to the Nuclear Notebook, the growth of the arsenal will depend on China's stockpiles of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and tritium. In 2023, the International Panel on Fissile Materials estimated that China had around 14 tons of HEU and approximately 2.9 tons of separated plutonium available for nuclear weapons. China aims to acquire significant stockpiles of plutonium using its civilian reactors, including two sodium-cooled fast breeder reactors (CFR-600). Experts note that the most significant development in China's medium- and intermediate-range missile force is the production and deployment of the DF-26 dual-capable missile. The number of DF-26 launchers has increased from 18 in 2018 to 250, with an estimated 500 missiles in 2024, according to Pentagon estimates. The DF-26 has an approximate range of 4,000 kilometers and can strike important US bases in Guam and northeast Asia, as well as much of Russia and all of India. The H-20 is also mentioned as a significant development in China's nuclear capabilities.

**China's Nuclear Ambitions: Aiming for 1,000 Warheads by 2030**
China is rapidly increasing its nuclear arsenal, aiming to reach 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030, according to a new study. The country is investing heavily in nuclear weapons, the pinnacle of mass destruction systems, to surpass the United States and become a global superpower. China currently has 600 nuclear warheads and is producing more without pause. The goal is to increase its military deterrence and become a major player in the international order. Analysts note that China's nuclear program will continue to intensify to reach its target, with no end in sight. This development is a cause for concern, as it may lead to increased international tensions, particularly with Russia's recent withdrawal from strategic agreements on nuclear production and use. As one analyst noted, 'The mere presence of nuclear weapons is relevant, regardless of their size or lethality.'

**SMR: Atom-Comeback thanks to small power plants?**
The AP300 is a small modular reactor that produces 300 Megawatts of energy, roughly a quarter of what a large nuclear power plant can produce. The manufacturer, Westwing, plans to mass-produce the AP300 by 2030 and make it a common sight worldwide. However, the World Climate Council IPCC has listed nuclear power as a low-carbon energy source, but the reality is that it is not economically viable. As Westwing's representative said, the AP300 is a 'CO2-neutral energy source', but it remains to be seen if it will be a viable solution in the climate crisis.
