**Faure Asked to Clarify Presidential Ambitions by Rival Mayer-Rossignol**
Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol, a rival of Olivier Faure for the leadership of the French Socialist Party, has asked Faure to clarify his presidential ambitions and confirm whether he will run in the 2027 presidential election. In a letter obtained by AFP, Mayer-Rossignol expressed concern that the upcoming party congress, which will take place on Thursday, may be used to validate Faure's presidential ambitions. Faure has refused to 'presidentialize' the party, but Mayer-Rossignol believes there is still ambiguity about his intentions. 'I ask you, in the name of the many comrades who are questioning and worrying, to be clear and tell us if you want to be a candidate for the presidential election,' Mayer-Rossignol wrote. The outcome of Faure's response will be 'decisive in enlightening the choice of comrades,' Mayer-Rossignol said, adding that Faure should also agree to a televised debate or one organized by the party's networks.

**Poland's Shift to the Right: A Blow to European Democracy**
The ultranationalist candidate, Karol Nawrocki, has won the Polish presidential election, while the Europeanist candidate, Rafal Trzaskowski, lost. This is a bad news for several reasons. Firstly, Nawrocki is connected to organized crime and neo-Nazi groups, which makes him a 'type you can't trust'. Secondly, this election marks a trend where European democracy is losing ground, as seen in the recent Portuguese and Polish elections, while the Romanian election went in favor of Europeanism. Additionally, the Polish president has significant powers, including the ability to veto laws, which will block the centrist and European agenda of Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Furthermore, this victory will give momentum to the reactionary friends of Donald Trump ahead of the 2027 legislative elections. However, there is a small silver lining: Poland's loss means that Spain and Italy gain points in their bid to complete the EU's leadership duo, alongside France and Germany.

**Who Wants a Crisis?**
A sense of uncertainty hangs over the French political landscape, with each side preparing for the next crisis, which is seen as inevitable. However, most political parties are opting to avoid any major upheavals until 2027, especially within the LR and PS parties. The current geopolitical context, the 'trumpo-muskien' era, and the upcoming municipal elections mean that, aside from La France Insoumise, no one wants to further destabilize the system. The French Parliament has become a 'theatre of shadows' where each side is engaging in a form of tactical glaciation. The stability at the cost of stagnation? The Prime Minister seems content with this situation. The outcome of the conclave on retirement reform in late June is no longer feared by the executive, as it is understood that neither the Medef nor the CFDT want to blow up the system. In politics, the proportionnelle system is being used as a bargaining chip with the Rassemblement national. Marine Le Pen is forced to regularly raise the specter of censorship, a Pavlovian reflex, but even she seems to have lost faith in it. François Bayrou, the 'charmer', has lulled everyone to sleep, and only the President of the Republic seems to want his departure (which is no less dangerous...). It's far from certain that the cunning Béarnais will be able to navigate beyond the budget.

**Boris Vallaud to Vote for Olivier Faure in PS Leadership Election**
Boris Vallaud, the president of the Socialist group in the French National Assembly, announced that he will vote for Olivier Faure in the second round of the PS leadership election. Vallaud, who came third in the first round, stated that his decision is a 'personal choice' and not a 'directive' for his troops. He emphasized that he will not be giving a blank check to Faure, but rather expects him to address the aspirations of the party's militants, including a desire for change, a focus on ideas, and a more inclusive and united governance. Faure and Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol will be separated in the second round on June 5, ahead of the PS Congress scheduled for June 13-15 in Nancy. The election is seen as a key moment in determining the party's strategy for the 2027 presidential election.

**National Rally Leaders: 'Cela va très bien' Amid Controversy Over Le Pen's Comments**
Sébastien Chenu, vice-president of the National Rally (RN), has assured that there is no conflict between Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, the party's president. Chenu stated, 'Cela va très bien' (everything is fine) between the two leaders. He also clarified that the party's goal for 2027 is to win with the ideas of the RN, led by Le Pen or Bardella if she is unable to run due to ineligibility. Chenu added, 'Il n'y a pas de mystère chez nous, on agit en toute transparence' (there is no mystery here, we act with transparency). The controversy arose after Le Pen made a comment about Bardella's lack of knowledge on New Caledonia's issues, which Bardella quickly responded to, saying he knows the dossiers well. Le Pen later clarified that she did not intend to criticize Bardella, but rather make a 'constatation' (observation). The controversy has been fueled by the recent cover of Valeurs actuelles, which features Bardella with the title 'Objectif 2027' and an IFOP study showing that 41% of French people believe he has the stature to be president.

**Sébastien Chenu Denies Rivalry Between Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella**
Sébastien Chenu, a close ally of Marine Le Pen, has denied any rivalry between Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, the leader of the Rassemblement national. Chenu stated, 'There is no mystery here, we are acting with transparency.' He emphasized that the goal for 2027 is for Le Pen to win, and if she is unable to do so due to ineligibility, then Bardella will take her place. Chenu also defended Le Pen's statement, saying it was taken out of context. Le Pen had previously stated that she had 'total confidence' in Bardella, and that she was following the debates on New Caledonia for two years. A recent poll by IFOP found that 41% of French people believe Bardella has the stature to be president in 2027.

**Republicans Reconsider Participation in Government**
The Republicans (LR) are reconsidering their participation in the government, led by President François Bayrou. The party's president, Bruno Retailleau, has stated that their exit from the government, like their entry, will be decided collectively. Some LR members are critical of Bayrou's actions, with one senator saying, 'There are only proposals for laws that have been voted on, no government text.' A deputy has also expressed disappointment, stating, 'His lack of courage depresses me. He is incapable of ensuring any cohesion.' Despite their participation in the government allowing LR to regain prominence, the party is now preparing for the 2027 election. They are studying reasons for breaking with the government, including opposition to the proportional representation system and refusal to increase taxes in the 2026 budget. Some LR members are even predicting a government censure in the fall.

**Mâcon to Host International Sommellerie Assembly in 2027**
Mâcon, a city in France, has been selected to host the International Sommellerie Assembly in 2027. A French delegation, led by Fabrice Sommier, the president of the Union de la sommellerie française, presented the city's candidacy in South Africa. According to Sommier, 'This is a challenge, but I was confident in our proposal.' The event will bring a 'formidable coup de projecteur' (a significant spotlight) on the Bourgogne du Sud region and Mâcon. The assembly will take place in June 2027.

**The Left-Wing Primaries in France: A Platform for Debate and Emergence**
The upcoming 2027 presidential election in France may not require a single left-wing candidate to win, according to Pierre Jacquemain. Pablo Pillaud-Vivien notes that primaries are often seen as divisive and media-driven, but they have also been a platform for democratic debate, project development, and the emergence of new figures. The recent results of the Socialist Party's congress show a close competition between Faure and Mayer-Rossignol, with the outcome of the second round potentially determining the future of the left-wing union in 2027. As Pillaud-Vivien says, 'Il faut que ça décolle sinon on va s'emmerder' ('It has to take off, otherwise we'll get bored'). The left-wing primaries are a living practice of the left-wing politics, and they will continue to shape the future of the French left.

**Three Potential Candidates Emerge for French Presidency in 2027**
Three potential candidates are emerging to succeed Emmanuel Macron as President of France in 2027: Bruno Retailleau, the current Minister of the Interior and winner of the Republican Party presidency; Gabriel Attal, the former Prime Minister, who is positioning himself for the center-right block; and Édouard Philippe, also a former Prime Minister under Macron. According to Mathilde Siraud, editor-in-chief of Le Point's political service, 'They are starting to line up for the succession of Emmanuel Macron.'

**2027 Presidential Election: Candidates Already Declaring or Considering a Run**
Two years before the 2027 presidential election, several candidates have already declared or are considering running. On the left, Jean-Luc Mélenchon is almost certain to be the candidate for La France Insoumise. Another certainty is that there will be a left-wing candidate outside of Mélenchon's party. The question is who will be chosen, with several options including Olivier Faure, Raphaël Glucksmann, and Bernard Cazeneuve. However, Glucksmann has refused to participate in a primary election, and Faure's opponents at the PS congress reject the idea of a large primary. Marine Tondelier and Lucie Castets are advocating for a 'primary of the left', hoping to convince La France Insoumie to join. Meanwhile, on the right, Edouard Philippe is seen as a strong candidate, but several others are also considering running, including Elisabeth Borne, Gabriel Attal, and Gérald Darmanin. François Bayrou is focusing on his survival as Prime Minister, while Bruno Retailleau is trying to lead a renaissance of the LR party after years of decline. The idea of a single candidate at the right and center is no longer dominant, and the game at the extreme right could reopen in mid-2026 when Marine Le Pen's eligibility is determined.

**The 2027 French Presidential Election: A Crucial Moment for France's Global Role**
The 2027 French presidential election will be crucial in determining the country's role in the global arena. Despite the US's growing influence in globalization, France remains a significant power in the European Union and the world. With a strong economy, nuclear military power, and a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, France is a key player in international relations. The country's leadership in the Francophonie organization, which comprises 900 million people who speak French, and its presence in various parts of the world, including Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas, make it a vital partner for the EU and the West. However, France faces challenges, including social and identity integration issues, which have led to a significant portion of its population supporting far-right parties. The country's economic muscle is also at risk of weakening, which could hinder its ability to lead in the global arena. The next president will need to navigate these challenges and assert France's voice in the world, reasserting Western values and differentiating itself from Chinese imperialism and US unilateralism. France has natural allies in Italy and Spain, but the upcoming election will be crucial in determining the country's future role in the world.

**French far-right's Bardella eyes 2027 presidency**
Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old leader of France's far-right National Rally, has stated that he would run for president in 2027 if his mentor Marine Le Pen is barred from seeking office due to a recent conviction. Le Pen, who is facing a five-year ban from public office, hopes to appeal the conviction and remain a candidate. Bardella emphasized the importance of unity and said that he would be Le Pen's candidate if she is disqualified. He also stated that he aims to modernize the party's image and broaden its appeal, particularly among younger voters. The 2027 election remains uncertain, with several potential candidates emerging, including former prime ministers Edouard Philippe and Gabriel Attal, and Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin.

**Four Former French Prime Ministers Consider Running for 2027 Presidential Election**
Several former French Prime Ministers are considering running for the 2027 presidential election. Édouard Philippe, who announced his candidacy in September 2024, is the most obvious candidate. He stated, 'I will be a candidate in the next presidential election. I am preparing to propose things to the French people. What I will propose will be massive. The French people will decide.' Michel Barnier, another potential candidate, has proposed a coalition between the center, the 'friends of Édouard Philippe' and Emmanuel Macron, and the Republicans. He stated, 'I think we need a coalition, and even if the future President of the Republic has a large party with him, what I want is that he pays attention to the others.' Dominique de Villepin, who has been speaking out on international issues, has not ruled out a candidacy, stating, 'At two years from the election, this question does not arise.' Gabriel Attal, who has been rallying support, has launched the 'two years for France' operation to develop a 'project for the country.' Bernard Cazeneuve, who has been multiplying meetings since creating his movement 'La Convention' in March 2023, is also considering a candidacy.

Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the president of Debout la France, announced his candidacy for the 2027 French presidential election. Speaking to his supporters in Yerres, Essonne, he said, 'I have the duty to be a candidate for the presidential election.' This comes after he lost his parliamentary seat in July 2024 in a three-way contest. Dupont-Aignan, who served as a deputy for 27 years, expressed his determination to run for the presidency, stating, 'I didn't think I'd be gathering you all here so soon to take up the fight again.'

**La Droite and the Demons of the Past: A New Battle for the Republicans**
A new battle is emerging on the right for the conquest of the 'Republicans' between Bruno Retailleau and Laurent Wauquiez. This election is a form of pre-selection for the 2027 presidential election, through which the right is rekindling its old demons. The election of the future president of the 'Republicans' will take place on May 17. The electoral process has been revealed this weekend, and it includes a classic system of candidate sponsorship by militants and parliamentarians, followed by official declarations before March 18. The election will have a first round on May 17 and a second round, if necessary, on May 25. Laurent Wauquiez, current president of the 'La Droite Républicaine' group in the National Assembly, and Bruno Retailleau, current Minister of the Interior, are the two main candidates. This election is a pre-selection for the 2027 presidential election, which the right believes it has a chance to win, considering the 2017 election as a 'holdup' and Emmanuel Macron's chances as 'overestimated'. With Macron unable to run in 2027, the right hopes to regain its place and dominance.

**Right and Center in France Gear Up for 2027 Presidential Election**
The right and center in France are gearing up for the 2027 presidential election. Laurent Wauquiez and Bruno Retailleau, two prominent figures in the Republican party, are vying for the party's presidency. Wauquiez declared his candidacy after Retailleau announced his bid, calling it a 'war of chiefs'. Retailleau, the Minister of the Interior, sent a letter to his party's militants announcing his candidacy, saying 'I want to do for my party what I do as Minister: speak the truth and act quickly.' Meanwhile, Gérald Darmanin, the Minister of Justice, is also making a push for the presidency, proposing several reforms and advocating for an open primary to determine the best candidate for the right and the party of President Emmanuel Macron. Gabriel Attal, a former Prime Minister, is also considering a run, and Christelle Morançais, the second-in-command of Edouard Philippe's party, has ruled out the idea of an internal primary for now.

Gérald Darmanin and Gabriel Attal have both made their moves, while even Sébastien Lecornu's name has been mentioned in the press as a possible candidate. As one commentator noted, 'Tout le monde est en train de jouer sa partition' (everyone is playing their part), in a game of musical chairs that will ultimately determine the next president of France.
