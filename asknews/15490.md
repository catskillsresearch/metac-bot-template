**House passes bill to scrutinize Taliban funding**
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the No Tax Dollars for Terrorists Act (H.R. 260) on Monday, which aims to limit the funding the Taliban receives from foreign governments and charities. According to Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), Afghans resisting Taliban rule have reported that nearly all cash aid sent to Afghanistan ends up in the hands of the Taliban. The legislation requires the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to discourage foreign aid to the Taliban and to support Afghan women and former U.S. military partners. Rep. Jonathan Jackson (D-Ill.) noted the bipartisan support for the measure, but criticized the Trump administration for a lack of transparency about its intentions for Afghanistan. The bill passed the House by voice vote without objection and will now proceed to the Senate for final passage.

**Court Rules District Must Continue to Provide Social Benefits to Rejected Asylum Seeker**
The Lower Saxony State Social Court in Celle has ruled that the Stade district must continue to provide social benefits to a rejected asylum seeker. According to the court, asylum seekers cannot have all their benefits withdrawn, even if they have been rejected under the Dublin procedure and an exit is not possible at the time. A new regulation by the federal government from the fall had provided for the withdrawal of social benefits from asylum seekers who are obliged to leave and have previously been registered in another EU country. The court's decision is based on the case of an Afghan man who entered Germany in April 2024 with a Polish Schengen visa. The man applied for asylum and was placed in a shelter, but the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) rejected his application and ordered his deportation to Poland. However, two planned transfers failed because the man was not found in the shelter. As a result, the man received cash benefits under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act until November 2024, and then only accommodation and individual benefits. The court ruled that a voluntary departure was not possible because the Dublin procedure does not provide for it. This decision is not unique, as several social courts have already made similar rulings in other cases.

**'For Sale': DOGE moves to sell off almost half a billion in federal real estate, relocate cabinet agency HQs**
The Senate's DOGE leader, Sen. Joni Ernst, is proposing the 'For Sale Act' to sell off nearly half a billion dollars in federal real estate in Washington, D.C. The properties, which include the headquarters of the Departments of Energy, Housing & Urban Development, and other top agencies, would be sold without attrition or layoffs, as employees would be relocated elsewhere. Ernst stated, 'The Agriculture building is the perfect 'fixer-upper' to be on the market.' The sale would aim to reduce the national debt, currently at $36 trillion. The legislation would also include safeguards against foreign entities buying up the buildings, and any entity in which a foreign national is a 'beneficial owner' would be prohibited from participating in any federal real estate sales. Ernst and DOGE previously successfully mandated the sale of the aging Wilbur J. Cohen Federal Building, which had only 72 people working there as of 2024.

**Ask Eartha: What's important to know about federal tax credits for solar?**
The proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act could terminate the 30% federal tax credit for solar installations 180 days after it's signed into law, potentially cutting the timeline short by more than six years. The current timeline guarantees the full 30% credit through 2032. The bill has passed the U.S. House of Representatives and is now under consideration in the U.S. Senate, where lawmakers have proposed changes. If signed into law, homeowners would have only six months to install solar and qualify for the full federal tax credit. Solarize Summit is designed to help homeowners move quickly and confidently, and participants can access up to $2,400 in combined incentives. The takeaway is that 2025 is one of the most affordable and impactful years to go solar, with the combination of the federal tax credit, local rebates, and the streamlined Solarize Summit process.

**10,000 Danes to Receive Fewer Payments from July 1, 2025**
Approximately 10,000 Danes will receive fewer payments from the government as of July 1, 2025, due to a new law. The law, which was passed by a majority in the Danish parliament, introduces stricter and more uniform work requirements for recipients of cash assistance. According to the Ministry of Employment, the new rules will particularly affect non-Western immigrants who have been living in Denmark for a long time but have had limited involvement in the labor market. 'The new rules will ensure that everyone who has come to Denmark will have to meet the same employment requirements to receive the higher cash assistance rate,' said the Ministry of Employment. To receive the higher rate, individuals will now need to have had at least 2.5 years of full-time work in the past 10 years and have lived in Denmark for at least 9 out of the past 10 years. 'This means that many in this group risk losing access to the higher rate unless they meet both employment and residence requirements,' the Ministry added. The new law is expected to affect around 10,000 people, who will be downgraded to the lowest rate.

**Centre plotting against K-P govt: CM**
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur accused the federal government and establishment of plotting against the provincial government, warning that he would dissolve the assembly if directed by PTI patron-in-chief Imran Khan. Gandapur alleged that the events of May 9 were used as a pretext to eliminate the PTI and its leader, and that the federal government is conspiring to topple the K-P government through a financial emergency. He claimed that the province's revenue has surpassed Rs93 billion and is projected to reach Rs129 billion in the next fiscal year, and that Rs150 billion in cash reserves remain in the debt servicing account. Gandapur said, 'We will never let this conspiracy succeed,' and that the provincial budget will be passed as per the PTI's decision, but with the option to make changes upon Imran's directives. He also accused the establishment of orchestrating PTI's ouster from power through a carefully crafted conspiracy, and lamented that constitutional provisions were violated and elections were deliberately delayed to sabotage the party's position.

**Cash Machines to Undergo Changes to Improve Accessibility**
As of June 28, cash machines will undergo changes to comply with the new accessibility law. The law, which aims to improve accessibility for people with disabilities, includes features such as larger font, audio guides, and a redesigned interface and menu. The Guardia Civil warns that many people make a common mistake when withdrawing cash from an ATM, which can lead to financial losses. The new regulations also include requirements for ATM manufacturers, such as adapting icons, text, and screen brightness, as well as adding audio instructions and tactile buttons. Additionally, ATMs will have a maximum lifespan of 10 years and a maximum cost of €3,000 per unit. This change is expected to benefit older adults, who will have improved access to cash machines.

**KMT Lawmakers Push for Welfare Bills Ahead of Recall Vote**
As the recall vote approaches, Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers are working hard to counter the recall by promoting their legislative achievements and pushing for more welfare bills. KMT Legislative Party Secretary-General Wang Hung-wei said that bills such as universal cash handouts and anti-child abuse laws are on schedule and should be completed before July 26. The KMT will also continue to push for other welfare bills. The People First Party will also introduce a bill to grant the Supreme Court the power to approve or reject the president's appointments and another to abolish the Control Yuan. Wu Shih-yao, the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) legislative party whip, criticized the KMT for using the child abuse issue to scare voters and distract from their own failures. Wang Hung-wei responded, saying that the KMT has been pushing for welfare bills and they are all on schedule, including the bill to provide universal cash handouts, which will be processed after the cold storage period ends in early July. The bill to amend the Criminal Code to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment for child abuse will also be completed before the recall vote on July 26.

**Reps. Torre & White: Legislative session summary — Waterbury Roundabout**
Reps. Dara Torre and Candice White provided a summary of the legislative session, highlighting key bills passed, including H.454, the education transformation bill. This bill aims to transform the education system by 2028, switching from voter-approved district school budgets to a 'block grant'-style foundation formula. The new funding mechanism will be implemented slowly, with completion in 2033. The goal is to provide every school with the funding its students deserve in a more understandable and affordable way. Additionally, childcare centers received a 5% boost for infant and toddler care, and social service agencies saw a 2% rate increase. Over $1 million was directed to food and nutrition programs, and an additional $1.3 million will support substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery. The legislature has also planned a response process in case of reductions in federal funding, with nearly $100 million in contingency funding available to offset funding shortfalls in federal grant programs.

**How They "Clunkered" Us**
The author reflects on the past, when used cars were affordable and common, and how the 'cash for clunkers' program in 2008 destroyed the supply of older cars, making it difficult for teenagers and young adults to afford a car. The program, which was meant to stimulate demand for new vehicles, paid people to bring in their old cars to be destroyed in exchange for cash to be used towards the purchase of a new car. This led to a shortage of affordable used cars, making it necessary for people to finance new cars, which many cannot afford. The author argues that this has led to a generation of young people who cannot afford to own a car, and are therefore not bothered to get a driver's license. The author hopes that by writing this, people will remember the past and understand why owning a car is no longer affordable for many.

**How They “Clunkered” Us – The Burning Platform**
The author, Eric Peters, reflects on the past to understand the present high cost of used cars. He notes that in the past, used cars were affordable and abundant, but the introduction of 'cash for clunkers' in the 1990s destroyed the supply of older cars, making it difficult for teenagers and those on a low income to afford a car. Peters argues that this program was designed to make it seem like a good thing to destroy functional, affordable older vehicles, and that it has had a lasting impact on the car market, making it necessary for people to finance their cars, which many cannot afford. He concludes that today's youth has no idea that they have been 'gypped' by this program and that it is his hope that by writing this, a few people will learn about it and remember what has been forgotten.

**Here Are The Transportation-Related Executive Orders You Would Sign If You Were President For A Day - Jalopnik**
Jalopnik readers were asked to imagine they were President for a day and draft transportation-related executive orders. Some of the suggestions include: making motorcycle lane filtering/splitting legal nationwide, implementing a national semi-truck speed limit of 55 mph, and offering a 'cash for clunkers' incentive for vehicles over 10 years old. Other proposals include tax credits for buying cars that were once a poster favorite, mandatory driving education similar to Germany's, and a federal ban on coal rolling on public roads. Additionally, readers suggested requiring special licenses for large vehicles, implementing road tests for drivers over 70, and incentivizing states to hire inmates for road construction jobs.

**Cash for clunkers? Desperate Diesel begs for 'Furious' funding**
Vin Diesel is seeking funding for an 11th 'Fast & Furious' movie, despite the franchise's declining creative and financial performance. Diesel took to social media to beg for closure after the cliffhanger ending of 'Fast X', which made $146 million in the US but was one of the most expensive films ever made. Meanwhile, Disney is struggling to produce 'Star Wars' movies, with the last installment being 'The Rise of Skywalker' in 2019. A new 'Star Wars' project, 'Star Wars: Starfighter', is in the works, featuring Ryan Gosling and director Shawn Levy. Molly Ringwald has criticized her own classic films, such as 'The Breakfast Club', as 'very white' and 'problematic'. Ringwald expressed her views during a reunion of the film's cast at the C2E2 pop culture convention in Chicago. Jimmy Kimmel revealed that he sees his talk show as a platform to 'scream' about politics, rather than to inform or entertain. George Clooney has been criticized for his public letter suggesting that President Joe Biden was too mentally compromised to continue his 2024 presidential campaign. Clooney claimed that it was his 'civic duty' to speak out, but waited until after the June 27 presidential debate and Biden's declining poll numbers to do so.

**Pashtun land is not for sale**
The Pashtun people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are resisting the transformation of their ancestral lands into corporate extraction zones. The recently passed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mines and Minerals Act 2025 clears the legal path for corporations and federal authorities to grab indigenous land and resources, often under military oversight and without consent. The author, Levsa Bayankhail, writes, 'Our land is not for sale, and our silence is not your consent.' She rejects the 2025 KP Mines and Minerals Act and the Minerals Investment Forum as a corporate-colonial venture. Bayankhail calls for unity among Pakistan's oppressed nationalities, including Pashtuns, Baloch, Sindhis, Kashmiris, and Gilgitis, to raise their voices against this extractive order. The fight is not just for minerals, but for dignity, sovereignty, and the right to exist on their own land. Bayankhail concludes, 'Down with colonialism. Down with corporate loot. Long live the resistance of the colonized.'

**Cash for Clunkers: A Policy So Brief, Even Its Website Crashed**
In 2010, the Australian Labor government introduced the 'Cash for Clunkers' policy, which aimed to promote environmentally friendly cars. However, the policy was short-lived and poorly received, and its website crashed due to high traffic. The policy was seen as a way for the government to show concern for the environment without upsetting voters or car companies. Despite its brief existence, the policy has become a footnote in Australian politics, remembered only as a failed attempt to promote sustainability.

**Should Old Cars Undergo Mandatory Inspections?**
A member of parliament, Puah, suggested mandatory inspections for old cars to prevent accidents and traffic congestion. He also proposed introducing cash incentives to encourage car owners to scrap their old vehicles, similar to the 'Cash for Clunkers' program. Puah noted that nearly every Malaysian owns at least two vehicles, contributing to traffic congestion, pollution, and other transportation issues. A well-implemented scrappage program could stimulate the local economy by increasing demand for new, fuel-efficient vehicles, benefiting the automotive industry and promoting technological advancements.
