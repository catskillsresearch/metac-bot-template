**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**Neuroscientist Predicts 'Mind Uploading' Will Become a Reality in the Future**
Neuroscientist Dobromir Rahnev believes that the idea of 'mind uploading', or transferring human consciousness into a computer, will become a reality one day. However, he notes that current technology is not yet advanced enough to achieve this goal. According to Rahnev, the human brain is the most complex structure in the universe, and copying it digitally is a daunting task. Not only would the brain's entire structure need to be digitized, but also all the sensory inputs it is accustomed to, such as sight, sound, touch, smell, and movement. Rahnev estimates that it would take a supercomputer with the necessary processing power and information to simulate these systems. Currently, scientists are unable to create a digital simulation of even a small part of the brain. Rahnev believes that it may take 100 years or more for the technology to advance to the point where mind uploading is possible. However, he is optimistic that it could happen within 200 years.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**Mind Uploading: A Theoretical Possibility, but a Long Way to Go**
According to Dr. Dobromir Rahnev, a neuropsychologist from the Georgia Institute of Technology, the idea of 'Mind Uploading', or transferring human consciousness into a computer, is theoretically possible. However, the process would require a simulated version of the world for the consciousness to interact with. The complexity of the human brain, with its 86 billion neurons, is one of the biggest challenges in achieving this goal. Researchers have made initial steps in brain mapping, but a detailed 3D model of the human brain does not yet exist. Even if it were possible to scan all neural connections, the dynamics and interactions of these cells would need to be realistically simulated. Additionally, a digital consciousness would require a realistic simulation of the external world, including sensory experiences such as sight, sound, touch, and even breathing and blinking. The necessary computational power is currently beyond what is available, but technological advancements in AI and neuroinformatics are progressing rapidly. Some visionaries hope for breakthroughs that could make Mind Uploading possible by 2045, but a more realistic timeline is 100 to 200 years.

**Scientists: Uploading the Human Mind onto a Chip May be Possible within 20 Years**
Scientists believe that it may be possible to 'download' a human being in its entirety onto a chip within the next 20 years. According to Professor Dobromir Rahnev from the Department of Neuroscientific at Georgia Tech, the idea of 'uploading the mind' is becoming a serious concept. In this hypothetical digital existence, one could eat, drive a car, fly, or even travel between galaxies, thanks to a digital simulation of reality. While the idea is still purely theoretical, neuroscientists agree that it is possible, but we are still far from achieving it. The first condition for uploading the mind is the ability to scan the entire brain and create a precise three-dimensional map of the 86 billion neurons and trillions of connections between them. However, scientists have so far only been able to map the brain of a fly and some parts of a mouse's brain. The challenge goes beyond scanning, as it also requires modeling the behavior of each neuron, which changes constantly. No one knows exactly what level of detail is required to accurately simulate the brain: is it at the molecular level or deeper? Perhaps understanding how the brain works will make it easier to find solutions, like building a car from scratch instead of simulating an old one without understanding its components. However, currently, scientists cannot even replace one neuron with an artificial one. Despite the challenges, the rapid pace of technological progress, especially in artificial intelligence and computing, keeps this dream alive. Billionaires who dream of immortality are willing to fund ambitious research. While some estimates suggest that uploading the mind may be possible by 2045, other experts consider these predictions overly optimistic. It is more likely, according to some scientists, that we will not achieve this within the current century, but perhaps within the next 200 years.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Can the Human Brain be Digitally Transferred? The Future of Mind Uploading**
The idea of uploading human consciousness into a computer and living digitally is a concept that has been explored in science fiction, but it is theoretically possible. This concept is known as 'mind uploading' and would allow individuals to exist in a digital world, even without a physical body. However, the biggest obstacle to this is the human brain. Scientists consider the brain to be the most complex structure in the universe, with approximately 86 billion neurons and trillions of connections. Currently, only the brain of a fly has been fully mapped, and only small sections of a mouse's brain have been detailed. It could take decades to model the human brain at this scale, and even then, simulating how neurons change over time would be a significant challenge. When a person's mind is uploaded into a computer, not only would their thoughts be simulated, but also their senses, such as sight, sound, and touch, would need to be simulated. Without these senses, the mind could experience severe psychological problems, known as 'sensory deprivation,' which could be equivalent to torture over time. Therefore, a successful mind upload would require not only a highly accurate simulation of the brain but also of the environment and senses. Currently, neither computer power nor scientific knowledge has reached this level. While some scientists believe that this technology could be possible by 2045, considering the current pace of brain research, this date may be overly optimistic. Some experts even suggest that it may not be possible until the end of the 22nd century. However, given the rapid progress of technology, the possibility of achieving this goal in the next 200 years is not negligible. Moreover, billions of dollars have already been invested in research to achieve this goal.

**The First Person to Live Eternally May Be Born During Your Lifetime**
According to Omar Kardoudi, a scientist who studies brain perception and mental information transfer, it may be possible for the first person to live eternally during your lifetime. However, this person would not have a physical body. They would be able to perform all the tasks they do in real life, but in a simulated environment. Currently, scientists are struggling to understand the functioning of the brain, with 86 billion neurons and billions of connections that constantly adjust their functioning. It is unclear how many levels of complexity researchers need to reach to simulate a functioning brain. Kardoudi notes that even small distortions could have severe mental consequences, and that the current computational power is not sufficient to scan and map the 3D structure of the human brain. Nevertheless, he believes that the rapid advancements in computing power and artificial intelligence may make it possible to achieve this goal, potentially by 2045 or even sooner.

**Transferring the Human Mind to a Computer: A Theoretical Possibility**
As a neuroscientist, it is theoretically possible to transfer the human mind to a computer, but it would come with significant limitations. Jesus Díaz, a scientist who studies brain perception and information transfer, notes that 'the object most complex in the universe, the brain, needs the same inputs it has always had.' This means that a simulated brain would require a vast amount of computational power to function, equivalent to scanning and mapping the 3D structure of the entire human brain. Currently, researchers lack the necessary computational power to simulate even a small portion of the brain, such as a mouse's brain or a rat's brain. The human brain consists of 86 billion neurons and trillions of connections, making it difficult to determine how many levels of complexity the researchers need to reach to create a functioning simulated brain. 'It's difficult to know how many levels we need to descend to for the simulated brain to work,' Díaz says. 'Do we need to stop at the molecular level? 2045? 2145? Or later?' The development of artificial intelligence and computational power is accelerating, but it may take decades or even centuries to achieve the necessary level of complexity to simulate the human brain.

**Can you upload a human mind into a computer? A neuroscientist ponders what's possible - North Country Now**
A neuroscientist, Dobromir Rahnev, discusses the possibility of 'mind uploading', where a person's consciousness is transferred into a computer. While theoretically possible, the challenge lies in replicating the complexity of the human brain. The brain needs the same inputs it always had, including sensory simulations, to function properly. Researchers are currently working on brain mapping, but capturing the identities of all 86 billion neurons and their trillions of connections is a daunting task. Rahnev believes that mind uploading may be possible in the future, but it's uncertain when it will happen, with some predictions as early as 2045 and others as late as the end of the century.

**Can you upload a human mind to a computer? A neuroscientist reveals all**
Mind uploading, the concept of transferring a human mind into a computer, is theoretically possible, but extremely challenging. According to brain scientist Dobromir Rahnev, replicating the brain's complexity will be difficult, requiring the same inputs it always had, including sensory simulations. Even minor distortions could have serious mental consequences. Researchers are currently at the early stages of brain mapping, and capturing the identities of all 86 billion neurons and their trillions of connections is not enough. Uploading this information by itself into a computer won't accomplish much, as each neuron constantly adjusts its functioning. It's hard to know how many levels down researchers must go to make the simulated brain work. Rahnev believes that mind uploading will one day be a reality, but it might happen in 200 years, not 2045 or the end of this century. He says, 'I would be shocked if mind uploading works in the next 100 years. But it might happen in 200 - which means the first person to live forever could be born in your lifetime.'

**Alternative splicing across the C. elegans nervous system - Nature Communications**
Researchers from the CeNGEN project analyzed data from 55 individual neuron types in C. elegans to produce an atlas of alternative splicing (AS). They developed analytical tools to make the data available to the research community and studied differential AS between neuron types. The results showed that key neuronal genes display broad patterns of differential AS. The researchers established overall patterns of differential splicing and developed a computational approach to extract a regulatory network for differential AS. They used the network to identify candidate factors that regulate differential alternative splicing. The study also identified novel alternative transcripts in the genes unc-40/DCC and sax-3/ROBO, and found that these transcripts are conserved in other nematode species. The researchers also detected novel alternative first exons in the genes sax-3/ROBO and ceh-8, and found that these exons affect coding potential. The study demonstrates that the approach can detect novel alternative first exons and contribute to transcript diversity. The data and analytical methods are available via a web portal at www.splicing.cengen.org.

**Elon Musk's New Chip to Give the Blind Superhuman Vision**
Elon Musk has confirmed that Neuralink is developing a technology that can restore vision to people who are completely blind. According to Musk, the technology, called Blindsight, will not only restore vision but also surpass the capabilities of the human eye. The innovation is based on direct connection to the visual cortex of the brain, bypassing damaged eyes and optic nerves. Musk tweeted that the initial image quality will be similar to early computer graphics, but the technology will eventually reach a superhuman level. This development is considered the next step in the development of the Neuralink platform, which has already demonstrated the ability to transmit signals between the brain and a computer. Neuralink has successfully implanted chips that allow paralyzed people to control electronics with their minds. The development of Blindsight was first announced in March 2024, and Musk reported positive test results, including the restoration of vision in a monkey. In September 2024, the US Department of Health granted Blindsight the status of a 'revolutionary device' and allowed human testing. Neuralink has announced its readiness to perform the first implantation of the Blindsight chip by the end of 2025. The project has the potential to be a breakthrough not only in neurology and ophthalmology but also in the entire field of biotechnology. Musk plans to implant the chip in himself in the future, which will allow not only control of electronics but also restoration of limb mobility, fighting depression, and improving brain efficiency. Musk predicts that AI will become smarter than any human by the end of 2025, and the probability of AI surpassing the collective intelligence of all humans by 2030 is 100%.

**We Can, Must, and Will Simulate Nematode Brains - 3 Quarks Daily**
A near-perfect simulation of the human brain could have profound implications for humanity, enabling new forms of intelligence, creativity, and exploration. However, reverse-engineering the human brain's vast network of neurons and synapses is a significant challenge. Scientists have turned to simpler model organisms, such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which has a brain consisting of just 300 neurons. Despite 25 years of research, simulating C. elegans has been met with little success. Nevertheless, with today's technology, the task is now possible and necessary, according to scientists.

**By 2045, Could Messi's Brain Be Transferred to Another Player? The Future of Sports Tech.**
By 2045, scientists may be able to transfer Lionel Messi's skills into another player's brain using advanced neurotechnology, AI, and genetic engineering. This could be achieved through neural skill uploading, where Messi's brain is scanned and his motor skills, decision-making, and reflexes are transferred into a young player's brain. Alternatively, AI could create a 'digital Messi' that mimics his playing style and decision-making, providing real-time feedback to the player's brain. Other technologies, such as the Messi exoskeleton, which uses AI-controlled muscle stimulators to mimic Messi's movements, and gene-editing, which could modify a player's DNA to replicate Messi's traits, could also be used to create the next Messi. However, this raises massive ethical questions about the future of football and whether players would still be admired if they were engineered for greatness.

**BCI and AI Allow the Mind to Control Robot Arm**
Scientists at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) have published a study in Cell that demonstrates a brain-computer interface (BCI) powered by artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning that allows a paralyzed man to control a robotic arm using his thoughts for seven months without recalibration. This is a significant advancement in BCIs, which previously required adjustments after only a day or two. The study shows that AI machine learning can enhance BCI performance by accounting for day-to-day neural activity changes due to learning. The researchers used an invasive BCI implanted via neurosurgery and AI machine learning to decode the complex neural activity. The participant, a 41-year-old man who had a stroke years prior, was able to control a virtual robot arm and then an actual robot arm using his thoughts. The researchers plan to continue to improve the AI model's speed and motion fluidity, as well as analyze the BCI performance in a home setting. 'Our nervous system needs to balance maintaining a stable neural representation of a large repertoire of well-rehearsed actions while also facilitating new learning,' said corresponding author and neurologist Karunesh Ganguly, MD, PhD. 'We use the term'representation' to refer to the distribution of activity patterns during repeated performance of an action.' The market size for BCIs is expected to grow at an annual compound growth rate of 18% and reach USD 6.52 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research estimates.

**NVIDIA Will Dominate Until ~ 2030, Then Decline Rapidly**
NVIDIA's dominance in artificial intelligence hardware is expected to decline rapidly by 2030 due to the limitations of traditional computing architectures. Despite massive investments, AI still cannot reason, generalize, or think beyond statistical patterns. The industry is beginning to see the limits of brute-force computation, and NVIDIA has no long-term solution. A new revolution in AI hardware is unfolding - neuromorphic computing, which mirrors biological intelligence and is extremely energy efficient. Companies like Intel, BrainChip, and IBM are leading the neuromorphic AI revolution, developing chips that can process data ten times faster while using a fraction of the energy of traditional GPUs. By 2030, AI training on GPUs will become economically unsustainable, and neuromorphic processors will begin overtaking GPUs in real-world applications. By 2035, neuromorphic computing will become the new standard for AI hardware, and NVIDIA will either pivot to neuromorphic AI or face irrelevance.
