**NASA's Europa Clipper Mission Canceled, but Technology Could Explore Enceladus Instead**
NASA has announced that the Europa Clipper mission, originally planned to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, has been canceled in 2023. However, the technology that supports it can be used to explore Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons. According to Interesting Engineering, the subsurface oceans of both Europa and Enceladus could potentially harbor life, making them prime targets for searching for extraterrestrial life in our solar system. If the Europa Clipper mission had launched, it would have collected data on the possibility of life on Europa. The mission was not an easy one, as the intense radiation from Jupiter would damage electronic devices, and communication time would be limited due to Europa's short orbital period of 85 hours. As NASA's Dr. said, 'The mission was not feasible due to the harsh environment of Jupiter.'

**This 'lost city' at the bottom of the ocean is unlike anything else seen on Earth**
Scientists have discovered a 'lost city' at the bottom of the ocean, a 700-meter-long section of seafloor called the Lost City Hydrothermal Field. The city is estimated to be at least 120,000 years old and is home to vast communities of microbial lifeforms that feed off hydrocarbons. Researchers have recently recovered a 1,268-meter-long sample of mantle rock from the area, which could help them learn more about how life originated on Earth. Some scientists believe that understanding the lifeforms in this 'lost city' could provide evidence of ecosystems active on other planetary bodies like Europa or Enceladus, and even provide insight into how life existed on Mars in the past. 'This might not be an underwater road to Atlantis, but understanding more about the iconic 'lost city' at the bottom of the Atlantic could tell us more about our planet's earliest days,' said researchers.

**Scientific Highlights: Homo Sapiens, Prototaxites, Antimatter, and Extraterrestrial Life**
This month's scientific highlights include the success of Homo Sapiens, the enigmatic prototaxites, the transportation of antimatter, and the search for extraterrestrial life. Researchers have identified 7 key factors that contributed to the success of our species, according to Sciences et Avenir. However, some scientists may have gotten ahead of themselves in their claims of finding extraterrestrial life, as noted by Slate. The BASE experiment has made significant progress in transporting antimatter, as reported by CERN. Meanwhile, Trust my science questions the feasibility of antimatter bombs. 'When can we reasonably expect to find signs of extraterrestrial life?' remains an open question.

**NASA's Europa Clipper Mission Canceled, but Technology Could Explore Enceladus for Life**
NASA announced that the Europa Clipper mission, which was originally planned to land on Jupiter's moon Europa in 2030, has been canceled in 2023. However, the technology that supports it could be used to explore Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons. According to interesting engineering, the subsurface oceans of Europa and Enceladus could potentially harbor life, making them promising places to search for extraterrestrial life in our solar system. If the Europa Clipper mission had launched, it would have collected data on the possibility of life on Europa. The original plan was to send a lander to search for biosignatures if the Clipper mission found good evidence of a habitable environment. However, the mission was challenging due to the intense radiation from Jupiter, which would damage electronic devices, and the limited communication time due to Europa's short orbital period of 85 hours.

**Argentine Students Win Prestigious NASA Competition and Will Represent Latin America in International Final**
A group of students from the Southern International School in Hudson, Berazategui, Argentina, won the first place in the Desafío Espacial Latinoamericano (DESLA) 2025, a prestigious educational competition organized by NASA. The team, composed of 14 students, designed a colony on one of Jupiter's moons, Europa, which would be a tourist destination for 2000 residents and 450 tourists annually. The project required innovative solutions for engineering, sustainability, and human well-being in an extraterrestrial environment. 'We understood from the beginning that designing a colony for Europa was not just an academic exercise, but a simulation of the future,' said Clara Pérez Beitia. The team will travel to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on July 24 to represent Latin America in the international final, where they will compete with students from Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North America. 'We learned to work under pressure and as a team,' said Victoria Gabrieludis. 'We also learned to ask for help when needed and to correct ourselves in a constructive way.' The team's design, a structure in the shape of a beehive, was chosen for its resistance to extreme conditions and its visual appeal. 'We had to find a structure that could withstand the movements of the ice and be attractive to tourists,' said Victoria. 'The beehive design was a creative solution that met both requirements.' The team's experience in the competition was not without challenges, including presenting the project in Spanish when they had prepared it in English. 'I had to translate everything in real-time,' said Juan Filloy. 'But I knew the content well and was able to resolve it.' The team's success is a testament to the talent and preparation of young Latin Americans in the field of space science and technology. 'We never give up,' said Victoria. 'If one really tries and works hard, they can achieve any goal.'

**NASA's Robot Ready for Encelado: New Hope in the Search for Life**
After years of development and testing, a sophisticated robot designed to land on Europa, a frozen moon of Jupiter, may now be directed towards Encelado, a moon of Saturn, considered a more suitable destination for searching for extraterrestrial life. The prototype, initially linked to the Europa Clipper mission, was designed with advanced technical solutions to tackle extreme environmental conditions: temperatures between -160 and -220 degrees Celsius, intense radiation, and difficult communication with Earth. The lander features articulated legs for a safe descent on irregular surfaces, a stereoscopic camera for visual exploration, and a mechanical arm with sensors for collecting samples up to 20 cm deep using the ICEPICK tool. The machine has successfully passed tests on terrain similar to Europa's icy surface, such as the Matanuska Glacier in Alaska. However, the latest planetary exploration strategy developed by NASA in 2023 excluded the possibility of a landing mission on Europa due to the high levels of radiation from Jupiter, which would make it unlikely for any biosignatures to survive on the moon's surface, compromising the effectiveness of the entire operation.

**What if we found life beyond Earth?**
The discovery of life beyond Earth has long been a topic of human imagination, from ancient myths to modern science fiction. But what if this was no longer just a fantasy? What if scientists announced tomorrow that they had found conclusive evidence of life, even if it's simple, elsewhere in the universe? How would our world change? Recent scientific discoveries suggest that we may be on the brink of achieving this dream, which would mean a historic shift in our understanding of the universe and our place in it. In April 2025, a team from the University of Cambridge announced the discovery of strong signals of life on the exoplanet K2-18b, 124 light-years from Earth. Researchers detected gases like dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in its atmosphere, which are produced by living organisms on Earth, such as seaweed. This discovery, made using the James Webb Space Telescope, is a significant step towards confirming the existence of life beyond our planet, although further studies are needed to confirm that these compounds are not the result of non-biological processes. Dr. Nico Madhusudhan, the lead researcher, says that finding life beyond Earth, even if it's microbial, would be 'the greatest discovery in human history', confirming that we are not alone in this vast universe and fundamentally changing our view of biology, the history of life, and even the possibility of intelligent civilizations. This discovery will raise many scientific questions, such as: 'Do extraterrestrial life forms share our DNA?', 'How did life evolve in a completely different environment?', and 'Can life be based on elements other than carbon and water?' It will not be just a scientific achievement, but a cultural and philosophical earthquake, as it will open deep discussions in religions and philosophies around the world about humanity's place in the universe, the relationship between faith and science, and the purpose of existence itself. The media, art, literature, and cinema will witness a new wave of production inspired by this event, and concepts like 'the other', 'the strange', and 'human boundaries' will be re-examined. This will not be without tension, as the idea of 'others' there, even if they are not threatening, may cause collective anxiety and panic in some communities. However, many people may feel a sense of unity and belonging to the 'universe' rather than just Earth, as the study suggests. If the discovery is made through an international space mission, it may drive the world towards more scientific and technological cooperation, and perhaps create a rare case of human unity that transcends political boundaries. But if the discovery is made by a single country, it may start new competitions, not towards armament, but towards exploring life and possibly communicating with it. Through the above, it seems that this event, if it occurs, will mark the beginning of a 'new cosmic era' that changes humanity's goals from survival on Earth to becoming a multi-planetary civilization, and scientific research resources may be directed towards understanding extraterrestrial life, developing interstellar travel means, and thinking about new laws governing relations with other beings.

**New space mission to Venus could reveal signs of alien life**
A new, multi-stage space mission is set to launch in 2031, aiming to search for signs of alien life in the acidic clouds of Venus. The planet, with temperatures reaching 456 degrees Celsius, is considered one of the most inhospitable places in the solar system. According to NASA, the mission will be a significant step in understanding the planet's atmosphere and potentially revealing evidence of life beyond Earth. As Dr. David Wysotski, a leading expert in the field, said, 'The discovery of life on Venus would be a groundbreaking moment in the history of space exploration.' The mission is a collaborative effort between space agencies and scientists, with the goal of expanding our knowledge of the universe and potentially answering the question of whether we are alone in the cosmos.

**3.7 Billion-Year-Old Organic Molecules on Mars: A Step Towards a New Era of Life?**
NASA and private space companies are in a priority race, while organic molecules discovered on Mars have caused excitement in the scientific community. Andy Weir's 'The Martian' novel and film, which has become a reality, is a step-by-step process. What does this mean for humanity and our world? In recent years, Mars has become the biggest excitement for the scientific community and space enthusiasts. Mars, being a neighbor to Earth, has a potential for new life and exploration. Searching for life signs on Mars, solving the planet's past climate, and establishing permanent settlements, are considered important milestones for humanity's future in space. The Martian film, which was adapted to the big screen in 2015, detailed and realistically portrayed NASA's plans to send humans to Mars by 2035. The film tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, who is left behind on Mars after a storm and must survive with limited resources. NASA also makes a great effort to rescue him. The Martian has turned into a reality. In the US, there is a debate about whether Mars or the Moon should be prioritized. Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman thinks that Mars should be prioritized. However, Elon Musk's priority is also Mars, but he has been criticized for his approach. China's increasing activity on the Moon is also affecting the US's strategic decisions. Trump and Musk's priority on Mars can be interpreted as follows: 'Mars, although it seems like both of their priorities, has not been left out of the equation. Ultimately, Mars is a difficult road, and the Moon is an important station. It's a destination, as well as a stopover.' 'Of course, Mars is much more important and has a much greater return. Both scientifically and technologically, Mars travel requires significant investments. The work done will result in technologies that can be adapted to daily life on Earth, changing our lives in different forms.' 'Even if humans are not on Mars by 2031, they will be very close to it in the 2030s.' Elon Musk has announced that he will send an 'unmanned' spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026 and that humans can go to Mars by 2031. Do you think humanity is close to achieving this goal? 'Because this work has long exceeded the realm of imagination. This process can be described as 'a very ambitious goal.' The fact that large companies are investing so much in this indicates that they have significant commercial expectations. The timeline may be a bit behind schedule. Humans may not be on Mars by 2031, but they will be very close to it in the late 2030s.' 'The fact that Mars has signs of past life, which may indicate that the necessary conditions for life exist there, is a significant discovery.' Sabancı University Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Astrofysics Professor Ersin Göğüş recently discovered large organic molecules on Mars. This has raised questions about biological activity on Mars. The molecules found on Mars are similar to those produced by life on Earth and have remained intact for approximately 3.7 billion years without being affected by geological activity, moisture, or heat. This suggests that the molecules on Mars are as old as life on Earth. What does this mean? Can Mars give us clues about our world's past and future? 'Of course, it can.' 'We know that the first signs of life appeared on Mars and Earth around the same time, approximately 4 billion years ago. We also know that Mars lost its atmosphere due to extreme solar winds, which could have led to the end of life. Although this is not a risk for Earth, humanity's excessive use of the planet could have negative consequences.' 'The Mars mission is motivating the development of new technologies.' Some people criticize the billions of dollars spent on sending humans to Mars, saying that 'it's a luxury to invest in space while solving problems on Earth.' Do you think this criticism is justified?

**NASA Considers Enceladus as a More Promising Target for Searching for Extraterrestrial Life**
The NASA mission to deliver a lander to Jupiter's moon Europa was canceled in 2023. However, the technologies developed for this expedition can be used to study another icy moon, Enceladus, which orbits Saturn. The Europa Clipper project's robotic prototype successfully passed testing, but the extreme conditions on Europa made landing too risky. Now, NASA considers Enceladus a more suitable target for searching for extraterrestrial life due to its subsurface ocean and relatively low radiation levels. As NASA's deputy associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, Maria Zuber, said, 'Enceladus is a more accessible and more promising target for searching for life beyond Earth.' The technologies developed for the Europa Clipper mission, such as the ICEPICK instrument, which can take ice samples from a depth of up to 20 centimeters, can be adapted for a mission to Enceladus. The Enceladus moon is similar to Europa in that it has a large subsurface ocean, making it a promising object in the Solar System where life forms may exist.

**Scientists Suggest Europa Could Harbor Life**
Scientists from the US and Germany have published a study in the journal 'Science Advances' suggesting that a small part of a bacterium could be detected by the upcoming NASA mission 'Europa Clipper' in 2024. The mission aims to explore the Jupiter moon Europa, which has a thick ice crust covering a vast ocean. The researchers analyzed two impact craters on Europa, Callanish and Tyre, and found that the ice crust must be at least 20 kilometers thick for the observed ring-like structures to form. This suggests that the ice crust is warm and in motion, allowing for exchange with the ocean below. Additionally, a team led by Fabian Klenner from the University of Washington and the Free University of Berlin suggests that the Saturn moon Enceladus, which ejects water vapor and ice crystals into space, could also be a potential candidate for life. The 'Europa Clipper' mission will carry a device to measure the composition of small ice particles ejected from Europa, which could potentially contain biological material. 'Even if only one percent of a bacterium is contained in a micrometer-sized ice particle, its biological components are clearly visible in the data,' Klenner and his team write. 'The sonde must therefore only catch one of the rare fountains during its flyby.' The search for extraterrestrial life is ongoing, and the discovery of a habitable environment under the ice crust of Europa could be a significant step forward. 'Our interpretation suggests that carbon, an essential element for biological life, is present in the subglacial ocean of Europa,' the astronomers write. This carbon must have reached the surface of the moon relatively recently, making the environment under the ice crust of Europa a potential candidate for life. 'The discovery of carbon in the subglacial ocean of Europa makes it a more promising candidate for extraterrestrial life in our solar system,' the researchers conclude. 'This finding is crucial for future space missions, such as the 'Europa Clipper' mission, which will explore the Jupiter moon in 2030.'

**NASA's New Probes to Search for Alien Life**
The NASA project, called ORCAA (Oceanic World Recognition and Astrobiological Analog Characterization), aims to search for extraterrestrial life. In 2023, the team conducted a test mission at the Echo glacier in Alaska, using a hot water drill to collect samples from the glacier's bottom. They found traces of ATP and chlorophyll-a, key molecules for life. The team is now preparing for a second campaign in North Basin in 2025, where they will use a cryobot to simulate the conditions they will face on Jupiter's moon Europa. The goal is to test the autonomous operation of the cryobot, from drilling to sample analysis, to determine if these technologies can be used in a future real landing on Europa. The study aims to detect changes in the environment and find potential indicators of habitability, such as microorganisms or organic compounds. The research is advancing, with the Europa Clipper mission already en route to Jupiter's moon. This spacecraft will fly over Europa 49 times starting in 2030, searching for areas where the ice crust is thinner. This will help choose the most promising location for a future landing mission, such as the Europa Lander. While this mission will not penetrate the ice, it will test the first key instruments for that stage. Other oceanic worlds in the solar system where these probes could be used include Enceladus and Titan (Saturn), Triton (Neptune), Ganymede and Callisto (Jupiter), and even Ceres and Pluto. Enceladus, for example, has active geysers that eject water into space and have already been analyzed by the Cassini mission, which found water vapor, carbon dioxide, and organic compounds: basic ingredients for life.

**New Evidence for Life in Space: The Discovery on K2-18b**
In April 2025, researchers announced that they had found the strongest evidence yet for life in space. Using the James Webb Telescope, they detected signs of dimethylsulfid on the planet K2-18b, which is 124 light-years away. This element is only produced on Earth by plankton. The 8 times more massive planet is believed to be a water world, orbiting a red dwarf star. This discovery reminded the author of Carl Sagan's idea of 'Kosmos', where he suggested that there could be giant balloon-like beings on the gas giant Jupiter. Today, scientists are more likely to find life under the ice crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, which has more water than all the oceans on Earth. While this scientific publication has not yet provided conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life, it highlights the exciting times we live in and the possibility of life being even more alien than we imagine.

**The Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life: What Would it Mean for Humanity?**
Scientists believe that the discovery of extraterrestrial life is now within reach. But what would it mean for humanity? The discovery of extraterrestrial life would be a turning point, not just for science, but for humanity as a whole. It would change our perspective on the universe and our place in it. According to Professor Nikku Madhusudhan, the head of the team that discovered the gas on K2-18b, the possibility of finding extraterrestrial life is no longer a distant dream. The discovery of extraterrestrial life would raise new questions, such as what it would mean for humanity to know that we are not alone in the universe. It would also raise questions about the implications of such a discovery for our society and our way of life. The search for extraterrestrial life has been ongoing for decades, but the discovery of the gas on K2-18b has brought us closer to finding evidence of life beyond Earth. The James Webb Space Telescope, which was launched in 2021, has the ability to detect the presence of biosignatures, which are signs of life, in the atmospheres of distant planets. However, the telescope's ability to detect biosignatures is limited to planets that are similar in size to Earth. NASA is planning to launch a new mission in the 2030s that will be able to detect biosignatures on planets that are much smaller than Earth. The discovery of extraterrestrial life would be a major breakthrough, but it would also raise new questions and challenges for humanity. It would require us to re-evaluate our place in the universe and our relationship with the natural world. It would also raise questions about the implications of such a discovery for our society and our way of life. Ultimately, the discovery of extraterrestrial life would be a major step forward for humanity, but it would also require us to confront the challenges and implications of such a discovery.

**¿Hay alguien ahí fuera?: The Search for Life Beyond Earth**
Joan Antón Català, a scientist with a rigorous and engaging approach, explores the fascinating search for life beyond Earth in his book '¿Hay alguien ahí fuera?' The discovery of life outside our planet would be one of the most significant moments in human history. Thanks to recent scientific advancements, we may be on the verge of making this discovery. Perhaps it will be on Mars, or one of Jupiter's or Saturn's moons, or one of the thousands of exoplanets we know. How will the first extraterrestrial microorganisms be? Will they be made of the same ingredients as those on Earth? How are we searching for them? And what about the day we receive a signal from another civilization? This would be a revolution: the confirmation that we are not alone in the universe. A remarkable milestone that could happen sooner than we think. How will the civilization we detect be? Will it still exist? Will we be able to interpret its message? How are we searching for it? The search for life beyond Earth is one of humanity's greatest questions. With advances in space exploration, science has developed increasingly sophisticated tools to answer this question. But what exactly are we looking for when we talk about extraterrestrial life? In what places in the cosmos could there be conditions suitable for life? Let's see the evidence and current strategies. Space exploration has sent probes and rovers to various celestial bodies in search of conditions conducive to life. Mars, for example, has been a key target. Missions like Perseverance and Curiosity have analyzed the Martian surface in search of organic compounds, evidence of past liquid water, and possible biosignatures. Although we have not yet found conclusive evidence of life, the existence of ancient lakes and rivers on Mars suggests that microorganisms may have existed in the past. Another point of interest are the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, such as Europa and Enceladus, which hide subsurface oceans beneath thick layers of ice. These moons have internal heat sources and chemical reactions that could provide the energy needed for microbial life. Future missions like Europa Clipper will analyze the composition of their oceans in search of biosignatures. Astrobiologists have defined several ways we could detect life on other planets. One of the main objectives is the identification of biosignatures, which are substances or chemical patterns that could only be generated through biological processes. Some examples include: The presence of liquid water: Considered essential for life as we know it. Complex organic compounds: Such as amino acids or lipids, which are the basic components of life. Unbalanced atmospheric gases: The combination of oxygen and methane in an atmosphere, for example, could indicate biological activity. Detectable changes on the surface: Such as structures or patterns that cannot be explained by geological processes. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has begun to analyze the atmospheres of exoplanets in search of these biosignatures. Exoplanets in the 'habitable zone' are those that orbit their star at a distance that allows for the existence of liquid water on their surface. So far, thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, and some of the most promising include Proxima Centauri b, located in the closest star to the Sun, and the planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system, which could have conditions suitable for life. Despite these findings, life may not be limited to planets in the habitable zone. Extremophilic organisms on Earth have shown that life can thrive in extreme conditions, such as ocean depths, hydrothermal vents, and salt deserts. This suggests that life could exist in unexpected environments in the cosmos. We still do not have a definitive answer, but space exploration is bringing us closer to finding it. Advances in space technology, such as space telescopes, planetary rovers, and future manned missions, could reveal whether life is a common phenomenon or a cosmic rarity. With each new discovery, we are getting closer to answering the great question: Is there someone out there?

**Elon Musk Chooses Mars Region for First Human Settlement**
Elon Musk has chosen the Arcadia Planitia region on Mars as the site for the first human settlement, which he plans to establish in 2029. According to Musk, the settlement must be able to survive without supplies from Earth. He emphasized that a civilization on the Red Planet could persist even if a global catastrophe occurs on Earth. 'It's critically important that the city can grow and develop even if the ships from Earth stop coming,' he said. Musk stated that to create a self-sufficient settlement, it is necessary to fully recreate the industrial base of Earth on Mars, which will require extracting resources, processing hundreds of types of raw materials, growing food, and producing building materials. Due to the low temperatures on Mars, the first step will be to build hermetically sealed living modules. He suggested using glass domes for the first settlements. Musk also mentioned that he has a personal connection to the region, as one of his daughters is named after it. He reiterated that he does not expect to find intelligent extraterrestrial life on Mars, but there is a possibility of discovering underground microorganisms or ruins of an ancient civilization. 'We may find signs of a long-lost extraterrestrial culture,' he added. Musk announced that the Starship rocket may launch to Mars as early as the end of 2026 with a Tesla Optimus humanoid robot on board. He believes that a manned expedition could be launched as early as 2029, although a more realistic date would be 2031. However, the Starship is still far from completing the development of its basic version, and the two latest prototypes were lost during an attempt to put them into orbit. During the eighth test, the rocket exploded just a few minutes after launch from Texas. SpaceX noted that a 'sudden unplanned disassembly' occurred during the ascent, and contact with the apparatus was lost. Musk pointed out that the main problem remains the creation of a reusable heat shield. 'No one has yet made it fully suitable for reuse,' he said.

**CosmoCaixa Exhibition Explores the Possibility of Life Outside Earth**
The CosmoCaixa Science Museum in Barcelona is hosting an exhibition called 'Extraterrestres. ¿Hay vida fuera de la Tierra?' (Extraterrestrials. Is there life outside Earth?) until August 30, 2026. The exhibition explores the human place in the universe, the meaning of life, and the collective imagination of extraterrestrials. According to Valentí Farràs, the director of CosmoCaixa, the exhibition aims to 'understand where we are and if we are alone', a question that has concerned humans since ancient Greece. The exhibition has been developed with the collaboration of 4 scientific advisors, including Dr. Montserrat Villar, Dr. Ester Lázaro, Dr. Benjamín Montesinos, and Dr. Eva Villaver. Farràs believes that the exhibition will be a success, with around 800,000 visitors, and that it will be able to answer the questions it raises. Dr. Villar emphasizes that the exhibition is based on scientific rigor and aims to 'break myths and propose what could happen in the future' if life is found outside Earth. The exhibition features a 1:1 scale model of the Perseverance rover and the Ingenuity helicopter, as well as a meteorite from Mars. It also includes interactive screens, a representation of carbon molecules, and a cosmic calendar made of rice that compresses the age of the universe into a year.

**The Search for Life on Europa and Enceladus: A New Frontier in the Search for Extraterrestrial Life**
Scientists are exploring the possibility of life on Europa and Enceladus, two moons in our solar system with subsurface oceans. Europa, a moon of Jupiter, and Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, have conditions that could support life. The NASA's Europa Clipper mission, set to launch in 2024, will study the moon's surface and subsurface ocean. The mission aims to analyze the chemical composition of Europa's geysers and map its surface to identify potential landing sites. Enceladus, on the other hand, has a surface that expels large geysers of water into space, and scientists believe that its subsurface ocean could have hydrothermal activity, similar to those found on Earth. The European Space Agency and NASA are planning future missions to Enceladus, including the Enceladus Orbilander project, which aims to orbit and land on the moon's surface. The search for life on these moons is a top priority in the search for extraterrestrial life. Scientists are using advanced technologies, such as robots and submarines, to explore the subsurface oceans and detect signs of life. The discovery of life on Europa or Enceladus would be a major breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life and would change our understanding of the universe.

**Héctor Socas: 'We could find evidence of extraterrestrial life tomorrow'**
Héctor Socas, director of the Fundación Telescopio Solar Europeo, said that a signal of extraterrestrial life 'could be found tomorrow', or within 10 or 50 years, and that every day, one should say 'today could be the day'. Socas emphasized that humanity is fortunate to be living in this era, as it is the first generation that can start to have hopes of answering the question of whether there is life beyond Earth during their lifetime. Socas noted that the human race has been asking if there is life beyond Earth since it began writing its thoughts, and that the answer has always been out of reach until recently. He also highlighted that the emergence of life on Earth was 'immediately' and 'very simple', and that it took 4.5 billion years to reach a species with the capacity for thought, technology, and interstellar communication. Socas emphasized that the search for life and intelligence beyond Earth is one of the most important endeavors that humanity can undertake, whether the answer is positive or negative.

**The Ordinary Claim of Extraterrestrial Life**
Avi Loeb, director del proyecto Galileo, argues that the existence of extraterrestrial life is an ordinary claim that requires ordinary evidence. He points to the discovery of the asteroid Bennu, which contains the 5 nucleobases that form DNA and RNA on Earth, and 14 of the 20 amino acids of proteins. Loeb suggests that the protoplanets in the primitive solar system developed the basic components of life, and that the ocean beneath the surface of Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, or Europa, a moon of Jupiter, may contain microorganisms. He also proposes that we can learn about extraterrestrial civilizations by searching for artifacts they may have left in space. Loeb's project, Galileo, is building four observatories to monitor the sky for anomalous objects and is planning a new expedition to recover fragments of the IM1 meteorite. He believes that the human mind will only mature if astrobiologists are willing to study anomalous objects in space. Loeb will celebrate the legacy of Galileo Galilei on February 20, 2025, by unveiling a bronze sculpture of Galileo looking at the four moons of Jupiter.
