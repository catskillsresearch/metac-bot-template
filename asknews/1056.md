**The Mysterious Construction of the Pyramids of Egypt**
According to official history, the pyramids of Egypt were built by slaves as tombs for their pharaohs (Keops, Kefrén, and Micerino) approximately 5,000 years ago. The Great Pyramid is composed of 2,300,000 blocks of limestone and granite, weighing between 2.5 and 60 tons, equivalent to the weight of 12 trucks together. It is said to have taken around 20 years to build, but a quick calculation suggests that the 2,300,000 stones, working 10 hours a day, 365 days a year, would have required placing one stone every 2 minutes, with extreme weight variations. Interestingly, the pyramid's highest point deviates by only 6 millimeters from the base after placing 2,300,000 stones. It is also noteworthy that the Egyptians painted everything on walls, yet no evidence of pyramid construction has been discovered. The pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacán, Mexico, and its sanctuaries are aligned with the Orion constellation, similar to those in Egypt, and its base dimensions are almost identical to the Great Pyramid. The stepped pyramid of Zoser in Saqqara, Egypt, is the oldest stone structure in the world, built in 2650 BC. Hatshepsut, daughter of Tutmosis I, was the most important Egyptian queen, followed by Nefertari, wife of Ramsés II, who ruled during her husband's absences.

**Pyramids' Hani Said: We Will Celebrate the African Champions League Title Today**
Hani Said, the sports director of Pyramids, expressed his happiness after winning the African Champions League title. Pyramids won the title after defeating Sundowns 2-1 in the second leg of the final match, following a 1-1 draw in the first leg. Said said, 'We will only celebrate the African Champions League title today because we don't have enough time to continue celebrating.' He added, 'It's natural for the level to decrease after a big title, and the timing of the Zamalek match is very difficult, as we will play the Egyptian Cup final in three days, but this is our fate and we will deal with it from tomorrow.' Said concluded, 'Before the last two days, I didn't expect the large crowd we saw in the stands, but I expected it especially with the consecutive events of the last two days.'

**Archaeologists Uncover Ancient Cult Site of Lost Kingdom**
Archaeologists have discovered an ancient cult site of a lost kingdom, reminiscent of the 'Indiana Jones' style. The site, named Los Abuelos (The Grandparents), features two 1.5-meter-tall stone sculptures of a human couple, dated to between 600 and 400 BCE. The team found ceramics intentionally broken for ancestor worship rituals at their feet. The excavation also uncovered an observatory, numerous altars, stela fragments, and additional pyramids. A 33-meter-tall pyramid was discovered in a nearby site, Petnal, making it the largest found in the area. According to the team, these structures may provide insights into the complex political and religious organization of the early Maya society.

**Russia: The Cradle of Ancient Pyramids**
The discovery of ancient structures on the Kola Peninsula has sparked debate about the origins of the first pyramids. While the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing, the age of the Kola Peninsula's pyramids is estimated to be at least twice that of the Egyptian ones. According to some scientists, the Kola pyramids are 'at least as old as 4,500 years, which is roughly 1,000 years older than the Great Pyramid of Giza', as Oleg Shishkin says. The connection between the Kola pyramids and the legendary land of Hyperborea remains a mystery. The expedition to the Lovozer tundras, led by occultist Alexander Barchenko, was allegedly monitored by the KGB. 'It was a great day', says Oleg Shishkin, 'when we discovered the truth about the Kola pyramids.'

**The Concave Shape of the Great Pyramid of Giza: A Key to its Durability**
The Great Pyramid of Giza is not a standard square pyramid, but rather a concave 8-sided pyramid, according to a 1926 photograph taken by British pilot P. Groves. The concave shape provides stability and durability to the structure, with inclined layers and a reinforced base helping to withstand earthquakes and subsidence. Research has shown that the pyramid has survived over 500 strong storms in 4,500 years. However, some corridors and rooms in the pyramid may have been left unfinished due to instability, leaving some design decisions unclear. 'The ancient Egyptians were excellent engineers,' said an expert, 'but some parts of the pyramid may have been left unfinished due to instability.'

**Can the Great Pyramid of Giza be Destroyed by a Modern Atomic Bomb?**
The Great Pyramid of Giza, built around 4,500 years ago, is not only the only surviving wonder of the ancient world but also an engineering achievement that continues to inspire awe. The pyramid, consisting of approximately 2.3 million blocks of limestone and granite, weighing up to 2.5 tons, has a height of around 146 meters and a base length of 230 meters. Despite its massive size, the pyramid's internal system of chambers, galleries, and ventilation shafts makes it a complex architectural object. The pyramid's construction, achieved with copper tools and simple engineering principles, is a testament to the ingenuity of the ancient Egyptians. The pyramid has withstood various attempts to destroy it, including a plan by the young Egyptian Sultan Al-Aziz Uthman in the 12th century to search for hidden treasures beneath its base. In the 19th century, the Egyptian ruler Muhammad Ali Pasha considered using the pyramid's stones to build a dam across the Nile, but the project was abandoned due to the complexity of the task and the high cost. In theory, a nuclear bomb with a power of around 50-100 megatons, like the 'Tsar Bomba' tested by the Soviet Union in 1961, could potentially destroy the pyramid. However, a smaller nuclear bomb would likely only damage the pyramid's stone structure, while a larger bomb would have catastrophic consequences, including radioactive contamination of the surrounding area. Despite its strength, the pyramid requires ongoing maintenance and reinforcement to protect it from natural erosion and other threats. Ultimately, the pyramid remains a symbol of human ingenuity and the wisdom of ancient civilizations, and its preservation is essential for future generations.

**How Many Sides Does The Great Pyramid Of Giza Have?**
Contrary to popular belief, the Great Pyramid of Giza has more than four sides. A 1926 aerial photograph by British Air Force pilot P. Groves revealed that the pyramid's sides are indented along their middles, making it a concave octagonal pyramid. According to a 2023 paper, this concavity is not visible from ground level but adds stability and longevity to the pyramid. The indents, combined with the inclined layers and reinforced base, help the pyramid withstand natural forces like earthquakes and rainstorms, which it has experienced over 500 times in the past 4,500 years. As Kato wrote, 'The crucial point about stability is that the effects of such natural forces are quite different between the core of inclined courses and that of truly level courses in the sense that the former can be tightened to become stronger over time, but the latter would be disintegrated to be weaker over time.'

**The Great Pyramid**
The Great Pyramid of Giza, built around 2580-2560 BCE, is the largest and oldest of the three pyramids on the Giza Plateau. Originally constructed as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu, it reflects the ancient Egyptians' understanding of mathematics, astronomy, and engineering. The pyramid was the tallest man-made structure for over 3,800 years, standing at 146.6 meters (481 feet) before erosion reduced it to 138.8 meters (455 feet) today. It features a complex network of passageways, including the King's Chamber, Queen's Chamber, and the Grand Gallery, showcasing the architectural sophistication and spiritual beliefs of ancient Egypt. The Great Pyramid has inspired various theories regarding its purpose and construction, with most scholars agreeing it was built as a royal tomb. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and continues to attract millions of visitors, standing as a testament to the ingenuity of ancient Egyptian civilization and a source of inspiration and mystery.

**MrBeast's 100-Hour Pyramid Adventure Sparks Debate**
YouTuber MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, has released a video titled '100 Hours Inside the Pyramids' where he and his team spent 100 hours inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. The video has gained over 39 million views in just 17 hours, making it one of his most popular videos. In the video, MrBeast and his team explored the pyramid, reaching depths of 30 meters below ground, and discovered a room that is believed to be the tomb of an ancient Egyptian king. However, some people have questioned the authenticity of the discovery, with some claiming that the team may have been allowed to enter the pyramid by the Egyptian authorities. MrBeast has also buried a game worth $10,000 in the pyramid, and has sparked a debate about the possibility of extraterrestrial life being involved in the construction of the pyramids. The video has received widespread attention, with many people praising MrBeast's adventurous spirit and others criticizing his actions as disrespectful to the ancient Egyptian culture. 'It's a great adventure,' said blogger Raj Amar. 'As a Egyptian, I love seeing the secrets and beauty of the pyramids presented in a unique way.' However, some people have raised concerns about the team's actions, with blogger Shaima saying, 'I saw the video and there's a possibility that the guy is wearing a costume from a village called San al-Hagar in the center of Basyoun, which was the capital at some point in ancient Egypt. This is the same village where the Great Pyramid's stone was quarried.' Blogger Deva said, 'The man has gone to the pyramids and is searching for every hole, it seems that fame and money have their benefits. You can see things that no one has seen in 4,500 years. There are tunnels and passages under the city of Persepolis, if you see the pyramids and then you want to destroy anything else in life... There are places in the pyramids that made me cry, from the highest to the lowest point, even at the gate of Osiris, there was water under the city of Persepolis, there are scary tunnels and passages, it would be a shame not to see them.'

**The Great Pyramid of Giza: A Transformative Force in Ancient Egyptian Civilization**
The Great Pyramid of Giza, built over 4,500 years ago, was the tallest structure ever constructed by humans, standing at 146.6 meters tall. It was built using over 2 million blocks of limestone, each weighing around 2 tons, and the granite blocks in the central chamber were transported from Aswan, 800 kilometers away. The pyramid's original purpose was as a tomb for the pharaoh and a 'spiritual elevator.' The pharaoh's body was transported to the temple funerary along a ceremonial road, and the pyramid was covered in polished white limestone and a golden pyramidion. Historian Bettany Hughes notes that the Great Pyramid was a transformative and catalyzing force for ancient Egyptian civilization. The pyramid was later joined by those of its son Kefrén and grandson Micerino. The Esfinge, a giant sculpture carved into the rock, was also added by Kefrén. The tomb of Keops was likely looted soon after his burial, but the sacerdotes funerarios continued to worship him for 400 years. The pyramid and the Esfinge became a center of cult for centuries, with the Esfinge being the object of worship during the New Kingdom. The Great Pyramid was also a popular destination for pilgrims from the Mediterranean, with visitors bringing back souvenirs and ideas about the pharaoh's mystical powers. Heródoto visited Egypt in the 4th century BC and wrote extensively about the Great Pyramid, describing it as 'beyond human expression' and 'equal to many works of the Greeks.' However, the Romans showed less admiration, with Plinio the Elder calling it an 'ostentation of royal wealth' and a rival to their own engineering feats.
