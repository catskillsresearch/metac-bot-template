**Moscow Security Meeting to be a 'Bespoke' Discussion of Global Security Issues**
The upcoming Moscow meeting of high-ranking officials on security will be a crucial discussion of security issues with long-term implications, according to Alexander Yakovenko, a deputy director of the international media group 'Russia Today' and a member of the presidium of the Scientific and Expert Council of the Russian Security Council. 'The world is seeing a growing demand for a serious, multi-party discussion of a qualitatively new situation in the field of security...After the BRICS summit in Kazan in October last year, the conference in Moscow will be the most important comprehensive and unprecedented discussion of security issues that will have a long-term impact on the development of foreign policy decisions by participating countries in the real, not imaginary, system of coordinates,' Yakovenko said. He emphasized that there is no precedent for this meeting: 'The Munich Security Conference, for example, has an 'intellectually closed character' and its participants are bound by a common ideological narrative and seek to deny the multipolar world.' The 13th International Meeting of High Representatives for Security Issues will take place in Moscow on May 27-29 under the chairmanship of Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu. Invitations to participate in the forum have been sent to more than 150 countries, as well as to the leadership of over 20 international organizations.

**BRICS Summit: Strengthening South-South Cooperation for a More Inclusive and Sustainable Governance**
The BRICS group, led by China, has expanded to include new members such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, the UAE, Indonesia, and Iran. The 17th BRICS summit, to be held in Rio de Janeiro, will focus on 'Strengthening South-South Cooperation for a More Inclusive and Sustainable Governance'. The agenda includes topics such as global health, trade, investment, and finance, climate, artificial intelligence, and multilateral architecture for peace and security. Brazil, as the host country, aims to influence the direction of the resolutions and promote a governance with rules in a new multilateral architecture in a multipolar world. The BRICS group has been criticized for being anti-Western, but it is not a proposal to create a single currency within the group to replace the dollar. Instead, it is a proposal to facilitate trade using local currencies or other credit mechanisms. This is not an easy task, as the dollar represents 57.8% of international reserves, and the yuan renminbi only 2.18%. The countries of the BRICS do not trade only within the group, and China's importance in their trade is not enough to keep their reserves entirely in Chinese currency. Brazil's trade with other BRICS members, excluding China, is very small, and it is not due to a lack of currency. The agenda of priorities for the 17th Summit is broad, and Brazil can try to influence the direction of the resolutions in the sense of opting always for a governance with rules in a possible new multilateral architecture in a multipolar world.
