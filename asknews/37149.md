**Summer is Coming: When Can We Finally Put Away the Umbrella?**
Although the next few days will be turbulent weather-wise with a new storm hitting most of Italy, the African anticyclone is ready to take back the scene, reminding us that summer is getting closer with a significant increase in maximum temperatures. After the arrival of cold polar air on May 22, from next weekend we will have a more pronounced improvement with sun and rising temperatures, but it will not be hot yet. As explained by Mattia Gussoni of Ilmeteo.it, the recovery seems solid and lasting, unlike recent past experiences where good weather lasted until the beginning of June. Many are unaware that there is another curious term to indicate the high African pressure. 'As added Lorenzo Tedici, expert of the daily meteo. The logical consequence of the warm African air will be a thermal increase that will be felt everywhere, especially in maximum values. The expert explains that in many cases, the values will be higher by several degrees compared to the reference climate averages.

**US Scientists Report 757 Documented UFO Sightings, Cartels Suspected of Using Drones for Espionage and Drug Trafficking**
US scientists have reported 757 documented cases of UFO sightings. According to Ron Vitello, a US Customs and Border Protection advisor, cartels have 'unlimited funding' that allows them to implement new technologies, including drones, to smuggle drugs into the US. In 2023, a US military F-16 Viper fighter jet was damaged by a UFO while flying over Arizona, forcing it to be temporarily taken out of service. The incident was confirmed by official documents from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA has confirmed that it is investigating all reports of UFO sightings, especially those that are confirmed by radar data. The US government has documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of them occurring in airspace. Only 49 cases have been officially closed. Many of the sightings occurred in areas where military exercises were taking place in Arizona and surrounding states. Some officials, including Vitello, believe that these objects may be drones used by cartels for espionage or drug trafficking. According to NewsNation, cartels have already used similar devices to transport up to 10 kg of cargo at a time. Vitello stated, 'They have unlimited funding, which allows them to implement new technologies that the US has not seen before.' This, he believes, is part of the business model of criminal organizations that continuously improve their methods of delivering prohibited substances into the US.

**US Air Force Pilot Describes Close Encounter with UFO at Mach 2**
A US Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with an unidentified flying object (UFO) while on a secret mission in California in September 2024. The pilot, identified as Troy 21, described the object as traveling at Mach 2, a speed that eliminates the possibility of it being a simple drone. The incident was reported to the National UFO Reporting Center, a recognized organization by the Federal Aviation Administration for reporting unexplained aerial phenomena. The implications of this incident on air safety are alarming, as collisions with unidentified objects pose a real danger to aircraft. The lack of prior notification on the object's presence in the controlled airspace is also concerning. This incident has sparked speculation about what the government might be hiding, and potential transparency could change our understanding of the UFO phenomenon.

**Mysterious UFOs Swarm Over US Air Force Training Fields in Arizona**
A UFO that collided with a US Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet in January 2023 is just one of a swarm of mysterious objects buzzing around the Air Force's training fields in Arizona, according to multiple reports. The unidentified flying object struck the 'bubble canopy' of a $63 million F-16 Viper, damaging it and temporarily grounding the aircraft, according to FAA documents. The military aircraft was hit by an orange and white 'UAS' (unmanned aerial system) while in the air, according to the FAA documents. 'There's been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things from Arizona, particularly along the border with Mexico,' said former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo to NewsNation this month. The FAA told The Post in a statement that the agency 'documents unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) sightings whenever a pilot reports one to a air traffic control facility.' The government reported 757 such incidents between May 2023 and June 2024 (708 of which occurred in the air) and only 49 were marked as 'Case closed' in the latest report from the Office of Anomaly Resolution. The small unidentified objects seen in Arizona fly in groups of up to eight and are sometimes characterized as drones, according to War Zone, which noted that the incidents took place at high altitudes near military combat training sites since January 2020. 'They're clearly being transmitted through multiple military reporting channels,' added War Zone. Some US officials, including Ron Vitiello, chief advisor to US Customs and Border Protection, speculate that the mysterious flying objects could be drones used by foreign cartels to spy or smuggle drugs. 'Maybe they have technology we're not used to seeing in the drone space,' said Vitiello.

**Note d'alerte: Une nouvelle année d'aggravation de la crise alimentaire et nutritionnelle au Sahel et en Afrique de l'Ouest et du Centre**
For the eighth consecutive year, a record number of people are in need of food and nutrition assistance in the Sahel and West and Central Africa region. The situation requires urgent and coordinated action from governments, donors, national and international organizations, and partners to reduce the vulnerability of affected populations. The projections for June to August 2025 indicate that 52 million people could face acute food insecurity if appropriate measures are not taken. The recent analysis of the Cadre Harmonisé (CH) reveals a significant deterioration of food and nutrition security in the region. The analysis for the current period (March-May 2025) covers 11 countries, including Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Nigeria, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, Chad, and Togo. The projections for the period of June to August 2025 present an overview of the food and nutrition security situation in the Sahel and West and Central Africa region. 'This situation requires a significant increase in aid to protect the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable households and reduce the risk of catastrophic food insecurity,' said the report.

**What Sassa beneficiaries need to know about payment dates in June 2025**
The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has dismissed rumors of double grant payments in June 2025. Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi stated, 'We appeal to our beneficiaries not to expect any double payment in June as stated in various fake news reports, particularly on social media platforms.' The only grant increases announced were those made in the Ministry of Finance's Policy Statement in March, which came into effect in April, and another increase is scheduled for October. Letsatsi emphasized that any other increase not announced by credible and relevant authorities should be treated as lies. 'In line with the Ministry of Finance's Policy Statement in March, grant increases were announced and came into effect in April, and there will be another increase again in October. Any other increase not announced by credible and relevant authorities should be treated as lies,' Letsatsi said.

**US Government Reports 757 UFO Sightings, Including One That Damaged an F-16 Fighter Jet**
In 2023, a unidentified flying object (UFO) was reported in the US, colliding with an F-16 fighter jet during a training mission over Arizona, causing damage to the aircraft. According to The New York Post, these unidentified objects have been seen in groups of up to eight and have been classified as drones on occasion. 'Pentagon investigators and the Federal Aviation Administration have confirmed that these sightings have been documented every time a pilot has reported them to the corresponding air traffic control facility', says the medium. The incident is just one of a number of mysterious objects that have been spotted over the US Air Force's training fields in Arizona, according to multiple reports by The New York Post. Three more encounters with these objects were detected the following day. 'There has been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things from Arizona, particularly at the border' with Mexico, said former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo to the medium. The US government has presented 757 reports of this type between May 2023 and June 2024, of which 708 occurred in the air, and only 49 were marked as 'Case closed' in the latest report issued by the Office of Anomaly Resolution. The US government has dismissed, for now, the security threat posed by these sightings, but some officials, including Ron Vitiello, principal advisor to the US Customs and Border Protection Office, suggest that the mysterious objects could be drones used by foreign cartels to spy or smuggle drugs. Vitiello stated that the 'unlimited funding' of the cartels could explain the advanced technology never seen before. 'Perhaps they have technology that we are not used to seeing in the drone sector', said Vitiello.

**UFO crashes into US Air Force fighter jet over Arizona**
A US Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet was hit by an unidentified flying object, believed to be a drone, over Arizona on January 19, 2023. The collision cracked the canopy protecting the pilot, but no injuries were reported. The incident is one of 22 reported UFO sightings by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), there have been hundreds of UFO reports made in recent years, with Arizona becoming a hotspot for sightings. AARO, the Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, has received 757 UAP reports worldwide between May 2023 and June 2024, with at least 410 occurring over the US. Whistleblowers have revealed that many UFO sightings are taking place in Arizona, particularly on the border, and some believe that Mexican cartels may be involved in launching high-tech spy missions into the US. 'A lot of people reporting a lot of things out of Arizona, particularly on the border,' said Luis Elizondo, a former government intelligence officer. 'I've seen orbs that were off in the distance. I've seen crafts that were cigar-shaped, I've seen triangles,' said Bob Thompson, a former US Customs and Border Protection agent.

**Report: UFO crashed into US Navy fighter jet over Arizona in 2023**
A US Navy F-16 fighter jet was damaged after colliding with a UFO over Arizona in January 2023. The incident occurred when the plane was flying in restricted airspace near Gila Bend, Arizona, and was hit by an 'orange-white UAS' in the rear of the canopy. No injuries were reported, but the plane was grounded for repairs. This incident is one of 22 reported UFO sightings involving Air Force fighter pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. According to the Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), there have been hundreds of UFO reports made in recent years, with Arizona becoming a hotspot for sightings. Luis Elizondo, a former government intelligence officer, stated, 'A lot of people reporting a lot of things out of Arizona, particularly on the border.' Bob Thompson, a former US Customs and Border Protection agent, shared videos of UFOs spotted over Arizona, including 'terrifying portals' opening into the sky. While some believe the surge in UFO sightings is due to extraterrestrial activity, others think it may be caused by high-tech spy missions launched by drug cartels into the US.

**Mid-month Petrol Price Predictions Are Here – With Cheaper Fuel Prices Expected This June - Stuff South Africa**
The Central Energy Fund (CEF) has released mid-month petrol price predictions for June 2025, indicating cheaper fuel prices. According to the CEF, the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) is responsible for adjusting South Africa's fuel prices, which will take place on June 4, 2025. The CEF's predictions are based on the average Rand/US Dollar exchange rate and the average price of oil throughout the month. The CEF notes that a sudden shift in either or both of these factors could cause a dramatic change in South Africa's expected fuel prices. As the CEF's figures are subject to change, it is essential to note that these predictions are not final. 'The DMRE then uses the collected data to accurately adjust South Africa's fuel prices, even if we don't always like the results,' the CEF states.

**UFOs Are Swarming U.S. Military Zones -- And One Just Crashed Into a Fighter Jet**
A U.S. F-16 fighter jet collided with an unidentified flying object (UFO) during a training mission over Arizona in January. The object, described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system,' or UAS, hit the plane's canopy mid-flight. This incident is one of dozens of reported midair encounters between military pilots and strange objects over restricted airspace in the Southwest. Since 2020, military pilots have reported encountering objects such as metallic spheres, drones, and objects moving at high speeds. Former Pentagon UAP investigator Luis Elizondo said, 'These reports are coming in constantly,' and former CBP official Ron Vitiello speculated that the technology behind these objects may be more advanced than what's publicly known. The U.S. government has logged 757 sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena from May 2023 to June 2024, with only 49 marked 'case closed.'

**Unidentified Flying Objects: A Mysterious Phenomenon in Arizona**
The US Air Force has reported multiple incidents of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in Arizona, with some incidents involving collisions with military aircraft. According to the New York Post, a report by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that a mysterious object collided with an F-16 fighter jet worth $63 million in January 2023, causing damage and temporarily grounding the aircraft. The FAA documents also mentioned three other encounters with drones in the same day. Former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo told NewsNation that there was a lot of activity and many reports of strange phenomena in Arizona, particularly along the US-Mexico border. The FAA stated that it investigates reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) whenever a pilot reports them to the Air Traffic Control Center. If the information is confirmed, the FAA shares the report with the US Department of Defense's Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, which is responsible for investigating UAPs that pose a threat to national security or safety. Between May 2023 and June 2024, the US government received 757 reports of UAPs, with 708 of them being investigated in the air and 49 cases being closed. The small, unidentified objects have been spotted in groups of up to eight and are sometimes classified as drones. Some US officials, including Ron Vitello, the US Customs and Border Protection's chief of operations, believe that the mysterious objects could be drones used by foreign cartels for espionage or drug trafficking.

**Jet Plane Crashes at South African Air Show, Pilot Killed**
A jet plane crashed during the West Coast Air Show in South Africa on March 22, 2025.

**Leaked recording: US Air Force pilot reports UFO over California in 2024**
A US Air Force pilot reported a UFO sighting in September 2024 while flying a Beechcraft 350 in California. The pilot, identified as 'Troy 21,' described a football-sized, dark, cylindrical object passing underneath his wing. The incident was reported to the National UFO Reporting Center. Radar systems on the plane detected an object 60 miles away, but it is unclear if it was the same object. The UFO's speed exceeded Mach 2 within two minutes, which is not possible for most drones. This incident is one of several recent UFO sightings, including a temporary suspension of operations at the Gaziantep Airport in Turkey due to a reported UFO sighting.
