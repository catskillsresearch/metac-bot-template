**Many survivors of Myanmar's devastating quake in March still live...**
Two months after a devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar, recovery efforts are slow, with many people still living in temporary shelters. The confirmed death toll is 3,740, with 5,104 injured. The Myanmar Fire Services Department has recovered four bodies from the rubble of the Sky Villa Condominium in Mandalay, and more than 100 bodies are believed to be buried under debris. Humanitarian needs in Myanmar have reached record levels, with 19.9 million people identified as needing assistance. Aung Kyaw, who supervises recovery activities in Mandalay, said 'I need iron sheets for a roof to build a shelter on my land. I would be satisfied just to be able to safely sleep at my house.' Many people are still living in roadside shelters in tarpaulin tents, suffering from strong winds and constant rain. 'I don´t want to badger for anything else. Now we are just sitting in the rain,' Aung Kyaw said.

**Many survivors of Myanmar's devastating quake in March still live in leaky tents**
Two months after a devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar, recovery efforts are slow, with many survivors living in leaky tents and facing heavy rainfall and strong winds. The confirmed death toll has reached 3,740, with 5,104 injured. The Myanmar Fire Services Department has recovered over 100 bodies from the rubble, and search operations continue. Humanitarian needs in Myanmar have reached record levels, with 19.9 million people identified as needing assistance. Many survivors are still in inadequate temporary housing, with over 150 people in one ward living in roadside shelters in tarpaulin tents. Aung Kyaw, who supervises recovery activities, said, 'I need iron sheets for a roof to build a shelter on my land. I would be satisfied just to be able to safely sleep at my house.' He added that people living in temporary shelters will likely face floods due to heavy monsoon rains in the coming months. Myanmar's Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said that more than half a million people from 2,081 villages were affected by the quake.

**In Myanmar, A Tragedy Atop A Crisis - Myanmar**
A devastating magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday, causing widespread destruction and a significant loss of life. The earthquake, which was the strongest in Myanmar in at least 100 years, has compounded the country's existing crisis, which has been ongoing since the February 2021 military coup. The death toll has risen to over 2,700, with some estimates suggesting it could reach 10,000 or even exceed 100,000. Survivors face significant challenges, including shortages of food, safe drinking water, medicine, and shelter. Rescue and relief efforts have been hampered by aftershocks, power shortages, and telecommunication restrictions. The military regime, the State Administration Council (SAC), is likely to require aid providers to work through them, which may be complicated by the politics of assistance and the military's history of politicizing humanitarian aid. Despite this, some health workers have offered to return and provide treatment in earthquake-hit areas if the SAC guarantees their safety. A complex aid response is expected, with at least a dozen countries pledging assistance. The SAC leader, Min Aung Hlaing, has called for international assistance, but there is a risk that he uses the inflow of aid to rehabilitate his reputation internationally. Pauses in offensive operations have been announced by some armed groups, but there is reason to be skeptical that the ceasefires will hold.

**Büyükçekmece Deprem Risk Map: How Safe is the District?**
A study by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and Boğaziçi University's Kandilli Observatory in 2020 analyzed the potential risks of a major earthquake in Büyükçekmece, a district in Istanbul. The study found that 52% of the district's 31,343 buildings were constructed after 2000, 44% between 1980 and 2000, and only 4% before 1980. The study also found that 87% of the buildings are 1-4 stories high, 12% are 5-8 stories high, and 1% are 9-19 stories high. In the event of a Mw=7.5 magnitude earthquake, the study predicts that 2% of the buildings will suffer severe damage, while approximately 8,696 buildings will suffer moderate to severe damage. The study also found that the district's coastal areas and filled-in areas are at higher risk of damage. The most affected neighborhoods are Bahçelievler, with 111 severely damaged buildings, and Güzelce, with 174 severely damaged buildings and 1,920 temporary housing needs. The neighborhoods of Çakmaklı, Ekinöba, Alkent 2000, and Kamiloba are considered safer, with lower predicted damage and casualty rates. The study also found that the district's soil conditions, with some areas showing low Vs30 values, are a significant factor in the severity of the earthquake's impact. The coastal areas and filled-in areas are among the highest-risk zones due to their weak soil conditions.

**MADO Owners Cleared of Blame in 2023 Kahramanmaraş Earthquake Case**
The owners of MADO, Mehmet Sait Kanbur and Atilla Kanbur, were initially accused of being responsible for the deaths of 35 people in the 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquake. However, after two separate expert reports found them to be primarily responsible, a third report was requested. The third report, conducted by seven academics from Ondokuz Mayıs University, found the owners to be 'blameless'. The court has since lifted the travel ban on the suspects and exempted them from attending future court hearings. The case has been postponed to October 10, 2025. Mehmet Sait Kanbur was seen escorting President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at the airport after his visit to Kahramanmaraş in 2024. The owners of MADO have also been seen in public, including an appearance on a TV show with Alişan.

**Peru to Conduct First National Multipeligro Simulacro of 2025**
The Peruvian National Institute of Civil Defense (Indeci) has announced the first National Multipeligro Simulacro of 2025, which will take place on May 30th at 10:00 a.m. The event aims to improve the population's ability to prepare and respond to emergencies caused by natural disasters or human actions. The simulacro will simulate responses to possible earthquakes, tsunamis, intense rains, and other hazardous events. The population is expected to evacuate calmly and follow the instructions of specialized authorities to reach the designated meeting point. Indeci recommends that people in various institutions, schools, offices, and workplaces practice evacuation protocols and strengthen responses and coordination between Civil Defense brigades and community groups. This measure is part of the commemoration of the 55th anniversary of the devastating 7.9-magnitude earthquake that occurred off the coast of Áncash on May 31, 1970, which caused a landslide that buried the cities of Yungay and Ranrahirca, killing over 20,000 people. According to Indeci, the next simulacros will take place on August 15th at 3:00 p.m. and October 13th at 8:00 p.m. Indeci also recommends essential items to include in an emergency kit, such as food and water, hygiene and biosecurity items, a first-aid kit, warm clothing, communication tools, documents, and specific items for babies, women, and people with disabilities.

**Experts Warn of Catastrophic Scenario: 300,000 Could Die in Japan's Next Megadeprem**
Japanese scientists predict a devastating earthquake in the country's Pacific coast within the next 30 years, which could result in 300,000 deaths and 2.35 million buildings being destroyed. According to the government's new estimates, the worst-case scenario could lead to the deaths of 300,000 people, including 215,000 due to tsunami waves exceeding 30 meters in some areas. The Nankai Trough, where the earthquake is expected to occur, is a deep ocean trench formed by the boundary of two tectonic plates, which experiences a major earthquake every 100 to 200 years. The report predicts that in the worst-case scenario, 2.35 million buildings will collapse due to flooding and fires, causing £1.44 trillion in damage and displacing approximately 12.3 million people, which is at least 10% of Japan's population within a week of the disaster.

**Japan Estimates 298,000 Deaths in Potential Megathrust Earthquake**
According to an official report, approximately 298,000 people could die in Japan if a megathrust earthquake occurs in the Nankai Trough, a region of high seismic activity in the Pacific Ocean. The report, published by the Japanese government's seismology team, estimates that 215,000 of these deaths would be caused by tsunamis, assuming only 20% of the population would evacuate immediately. The government aims to increase the speed of evacuations. The report also projects between 26,000 and 52,000 'disaster-related deaths', caused by situations such as deteriorating health conditions in evacuation shelters. The most deadly scenario involves a magnitude 9 earthquake occurring during a winter night, with damage concentrated in the Tokai region. The Japanese government will review its disaster prevention plan and designate priority areas based on flood risk, and develop a new resilience plan for the 2026-2030 period.

**Japan Warns of 300,000 Potential Deaths from Megathrust Earthquake and Tsunami**
Japanese authorities have updated their estimate of potential deaths in the event of a megathrust earthquake followed by a tsunami, which could reach up to 300,000 people. The new estimate is lower than the previous one made in 2014, which predicted up to 323,000 deaths. The disaster management team estimates that 215,000 people would die from the tsunami, 73,000 from building collapses, and 9,000 from fires. Scientists note that predicting earthquakes is extremely difficult, but a government expert group in January stated that the probability of a megathrust earthquake occurring in the next 30 years increased slightly, with a 75-82% chance of it happening. 'It is extremely difficult to predict the sismos,' said the scientists, 'but we must be prepared for the worst-case scenario.'

**"Nearly 10,000" Feared Dead in Myanmar's deadly Earthquake, Death Toll May Even 'Exceed 100,000' - News18**
The death toll from the 7.7 earthquake in Myanmar and Thailand continues to rise, with predictions suggesting that between 10,000 and 100,000 people may have been killed. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the earthquake, which struck near Mandalay on Friday, could result in a death toll that 'exceeds 100,000'. As of Saturday morning, the confirmed death toll had reached 1,000, with 2,376 injured, according to the country's military-led government. The USGS warned that the death toll may be significantly higher than the current confirmed number.

**Death Toll from Myanmar Earthquake Exceeds 1,644**
The death toll from the earthquake in Myanmar has exceeded 1,644 people, with 3,408 injured and 139 missing. The number of victims is likely to increase as rescue efforts continue. The 7.7-magnitude earthquake was felt in Thailand, where a skyscraper collapsed in Bangkok, as well as in China, India, and Vietnam. In Thailand, 10 people were killed, with many more injured and missing. Scientists emphasize the importance of a comprehensive analysis of seismic risk and earthquake prediction to minimize the impact of catastrophic earthquakes. However, they note that earthquakes are currently impossible to predict and prevent. The people of Myanmar and Thailand were caught off guard by the disaster. According to scientists, over 200,000 people have lost their lives in European earthquakes in the 20th century, with damages exceeding 250 billion euros. Countries with the highest seismic risk in Europe include Turkey, Greece, Albania, Italy, and Romania, followed by other Balkan countries. However, significant seismic risk also exists in some regions of Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Iceland, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland.

**Over 4 400 dead after deadliest earthquake in 95 years strikes Myanmar**
A powerful M7.7 earthquake struck Myanmar on March 28, 2025, resulting in over 4,390 fatalities and injuring over 5,490 people. The quake also caused significant damage to buildings, roads, and bridges. In Thailand, at least 18 people were killed, 68 were injured, and 90 were reported missing. International relief efforts are underway, with India and China providing aid to the affected regions. The death toll is expected to rise as reports from rural areas continue to arrive. Myanmar's authorities have declared a state of emergency across six of the worst-hit regions, and multiple countries have pledged to provide aid in the relief efforts. According to the National Unity Government of Myanmar, at least 2,970 residential buildings, 150 religious buildings, 30 roads, and 7 bridges were badly damaged or destroyed across the country.

**Deadly 7.7 magnitude quake hits Myanmar, Thailand; 150+ dead**
A devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar and Thailand on Friday, causing widespread destruction and at least 154 confirmed fatalities. Myanmar bore the brunt of the disaster, with at least 144 confirmed fatalities reported, while Thailand reported 10 deaths and 101 missing. The full scope of the tragedy remains uncertain, particularly in Myanmar, which faces additional challenges due to its status as one of the world’s poorest nations and its ongoing civil conflict. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said, 'The death toll and injuries are expected to rise.' The earthquake resulted in significant infrastructure damage, including the collapse of buildings, a bridge, and a dam. Rescue crews are working to reach affected areas, but concerns about how rescuers will even reach some areas in a country already enduring a humanitarian crisis are growing. 'We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake,' said Mohammed Riyas, the International Rescue Committee’s Myanmar director. The disaster will have left people 'devastated,' said Julie Mehigan, who oversees Christian Aid’s work in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. 'Even before this heartbreaking earthquake, we know conflict and displacement has left countless people in real need,' Mehigan said.

**Myanmar Earthquake: Experts Predict High Death Toll**
Experts predict that the recent earthquake in Myanmar could have resulted in between 10,000 to 100,000 deaths. The earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.8, was similar in strength to one that occurred in Turkey in February 2023, which resulted in over 60,000 fatalities. According to the US Geological Survey, the initial death toll is estimated to be at least 1,000, but this number is expected to rise significantly. 'The main problem will be that most people live in buildings that are not designed to withstand earthquakes,' says Daniel McCrum, a professor of civil engineering at University College Dublin. 'As a result, they are vulnerable to structural damage.' Reports of multiple building collapses have already been reported, and it is likely that a significant portion of the remaining buildings will be uninhabitable. The earthquake has also severely impacted the supply of water and electricity.
