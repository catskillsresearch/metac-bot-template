**South Korea's presidential front-runner backs nuclear power  --  for now**
South Korea's presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has announced a temporary commitment to nuclear power, but plans to shift to renewables in the long term. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework focuses on offshore wind and aims to phase out coal by 2040, reduce natural gas consumption, and establish a ministry to achieve South Korea's 2050 net zero goal. While Lee supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants, he opposes new reactors due to land constraints and waste management issues, as he stated, 'for the time being' nuclear power will be maintained.

**[Lee Kyong-hee] Pressure mounts for inter-Korean detente**
The new South Korean president will face significant challenges, including the division of the Korean Peninsula, which has persisted for over 70 years. The previous president, Yoon Suk Yeol, employed a 'Red Scare' strategy to stifle opponents, but this approach only highlighted the need to address the ideological divide. The new president will be under pressure to address the North-South divide, as well as a high tariff threat from US President Donald Trump. Trump is likely to resume his 'bromance' with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to strike a deal, and the new president must be prepared to negotiate with Pyongyang to discuss bilateral issues, including humanitarian assistance and cross-border economic cooperation. The new administration should also clarify its stance with Washington concerning possible reductions in US Forces Korea and enhancing deterrence by securing nuclear latency through renegotiating provisions in the Korea-US civil nuclear agreement. Lee Kyong-hee writes, 'The new president needs to show extraordinary leadership by listening to different public views and crafting a suprapartisan consensus regarding inter-Korean issues across a polarized divide.'

**Britain Plans Multi-Billion Pound Investment in Munitions Factories**
The British government plans to invest 1.5 billion pounds (approximately 1.8 billion euros) in the construction of at least six new munitions factories. According to the Ministry of Defence, this investment aims to boost the production of ammunition and provide the military with more weapons with greater range. Defence Minister John Healey stated that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shown that a military is only as strong as the industry behind it. The government aims to strengthen the industry to deter enemies and make the country safer and stronger. The plan is to present a report on the review of defence policy on Monday. However, it is unclear when the factories will be built. Premier Minister Keir Starmer wrote in the 'Sun', 'The threats we face are no secret. War in Europe. New nuclear risks. The Kremlin is working hand in hand with its allies in Iran and North Korea. We are confronted with daily cyber attacks.' He added, 'We are directly threatened by states with developed military forces, so we must be prepared to fight and win.' Starmer had previously announced an increase in defence spending in February, aiming to raise it to 2.5% of the GDP by 2027. The current spending is around 2.3%, with 53.9 billion pounds (approximately 63.9 billion euros) invested in the financial year 2023/24. Healey expects the UK to spend 3% of its GDP on defence by 2034.

**UK Plans to Build New Munitions Factories with 1.5 Billion Pound Investment**
The UK government plans to invest 1.5 billion pounds (approximately 1.8 billion euros) in the construction of at least six new munitions factories. The Ministry of Defence announced today in London that the investment aims to boost the production of ammunition. The military will also receive more advanced and longer-range weapons. According to Defence Minister John Healey, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shown that a military's strength is only as good as the underlying industry. The government wants to strengthen the industry to deter enemies, make the country safer and stronger. The government will present its report on the review of the defence policy tomorrow. The report will include the creation of a munitions production system that can be quickly scaled up in case of need. However, it is unclear when the factories will be built. Premier Minister Keir Starmer wrote in the 'Sun' that the threats facing the country are no secret. 'War in Europe. New nuclear risks. The Kremlin is working hand in hand with its allies in Iran and North Korea. We are facing daily cyber attacks.' He added that the best way to prevent a conflict is to prepare for it. Starmer had announced an increase in defence spending in February, which will rise to 2.5% of the GDP by 2027. The current spending is around 2.3% of the GDP, with 53.9 billion pounds (approximately 63.9 billion euros) invested in the financial year 2023/24. The spending is expected to increase to 3% of the GDP by 2029 and to 3% of the GDP by 2034, according to Healey.

**North Korea and South Korea Engaged in Underground Information War**
North Korea and South Korea are engaged in an underground information war. South Korea has been broadcasting messages and information into North Korea through loudspeakers and other means, while North Korea has been trying to block these messages and maintain control over its citizens. The South Korean government has been using various tools, including loudspeakers and USB drives, to send information into North Korea. The information includes news, entertainment, and educational content, with the goal of promoting democracy and human rights in North Korea. However, North Korea has been cracking down on these efforts, with severe punishments for those caught possessing or disseminating foreign information. The situation has become increasingly dire, with many North Koreans being executed for watching or possessing South Korean content. The US has been providing funding for these efforts, but the Trump administration has cut off funding, which has put the efforts in jeopardy. The future of these efforts is uncertain, but many believe that they are a crucial part of promoting change in North Korea.

**North Korea and South Korea Engaged in Secret Information War**
North Korea and South Korea are engaged in a secret information war. South Korea is trying to send external information into North Korea, while North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un is trying to keep the people isolated from the outside world. South Korea has been using loudspeakers to broadcast information into North Korea, including news, entertainment, and educational content. The content is stored on USB drives and memory cards, which are then smuggled into North Korea. The goal is to undermine North Korea's propaganda narrative and to educate the people about democracy and human rights. However, Kim Jong-un's government is cracking down on the information war, and the situation is becoming increasingly dire. The US has been providing funding for the information war, but the Trump administration has cut off funding, which has put the project in jeopardy. The future of the information war is uncertain, but experts believe that it is a crucial tool in changing North Korea's behavior.

**North Korea Warns of Nuclear War in Space Amid Growing Tensions**
North Korea has warned that the US could spark a nuclear war in space, rekindling international alarm in a context where geopolitical tensions and the arms race are reaching alarming levels. The North Korean government criticizes the Golden Dome defense program, promoted by US President Donald Trump, calling it a dangerous threat that could turn outer space into a nuclear battlefield. This rhetoric reflects the characteristic bellicose tone of the Kim Jong-un regime and highlights the challenges faced by the international system in containing nuclear proliferation. The Golden Dome program, announced by Trump on May 20, 2025, is an ambitious anti-missile defense system based on a set of satellites and space-based arms designed to intercept ballistic attacks against the US. However, this initiative has generated a chain reaction among rival powers. China has pointed out that the program increases the risk of space becoming a battlefield, fuels an arms race, and undermines international security. The North Korean government aligns with this stance and accuses the US of seeking to impose its hegemony through this technology. According to a 2025 report by the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), North Korea has approximately 50 nuclear warheads and a dozen intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching any point in the US territory. In June 2024, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested three independently guided warheads, although South Korea questioned the validity of this test, suggesting that the missile in question exploded in mid-flight. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) documented a worrying increase in global military spending, reaching $2.71 trillion in 2024, a 9.4% increase from the previous year, the largest annual increase since 1988. This growth is driven by conflicts such as those in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as geopolitical tensions in Europe and Asia. According to Sipri, the five countries with the highest military spending - the US, China, Russia, Germany, and India - represent 60% of the total, with a combined spending of $1.635 trillion. The US, with a 5.7% increase in its military budget in 2024, leads the ranking with 37% of global spending, followed by China, which increased its military budget by 7%. In Europe, rearmament is particularly notable, with a 155% increase in arms imports between the periods 2015-2019 and 2020-2024, largely in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine initiated in February 2022. Ukraine has become the world's largest importer of heavy arms in this period, with a nearly 100-fold increase in its external purchases compared to the period 2015-2019. Also, Israel increased its military spending by 65%, the highest since 1967 (reflecting the intensity of the conflict in Gaza and the conflict with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon). The UN has tried for decades to curb North Korea's nuclear program through sanctions and Security Council resolutions. However, Pyongyang continued its missile tests in violation of these measures, including short-range ballistic missile launches in May 2025, which, according to South Korea, could be intended to test arms for export, possibly to Russia. The UN Security Council has repeatedly condemned these actions, but the lack of consensus among its permanent members, particularly between the US and China, weakens the effectiveness of these sanctions. The North Korean warning is set against a backdrop of growing military cooperation with Russia. In April 2025, North Korea confirmed the dispatch of 14,000 soldiers to Russia to support its war in Ukraine. Some analysts suggest that this cooperation could be rewarded with transfers of armament technology from Moscow, complicating US and allied efforts to counter threats on multiple fronts. It appears that the UN will need to implement a new approach to address nuclear proliferation, but this requires overcoming the divisions between the great powers. Meanwhile, the US Golden Dome program could accelerate the militarization of space, a site that has been relatively free of direct conflicts until now.

**South Korea's Presidential Front-runner Backs Nuclear Power, But Plans Long-term Shift to Renewables**
South Korea's presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being,' but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected June 3. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables, like offshore wind, to supply industrial hubs. He plans to phase out coal by 2040, curb natural gas consumption, and form a ministry to meet South Korea's 2050 net zero goal. Lee said, 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students.' However, his stance could undermine the nation's atomic energy expansion plans at home and abroad. Lee's strategy calls for a gradual shift to renewables, with a focus on offshore wind power. He aims to reduce the country's reliance on coal and natural gas, and to meet the 2050 net zero goal. Lee's policy framework is seen as a significant step towards a more sustainable energy future for South Korea.

Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables to supply industrial hubs and aims to phase out coal by 2040. He supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants but opposes new reactors due to land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' This stance could undermine the nation's atomic energy expansion plans at home and abroad. Lee's main rival, Mr Kim Moon-soo, currently supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60 per cent of the mix by 2038. However, Mr Han Byung-Hwa, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities, expects Lee to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30 per cent of the power mix by 2030. 'One of the hurdles to entering the AI era is power,' said Mr Jaeseung Kim, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities. 'Whoever wins will have no choice but to accept and use nuclear power for the time being.'

**South Korea Needs a New Vision for the Next 100 Years**
South Korea needs a new vision for the next 100 years, according to experts. The country's current president should present a 2050 vision and forecast for the future. The 6.25 War will mark its 100th anniversary in 2050, and it is time for South Korea to write a new chapter in its history. The experts emphasized the importance of presenting a national vision to the public, which can help create a consensus among citizens. Without a vision, it is difficult to make sacrifices for the future and to understand why people should work for the greater good. The experts also discussed the need for constitutional reform, which should be done in a gradual and sequential manner. They suggested that the government should focus on short-term goals and then move on to more complex issues. Additionally, they proposed the introduction of a 'hate speech regulation law' to address the increasing number of hate speech and fake news on social media. They also discussed the need to reform the country's nuclear policy, which has been stuck in a state of denial about North Korea's nuclear capabilities. They suggested that the government should acknowledge the reality of North Korea's nuclear capabilities and develop a more realistic policy. Finally, they proposed the use of existing laws to regulate fake news and hate speech, rather than introducing new laws that could infringe on freedom of expression.

**US Think Tank Warns of Nuclear War if China Invades Taiwan in 2030**
A recent report by the Atlantic Council, a US think tank, has warned that if China were to invade Taiwan in 2030, the Korean Peninsula could become a second battlefield, and a nuclear war may be unavoidable. The report, titled 'Guardian Tiger II', simulated a hypothetical scenario in which China launches a large-scale conventional war against Taiwan, leading to a US-China confrontation. According to the report, North Korea would play a significant role in this conflict, with China and North Korea sharing intelligence and North Korea launching short-range ballistic missiles at US military bases in South Korea. The report warns that the conflict could escalate into a nuclear war, with China using nuclear weapons to cut off Taiwan's external aid and then invoking a military alliance treaty with North Korea to justify its intervention in the Korean Peninsula. The report also suggests that the US may struggle to make a quick decision on whether to use nuclear force in response to North Korea's provocations, given the complexity of the situation. Experts are calling for the US to reorganize its command and control systems in the Indo-Pacific region and to engage in regular trilateral security talks with South Korea and Japan to address the synchronized threats from China and North Korea.

**As ROK-US Drill Began, North Korea Fired Ballistic Missiles**
North Korea fired several ballistic missiles toward its western waters on Monday, the same day the United States and South Korea began their annual joint military drills, 'Freedom Shield'. The South Korean military detected the launch from North Hwanghae Province and believes the missiles flew less than 300 kilometers before falling into the ocean. Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, had previously warned of the upcoming missile test, saying 'If the U.S. continues to renew its records in the anti-DPRK military demonstration, the DPRK will be naturally compelled to renew its records in the exercise of strategic deterrence.' The United States and South Korea condemned the North's missile test as a clear violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions. Meanwhile, North Korea has strengthened its relations with Russia and has received economic aid and military technology in return for its support in the Ukraine War. North Korea has also unveiled photos of its leader inspecting the construction site for nuclear-powered submarines, showing its determination to advance its nuclear arsenal. As many experts say that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have attacked Ukraine if Kyiv had not given up its nuclear weapons, North Korea's claim that its nuclear weapons are for self-defense will be repeated more by Pyongyang. The article suggests that North Korea's actions may be a response to U.S. President Donald Trump's unconventional view on the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and his one-sided claim that Seoul does not pay enough for the U.S. defense commitment to South Korea.

**Third World War Inevitable, Survey Finds: What to Expect in 2035**
A recent survey conducted by the Atlantic Council found that 40% of international strategists believe that a third world war is inevitable and likely to start within the next decade. According to the survey, 357 experts in international affairs were asked to express their opinions on the future of humanity. The survey found that 40% of the experts believe that a major war involving great powers such as the US, China, or Russia will break out in 2035 and will likely involve nuclear weapons and space battles. Climate change was identified as the second biggest threat to the world in 2035 by 30% of the experts, while 1.7% believed that a new pandemic would be the most pressing concern. Only 5.1% of the experts believed that increasing global debt would be the biggest threat by 2035. The survey also found that the experts believe that the war in Ukraine will not end well for the Ukrainians, and that US economic and diplomatic dominance will decline over the next decade. The survey warned that new global alliances may emerge in the next decade that could threaten the US and NATO. Nearly half of the survey participants believed that China will lead a new alliance that will formally link it with Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and will compete with the BRICS and the G7. In the Middle East, the survey painted a complex picture, with experts predicting that the situation of the Palestinians will remain unchanged, with Israel continuing to occupy Palestinian territories.

**UK 'will be at war in next five years' as official claims we 'need conscription right away' - Daily Star**
Liberal Democrat MP Mike Martin, a former British Army officer, believes there is a 'good chance' the UK will be involved in a war 'before the next election' and thinks conscription is necessary 'right away'. Martin, who has a PhD in war studies, stated that 'we're not at a stage yet where you can replace people with drones' and that 'drones are fine, as far as they go, but you still need people to occupy villages, hold ground, and all the rest of it'. This warning comes as experts predict the likelihood of 'World War 3' and Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has warned that the risk is 'extraordinary' and that 'World War III has already begun'. Dimon pointed to the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as cooperation between US enemies Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, as reasons for his grim outlook. He also stated that the world's collection of nuclear weapons is 'the biggest risk mankind faces', ahead of climate change.

**Thousands of North Korean Workers Sent to Russia, Violating UN Resolution**
According to South Korea's National Intelligence Service, thousands of North Korean workers were sent to construction sites across Russia in 2024, violating a UN Security Council resolution that prohibits North Korea from sending its citizens abroad for work. The resolution, adopted in response to North Korea's nuclear and missile tests, required all North Korean workers abroad to return home by December 2019. However, data from Russia's Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) shows that 13,221 North Korean students entered Russia in 2024, a 12-fold increase from the previous year. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has expressed support for Russia's actions in the war against Ukraine, stating, 'The army and people of the DPRK will always support and encourage the just cause of the Russian army and people in defending their sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity in accordance with the Treaty of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the DPRK and the Russian Federation.' Analysts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) believe that North Korea is using the war in Ukraine as a testing ground for its military capabilities, and that Russia may be providing North Korea with drone and missile technologies in exchange for North Korean troops' participation in the fighting in the Kursk region.

**Kim Jong Un Promises Countermeasures Against Trilateral Military Cooperation**
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un criticized the trilateral military cooperation between the US, Japan, and South Korea, saying it is increasing tensions in the region and promising countermeasures, including the development of additional nuclear forces. Kim stated that the deployment of US strategic nuclear assets, military exercises, and cooperation with Japan and South Korea are causing a military imbalance in the region and posing a serious challenge to the security environment, according to the state media KCNA. 'The DPRK does not want unnecessary tension in the regional situation, but will take sustained countermeasures to ensure regional military balance,' Kim said during a visit to the Ministry of Defense on Saturday to commemorate the Army's founding day. The DPRK stands for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the official name of North Korea. US President Donald Trump said after a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba that he will have relations with North Korea, as they express concern over its nuclear program. However, Kim 'once again clarified the unshakeable policy of developing nuclear forces even further,' according to the report. On the Russia-Ukraine war, Kim said: 'The Army and people of the DPRK will invariably support and encourage the just cause of the Russian Army and people to defend their sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, maintaining the spirit of the comprehensive strategic partnership treaty between the DPRK and Russia.' Last month, South Korea said it suspected North Korea of preparing to send more troops to Russia, in addition to the approximately 11,000 soldiers already sent to the nearly three-year-old war. In a separate commentary released later on Sunday, KCNA again criticized South Korea's military activity with the US this year and warned that aggressive actions will be met with undesirable consequences. 'Anyone could easily imagine how we would see the fact that they conducted more intense war exercises than ever before at a time when diplomatic agendas were being canceled due to political turbulence,' KCNA said.

**Kim Jong-un: North Korea Will Always Support Russia**
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has expressed support for Russia's actions in the war against Ukraine, stating that 'the army and people of the DPRK will always support and encourage the just cause of the Russian army and people in defending their sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity in accordance with the comprehensive strategic partnership between the DPRK and the Russian Federation.' He also emphasized the need to continue developing North Korea's nuclear capabilities, saying that 'the DPRK does not want excessive tension in the region, but will take stable countermeasures to ensure regional military balance.' Kim Jong-un criticized the trilateral military cooperation between the US, Japan, and South Korea, which he believes is increasing tensions in the region. North Korea plans to start producing drones in 2025, developed in collaboration with Russia, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK. The agreement was made in exchange for North Korea providing soldiers to assist Russia's military aggression, sources said. Analysts at the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW) believe that North Korea is using the war in Ukraine as a testing ground for its military capabilities, and that Russia may be providing North Korea with drone and rocket technologies in exchange for North Korean troops participating in the conflict.

**NK expected to maintain hostile stance toward US, South Korea in 2025: experts**
North Korea is expected to maintain its hostile stance towards the US and South Korea in 2025, while strengthening ties with Russia and China, according to experts. The country's leader, Kim Jong-un, made risky bets in 2024 by advocating a 'two hostile states' theory and sending troops to aid Russia in its war against Ukraine. In 2025, North Korea will likely focus on domestic affairs and leverage its ties with Moscow to ensure regime stability. Experts predict that North Korea will continue to ignore South Korea and maintain a stable relationship with China, while bolstering its military capabilities through deepening ties with Russia. As the country approaches its 80th founding anniversary and the Ninth Party Congress in 2026, North Korea's strategic vision for 2025 may include fully implementing its two hostile states theory and increasing troop dispatch to support Russia. 'North Korea's strategic vision for 2025 may include fully implementing its two hostile states theory, increasing troop dispatch to support Russia and continuing war of words with the U.S. and South Korea,' said Kwak Gil-sup, president of One Korea Center. 'North Korea will continue to ignore South Korea even after a new administration steps into power. In other words, any form of inter-Korean exchanges or cooperation seems unlikely this year,' added Chung Young-chul, professor at Sogang University's Graduate School of Public Policy.
