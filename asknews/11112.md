**Taiwanese Progressive Party Chairman Warns of 'Ostrich-Like' Mentality Amid China's Military Threats**
Taiwanese Progressive Party Chairman Wang Hsing-huan warned that Taiwan cannot afford to be in a ' ostrich-like' mentality, ignoring the possibility of war. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently stated that China's military action against Taiwan 'may be imminent' and urged allies in the Indo-Pacific region to increase their defense budgets to deter China. Wang pointed out that various US think tanks, frontline Indo-Pacific commanders, and naval combat forces have warned that China will launch an invasion of Taiwan in 2027. China has also set a goal of 'winning a local war' by 2027. Wang emphasized that China's ideal script for invading Taiwan is to 'encircle and blockade' the island, creating pressure on Taiwanese society through localized military actions, and then using pro-China parties in Taiwan to advocate for 'peace talks' and shape international opinion to accept unification. He stated, 'Those who advocate for peace talks are Taiwan's enemies.' To counter China's military threats, Wang suggested that Taiwan must strengthen its military deterrent, solidify its alliances with Indo-Pacific nations, and cultivate an 'unyielding resistance spirit' to prevent China from launching an invasion. 'If China expects a blockade to lead to a long-term war and international sanctions, it will be hesitant to launch an invasion,' Wang said.

**US Warns of Imminent Chinese Attack on Taiwan, China Responds with Fury**
US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has warned that a Chinese military attack on Taiwan could be imminent. He stated that Xi Jinping has ordered his army to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. Hegseth also emphasized that the US is ready to counter China's hegemonic ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region. The US has 'returned' to the region and is 'here to stay', but Hegseth urged countries to take responsibility for their own defense without relying on the US. China has responded harshly, saying that the Taiwan issue is 'purely internal' and that no foreign country has the right to interfere. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also warned the US not to 'play with fire' and not to use the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China.

**China rejects US defence chief's warnings on Taiwan invasion threat**
China has rejected US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's warnings about the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, calling them 'groundless accusations'. Hegseth had warned that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan 'would result in devastating consequences'. China's National Defence University vice president, Hu Gangfeng, said the accusations were 'nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region'. Australia's Defence Minister, Richard Marles, pointed out that China's largest conventional military build-up since World War II is happening without strategic reassurance and without a clear strategic intent. Australia is increasing its defence spending, aiming to reach 2.33 per cent of GDP by 2033-34, and is on track to receive eight new nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS agreement.

**China Warns US Not to 'Play with Fire' Over Taiwan**
China has warned the US not to 'play with fire' over Taiwan, in response to comments from US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who accused Beijing of preparing an 'imminent' invasion of the island and attempting to alter the regional balance in Asia. 'The Taiwan issue is purely internal to China. No foreign country has the right to interfere,' said the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson in a statement released at midnight. Beijing has expressed its 'firm opposition' and 'deep discontent' with what it considered a 'provocative and inciting' speech by Hegseth, who on Saturday warned that the Chinese military 'practices daily' a possible invasion of Taiwan and hinted at the supposed intention to do so before 2027. 'Let me be clear: any attempt by the Communist Party of China to conquer Taiwan by force will result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world. The Chinese threat is real. And it could be imminent,' emphasized the Pentagon chief on Saturday. China has also warned the US not to 'harbor illusions' about using the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China, and has announced a formal protest to Washington.

**China Warns US Not to 'Play with Fire' Over Taiwan**
China warned the US not to 'play with fire' regarding Taiwan, in response to comments from US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who accused Beijing of preparing an 'imminent' invasion of the island and attempting to alter the regional balance in Asia. 'The Taiwan issue is purely internal to China. No foreign country has the right to interfere,' said the spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry in a statement issued after midnight. Beijing expressed its 'firm opposition' and 'deep discontent' with what it considered a 'provocative and inciting' speech by Hegseth, who on Saturday, during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, warned that the Chinese army 'practices daily' a possible invasion of Taiwan and alluded to the supposed intention to do so before 2027.

Beijing has also accused the US of fomenting confrontation between blocs, deploying offensive weapons in the South China Sea, and 'turning the region into a powder keg.' The spokesperson stated that there are no problems with freedom of navigation in the waters, where tensions exist with neighboring countries such as the Philippines, Malaysia, or Vietnam, and that China 'manages its differences through dialogue and in accordance with the law.' In his Saturday speech, Hegseth had warned that China seeks to 'dominate and control' Asia, and assured that Washington will not allow Beijing to modify the status quo by force.

**US Defense Secretary Warns China is 'Preparing to Use Force' to Upset Asia's Balance of Power**
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that China is 'preparing to use force to upset the balance of power in Asia', sparking a stern rebuke from Beijing. Hegseth made the comments at the '2025 Shangri-La Dialogue' in Singapore, where he also criticized China's influence in global strategic areas. China's Foreign Ministry condemned Hegseth's remarks, saying it had 'lodged a formal protest' with the US and expressed 'strong dissatisfaction' with his comments on Taiwan. Hegseth stated, 'The threat posed by China is real and may be imminent.' He added that Beijing is 'preparing to use force to change the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region.' Hegseth also warned that China's military is building the capability to invade Taiwan and 'is conducting live-fire exercises.' He urged the US's Asian allies and partners to 'rapidly upgrade their defense capabilities' in the face of growing threats. China's Foreign Ministry responded with a statement, saying Hegseth is 'continuously peddling Cold War-era thinking' and 'smearing and attacking China.' The statement added, 'The US should not think that it can use the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China, and should not play with fire.'

**US Defense Secretary Announces China's Planned Invasion of Taiwan**
US Defense Secretary Pita Hegset announced that China will invade Taiwan within two years. He stated, 'The Chinese People's Liberation Army has been instructed to reach the capacity to invade Taiwan by 2027. They are building the necessary military power, training every day, and conducting realistic exercises.' Hegset warned that any Chinese annexation attempt could have devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific region and the world. 'The threat posed by China is real and could become a reality very soon. We hope it doesn't, but it certainly could.' he said. Chinese Military Academy Vice President Hu Gangfeng responded to Hegset's allegations, saying, 'We do not accept any baseless accusations against China. These accusations are fabrications, distorted facts, and claims made by those who are directly responsible for the crime.' Hegset made these comments in Singapore, where he met with US military personnel and participated in a training session.

**US Warns Allies of China's Growing Threat: 'Invading Taiwan in 2027'**
US Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, has warned allies not to 'look away' from the 'imminent risk' posed by China, which is investing in high-level nuclear arms and armament technology to 'invade Taiwan in 2027'. Hegseth has reiterated that China's attempts to conquer Taiwan 'by force' would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. China has warned the US that military aid to Taiwan increases the 'risk of conflict'. Hegseth has called for increased defense spending 'to prevent war, make the cost too high, and peace the only option'. Analysts interpret this as a signal from Washington to increase arms sales in Asia. Hegseth has also highlighted the 'risk' of economic dependence on China, which 'deepens its malign influence' globally. This comes as tensions rise, with China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, not attending the Singapore meeting, and instead sending a delegation from the National Defense University.

**How the US plans to fight off Chinese invasion of Taiwan**
The US Special Forces conducted a drill simulating a war between the US and China over Taiwan. The scenario, which began with Chinese ships crossing the Taiwan Strait with the intention to invade, quickly escalated into chaos with hostile drones and explosions. The drill was a response to Chinese President Xi Jinping's order to be ready to 'reunify' Taiwan with the mainland by 2027. The Chinese military has been building up its forces, boasting one million more troops than the US, a larger navy, and a growing nuclear arsenal set to reach 1,000 warheads by 2030. 'Attention on the floor!' a soldier shouted, 'Sorry to barge in, sir, but you'll want to hear this.' Chinese ships have begun to cross the Taiwan Strait 'with full intention to invade.'

**China's Military Enhances Ability to Launch Surprise Attack on Taiwan, US Officials Express Concern**
According to a Financial Times report, Taiwan and US officials and experts say that China is rapidly enhancing its ability to launch a surprise attack on Taiwan, with the goal of having the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027. The report states that China's air force and missile forces are ready to launch an attack at any moment, and that the Chinese military has been conducting frequent amphibious landing exercises near Taiwan's ports. Additionally, China has deployed new rocket systems that can strike key targets on the island. US military officials have expressed concern that China's military activities are becoming increasingly aggressive, with Chinese warplanes entering Taiwan's air defense identification zone over 245 times per month, up from less than 10 times per month five years ago. A US defense official stated, 'This is a clear indication that China's air threat to Taiwan is escalating and intensifying.' The report also notes that US intelligence agencies believe that Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered the military to have the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027. US officials have expressed concern that Taiwan's self-defense capabilities will be crucial in deterring a Chinese invasion, and that the US and its allies must prepare for a possible conflict. A US official stated, 'I have confidence that if Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party really do what they've committed to doing, if they really try to occupy this island, to start this war, we will win, we will defeat them, but tens of thousands of people will die.' Taiwan officials have also expressed concern, with one official stating, 'Taiwan is very dangerous, Taiwan is basically always at risk of being attacked by China, regardless of whether it's the KMT or DPP in power, they just want to attack us.' The report also notes that China is learning from the Ukraine war, with US experts warning that China is observing the international community's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and is using it to evaluate its own attitude towards Taiwan. A US expert stated, 'If Russia can invade a sovereign state, occupy parts or all of Ukraine, and no one really stops him, China will fantasize about taking Taiwan and all the advanced semiconductors produced there, and no one will be surprised.'

**US Think Tank Warns of Nuclear War if China Invades Taiwan in 2030**
A recent report by the Atlantic Council, a US think tank, has warned that if China were to invade Taiwan in 2030, the Korean Peninsula could become a second battlefield, and a nuclear war may be unavoidable. The report, titled 'Guardian Tiger II', simulated a hypothetical scenario in which China launches a large-scale conventional war against Taiwan, leading to a US-China confrontation. According to the report, North Korea would play a significant role in this conflict, with China and North Korea sharing intelligence and North Korea launching short-range ballistic missiles at US military bases in South Korea. The report warns that the conflict could escalate into a nuclear war, with China using nuclear weapons to cut off Taiwan's external aid and then invoking a military alliance treaty with North Korea to justify its intervention in the Korean Peninsula. The report also suggests that the US may struggle to make a quick decision on whether to use nuclear force in response to North Korea's provocations, given the complexity of the situation. Experts are calling for the US to reorganize its command and control systems in the Indo-Pacific region and to engage in regular trilateral security talks with South Korea and Japan to address the synchronized threats from China and North Korea.

**China's Invasion of Taiwan: The Importance of Port Defense**
According to a recent article by David Axe, a US military expert, if China were to invade Taiwan, it would prioritize attacking ports rather than beaches. The article cites a 2021 report by the 2049 Project, which states that the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) lacks the infrastructure to unload large transport vessels and that landing on beaches would expose them to attack. As a result, the PLA would likely target Taiwan's ports, with five ports - Taichung Port, Kaohsiung Port, Mailiao Port, Taipei Port, and Anping Port - being potential targets. To counter this, Taiwan's military would need to deploy mines, but it is unclear whether the country's leaders are aware of this. According to Ian Easton, a researcher at the 2049 Project, the success of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would depend on the PLA's ability to occupy, control, and utilize Taiwan's large ports. Axe notes that Taiwan's military has a limited number of mine-laying vessels, and that even if all available vessels were mobilized, it may not be enough to create a sufficient minefield to deter the PLA. Axe suggests that Taiwan should rapidly deploy mines, even using commercial ships if necessary, to create a minefield that can effectively deter the PLA. However, it is unclear whether Taiwan's leaders are aware of this and are taking necessary steps to prepare.

**US, China, and Taiwan: A Brewing Storm in the Taiwan Strait**
The tensions between the US, China, and Taiwan have been escalating, with all three sides increasing their military presence in the region. China has been promoting 'unification' propaganda at its airports, and the People's Liberation Army has been conducting military exercises near Taiwan without prior notice. The US has increased its military presence in the region, including deploying B1-B bombers to Japan, and the US-Taiwan military cooperation has deepened. The article suggests that the US may be trying to provoke China into a war, and that Taiwan is caught in the middle. The author notes that the US has been warning of a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan in 2027 or 2035, and that Taiwan should be prepared for the worst. The article also mentions that the US has been supporting Taiwan's international participation, and that China has been increasing its military presence in the region. The author concludes that the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous and that Taiwan should be prepared for the worst. 'If Beijing feels that it has no way out, it may not matter whether it fights or not, the cost of fighting will not be as high,' said an analyst. 'Taiwan should not let itself become the next Ukraine, but it also cannot surrender,' said another analyst. 'The US has been warning of a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan in 2027 or 2035, but it is unclear whether this is based on intelligence or an attempt to provoke China into a war,' said a US expert.

**Taiwan's military exercises to focus on invasion preparation**
Taiwan's military is conducting exercises focused on preparing for a potential invasion by China in 2027, a deadline previously mentioned by security experts and military officials. Former US Navy admiral Philip Davidson warned that China could attempt to invade Taiwan by 2027, while Chinese President Xi Jinping has reportedly instructed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to be prepared for an invasion by then. However, Su Tzu-yun, a fellow at the Institute for National Defence and Security Research, noted that there is no clear indication a formal decision has been made to resort to force by then. Security analysts worldwide have urged their governments to prepare for a possible conflict, and the Han Kuang exercises' focus on 2027 is a logical response to these concerns, according to Su. 'It could create a perfect storm,' he said, 'if Xi seeks a fourth term, he may take military risks to justify his leadership.' The defence ministry's 'immediate response drills' were specifically designed to deter China from 'turning exercises into war,' Su added. 'The principle of risk control was followed,' he said. 'It is normal to use timelines as a reference for defence strategy,' Su noted. 'The US military must be prepared for contingencies before then,' said former US Indo-Pacific commander John Aquilino. 'China is accelerating its military expansion, particularly in dual-use shipyards and nuclear weapons launch platforms,' said US Air Force Strategic Commander General Anthony Cotton. 'These developments align with preparations to have the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027,' he added. 'The US should expedite its own military production in response,' Cotton said. 'It is a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and his ambition,' said former CIA director William Burns, describing Xi's directive to the PLA. 'China is accelerating its military expansion,' Burns added. 'It will continue efforts to weaken US influence in the Indo-Pacific,' said Davidson. 'Whether or not China launches an invasion in 2027, it will continue efforts to weaken US influence in the Indo-Pacific,' he added. 'Alternative deadlines have been proposed, including 2035 and 2049, both of which mark major PLA anniversaries,' Su noted. 'However, if Xi seeks a fourth term, he may take military risks to justify his leadership,' he warned.

**Taiwan's Defense Ministry Predicts Chinese Invasion in 2027**
Taiwan's Ministry of Defense has publicly stated that a Chinese invasion of the island is likely to occur in 2027. The ministry released a document outlining future military exercises, which simulate a Chinese attack, and included the date as a reference point. According to the ministry, the 'Han Kuang' exercises always set a timeframe of one to two years in the future to allow for the acquisition and training of new equipment. However, it is unclear how the inclusion of 2027 will affect the exercise program, or if the date is more of a political signal. China's President Xi Jinping has set a goal for the People's Liberation Army to become a 'modern force' by 2027 and a 'world-class force' by 2047. US officials stated last year that China is preparing to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, citing China's increase in fighter jets, warships, and doubling its stockpile of ballistic and cruise missiles since 2020.

**Taiwan Names 2027 as Potential Year of Chinese Invasion**
The Ministry of Defense of Taiwan has named the year of a potential Chinese invasion for the first time, citing 2027 as the possible year of attack. This information was included in documents for lawmakers to inform them about upcoming summer military exercises that will simulate a Chinese attack. According to Bloomberg, this is the first time in the past decade that a major annual exercise with live fire on Taiwan has not included a specific year for a potential Chinese invasion. The duration of this year's exercises has been doubled to ten days, highlighting the growing attention to Taiwan's military preparedness, which China considers its territory. However, the Minister of Defense of Taiwan, Wellington Koo, did not directly confirm the specific date of a potential Chinese attack. It is unclear how this 2027 date will affect the exercise program or if it is actually a political signal, writes Bloomberg. According to Jack Chen, director of the Formosa Defense Vision human rights group, focusing the exercises on a potential Chinese attack in 2027 may be a tactic to overcome the deadlock in the divided Taiwanese parliament, where opposition parties dispute certain military spending plans. Chinese President Xi Jinping has set a goal for the People's Liberation Army to become a 'modern army' by 2027 and a world-class force by 2047. US officials stated last year that China is preparing for an invasion of Taiwan by 2027, citing Beijing's buildup of fighter jets, warships, and its goal to double its arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles from 2020. Taiwan is considering purchasing billions of dollars' worth of US arms in response to China's continued military pressure on the island, with negotiations currently underway between Taipei and Washington.

**2027: A High-Risk Period for a Chinese Attack on Taiwan**
Experts warn that 2027 is a high-risk period for a Chinese attack on Taiwan, citing three reasons. Firstly, China's economic and military power is declining due to Western economic and technological encirclement. Secondly, China wants to take advantage of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Middle East wars to divert attention and resources away from Taiwan. Thirdly, Chinese President Xi Jinping wants to use a successful attack on Taiwan to gain legitimacy for his fourth term. According to former Taiwanese Defense University professor Yuzhongji, China has been increasing its military activities around Taiwan, including the deployment of 7 warships in the Taiwan Strait, and has been conducting joint military exercises with Russia and other countries. Yuzhongji also notes that China has been trying to use 'by-play-to-war' tactics, where it conducts military exercises and then suddenly launches a surprise attack. He warns that if China were to launch a large-scale military attack on Taiwan, it would be difficult for the US and other countries to respond in time. The US has also warned that China may attack Taiwan in 2027, citing the country's increasing military activities and its desire to take advantage of the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Taiwan's defense minister has also warned that China has the capability to blockade Taiwan, but not necessarily to successfully invade the island. Taiwan is preparing for a potential blockade by China, including stockpiling essential supplies and developing a 'hedgehog defense' strategy to counter China's military actions.

**How China is secretly preparing for an invasion of Taiwan**
China is secretly preparing for an invasion of Taiwan, with President Xi Jinping aiming to be in a position to invade by 2027. The US is trying to ramp up its semiconductor chip production, but current projections suggest it won't be anywhere close to self-sufficiency before the end of this decade. China's aggressive shipbuilding strategy and provocative incursions into Taiwan shipping lanes and airspace point to an imminent invasion. The US has not ruled out military action, but so far is confining itself to demands of safe conduct for Taiwan's politicians, journalists and leading businessmen, who are under mass arrest. Japan has offered support to Taiwan, and a hastily assembled task force has set sail from Yokosuka Naval Base. The invasion of Taiwan has now become full-blown war between Japan and China, with the US launching a missile attack on Chinese transport ships in the Taiwan Strait. China has responded with a hypersonic missile attack on the US fleet, badly damaging one Constellation class frigate defending the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt. President Xi has threatened to use a nuclear warhead if the US does not withdraw its Navy, and the situation has escalated into a global conflict.
