**Elon Musk Leaves DOGE Position, Citing Desire to Focus on Other Businesses**
Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has left his position as special advisor to the US Department of Efficiency Government (DOGE) two days early, citing a desire to focus on his other businesses. Musk had been tasked by Donald Trump to optimize the federal budget and reduce unnecessary expenses, but his efforts were met with resistance from within the government. Despite his best efforts, Musk was unable to achieve the 2 trillion dollar reduction in the budget that he had promised. Musk's departure has been seen as a sign of his growing distance from Trump, who has been increasingly critical of Musk's business dealings. Musk's companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, will continue to have contracts with the government, but his personal influence may be waning. Musk's decision to leave DOGE has been seen as a blow to Trump's efforts to reform the government, and has raised questions about the effectiveness of Musk's leadership style. According to an expert, Musk's unpredictable personality and confrontational style in social media have increased the perception of risk, and have amplified the controversy surrounding his leadership. Musk's extreme politicization has also affected his brand, which has been associated with sustainability and environmental protection, but is now seen as having a personal agenda. This has fragmented audiences and debilitated the connection with certain groups of consumers, threatening the company's global expansion.

**Trump Withdraws Support for Musk's Ally to Lead NASA**
The White House announced that US President Donald Trump has withdrawn his support for Jared Isaacman, a close ally of Elon Musk, to lead NASA. According to the White House, 'it is essential that the next leader of NASA is fully aligned with President Trump's agenda for America, and a replacement will be announced shortly by President Trump.' This comes after a report by the New York Times stating that Isaacman's nomination has been withdrawn. Trump also bid farewell to Elon Musk in a White House meeting on Friday, marking the end of a tumultuous period for the billionaire entrepreneur. Musk is stepping down as head of the Government Efficiency Department and will focus on his other ventures, including Tesla, SpaceX, and X. Trump praised Musk for 'making a huge change in the old ways of working in Washington,' and said that some of his employees will remain in the administration. Despite the turmoil, Musk failed to achieve his goals, as he promised to cut federal spending by a trillion or even trillion dollars, but managed to cut it to only $150 billion in the current fiscal year.

**Elon Musk Leaves Trump Administration, but Promises to Continue Providing Advice**
Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has left the Trump administration, but he will continue to provide advice to the President. In a press conference, Trump said that Musk has done a 'great job' and that he will return to the administration 'from time to time'. Musk stated that his departure from the White House does not mean the end of the Efficiency Government Agency, which he was overseeing. He also said that a significant part of his team will remain in their positions and will continue to work on reducing government spending. Musk promised to save the US government $1 trillion in costs, and he expressed his confidence that the agency will achieve this goal 'over time'. Musk also stated that he will continue to support the team that is working to find $1 trillion in wasteful government spending, which will benefit US taxpayers. However, Musk complained that the agency has become associated with any cost-cutting measures, regardless of their location.

**Elon Musk Leaves Position as Head of US Government's Department of Government Efficiency**
Elon Musk, the billionaire and CEO of Tesla, has officially left his position as the head of the US government's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after a period of over 114 days. Musk, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, had been tasked with reducing government waste and inefficiency. However, his efforts were met with criticism and controversy, particularly after he criticized a Republican bill to fund many of Trump's agenda items. Musk had initially set a goal of reducing over $2 trillion in government waste, but later scaled back his ambitions. Despite his efforts, the DOGE has not yet achieved the promised savings of trillions of dollars. Musk's departure comes as he faces criticism from Trump and other investors in his companies. Musk had been a key supporter of Trump's agenda, but his popularity has waned in recent months. His company, Tesla, has also faced criticism and protests. Musk's departure is seen as a blow to his reputation and his efforts to reduce government waste. Trump has defended Musk's efforts, but it remains to be seen how effective the DOGE will be without him at the helm.

**Elon Musk on the Verge of Becoming the World's First Trillionaire**
Elon Musk is on the verge of becoming the world's first trillionaire, according to various media reports. His net worth is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2027, assuming it continues to grow at an average annual rate of 110%. In 2025, Musk lost $42 billion from his wealth, mainly due to the decline in Tesla's stock value. However, funding rounds for SpaceX, xAI, and Neuralink, in which he holds stakes of over 33%, helped to offset some of the losses. Musk's net worth increased by $16.8 billion yesterday, following a 6.94% increase in Tesla's stock value. His wealth is distributed among $149 billion in Tesla stock, $136 billion in SpaceX, and $20.1 billion and $2.07 billion in xAI and Neuralink, respectively. He also holds a stake in Boring Company, worth over $3.3 billion. Musk's wealth is expected to reach $500 billion soon, driven by Tesla's 'robotaxi' service, which will be tested next month, and his plans to make robots ubiquitous in every home. However, his plans to take SpaceX public have been delayed several times, making it a potential candidate for further growth. Musk's investments in AI through xAI and his social media platform X also present opportunities for growth.

**Bill Gates Could've Left Elon Musk In The Dust With A $1.2 Trillion Fortune  --  If He Hadn't Sold His Microsoft Stock Or Given It Away**
If Bill Gates had retained his original stake in Microsoft, he would have become the world's first trillionaire with a fortune of over $1.2 trillion. However, he gradually sold off his holdings over the years, and now owns 0.9% of the company, valued at around $28 billion. Gates has instead donated to philanthropic causes through the Gates Foundation, which has channelled over $47.7 billion to initiatives tackling health, poverty, and education. Gates has also announced that he will donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the foundation, which will wind down in 20 years. His ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, has also committed to giving away her wealth, with a recent $12.5 billion commitment to her independent work. Gates has been critical of Elon Musk, saying, 'The picture of the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children is not a pretty one,' referring to Musk's denouncement of USAID.

**US's Richest 10 People Increase Fortunes by $365 Billion in 2024, Says Oxfam**
According to a new analysis by Oxfam, the 10 richest people in the US increased their fortunes by $365 billion in 2024, equivalent to a daily gain of around $1 billion. In contrast, the median worker in the US earned around $50,000 in 2023. It would take 726,000 years for 10 workers with median income to reach the same value. 'We are seeing a wealth increase that is astronomical while many ordinary people struggle to survive,' said Rebecca Riddell, senior leader of economic and racial justice policy at Oxfam America. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, accumulated $186 billion in this period, making him the richest person in the world. A recent study suggests that Musk is on track to become the first trillionaire on the planet. Other billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg and Rob Walton saw their wealth grow by $38.7 billion each, while Warren Buffett and Jim Walton accumulated $34.8 billion and $36.5 billion, respectively. However, the cofounders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, saw a reduction in their wealth: $27.2 billion and $25.4 billion, respectively. Oxfam warns that the proposed tax cuts will benefit the rich and cut almost $1 trillion from essential social programs. 'We are seeing a tax code being developed that will result in the first trillionaire in the world,' said Rebecca Riddell. To combat inequality, some progressive politicians advocate for a wealth tax on ultra-millionaires and billionaires. Oxfam estimates that a 3% tax on wealth above $1 billion would raise $50 billion from the 10 richest Americans, enough to provide food assistance for 22.5 million people for a year.

**Elon Musk's Net Worth Plummets, Dream of Becoming Trillionaire Delayed**
Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has lost $116 billion in the first three months of 2025, resulting in a daily loss of $1.2 billion or approximately Rs 10,000 crore. According to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Musk's net worth has fallen to $316 billion. His dream of becoming the world's first trillionaire by 2027 may be delayed due to this decline. Among the world's top 20 billionaires, 14 have seen a decline in their net worth, while only six have seen an increase. Warren Buffet has seen the largest increase in net worth, rising by $24.3 billion to $166 billion. Larry Ellison is second after Musk in losing the most net worth, with a decline of $30.3 billion.

**Elon Musk’s Race to Become the World’s First Trillionaire Runs Through Your Social Security and Medicare**
Elon Musk's path to becoming the world's first trillionaire involves a massive infusion of cash, which can be achieved through the privatization of Social Security and Medicare. The article argues that the current system of asset price increases, fueled by tax cuts and government spending, has created a wealth gap that can be exploited to reach the trillion-dollar mark. The author suggests that the Trump administration's plans to reduce government spending, particularly on Social Security and Medicare, will provide the necessary funds for Musk's wealth to skyrocket. Additionally, the article notes that the privatization of these programs will have a devastating impact on the middle class, leading to downward pressure on private sector wages and further exacerbating the wealth gap. The author concludes that Musk's rise to trillionaire status will require a 'Mother of All Privatizations' (MOAP) of Social Security and Medicare, which will have far-reaching consequences for the US economy and society.

**AI's $19.9 Trillion Impact Could Create The First Trillionaire -- But Mark Cuban Says It Won't Be Musk Or Bezos - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)**
Mark Cuban predicts that the world's first trillionaire will come from someone who masters AI and applies it in innovative ways. Cuban believes that AI has the potential to create extreme wealth, citing a Goldman Sachs report that AI could increase the global economy's GDP by 7% or nearly $7 trillion over the next decade. While Elon Musk is currently the world's richest person with a net worth of $393.2 billion, Cuban doesn't think he will be the first to reach trillionaire status. Cuban suggests that someone who approaches AI from a different angle, such as studying philosophy to better understand human nature, could be the first to hit a trillion dollars. Cuban advises people to keep learning about AI and its developments to remain competitive in the future job market, saying 'Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, machine learning -- whatever you're doing, if you don't understand it -- learn it. Because otherwise, you're going to be a dinosaur within three years.'

According to Cuban, 'The world's first trillionaires are going to come from somebody who masters AI and all its derivatives and applies it in ways we never thought of.' The AI sector is valued at $214.6 billion and is expected to reach $1,339.1 billion by 2030, growing at a 35.7% annual rate.

**What It Takes To Become a Trillionaire, According To Mark Cuban**
Mark Cuban believes that the world's first trillionaire will be someone who masters artificial intelligence (AI) and applies it in innovative ways. Cuban made this prediction in 2017, and now, with AI becoming increasingly prevalent in various industries, his words hold more significance. He does not think that Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos will be the first trillionaire, but rather someone who can harness AI to create wealth in ways that are not yet understood. Cuban emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and growth to stay ahead of the curve in the AI economy. According to Benzinga, the AI market is expected to add $19.9 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with a 36.6% projected annual growth. Cuban urges people to keep learning and evolving to not be left behind when AI ramps up, and it could be possible to see the first-ever trillionaire in the not-too-distant future.

**Who will be the first trillionaire in history?**
Oxfam Intermón revealed at the 2025 Davos Conference that up to five billionaires may become trillionaires in the next decade. This surprising projection comes after an impressive growth of billionaires' assets in 2024. Almost all billionaires increased their wealth, transforming previous predictions that only one of them would become a trillionaire. The accumulated wealth now challenges expectations and raises questions about income concentration worldwide. Factors like space exploration and AI development have significantly contributed to this trend. Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos are among the names leading the new economic frontier. Recent US legislation under Trump's presidency also favored this growth. The meteoric rise of fortunes in 2024 is linked to two main factors: the growth of artificial intelligence, which elevated personalities like Jensen Huang and Mark Zuckerberg, and space exploration, which consolidated Musk and Bezos' companies among the most valuable. Trump's victory in the recent US elections also played a crucial role, with policies benefiting large corporations creating a favorable environment for wealth growth. Despite favorable conditions, billionaires faced unexpected setbacks, such as the Chinese AI DeepSeek, which caused a total loss of approximately US$ 108 billion in the US stock market in a single day. With Elon Musk leading the Forbes list with a fortune over US$ 400 billion, the era of trillionaires seems increasingly closer. The combination of technological advancements, space exploration, and political influences continues to shape the financial world and promises to redefine the concept of wealth in the coming years.
