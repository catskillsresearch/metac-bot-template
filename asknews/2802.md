**Nic Pizzolatto Says Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson Are 'Open' to Reprising Their 'True Detective' Roles**
Nic Pizzolatto, the creator of 'True Detective', is considering bringing back Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson's characters, Rust Cohle and Martin Hart, in a new story. Pizzolatto said, 'I actually have another story for [characters] Cohle and Hart that, who knows, maybe we'll do it one day,' and added that McConaughey and Harrelson 'are open to it.' The two actors only appeared in Season 1 of the anthology series, but their characters have been referenced in subsequent seasons. Pizzolatto has had conversations with McConaughey and Harrelson about reprising their roles, and while nothing is confirmed, it's clear that the possibility is being explored.

**Young Chinese Engineer Reinterprets 'Tits Alternative' Theory, Opens New Avenues in Mathematics and Science**
Chinese engineer, 28-year-old Chu Jongpeng, has made significant progress in one of the most complex modern mathematical theories, known as 'Tits Alternative between universes' (IUT). He has reinterpreted the theory, which was first proposed by Japanese mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki in 2012, as a new approach to solving the 'ABC Conjecture', one of the most difficult problems in the history of number theory. Chu, a former engineer at a Chinese company, dedicated himself to understanding the details of this complex theory, spending up to 14 hours a day studying its 1,000+ pages. His analysis caught the attention of Professor Ivan Veselov, a leading expert in the field, who invited him to join his research team at Westlake University. Chu's new reading of the theory showed a deep understanding of its structure and mathematical method. He didn't stop at understanding the theory, but used its tools to make progress in the 'General Fermat's Last Theorem', a historical problem that has puzzled mathematicians for centuries. Unlike previous attempts that required solutions exceeding 130 pages, Chu's approach is estimated to be able to solve the problem in a single page, a breakthrough considered by experts to be a significant simplification of mathematical concepts. Although the work is still under scientific review, Chu's contribution is seen as a breakthrough in fields such as cryptography, theoretical physics, and computer science, which have long relied on deep mathematical foundations. This progress reflects new possibilities that go beyond traditional academic frameworks.

**"I Have Another Story": 'True Detective' Creator Teases Reunion With Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey After 'Night Country' Backlash**
True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto has teased a potential reunion with Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey for an all-new story, 11 years after the original season. Pizzolatto appeared on the Nothing Left Unsaid podcast, saying, 'I actually have another story for Cohle and Hart that -- who knows? -- maybe we'll do it one day.' He added that the new story would be character-based, but emphasized that it's not something he's written yet. Pizzolatto's comments come after the backlash surrounding the fourth season, Night Country, which he was not involved in. He explained that he stepped away from the show due to spiritual exhaustion and a desire to focus on being a father. Pizzolatto said it was 'right and appropriate' for HBO to move on without him. Meanwhile, True Detective has been renewed for Season 5, which will take place in Jamaica Bay, New York, and is expected to launch in 2027.

**Blatten: Why the Evacuation Zone was Too Small**
The recent natural disaster in Blatten VS, where a glacier broke off and buried the village, has raised questions about the accuracy of the evacuation zone. According to Walter Wildi, a retired geology professor at the University of Geneva, the experts underestimated the size of the glacier abruption. 'The Naturekatastrophe in Blatten was not a pure bergsturz, but rather a Gletscherabbruch. The experts have it underestimated and did not foresee a glacier abruption of this magnitude.' Wildi believes that the mass of the glacier broke off, jumped on a relief, and from there, a much broader sturzfächer occurred than expected, resulting in a much larger schuttkegel than the evacuated zone. 'I have never encountered a Gletscherabsturz-Modell in my career.' The expert emphasizes that it was not the experts who failed, but rather the nature that took over. He also notes that the authorities would have increased the evacuation zone if they had known the true extent of the disaster. 'We calculate evacuation zones always generously.' Wildi also points out that the rescue of many people is a success for the authorities, despite the tragic loss of life. 'National, compared to other catastrophes, it is a success for the authorities that they were able to rescue so many people.'

**No Truth to Exam Leakage: Ministry of Education**
Shadi Zlata, the official spokesperson for the Ministry of Education and Technical Education, stated that the discussion about the leakage of exams is inaccurate. He explained that the leakage refers to the release of the exam before its official date, which has not happened. However, individual attempts to cheat by taking a phone into the exam room and taking a photo of part of the exam paper may occur. Zlata emphasized that these cases are individual attempts to cheat and not a leakage. He warned that the student who attempts to cheat will harm himself more than anyone else. The exams this year are being conducted in most governorates using the 'bocklet' system, which makes it difficult to handle the entire exam paper or take a photo of it easily. Zlata stated that even if a question or two from the exam booklet is shared, it does not mean a leakage, but rather an attempt to cheat that will be detected immediately. He warned of the danger of attempting to cheat, stating that the student who is caught cheating may face penalties, including being barred from taking the exam for a year or two. The ministry has established a central operations room at the ministry's headquarters to monitor the exams continuously, in addition to monitoring by sub-operations rooms in each educational directorate and a dedicated monitoring for each governorate according to its circumstances and exam schedule.

**True Detective Creator Hints at Franchise Return With Matthew McConaughey & Woody Harrelson**
True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto has hinted at a potential return to the show with Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. The trio collaborated on the first season of the HBO crime drama, which won five Emmy Awards. Pizzolatto has a new story idea for Cohle and Hart, but hasn't started writing it yet. 'I actually have another story for Cohle and Hart,' he said. 'Who knows? Maybe we'll do it one day.' McConaughey and Harrelson are 'open' to returning to the show, but it's uncertain if it will happen. Pizzolatto departed True Detective after its third season, citing spiritual exhaustion and a desire to focus on his family. He expressed support for HBO's decision to continue the brand, saying 'I think it's totally right and appropriate for HBO to keep that brand going because we built a brand. I hope they do lots of them.'

**Matthew McConaughey And Woody Harrelson Are Open To True Detective Return, Creator Has A Story For Cohle And Hart**
True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto has revealed that he has a story for Detective Rustin 'Rust' Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Detective Martin 'Marty' Hart (Woody Harrelson) and that both actors are open to reprising their roles. However, Pizzolatto's contract with the show expired after season 3 and he did not renew it, leading to a new creative vision. Given the current direction of the show, Pizzolatto's Cohle and Hart story will not become True Detective season 5, and it could be challenging for him to rejoin the series for a later season. HBO is currently set to continue building on season 4's success without Pizzolatto, along with continuing to embrace the anthology format.

**Kyoto University's ABC Conjecture Proof Finally Recognized After Seven Years**
In 2018, Kyoto University professor Motizuki Shinichi published a paper claiming to prove the ABC conjecture, a notoriously difficult problem in mathematics. However, the paper was met with criticism from abroad, and the journal's editorial committee put the paper on hold for further review. The committee, led by professors from Kyoto University's Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences, invited renowned mathematician Takeuchi Masaki to join as co-editor. Despite efforts to address the criticisms, the debate between Motizuki and his critics, including Peter Scholze and Jacob Stix, remained unresolved. Scholze and Stix later stated that the proof had 'very serious problems' and could not be salvaged with minor corrections. Motizuki responded by criticizing the critics for their lack of understanding of the new mathematics and their failure to give the proof sufficient time for consideration. The debate ultimately ended in a stalemate, with the journal's editorial committee eventually accepting the paper after two years of review. The paper's validity was confirmed by the committee, but some members expressed doubts about the decision. The paper's proof of the ABC conjecture was finally recognized seven and a half years after its initial publication. 'We have 100% confidence in the review process,' said one of the co-editors, Tamakawa Yasukuni. 'The criticisms raised by Scholze and Stix were found to be unfounded after further review and verification within the institute.'

**'True Detective's Nic Pizzolatto Says Matthew McConaughey & Woody Harrelson Are "Open To" Reprising Cohle & Hart For "Another Story**
True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto has expressed interest in revisiting the characters of Rust Cohle and Martin Hart for another story. He stated, 'I actually have another story for Cohle and Hart that, who knows, maybe we'll do it one day.' Pizzolatto emphasized that he doesn't feel pressured to continue the inaugural season's storyline, and that the decision to revisit the characters would depend on whether the guys, Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, are 'open to it.' The new story would be character-based, but Pizzolatto hasn't written it yet. He also dodged questions about plot details, citing the potential for speculation and speculation scripts. Pizzolatto previously made headlines for publicly critiquing Season 4, which was helmed by Issa López. López responded to the criticism, saying that Pizzolatto was entitled to his opinions as the storyteller. Pizzolatto has since expressed his support for López's work and has wished the team luck with Season 5, which is set to premiere in 2027.

**Why Can't Anyone Solve This 3rd Grade Math Problem ?**
The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3x+1 problem, is a mathematical problem that has been unsolved for decades. The conjecture states that every positive integer, when repeatedly applied to the 3x+1 operation, will eventually end up in the four, two, one loop. Mathematicians have tested over 295 quintillion numbers and found no counterexamples, but a formal proof remains elusive. Terry Tao has shown that almost all numbers will eventually have a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small, but this does not prove that all numbers do. The conjecture may be true, but it is also possible that it is undecidable, meaning that it cannot be proven or disproven. The problem's complexity and the vastness of the number space make it challenging to find a counterexample or a formal proof.

**The ABC Conjecture: A Mathematical Enigma**
Five years ago, a groundbreaking paper claimed to have solved the 'ABC Conjecture', a notoriously difficult problem in mathematics. However, the mathematical community is still in a state of confusion, and the proof remains unverified. The ABC Conjecture, proposed in 1985, is a fundamental problem in number theory that deals with the distribution of prime numbers. The conjecture was considered one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics, and its solution was expected to be a major breakthrough. However, the paper's complexity has made it difficult for mathematicians to understand and verify the proof. As one mathematician said, 'It was a great day, but the excitement has cooled down, and now we are in a state of confusion.'

**ABC Conjecture: A Simplified Approach to the Rare Case of c>d**
The ABC conjecture proposes that the sum of two numbers a and b, denoted as c, is rarely greater than their product, denoted as d. To simplify the inequality, the article replaces rad(abc) with d and removes the K and ε symbols. This changes the argument from 'the right side always increases' to 'the left side also increases rarely.' In other words, 'the sum c is rarely greater than the product d.' The article then calculates various values of a and b to demonstrate that c>d is indeed rare. However, it notes that there are an infinite number of exceptions, contradicting the original claim. To make the inequality more manageable, the article introduces ε, which makes the right side larger and reduces the number of exceptions. By replacing 1+ε with d, the article suggests that c>d is no longer enumerable, implying that the conjecture is still valid.

**The Elusive Goldbach Conjecture: A Problem that has Puzzled Mathematicians for Centuries**
The Goldbach Conjecture, one of the most difficult problems in mathematics, states that every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Christian Goldbach first proposed this idea in 1742, and it has been a subject of interest for mathematicians ever since. Despite numerous attempts, a definitive proof of the conjecture has not been found. As Leonhard Euler said, 'the problem is so difficult that it is not even clear if it is true or not.' The conjecture remains one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, and its resolution is still a topic of ongoing research.

**The Science Quiz: Mathematical puzzles**
The Science Quiz presents six mathematical puzzles, including the Towers of Hanoi, the Collatz conjecture, and the Monty Hall problem. The Collatz conjecture involves repeatedly applying a simple operation to a positive integer, and the puzzle asks what value the process will eventually reach. The Monty Hall problem is a classic game show scenario where a contestant must decide whether to stick with their initial choice or switch to the other option. The quiz also includes a question about magic squares, which are square grids of numbers where every row and column sums up to the same value. Additionally, it asks about the number of ways to place queens on a chessboard without any queen being a direct threat to another. The puzzles are designed to test mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills.

**Mathematician Takes A Major Step Toward Solving One Of Math's Biggest Mysteries: The Kakeya Conjecture**
Mathematician Hong Wang, along with her co-author Joshua Zahl, has made a significant breakthrough in solving the Kakeya conjecture, a problem that has stumped mathematicians for over a century. According to Zahl, 'I read a book in undergrad called A Panorama of Harmonic Analysis. I read about [the Kakeya conjecture] in that book and really was taken with it... that's how the interest really started.' Wang and Zahl used advanced math techniques to prove something new about the problem, which has been hailed as 'one of the top mathematical achievements of the 21st century' by Eyal Lubetzky, chair of the math department where Wang works. This breakthrough has the potential to lead to new technology, better computer systems, and a deeper understanding of the universe. As Wang and Zahl's work shows, following one's curiosity and perseverance can lead to significant accomplishments.

**The Kakeya Conjecture, a Decades-Old Math Problem, Is Solved in Three Dimensions**
Mathematicians Hong Wang and Joshua Zahl have solved the three-dimensional version of the Kakeya conjecture, a decades-old problem in mathematics. The conjecture relates to the question of how to rotate a needle in such a way that it takes up as little space as possible. According to mathematician Eyal Lubetzky, 'It stands as one of the top mathematical achievements of the 21st century.' The solution, which was posted in a preprint paper in February, shows that the volume covered by the needle is always three-dimensional. This result has implications for many other areas of mathematics, including harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory. As mathematician Guido de Philippis commented, 'I am expecting that their ideas will lead to a series of exciting breakthroughs in the coming years.'

**The Collatz Conjecture: A Problem of Eternity**
The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3x+1 problem, is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. It is a simple yet intriguing problem that has fascinated mathematicians for centuries. The problem states that any natural number, when repeatedly applied to the rules of 3x+1, will eventually reach the 4-2-1 cycle. However, despite extensive computer simulations that have checked billions of numbers, a proof for the general validity of the conjecture remains elusive. Paul Erdős, a renowned mathematician, once said, 'Mathematics is not yet ready for such problems.' The Collatz Conjecture is a problem that seems simple enough to be solved, but its depth and complexity have frustrated even the most brilliant minds. The question remains: is there a number that resists this rule and never enters the 4-2-1 cycle? Despite numerous attempts, no such number has been found, and a proof that it does not exist is also lacking.
