**Climate Change Doubles Extreme Heat Days in Germany**
According to an analysis by Climate Central, World Weather Attribution, and other partners, Germany has experienced around twice as many extreme heat days in the past 12 months due to climate change, compared to what would have been the case without global warming. The analysis defined extreme heat days as those where the maximum temperature exceeded 90% of the average local temperature in the period from 1991 to 2020. In the period from May 2024 to May 2025, Germany experienced 50 such days, with 24 of them attributed to climate change. The team calculated a theoretical scenario without global warming and compared it to the actual number of extreme heat days. At least 30 additional heat days were experienced by half of the world's population, approximately 4 billion people. In 195 out of 247 studied countries and regions, climate change caused at least a doubling of extreme heat days. In Europe, the most significant heat event influenced by climate change was a heatwave that spread from Greece to Romania, Asia, and the Middle East in June 2024. Friederike Otto, a German climate researcher from Imperial College London, stated, 'The climate crisis is real, and it kills. With every barrel of oil burned, every ton of CO2 released, and every fraction of a degree of warming, more people will be affected by heatwaves.' However, Otto also noted, 'We know exactly how to prevent heatwaves from getting worse: by transforming our energy systems to be more efficient and based on renewable energy, and creating a more equitable and resilient society.' According to the Robert Koch Institute, there were approximately 3000 heat-related deaths in Germany in 2023 and 2024.

**Climate Crisis Doubles Number of Hot Days in 195 Countries**
A study found that the climate crisis has doubled the number of hot days in 195 countries. In Germany, the number of extreme heat days has increased by a factor of two in the past 12 months due to climate change. According to Climate Central, World Weather Attribution, and other partners, 50 extreme heat days were experienced in Germany from May last year to May this year, with 24 of them attributed to climate change. The study found that four billion people, roughly half of the world's population, experienced at least 30 additional extreme heat days due to climate change. In 195 of 247 studied countries and regions, climate change has led to at least a doubling of extreme heat days. Dr. Friederike Otto, a German climate researcher, said, 'The climate crisis is real, and it kills. With every barrel of oil burned, every ton of CO2 released, and every fraction of a degree of warming, more people will be affected by heatwaves.' She also noted that heatwaves pose a particular risk to the elderly, those with pre-existing conditions, pregnant women, newborns, and young children. However, she also offered a positive message: 'We know exactly how to prevent heatwaves from getting worse: by transforming our energy systems to be more efficient and based on renewable energy, and by creating a more equitable and resilient society.'

**Climate Change Confronts World Population with Extra Month of Extreme Heat**
According to scientists, in 195 countries or regions, the number of extreme heat days has at least doubled due to climate change, compared to a world without warming. Between May 1, 2024, and May 1, 2025, researchers identified 67 instances of extreme heat. The study found that approximately 4 billion people, or 49% of the world's population, experienced at least 30 extra days of extreme heat in 2024 compared to a simulated world without warming. The scientists note that each heatwave that occurs today is more likely, intense, and prolonged due to fossil fuel burning. The results highlight the harmful effects of continued fossil fuel use on health and well-being across every continent. As one researcher noted, 'Although floods and cyclones make headlines, heat is likely the deadliest extreme event. Thousands of heat-related deaths are reported each year, and many more go unreported or unlinked to heat.'

**Climate Change Doubles Extreme Heat Days in Germany, Affects 4 Billion People**
A new study found that climate change has doubled the number of extreme heat days in Germany over the past year. According to the analysis, Germany experienced almost half the number of extreme heat days it would have seen without climate change. The study, conducted by the 'Global Weather Attribution' initiative, the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, and the Central European Climate Research Centre, defines extreme heat days as those where temperatures exceeded 90% of the average temperatures recorded between 1991 and 2020. In the period between May 2024 and May 2025, Germany experienced 50 extreme heat days, with 24 of them directly linked to climate change caused by human activities. By simulating a climate scenario without human emissions, scientists found that climate change caused at least 30 additional extreme heat days, affecting around 4 billion people, or half of the world's population. The study found that in at least 195 countries and regions, the number of extreme heat days has doubled due to climate change. The worst heatwave caused by climate change in Europe occurred in June 2024, when a heatwave swept from Greece through Romania to Syria and the Middle East, 'said Dr. Elin, a researcher at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, 'It was a great day, but it was also a day of extreme heat.'

**Climate Change Adds a Month of Extreme Heat in 2024, Study Finds**
A recent study by World Weather Attribution (WWA), Climate Central, and the Red Cross Climate Centre found that 4 billion people, roughly half of the world's population, experienced an average of 30 extra days of extreme heat between May 1, 2024, and May 1, 2025, compared to a world without climate change. These heatwaves recorded temperatures higher than 90% of historical observations in their area. The study warns that heatwaves are becoming longer and more frequent due to fossil fuel burning, but are still underestimated in many countries. To reach these conclusions, the authors conducted a global heat attribution analysis, combining peer-reviewed attribution science with detailed data from 247 countries and territories. They studied the influence of climate change on the 67 heatwaves that developed during the 12-month period and broke records or caused significant impacts. According to the study, climate change at least doubled the number of extreme heat days in 195 countries and territories compared to a world without climate change. The experts also found that the 67 major heat events of last year were exacerbated by global warming. They recommend strategies to prepare for heatwaves, such as increasing the number of heat impact reports and monitoring, and developing heat action plans. Friederike Otto, co-director of WWA and professor of climate science at Imperial College London, said, 'This study is a serious warning: climate change is already here and it's deadly.' However, she added, 'There's good news. We know exactly how to prevent heatwaves from getting worse: restructure our energy systems to be more efficient and based on renewable energy, not fossil fuels, and create more equal and resilient societies.'

**FÃ³rmula do emagrecimento? Os efeitos do jejum aliado ao HIIT**
A combination of intermittent fasting and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can double the weight loss results, according to a Norwegian study. The study involved 131 women with excess weight, who were divided into four groups: one group did intermittent fasting for 10 hours, another group did HIIT, a third group did both, and a control group continued their usual diet and activities. The results showed that the group that did both intermittent fasting and HIIT lost an average of 3.6 kg, compared to the control group. However, cardiologist Francisco Pupo warns that this type of training can be risky without proper medical supervision. 'This type of training accelerates heartbeats very quickly. Therefore, for a sedentary person, it is essential to have a cardiological check-up before starting the physical program,' he says. A professional in education and nutrition should also be present to guide the training and ensure that the person's health is not compromised. 'Intermittent fasting needs to be guided. It's not just about stopping eating, there's a whole planning and follow-up,' he emphasizes. The study also found that the group that did both intermittent fasting and HIIT had better blood sugar control in the long term, which can help prevent type 2 diabetes. However, no differences were found in cholesterol or blood pressure levels between the groups.

**Is It Time to Tax Data?**
The world is expected to produce 180 zettabytes of data in 2025, a threefold increase from five years ago, and is estimated to more than double again by 2028. This data explosion is largely due to the adoption of AI, which is energy-hungry and contributes to the environmental impact of data creation and storage. One petabyte of data takes 300,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per year to store, costing companies $240,000 and producing 240 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. As AI development and deployment accelerate, it may be challenging to control carbon emissions, with companies like Google and Microsoft already reconsidering their carbon-neutrality pledges. Proposed carbon taxes and cap-and-trade schemes, based on the economic concept of an 'externality,' may be necessary to address this issue.

**Solar Energy Doubles in Three Years, Becoming 'Motor of Global Energy Transition'**
The production of electricity from solar energy has doubled in just three years, according to a report by Ember, a research institute in London. In 2024, solar energy accounted for 6.9% of the world's electricity production, up from 5.6% in 2023. This marks the 20th consecutive year that solar energy has been the fastest-growing energy source. China saw the largest increase in solar energy production, accounting for more than half of the global solar growth. Ember's CEO, Phil MacDonald, stated, 'Solar energy has become the motor of the global energy transition. Paired with battery storage, solar energy is becoming an unstoppable force. As the fastest-growing and largest source of new electricity, it is crucial in meeting the increasing electricity demand.' Other renewable energy sources, such as wind power, also saw an increase, with wind power accounting for 8.1% of global electricity production. However, fossil fuels still dominate the energy mix, with coal accounting for 34.4% of global electricity production in 2024.

**Solar Power doubling every 3 Years; 41% of world Electricity now Low-Carbon**
Solar power is experiencing exponential growth, doubling every three years, and has reached 2,000 terawatt hours, a milestone it reached faster than any energy-producing technology in human history. According to Ember, if all the solar energy generated in the world last year was dedicated to India, it would have been able to supply the country with all its electricity. Solar is reducing the use of coal and gas, particularly in China, where the growth in coal production and use would have been 50% higher in recent years if it had not been for the big build-out in solar power. Non-OECD countries, including China, accounted for 59% of new solar installations in 2024, with 39% of that in China alone. Solar is expected to account for 4,000 terawatt hours in 2028, 8,000 terawatt hours in 2031, 16,000 terawatt hours in 2034, 32,000 terawatt hours in 2037, and 64,000 terawatt hours in 2040, which is likely to be all the electricity used in the world at that time. However, this progression depends on current technology, and advancements in perovskite solar panels could make the process even quicker and more affordable.

**Global Energy Consumption Hits Record High, Electricity Drives Growth**
The world's energy consumption has almost doubled compared to the average of the past decade, according to the Global Energy Review 2025 by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The energy gap between economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions is widening. IEA Director Fatih Birol noted that a summit on energy security will be held in London next month. The energy consumption continues to rise globally, with a +2.2% increase in 2024, almost double the decade-long average of +1.3%. Electricity is the main driver of this growth, with a +4.3% increase, equivalent to the annual consumption of Japan. This 'very strong growth' marks the 'age of electricity', said Fatih Birol, head of the IEA. Factors contributing to this growth include building consumption (60%), industrial production, electrification of transportation, and the development of artificial intelligence and data centers (+20%, mainly in the US and China). The IEA attributes 0.3% of this trend to the increase in energy demand, particularly the use of coal, due to extreme temperatures worldwide in 2024, the hottest year on record. The increase in energy consumption is covered by 38% by renewable energies, followed by natural gas (28%), coal (15%), oil (11%), and nuclear (8%). Renewable energies and nuclear power alone provided 80% of the additional electricity consumed last year. 'The world's greenhouse gas emissions last year increased by less than 1%. We observe a decoupling between economic growth and emissions growth. This is the result of the increasing share of renewables, a stronger penetration of nuclear power, electric vehicles, and other technologies,' said the IEA director. 'Our economies are increasingly dependent on electricity,' added Laura Cozzi, IEA's director of sustainable development and technologies. The consumption of oil increased by only 0.8% in 2024, composing only 30% of the global energy mix for the first time. However, polluting energies remain the main source of global electricity production (around 60%, half of which is coal).

**India Doubles GDP In 10 Years, Outpacing Major Economies: IMF Data - News18**
India has doubled its GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in the last 10 years, growing from $2.1 trillion in 2015 to $4.3 trillion in 2025, according to IMF data. This growth of 105 per cent outpaces major economies, including the United States (66 per cent growth) and China (44 per cent growth). India is now the fifth-largest country in terms of GDP, and is set to surpass Japan soon. BJP Minister Amit Malviya praised the achievement, saying, 'India has achieved a remarkable economic milestone, doubling its GDP from $2.1 trillion in 2015 to $4.3 trillion in 2025 - a staggering 105% growth unmatched by any other major global economy.' He attributed the success to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership and the government's proactive economic policies. 'Through proactive economic policies, bold structural reforms, and a sustained focus on ease of doing business, the Modi government has propelled India to the position of the world's fastest-growing major economy,' he added.

**China doubles US research output on next-gen chips amid export bans  --  trade war fuels a research wave**
A recent study by the Emerging Technology Observatory (ETO) found that China has conducted more than double the United States' research on next-generation chipmaking technologies. Between 2018 and 2023, China-based institutions produced 34% of the 475,000 chip design and fabrication-based articles published worldwide, compared to 15% from the United States and 18% from Europe. The quality of Chinese research is also high, with 50% of the top 10% most-cited articles coming from China. Zachary Arnold of the ETO commented, 'I don't know if we've seen a field where there is quite this difference...When you see so much activity, it's hard to imagine that [won't] have an effect on China's technological capability and ultimately manufacturing capability in the coming years.' China's research focus is on post-Moore's Law technologies, such as neuromorphic computing and optoelectric computing, which are not subject to current regulations. The United States' export bans may be ineffective against these next-gen chips, and China's research organizations are leading the world in chipmaking research, with no signs of slowing down.

**Macadamia production expected to double after crushing price struggles**
Australian macadamia nut growers are confident that they can secure new markets and avoid an oversupply, despite a price drop three years ago. The industry is expected to almost double its annual volume in the next five years, with global production also surging. According to Australian Macadamia Society (AMS) chief executive Clare Hamilton-Bate, 'That is just a theoretical number based on orchards in the ground and theoretical yields.' The World Macadamia Organisation estimates global production will grow by about 10 per cent each year. Ms Hamilton-Bate said prices and demand were recovering from the sharp declines of 2022, but she hoped more consumers would embrace the native nut. She said the industry was working to secure new markets and solidify current ones such as India to prevent another glut. Graham Wessling, a macadamia nut grower, said, 'I think there's such a huge taste for macadamias worldwide that we can always feed that market.' He added, 'It's up to the [AMS] marketing team to keep in front and make sure they're doing their job and able to sell the great product we've got.' In 2024, Australian farmers harvested 57,000 tonnes of macadamias while struggling with prices at or below the cost of production.

**U.S. LNG Exports Surge But Long-Term Growth Uncertain | OilPrice.com**
The US has become the world's largest supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG), exporting 88.3 million tons in 2024, a 4.5% increase from the previous year. However, the country's dominance is threatened by Qatar's plans to double its LNG output capacity by 2030, which will increase competition for new US terminals. Energy investors are becoming wary of committing to long-term take-or-pay deals with LNG developers due to uncertainty about future demand. As Andy Huenefeld, managing partner of Pinebrook Energy Advisors, said, 'There needs to be the demand for it, and there needs to be assurance that if you're going to enter into this extremely capital-intensive construction project, you're not going to be left holding the bag if the global market is suddenly oversupplied in 10 years.' Europe's LNG imports have declined, with increased imports from Russia despite sanctions, indicating that price is a significant factor in purchasing decisions. Despite this, forecasters expect US LNG export capacity to grow significantly in the medium term, with Morgan Stanley analysts predicting a twofold increase by the end of the decade.
