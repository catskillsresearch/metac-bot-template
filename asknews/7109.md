**6 In 10 Americans Fear Social Security Will Vanish Before They Retire, As 2033 Insolvency Clock Ticks Louder - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)**
A recent survey by DepositAccounts found that 59% of working-age Americans fear that Social Security will not exist by the time they retire, with 70% of Generation X sharing this concern. The anxiety is driven by the program's main trust fund's depletion in 2033, which would leave incoming payroll taxes covering only 79% of promised checks. Jaime Eckels, a certified-financial-planner, warned that the countdown has moved from abstract to immediate for many savers, saying, 'It's not that far away. We're creeping up on it.' However, not all gauges are as bleak, with the 2025 Retirement Confidence Survey finding that about half of workers remain at least 'somewhat confident' that the government will pay benefits of equal value to today's. Despite this, 60% of workers worry about cuts to Social Security benefits. Analysts stress that insolvency does not equal disappearance, with LendingTree's Matt Schulz saying, 'The truth is that it's highly, highly unlikely Social Security 'won't be available.'

**AI Energy Consumption to Surpass Bitcoin Mining by 2025, Study Warns**
According to a new study, the energy consumption of AI systems is growing faster than expected and could surpass that of Bitcoin mining by the end of 2025. By then, AI will account for almost half of the global energy consumption of data centers, up from 20% currently. The study's author, Alex de Vries-Gao, criticizes the lack of transparency from tech companies about the actual energy costs of AI applications. He draws parallels with the cryptocurrency industry, where the 'bigger is better' approach has led to environmental degradation. The study warns that the US market could see a 25% increase in energy consumption from AI, Bitcoin mining, and traditional data centers by 2030. However, it's not just the amount of energy that matters, but also its source. For example, a search query in West Virginia generates almost twice as much CO2 emissions as the same query in California, where renewable energy dominates. Despite progress in efficiency and sustainability, the study finds the situation alarming. The global energy consumption of data centers could reach the level of Japan's total energy demand by 2026, according to the International Energy Agency. Additionally, the increasing demand for specialized chips and other components drives up the demand for rare earth materials, while water consumption for cooling systems is also on the rise. In some regions, the establishment of data centers and their water consumption is already in conflict with the needs of the local population.

**US Plans to Create Strategic Bitcoin Reserve**
The US is planning to accumulate Bitcoin and not share it with anyone, according to officials in Washington. The goal is to create a strategic reserve of cryptocurrency, and the Trump administration has already taken steps to achieve this. The reserve will consist of around 200,000 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $16.5 billion. The move is seen as a way to diversify the country's financial assets, protect against inflation and economic instability, and promote technological leadership. The initiative also aims to help the US pay off its national debt. According to analysts, the creation of the Bitcoin reserve could lead to a surge in the cryptocurrency's price, as investors become more interested in it. The move is also seen as a way for the US to counter the growing influence of alternative financial systems in Russia and China. 'We want to accumulate as much as possible and not sell a single Bitcoin,' said Bo Haines, executive director of the White House Council on Digital Currencies, at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. 'This is a strategic reserve, and we will not share it with anyone.'

**TIS and Touchstone Capital Management Start Proof-of-Concept Experiment for Security Token Transfer**
TIS Inc. and Touchstone Capital Management have announced the start of a proof-of-concept experiment to verify the usefulness of a digital scheme that completes the necessary procedures for the transfer of security tokens (ST) on the 'STLINK' platform provided by TIS. The experiment aims to reduce the analog administrative burdens associated with the transfer of ST, such as the provision of content certification mail and the acquisition of a certificate of determination. The 'STLINK' platform will be used to verify the transfer of ST, and the results will be used to implement digital possession of third-party opposing requirements and to provide services. The experiment is expected to start in June 2025, and the goal is to provide services that implement digital possession of third-party opposing requirements by the end of 2025. TIS and Touchstone Capital Management will also work together to promote the use of ST in the GK-TK scheme, which is expected to expand to 2 trillion yen by 2030.

**Regulating India’s virtual digital assets revolution**
India continues to lead in grassroots crypto adoption, with a National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) report finding that Indian retail investors poured $6.6 billion into crypto assets and predicts the industry could create over eight lakh jobs by 2030. However, the country's regulatory and policy landscape for Virtual Digital Assets (VDA) remains unclear, with the Supreme Court of India questioning the absence of comprehensive regulation in 2025. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has expressed concerns about the potential threats of crypto since 2013, and the government has implemented tax policies such as a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on VDA transactions exceeding ₹10,000 and a 30% capital gains tax. Despite these measures, estimates show that Indians traded over ₹1.03 trillion worth of VDAs on non-compliant platforms between July 2022 and December 2023, resulting in a loss of ₹2,488 crore in uncollected VDA tax revenue for India. To move beyond the current policy stasis, a balanced, pragmatic, and future-proof regulatory framework is necessary, which would allow for the creation of comprehensive legislation that the crypto industry requires while mitigating associated risks.

**From Taxation To Confiscation: Europe's Wealth Exodus & The Coming Asset Seizure**
Europe's deindustrialization and bankruptcy continue, with the next step being asset seizure. Governments are raising taxes, including wealth taxes, but individuals are leaving the country to avoid them. Norway's experience shows that raising wealth taxes can lead to a loss of tax revenue as individuals with wealth leave the country. Spain has recorded a negative millionaire migration, and the UK has lost 12,500 high-net-worth individuals in 2023, with 9,500 more expected to leave in 2024. The proposed solution is an exit tax for citizens leaving the country, but the author believes the next step will be confiscation. The EU has already taken steps towards confiscation, including requiring citizens to register all their assets in a central register and eliminating cash. The author advises buying Bitcoin and self-custodying it to avoid seizure.

**Bitcoin's 'Time Bomb': Should the 21M Cap Be Removed? - Crypto News Flash**
Justin Drake, a Bitcoin and Ethereum security researcher, has warned that Bitcoin's security is a 'ticking time bomb' due to its Proof-of-Work mechanism. According to Drake, Bitcoin's fixed supply cap of 21 million coins is a 'critical bug' that breaks security and makes the network vulnerable to attacks. He claims that even if Bitcoin reaches a value of $10 million per coin, the daily budget for network security would still be around $65 million, making it easy to attack. Drake suggests that removing the 21 million cap and implementing a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism could fix the issue. He dismissed other alternatives as speculative or insecure. As of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $105,527, down 1.84% in the last 24 hours.

**Bitcoin to Reach $1 Million by 2030: Prominent Analysts Predict Strong Price Increase**
Several prominent financial commentators and investment analysts are predicting a long-term price increase for Bitcoin that could take the asset's price above $1 million before the end of the decade, driven by growing inflation and expanding global debt. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, predicts that Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030 in her company's 'Bull Case' scenario, requiring a 58% annual compound growth rate over the next five years, primarily driven by increasing institutional adoption. Robert Kiyosaki, a popular financial educator and author of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', predicts a more modest price of $1 million for Bitcoin by 2035. Kiyosaki believes that until 2035, a Bitcoin will be worth more than $1 million, gold will be at $30,000, and silver will be at $3,000 per coin, citing record-high federal and credit card debt in the United States in 2025 as the main factor for the search for protection assets like precious metals and Bitcoin. Other analysts, including Raoul Pal, point to the devaluation of fiat currencies as a key reason for Bitcoin's appeal as a protection asset. Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, also predicts that Bitcoin will reach $1 million, highlighting its potential to 'transform the global economy in incredible ways'. Markus Thielen, CEO and head of research at 10x Research, notes that Bitcoin's price historically moves in increments of $16,000, indicating that the next significant resistance for Bitcoin is near $122,000. André Dragosch, European research head at Bitwise, predicts that Bitcoin could extend its rally to a top above $200,000 by the end of 2025, citing a model proposed by Canadian Bitcoin investor Greg Foss that evaluates Bitcoin based on a basket of G20 sovereign bonds.

**Veteran investor predicts shocking Bitcoin rally by 2033**
Veteran investor Michael Terpin predicts a shocking Bitcoin rally by 2033, with the price potentially hitting $150,000-$250,000 by the end of 2025 and approaching $1 million by 2033. According to Terpin's Four Seasons of Bitcoin model, BTC's price moves in reliable cycles, similar to real estate and stock markets. He explained that halving, which reduces the block mining reward by 50% every four years, controls the circulating supply of Bitcoin tokens and drives up its price. Terpin said that if macroeconomic conditions remain neutral, Bitcoin's price could hit around $193,000 by the end of 2025, three times its price after the last halving. He also stated that unresolved or worsened conditions due to tariff tensions could impact BTC's price negatively, but it is unlikely to go below $150,000 at its peak. Terpin claimed that 2025 will be the best year ever in terms of the total market cap of Bitcoin and the dollar's value appreciation.

**This Investment Might be "Tariff-Proof," and It Could Soar 1,715% by 2030, According to Cathie Wood's Ark Invest | The Motley Fool**
Cathie Wood's Ark Invest predicts that Bitcoin could reach a price of $1.48 million by 2030, implying a potential upside of 1,715%. This is because Bitcoin is seen as 'tariff-proof' and could be a good addition to a traditional investment portfolio. Ark's prediction is based on eight factors, with four being the most significant. While Bitcoin is still a highly speculative investment, it has soared by 35,300% over the past decade and has a unique value proposition due to its scarcity and decentralized nature. As attractive as Ark's prediction sounds, investors must remember that Bitcoin doesn't produce revenue or earnings and its market capitalization would be $31 trillion if it reaches $1.48 million, making it 10 times more valuable than Apple. Nevertheless, considering the current economic and political climates, investors could benefit from allocating a small percentage of their portfolios to Bitcoin, which could shield them from a significant financial loss if it heads south instead.

**This Investment Might be "Tariff-Proof," and It Could Soar 1,715% by 2030, According to Cathie Wood's Ark Invest**
Cathie Wood's Ark Invest believes that Bitcoin could reach a price of $1.48 million by 2030, implying a potential upside of 1,715%. The investment firm thinks that Bitcoin will be 'tariff-proof' due to its digital nature and decentralized system, which makes it immune to long-term fallout from trade tensions between the US and its trading partners. According to Ark, Bitcoin's unique qualities, such as its scarcity and verifiable system of record, make it a good addition to a traditional investment portfolio. Wood's firm has identified eight factors that support this prediction, but four stand out as the most significant: 'These factors include the growing adoption of Bitcoin, its increasing institutional ownership, the development of a robust ecosystem, and the potential for Bitcoin to become a store of value.' As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $81,500.

**Researchers Predict Bitcoin to Reach $1.8 Million by 2035**
Researchers predict that Bitcoin's price will reach $1.8 million by 2035, despite the current market downturn. According to Joe Burnett, research director at Anchorage, a US-based cryptocurrency research firm, Bitcoin is still on an upward long-term trend, based on analytical models such as the parallel model and Michael Saylor's 'Bitcoin 24' model, which predict a price range of $1.8 to $2.1 million in the next decade. Burnett notes that these predictions represent 'logical and basic scenarios', with the possibility of exceeding them if favorable economic conditions are met. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and head of investment at Melstrom, predicts that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2025 if the US Federal Reserve returns to a dovish monetary policy. However, other analyses suggest that investors are currently cautious, with investors shifting their portfolios away from cryptocurrencies and towards more stable assets like gold and strong currencies, leading to a decline in Bitcoin's market capitalization. Since the beginning of 2025, gold has outperformed Bitcoin, with its price increasing by over 23%, while Bitcoin has declined by over 10%. The gold market has also seen a significant surge, with its market capitalization exceeding $1 billion this week, its highest level since the 2023 banking crisis.

**Cryptocurrencies and Online Gaming in 2025: Will They Remain the Future of Online Casinos?**
Cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the way players manage payments in online casinos and betting platforms. Many online gaming operators have adopted digital currencies due to their promise of instant payments, lower transaction fees, and greater privacy. In 2025, this trend continues to grow, with more platforms incorporating Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins to facilitate access to deposits and withdrawals for players. One of the most significant positive aspects of crypto in gaming is its extreme decentralization, which allows for a type of payment from user to platform, giving more online players worldwide greater accessibility. The security and confidentiality of each transaction are high due to blockchain technology, which permanently records each operation within the system. This allows participants and operators to verify any transaction or bet at any time, ensuring no alterations or traps. However, there are also challenges, such as regulations, which vary across jurisdictions, with some accepting and regulating crypto use while others impose severe restrictions or even complete bans. The volatility of cryptocurrencies is another factor to consider, as their value can change drastically in a short time, posing challenges for both players and operators. Despite these challenges, the current trends indicate that the adoption of cryptocurrencies in online gaming will continue to grow. The security, decentralization, and speed of transactions remain attractive for both players and operators, and the advancement of blockchain technology and new solutions to reduce volatility will likely lead to an increase in cryptocurrency use in online gaming. 2025 will be the decisive year for this transformation, as more online gaming platforms will adopt the demands of players along with clearer regulations in many parts of the world.

**US Could Hold 25% of Bitcoin by 2035, Says Michael Saylor**
Michael Saylor, a prominent figure in the crypto world, has proposed a plan to include Bitcoin in the US national reserves. The Treasury and Commerce Departments are considering this idea, which could see the US hold 5% to 25% of all Bitcoin by 2035. This strategic reserve could potentially grow to $16 trillion to $81 trillion by 2045, helping to tackle the country's debt. Saylor believes that this move would boost the US economy and keep it at the forefront of global finance. He also emphasized the need for businesses to be able to create digital assets without permission, for exchanges to trade and hold them freely, and for banks to offer crypto services instead of blocking them. According to Saylor, this plan could bring in $10 trillion in new markets, $20 trillion in securities growth, $10 trillion for the dollar, and $20 trillion in wealth from Bitcoin.

Experts have mixed predictions for Bitcoin's future, with some, like Cathie Wood, believing it could surpass $1 million by 2030, while others, like Warren Buffett, are skeptical. Meanwhile, Ethereum's potential for growth remains significant due to its vast ecosystem and continuous upgrades. As the first blockchain to feature smart contracts, Ethereum has seen significant developments, including its transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus through the Merge. Historically, Ether has shown consistent growth with typical market fluctuations, and many believe its widespread adoption and ongoing innovations could contribute to future appreciation.
