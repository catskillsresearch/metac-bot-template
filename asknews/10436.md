**Massive Solar Flare Expected on May 30, Severe Geomagnetic Storm to Hit Earth**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced that a massive solar flare will occur on May 30, causing a 'severe (G4)' level geomagnetic storm on Earth. According to the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), which is affiliated with NOAA, the storm is currently affecting the planet and is expected to have negative impacts on electricity transmission lines, satellite systems, and navigation signals. 'We expect the storm to cause voltage control issues and temporary disruptions to power transmission lines,' said the statement. The storm is expected to continue at severe levels until June 2, and then gradually decrease to moderate levels (G1-G2) by June 3. Additionally, the statement noted that it may be possible to observe the Northern Lights in high-altitude areas.

**Scientists Warn of New Solar Flare and Magnetic Storms on June 2, 2025**
Scientists from the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IKI RAN) have announced a new solar flare that is expected to hit the Earth on June 2, 2025. The first wave of magnetic storms hit the Earth on June 1, 2025. According to the IKI RAN website, the geomagnetic situation remains tense. 'As of the morning of June 2, Moscow time, the overall situation in the vicinity of the Earth remains strongly disturbed. The indicators of solar wind speed and temperature, although they have moved away from record levels, still maintain extremely high values,' the article on the official website states. Scientists note that the situation with geomagnetic radiation will be stabilized by the evening of June 4, and people sensitive to weather changes will feel relief. A previous forecast by KP.RU predicted magnetic storms from June 2 to 8. It was reported that a sudden and strong flare-up occurred unexpectedly on Saturday morning, releasing a massive amount of plasma directly towards the Earth.

**Powerful Solar Storm Hits Earth, June 3 Forecast**
A powerful solar storm hit the Earth on June 2, 2025, with a magnetic storm of almost 8 points. This is a record-breaking blow to the geomagnetic field, which was felt by millions. However, do not relax yet: according to scientists' forecasts, the storm will continue on June 3, 2025. The sun's solar flares in June 2025 began with a cosmic anomaly - record-breaking releases of solar plasma hit the Earth. On the morning of June 1, instruments recorded a solar wind speed of over 1000 km/s, one of the highest in history. The temperature of the release exceeded 2 million degrees, 20 times higher than normal. According to scientists from the Institute of Space Research and the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics, the situation is so non-standard that 'it is difficult to even understand what is happening.' On June 2, a magnetic storm of almost 8 points occurred. And this is not the limit. The probability of a magnetic storm on June 3, 2025, is very high - 80%. This is a serious indicator that is rarely recorded. The geomagnetic index will be around 5 points throughout the day, with a peak of activity from midnight to 10 am, when five 'red' points are expected. In addition, there is a 15% chance of a 'excited' magnetosphere - when the body reacts, even if officially there are no storms. People sensitive to weather changes may feel fatigue, headaches, insomnia, blood pressure fluctuations, and anxiety. According to scientists, the current storm will last at least until June 3, 2025. Then, from June 4 to 6, there will be an 'echo' of the storm - the magnetosphere will remain excited. A calm week will last from June 7 to 13, followed by a new geomagnetic attack on June 14. The next wave of magnetic activity will come at the end of the month: on June 24-25, scientists predict a 'red' level of geomagnetic activity. After that, until June 28, the Earth will remain in an excited state. Forecasts for such a long period may be inaccurate, so people sensitive to weather changes should regularly monitor the situation. But remember: the forecast is preliminary, and everything can change in a few hours. Unstable atmospheric pressure also puts an additional load on the body. In Moscow, it is today - 744 mm Hg, in St. Petersburg - 754 mm Hg. Both indicators are below normal (760 mm). Especially in the capital, this can be felt as weakness, drowsiness, disruption of concentration, and headaches. At the same time, a decrease in pressure enhances the effect of magnetic storms, especially in people with vascular disorders and weather sensitivity. Doctors recommend people sensitive to weather changes to follow these recommendations during days of magnetic activity: drink more water (dehydration exacerbates vascular load); limit coffee, strong tea, and alcohol; do not overexert yourself physically and emotionally; sleep for at least 7-8 hours, preferably on a schedule; take magnesium, omega-3, and vitamin B group (with a doctor's agreement); use a contrast shower to normalize vascular tone; if symptoms worsen - keep prescribed medications for pressure and headaches handy.

**Massive Solar Flare and Geomagnetic Storm Expected to Affect Earth on June 1-2**
A massive 8.2 magnitude solar flare occurred on the sun, followed by a G4 level geomagnetic storm that is expected to affect the Earth on June 1-2. The storm may cause power outages, communication disruptions, and rare northern lights sightings in some areas of Turkey, including Istanbul. According to the NOAA, the solar flare was a coronal mass ejection (CME) that occurred on the sun on the evening of May 31. The storm is moving towards the Earth at a speed of approximately 620 miles per second. As stated by Hava Forum on social media, 'The G4 level flare may cause us to see red/purple color tones in Istanbul as well.' The storm is expected to reach G3 levels on June 1 and G4 levels on June 2, potentially causing power surges, voltage fluctuations, GPS signal loss, satellite communication disruptions, and radio transmission failures. However, NASA has not yet made an official announcement about the event.

**Massive Solar Flare Heads Towards Earth, Causing Geomagnetic Storm**
A massive solar flare is heading towards Earth, causing a geomagnetic storm that could lead to temporary disruptions in electricity and internet infrastructure. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced that a powerful solar flare will occur on May 31, 2025, with a coronal mass ejection (CME) of 8.2 magnitude directly targeting Earth. The plasma mass is expected to reach Earth at a speed of approximately 3.6 million kilometers per hour, potentially causing a G4-level geomagnetic storm. This could lead to aurora sightings in Turkey and other lower-latitude regions, a rare natural phenomenon. Experts warn that the flare could disrupt satellite communications, GPS connections, and electricity grids, particularly for aircraft flying near the poles. Authorities advise citizens to unplug sensitive electronics and take precautions against power surges on Saturday night and Sunday morning. 'It is not a situation to cause panic,' officials say, 'but taking preventive measures can be beneficial.'

**Largest Plasma Ejection of 2025 to Hit Earth on June 1**
According to experts, a massive gas cloud will reach Earth in just a few hours. On June 1, a powerful magnetic storm will occur on Earth as a result of the largest plasma ejection on the Sun in 2025. Specialists predict that the disturbances of the magnetic field may lead to the emergence of a G4-class storm. 'Calculations confirm an exceptionally high speed of plasma, approximately 1,200 kilometers per second. It will take the plasma only about 37 hours to cross the 150 million kilometers between the Earth and the Sun,' the laboratory statement reads. During this time, a massive gas cloud will hit the group of space apparatus in the Lagrange point L1, including the SoHO spacecraft. Other space means near Earth will also be affected by the plasma.

**Will Magnetic Storms Occur on June 1, 2025?**
A strong solar flare of level M8.2 occurred on May 31, causing a massive plasma ejection directed towards Earth, according to scientists from the Laboratory of Solar Astronomy of the ICI RAS and the ISZSF SO RAN. 'The area is located in the center of the visible disk of the Sun. Almost exactly on the line Sun-Earth, which excludes even a theoretical possibility of the ejected solar material passing by Earth. The power of the ejection is slightly lower than similar events last year in May 2024, which led to level 5 storms, but may lead to the largest series of magnetic storms this year with peak values up to G4 (a class preceding the highest fifth level). A G5 forecast branch also exists, but has a 2% probability at the moment,' the statement says. The solar material is expected to reach Earth as early as Sunday, June 1, in the late evening. Initially, it was thought that magnetic storms would be possible after 16:00 Moscow time, but the forecast was later corrected: geomagnetic disturbances will occur after midnight. The Kp-index, which characterizes geomagnetic activity, may reach 7-8 points, corresponding to a strong and very strong storm. Even people without health problems may feel unwell during magnetic storms, experiencing headaches, weakness, insomnia, blood pressure fluctuations, and rapid heartbeat. In such periods, doctors recommend increasing water consumption, eating a balanced diet, reducing salt intake, taking more rest, spending time outdoors, avoiding stress, and excessive physical exertion.

**Solar storm could cripple power grids TOMORROW as rare 'severe' warning issued**
A rare 'severe' warning has been issued for a massive solar storm due to arrive at Earth tomorrow, which could cause major disruption to internet, phone signals, and power grids. The Space Weather Prediction Centre has put the warning in effect, stating that the coronal mass ejection (CME) erupted from the Sun yesterday evening and will likely lead to 'immediate geomagnetic disturbances'. According to a statement, 'Confidence in an Earth-arrival component to this CME is good. However, timing and intensity are more uncertain.' The storm could also make the aurora visible in the northern half of the United States, as far south as Alabama and Northern California. The Met Office defines geomagnetic storms as 'disturbances in the Earth’s magnetic field caused by solar activity', which can have physical impacts such as geomagnetically induced currents affecting power lines and pipelines, and technological impacts like potential power grid blackouts and GPS signal interference.

**Scientists Warn: Earth Still Blind to Solar Storms - Al Masry Al Youm**
Despite the scientific progress in monitoring coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the sun, scientists still face a critical weakness in predicting the impact of these solar storms on Earth. According to a report by Space-com, physicist Valentín Martínez Martínez stated that the biggest challenge lies not in monitoring the sun, but in the lack of early information about the 'Bz' component. He added that spacecraft like 'ACE' and 'DSCOVR' only collect Bz data when the storm reaches the 'Lagrange 1' (L1) point, giving Earth a warning of between 15 to 60 minutes. Martínez emphasized that we have the necessary scientific models to provide accurate predictions, but we lack continuous coverage from multiple angles of the sun. He believes that without expanding the monitoring network to points like L4, L5, and L3, we may need another 50 years to reach the accuracy of weather forecasting on Earth. Scientists hope to fill this gap through new space missions, including the 'Vigil' mission by the European Space Agency (ESA), which aims to launch towards the L5 point in 2031 and monitor solar storms from the side, allowing for the detection of their shape and magnetic field direction before they approach Earth. However, some scientists see waiting until the 2030s or later as a risk, as the world remembers the 'Carrington Event' in 1859, which caused a disruption to telegraph networks, or the 2012 solar storm that could have caused trillions of dollars in damage if it had hit Earth directly. Dan Baker from the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) warned in a 2013 scientific paper that a direct hit could completely shut down technological life. Although there are monitoring networks like GONG and DSCOVR, their limited capabilities highlight the urgent need to expand coverage. Martínez concluded by saying: 'The sun has not changed, but our increasing reliance on technology has made us more vulnerable.' Until scientists can monitor solar storms before they arrive, Earth will remain at risk without real protection.

**Astronomers Warn of Massive Solar Storm: A Threat to Global Technological Systems**
Astronomers have warned that humanity remains largely unprepared for a massive solar storm that could paralyze global technological systems. Despite advances in space weather forecasting, current tools are unable to accurately predict the main influencing factor - the orientation of the solar storm's magnetic field (component Bz), which determines the level of interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere. According to physicist of the Sun Valentin Martinez Pillet, 'placing new satellites in other points, such as L4, L5, and even L3, would allow for earlier warnings, potentially several days in advance.' It is estimated that it will take around 50 years for space weather forecasting to reach the level of accuracy of terrestrial meteorological models. The Vigil mission by the European Space Agency, scheduled for 2031, aims to address this issue by placing a satellite in the L5 point, allowing it to observe coronal mass ejections before they are directed at the Earth, providing at least a week's warning time. The consequences of a powerful solar storm can be catastrophic: communication disruptions, satellite failures, and even widespread power outages for several days or weeks. In a world increasingly reliant on digital infrastructure, the lack of preparedness for such events poses a significant challenge to security.

**NASA Warns of Mega Solar Storm and Global Blackouts**
NASA and US authorities are warning of a massive solar storm that could cause power outages, communication problems, and potentially a global 'internet blackout'. The storm, which could hit the Earth in the coming days, is expected to be one of the most extreme in recent history. According to NASA and US authorities, the storm could cause widespread disruptions to electrical infrastructure, satellites, and telecommunications systems. The warning comes after several massive solar eruptions were measured in the past few weeks, which led to communication disruptions in Europe, Asia, and the US. The US authorities conducted a large-scale emergency drill in May 2024, simulating four scenarios, including a 'superstorm' scenario that resulted in weeks-long power outages on the US East Coast, pipeline shutdowns, and train disruptions. However, the main problem with solar storms is the extremely short warning time, which is only about 30 minutes before the storm hits the Earth. Scientists are calling for a global strategy to mitigate the effects of space weather and are urging national and international protection measures. 'It's a matter of when, not if,' said a NASA spokesperson, 'we need to be prepared for the worst-case scenario.'

**Scientists Warn of Massive Solar Storm: A Threat to Global Infrastructure**
Scientists warn of a massive solar storm that could hit the Earth in the coming days. The sun has already sent several strong radiation bursts, including a X2.7-class eruption on May 14. These storms can severely impact the Earth's magnetic field and have caused power outages in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, as well as disruptions to the power grid in the eastern United States, according to 'Daily Mail'. NASA and other authorities warn of further eruptions. In May 2024, US authorities simulated a worst-case scenario, the 'Solar Storm Emergency Drill', which included four scenarios of geomagnetic storms. The 'Superstorm' scenario caused concern, with weeks-long blackouts on the US East Coast, pipeline and rail disruptions, and a feared 'Internet Apocalypse' scenario. The result was that the greatest weakness of current technology is the late detection of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which can only be reliably detected about 30 minutes before they reach the Earth. Scientists are calling for national strategies to defend against space weather hazards, including more satellites to monitor solar activity, better real-time data, and closer international cooperation. As the report states, 'Ongoing preparation efforts for a space weather event are of critical importance, as an extreme event has the potential to severely impact our nation's critical infrastructure and threaten our national security.' 'Just as we prepare for earthquakes, hurricanes, and cyber attacks, our nation must take action before a larger space weather event occurs.'

**Solar Storm Could Cause 'Internet Apocalypse', Warn Scientists**
Scientists warn that the upcoming solar storm on May 13-14, 2025, could cause an 'Internet apocalypse' due to the massive amount of particles it will bring. According to a study, the storm could cause widespread disruptions to radio communications, GPS systems, and satellites. The researchers conducted four simulations of geomagnetic storms, including the worst-case scenario, and found that the US is not fully prepared for a massive solar storm. As stated in the report by the Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation (SWORM) institute, 'An extreme event has the potential to severely impact our nation's critical infrastructure and threaten our national security.' The researchers emphasize the importance of preparing for such events, saying, 'Just as we prepare for earthquakes, hurricanes, and cyberattacks, our nation must take measures before a major space weather event occurs.' The solar storm is expected to bring particles over 600,000 miles long, equivalent to almost a million kilometers. The consequences of the storm could include disruptions to radio communications, GPS systems, and satellites, as well as fluctuations in voltage and auroras.

**14,000-year-old solar storm: 'Establishes a new, worse scenario'**
A massive solar storm, 500 times more powerful than the 2003 Halloween storm, hit the Earth 14,300 years ago. The storm, which was the most powerful solar storm ever recorded, generated severe disruptions to the Earth's magnetic field and released enormous amounts of charged particles into the planet's atmosphere. These particles, mostly high-energy protons, increased the natural levels of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon. Scientists can use the concentrations of radiocarbon to date organic materials, as the isotopes decay over time. A significant spike in radiocarbon concentrations was discovered in the fossilized tree rings in 2023, indicating that a strong solar storm occurred as the last ice age came to an end. The event, which occurred 12,350 years ago, is the only extreme solar particle event known outside of the Holocene, the last 12,000 years of stable warm climate. According to Dr. [no name mentioned], 'Our new model surpasses the current limitation to the Holocene and extends our ability to analyze radiocarbon data even for glacial climate conditions.' The impact of such massive solar storms is crucial to understand for 21st-century technology experts, who are much more vulnerable to the whims of the Sun due to society's dependence on electronic systems and space technologies. As Dr. [no name mentioned] said, 'This event establishes a new, worse scenario.' Understanding its magnitude is essential to evaluate the risks that future solar storms pose to modern infrastructure such as satellites, power grids, and communication systems. Past solar storms, such as the Carrington event of 1859 and the Halloween storm of 2003, have shown the devastating effects that solar explosions can have on Earth. A storm like the one that occurred 12,350 years ago would likely cause total chaos if it were to hit the Earth and its surrounding space today.

**Solar Flare Explodes on the Sun, But No Need to Worry... Yet**
A massive solar flare has exploded on the surface of the sun, but scientists say there is no need to worry for now. According to experts, the majority of this solar energy was not directed directly at the Earth, reducing its impact to minor disruptions in wireless communications. However, such events are not rare, as a solar flare of category (X) has previously struck the Earth, causing significant disruptions, and even allowing the display of the aurora borealis in unexpected places such as Florida and the Caribbean region, according to the Daily Star. What does this mean for our near future? The solar spot responsible for this phenomenon, known as AR4046, is still active and is expected to remain so for at least a week. As the Earth and sun continue to move, any direct alignment could lead to more severe effects, including disruptions to communication and satellite systems, and even spectacular displays such as aurora borealis in regions where it has never been seen before. The sun's cycle and the question of the future The sun goes through cycles of activity that last about 11 years, reaching its peak when the number of sunspots and flares increases. Currently, we are in the 25th solar cycle, which peaked in late 2024 and is expected to continue until 2031 before starting to decline gradually. However, even with this decline, scientists warn that solar activity may continue to surprise us. In 2003, the 'Halloween solar storm' caused disruptions to satellites, television broadcasting services, and even air traffic. Therefore, the real question is not 'Will a strong solar storm occur?' but 'When will it occur, and how prepared are we to face it?' What is a solar storm? A solar storm is a sudden explosion of particles, energy, and magnetic fields and materials that are ejected by the sun into the solar system, according to NASA. How does a solar storm affect us? When directed towards the Earth, a solar storm can cause a significant disturbance in the Earth's magnetic field, known as a geomagnetic storm, which can cause effects such as radio and power outages and beautiful aurora displays. However, these storms do not cause direct harm to anyone on Earth, as the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere protect us from the worst of these storms. What causes a solar storm? The sun creates a complex mess of magnetic fields. These magnetic fields twist with the sun's rotation. Solar storms occur when these twisted magnetic fields break and reconnect (in a process called magnetic reconnection), releasing huge amounts of energy. Types of solar explosions Solar explosions can produce any or all of the following: Solar flare: A bright flash of light. Radiation storm: A storm of charged particles launched into space at high speeds. Coronal mass ejection (CME): A large cloud of solar material that is ejected away from the sun. A solar flare is an explosion of intense radiation on the surface of the sun, extending through the electromagnetic spectrum, including X-rays and gamma rays. Classification of solar flares Solar flares are classified according to their intensity: X: The strongest of all categories, with each category increasing in intensity by a factor of ten. What is a radiation storm? A radiation storm occurs when solar flares accelerate charged particles (electrons and protons) into space at high speeds. Effects of radiation storms: Penetration of the Earth's magnetic field. Disruption of radio communications. Damage to satellites. Hazard to astronauts and high-altitude aircraft. Coronal mass ejection (CME) What is a coronal mass ejection? It is a large cloud of charged plasma that is ejected from the outer atmosphere of the sun (the corona). Effects of coronal mass ejection: Disruption of power grids. Increased drag on satellites. The solar storms vary according to the solar activity cycle, which lasts 11 years, where it increases during the maximum solar activity and decreases during the minimum solar activity.

**Earth dodges massive solar storm, with space experts watching for...**
A massive solar flare and coronal mass ejection (CME) erupted from the Sun's surface, but space experts say there is no need to worry yet. According to scientists, the majority of the energy from the solar event did not directly travel towards Earth, limiting the impacts to a few radio blackouts. However, when the Earth and the Sun are in more direct alignment, there could be potential impacts, such as auroras and disruptions to spacecraft and communication equipment. NOAA's Space Weather Center classified the recent solar flare as an 'X' event, which denotes the most intense level. Experts from Harvard University anticipate that the Sun will remain in Solar Cycle 25 through at least 2031, before starting the gradual rise of activity again in Solar Cycle 2026. Space experts will be monitoring sunspot region AR4046 over the coming weeks to see if it will remain active and potentially direct solar events toward the planet.

**Artificial Intelligence Predicts Solar Storms with Unprecedented Accuracy**
A new study has revealed that artificial intelligence has become capable of predicting violent solar storms before they occur, after being trained on decades of solar activity data. This allows for the early detection of solar disturbances and the prediction of future eruptions. According to ScienceAlert, the coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are massive plasma explosions that launch from the corona of the sun into space due to disturbances in the solar magnetic field. These events are often linked to solar flares, which occur when the magnetic field lines suddenly reorganize, releasing huge amounts of energy. The study found that in February 2000, a massive coronal mass ejection was released, launching a huge bubble of magnetized plasma into space. When these emissions reached Earth, they interacted with the magnetic field, potentially causing geomagnetic storms that can affect satellite communications, GPS systems, and power grids. The storms can also cause spectacular auroral displays known as the Northern or Southern Lights. Predicting these events has long been a challenge for scientists, but a research team led by Sabrina Gaustavino from the University of Genoa used artificial intelligence to tackle it. The team applied AI techniques to data related to the solar storm that occurred in May 2024, including solar flares from the active region 13644 and coronal mass ejections. The study found that 'analyzing vast amounts of previous data using AI enabled the team to uncover complex patterns that were difficult to detect using traditional methods.' According to the results, AI algorithms showed unprecedented accuracy in predicting solar flares, their development over time, and the production of coronal mass ejections, ultimately predicting geomagnetic storms and their effects on Earth. The study concluded that 'the team, using AI, was able to analyze vast amounts of previous data to uncover complex patterns that were difficult to detect using traditional methods.'
