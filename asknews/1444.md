**United Nations to cut nearly 7,000 workers, 20% of its budget: report - LifeSite**
The United Nations (UN) is planning to cut its $3.7 billion budget by 20% and eliminate approximately 6,900 jobs, according to an internal memo. This move comes as the US, which funds about 25% of the UN, plans to cut funding under President Donald Trump's 'America First' approach. UN Controller Chandramouli Ramanathan stated, 'The review of spending is an ambitious effort to ensure that the United Nations is fit for purpose to support 21st-century multilateralism, reduce human suffering and build better lives and futures for all.' However, a think tank director suggested that the UN's plan may be an attempt to win back Trump's support. Trump has been critical of the UN, particularly its promotion of the LGBT agenda and its Agenda 2030, which aims to spend trillions on fighting 'climate change' and promoting 'sustainable development.' Trump has also begun withdrawing the US from globalist agreements that send American tax dollars overseas.

**LGBTQ community divided as WorldPride 2025 comes to Washington, D.C.**
The LGBTQ community is divided about attending WorldPride 2025 in Washington, D.C. due to safety concerns under the Trump administration. Zoe Stoller, a licensed social worker, said 'D.C. is not necessarily a place that many people would think of as super safe and comfortable right now, given the current administration and their attacks on the LGBTQ community.' Meg Ten Eyck, founder of EveryQueer, anticipates 'an astronomical amount of fear and sadness from people' and potential violence. However, Stoller predicts that some people will attend as a 'giant 'F*** you' to the administration.' David D. Marshall, founder of Journey to Josiah Inc., said that for people of color, showing up is 'a whole different experience' to White LGBTQ people and that allies should 'show up' to support them. The Trump administration has rolled back protections for LGBTQ people, but the city of Washington, D.C. is democratic and supports the Pride celebration. WorldPride organizers have implemented 'top-to-bottom safety protocol' to ensure a safe event.

**NDC will lose 2028 elections if Mahama fails to sign Anti LGBT+ bill - Assin South MP**
Reverend Ntim Fordjour, Member of Parliament for Assin South, has warned that the National Democratic Congress (NDC) will suffer a humiliating defeat in the 2028 elections if President John Dramani Mahama fails to assent to the Anti-LGBTQ+ Bill. According to Fordjour, any president who treats the bill lightly risks jeopardizing the electoral fortunes of their party. He emphasized that LGBTQ+ issues are a significant influence on political behavior in Ghana and other countries, and that the NDC would be making a grave political miscalculation if Mahama fails to sign the bill into law. Fordjour cited a 2021 CDD Afrobarometer survey which found that 93% of NDC supporters are opposed to LGBTQ+ activities, and warned that if the bill is mishandled, the 6.3 million votes the NDC secured in the 2020 elections could turn into anger. He stated, 'If he doesn't sign it, it will be the Ghanaian people who show him the red card and register their disagreement.' The Speaker of Parliament, Rt. Hon. Alban Sumana Kingsford Bagbin, has announced that the bill will be reintroduced for its first reading during the second meeting of the Ninth Parliament. The bill seeks to criminalize LGBTQ+ activities in Ghana, as well as the promotion, advocacy, or funding of such activities.

**Polish Presidential Election: Nawrocki and Trzaskowski Head to Runoff**
The Polish presidential election has reached a runoff between the government-backed candidate Rafal Trzaskowski and the nationalist-conservative Karol Nawrocki. According to the first exit polls, Trzaskowski was leading with 50.3%, while Nawrocki had 49.7%. However, the first projections showed Nawrocki in the lead with 50.7%, while Trzaskowski had 49.3%. Nawrocki said, 'We will come back tonight and save Poland.' The outcome is crucial for the government, as the president has significant influence on foreign policy, defense, and veto power over new laws. The government, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, is seeking to pass laws on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, but has been blocked by President Andrzej Duda. A victory for Nawrocki would maintain the status quo, making it difficult for the government to pass important reforms before the 2027 parliamentary elections. Nawrocki has based his campaign on traditional Polish values, with the slogan 'Poland first, Poles first.' His win would be a significant boost for the opposition party Pis, which previously governed Poland from 2015 to 2023. Trzaskowski, on the other hand, has promised bipartisan support for civil rights and stricter immigration policies.

**Polish Presidential Election: Karol Nawrocki Takes Lead in Early Projections**
According to the first projections of the 23rd, the sovranist candidate Karol Nawrocki is in the lead in the Polish presidential elections, winning 50.7% of the votes, while the pro-EU candidate Rafal Trzaskowski, mayor of Warsaw and ally of the centrist government, has obtained 49.3%. The projections reverse the result indicated by the exit polls, which had given a slight advantage to Trzaskowski. The vote will have significant implications for the country's role in Europe, abortion, and LGBTQ+ rights. Trzaskowski, 53, has been running against the 42-year-old historic nationalist Karol Nawrocki, supported by the party Diritto e Giustizia (PiS) of the conservative President Andrzej Duda. The polls had predicted a close race. Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who has voted in the presidential elections in his country, wrote on X, 'Is there a queue at Sopot at this hour? There will be a good turnout!' while sharing a photo of himself smiling next to his wife in front of the ballot box in the coastal town between Danzig and Gdynia, where he spent most of his life. The runoff is crucial for the relations between Warsaw and Europe. The two opposing visions are at stake, and not just the leadership of the country - the President of the Republic, in addition to leading the armed forces, has the power of legislative veto - but also the orientation on sensitive issues such as women's rights, abortion, and LGBTQ+ policies. A Trzaskowski victory would give momentum to the progressive program of the executive led by Tusk, opening the possibility of recognizing same-sex civil unions and revising the rules on abortion. A Nawrocki win would instead mark a return to the hard line of the PiS, which was in government from 2015 to 2023, and could even trigger new parliamentary elections. His supporters push for a tightening of immigration rules and greater autonomy from Brussels.

**WorldPride 2025 Calls for Global LGBTQ Solidarity**
Ymania Brown, co-president of InterPride, emphasizes the importance of global solidarity at WorldPride 2025, saying, 'Right now, more than ever, we need global solidarity.' The event aims to bring together the global LGBTQI community, bridging global divides and creating deeper connections. Brown wants attendees to feel empowered by the visibility of the LGBTQI community and to be inspired by the activism, empowerment, and resilience of their fellow attendees. However, she notes that some LGBTQI people from abroad may refrain from attending due to concerns about detention by customs officials or being turned away due to the U.S. government's policies on immigration and gender identity. Brown, who is transgender, will not be attending WorldPride for this reason. Despite the challenges, Brown encourages attendees to celebrate and enjoy themselves, saying, 'When one or two or three of you LGBTI citizens of the world gather in the name of InterPride, you are celebrating.'

**'Even here we are afraid': Oregon family to leave U.S. to protect son, who is transgender**
An Oregon family is planning to leave the United States due to concerns that their lives could be disrupted by President Trump's policies on issues like health care and deportation. The family's 14-year-old son is transgender and has been receiving gender-affirming care. The mother said, 'I will never let anyone hurt him, and I will do whatever it takes to keep him safe and ensure that he continues to have access to the care that he needs.' Despite living in a state that offers protections, the family is afraid and has chosen to move to a country in Europe that is more LGBTQ-friendly. They plan to leave in August and will continue to receive care for their son without any threats. The family is taking only essential items with them, and their future plans are uncertain, including a potential return to America in 2029 when Trump leaves office.

**Poland's Presidential Election: A Crucial Test for the Government**
The polls in Poland have opened for the presidential election, with Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, and Karol Nawrocki, the candidate supported by the conservative and nationalist party Law and Justice (PiS), facing off. Although the role of the Polish president is largely ceremonial, they do have some influence on foreign policy and defense, as well as the power to veto new laws, which can only be overridden by a three-fifths majority in parliament, a threshold that the current government does not meet. 'At stake' is the possibility for the government of Tusk to make progress on its electoral promises, particularly on issues of the rule of law and social issues, such as abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, after 18 months of difficult cohabitation with the opposition president Andrzej Duda. A victory for Nawrocki, a former amateur boxer, would prolong the current stalemate, making it difficult for the executive to approve significant reforms before the 2027 parliamentary elections. 'Tusk knows what's at stake and knows that if Nawrocki wins, he will be facing a government in difficulty for the next two years. And it will be worse than with Duda, because Nawrocki will arrive fresh, with a new mandate, which has effectively become a referendum on the government,' said Professor Aleks Szczerbiak, a lecturer on Central and Eastern European politics at the University of Sussex.

**Polls open in Poland for close-fought presidential election**
Polls have opened in Poland for the second round of the presidential election, with pro-European Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski facing off against historian and former amateur boxer Karol Nawrocki. Trzaskowski, backed by Donald Tusk's governing coalition, is vying for the presidency against Nawrocki, who is endorsed by the populist-right Law and Justice (PiS) party. The election is a dead heat, with polls showing the difference between the two candidates to be within the margin of error. Prof Aleks Szczerbiak said, 'Tusk knows the stakes and that if Nawrocki wins, he's got a lame-duck administration for the next couple of years.' A Nawrocki win would prolong the current deadlock, making it difficult for the government to pass any major reforms before the 2027 parliamentary election. The election is seen as a crucial test of the government's ability to implement progressive reforms and its stance on issues such as abortion and LGBTQ rights.

**In an uneasy climate, LGBTQ activists converge in DC for World Pride**
LGBTQ activists from diverse communities are gathering in Washington D.C. for World Pride, a celebration that aims to bring together people from different backgrounds and identities. The event comes at a time when anti-immigrant fervor, racism, and anti-LGBTQ feelings are rampant, and many attendees are facing multiple grievances. Kenya Hutton, a Black gay man and president of the Center for Black Equity, said, 'We have so many different identity prides here in D.C., from Black Pride to Trans Pride to API Pride, Latinx Pride, Military Pride, Women's Pride, Silver Pride.' Frankie Miranda, the first openly gay president and CEO of the Hispanic Federation, urged Pride events to take a more political approach and have direct calls to action, including looking to the 2026 elections. Susan Appleton, professor of women, gender, and sexuality studies, said, 'It's not sufficient to look at race alone or gender alone or sexuality alone but all those factors.' Dee Tum-Monge, a board member for the Latinx History Project, said organizers are concerned about security and will be watching for international participants who may face obstacles traveling. The event will feature various activities, including the 'Freedom to Be' quilt project, which aims to raise awareness of the transgender community, and the Cirque du Slay Ball, a celebration of community and safe spaces.

**Kwon Young-guk: 'I will be a president with allies for LGBTQ+ individuals'**
Democratic Labor Party presidential candidate Kwon Young-guk announced on May 17 that he will be a 'president with allies' for LGBTQ+ individuals. Kwon emphasized that the current society still discriminates and hates LGBTQ+ individuals, and that extreme right-wing forces have been spreading exclusion and conspiracy theories about them. He criticized politicians who use anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric to gain popularity and said that conservative politicians have not distanced themselves from discriminatory forces. Kwon stated that as a result, LGBTQ+ individuals have been marginalized and excluded from society, and that they are now invisible in Korea. He emphasized that in times of democratic crisis, LGBTQ+ individuals have protected democracy, and that they were the ones who first held a protest in front of the presidential office in 2022. Kwon concluded by saying that democracy must now protect LGBTQ+ individuals and guarantee them equal lives, and that the next president must be one who stands with LGBTQ+ individuals, not one who hates or neglects them.

**This progressive actor describes the unlikely political evolution that drove him to Donald Trump**
Yuval David, a gay, progressive American-Israeli actor and activist, has made a surprising decision to vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. David, who has been a lifelong Democrat, felt excluded and unrepresented by the Democratic Party, particularly after experiencing anti-Jewish racism and physical abuse at an LGBTQ pride march in Washington, D.C. He believes that the Democratic Party has failed to acknowledge and address anti-Jewish racism, whereas the Trump administration has been more vocal in its fight against it. David also disputes claims that Trump is an anti-LGBTQ+ president, citing his administration's efforts to decriminalize homosexuality and appoint an openly gay person to a cabinet-level position. He argues that the LGBTQ movement has become too far-left and has forced uniformity and conformity, rather than promoting inclusion and diversity.

**Tim Walz says he may run for president in 2028 -- despite failure of Harris campaign: 'Do whatever it takes'**
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has expressed interest in running for president in 2028, despite his failed 2024 vice presidential campaign alongside Kamala Harris. When asked about a potential presidential run, Walz said, 'If I think I could offer something... I would certainly consider that.' He also stated, 'I'll do whatever it takes.' Walz, 60, has not ruled out running for a third term as governor in 2026, but has ruled out seeking the retiring Democratic US Sen. Tina Smith's seat in 2026. He reflected on the 2024 election, saying, 'An old white guy who ran for vice president, you'll land on your feet pretty well. But I still struggle with it... when I see Medicaid cuts happening, when I see LGBTQ folks being demonized, when I see some of this happening, that's what weighs on me personally.'

**'Positive step for football': Fifa boss defends Saudi Arabia World Cup**
Fifa president Gianni Infantino defended the decision to award the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia, calling it 'a very positive step for football'. He stated that the decision was made at a Fifa Congress, where the entire world was united. Infantino emphasized the importance of bringing all countries together, citing future World Cup hostings in North America (2026), South America, Africa, and Europe (2030), before returning to Asia in 2034. The decision was criticized due to concerns over Saudi Arabia's human rights record and treatment of migrant laborers and LGBTQ+ individuals.

**Pete Buttigieg already has his eye on running for president in 2028**
Out transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg is considering running for Michigan's U.S. Senate seat or taking another shot at the presidency in 2028. According to the Associated Press (AP), Buttigieg has been speaking with party officials, labor leaders, and top strategists about his next move. His decision could determine the rest of his political career. Buttigieg's interest in Michigan's Senate seat is well-known, but it's unlikely he would run just to turn around and start a presidential campaign soon after. Jason Roe, a Republican strategist, doubts Buttigieg would enter the 2028 presidential race 'because if he runs and loses, he could be done.' However, living in Michigan could help shore up public support if he decides to run for Senate. Aaron Wright, president of the local LGBTQ+ group Up North Pride, said the Buttigiegs are 'sacrificing their physical safety for the betterment of their local area, the state and society.' David Axelrod, former chief strategist of President Barack Obama, called Pete Buttigieg 'one of the most talented people in the party,' and said he would be a 'frontline candidate in any race that he ran.'

**Run for Senate or president? Buttigieg weighs decision with huge implications for Democrats**
Pete Buttigieg, the 43-year-old former U.S. transportation secretary, is considering a run for the U.S. Senate in Michigan or the presidency in 2028. Allies believe he has the tools to lead the Democratic Party on a national scale, but his decision will be guided by the impact on his young family at a difficult cultural moment in Trump's America. Buttigieg's decision is also influenced by safety concerns for members of the LGBTQ+ community and other prominent Democrats in the current political environment. He has been a more visible presence in his new home of Traverse City, Michigan, but some warn of the potential risks of running in a state with a history of anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment. 'I don't think you can run for Senate in 2026 and run for president in 2028... I would think that would be very, very hard,' said Obama's former chief strategist David Axelrod. 'He would be a frontline candidate in any race that he ran,' Axelrod added. Buttigieg's allies, including Sen. Debbie Stabenow and former Rep. Annie Kuster, believe he would be a strong candidate and are urging him to run. However, some critics argue that he moved to Michigan solely to help his political career and that his decision to run would be a challenge to his opponents.

**Buttigieg weighs a decision with huge implications for Democrats: Run for Senate or president?**
Pete Buttigieg, the 43-year-old former U.S. transportation secretary, is considering a run for the U.S. Senate in Michigan or the presidency in 2028. Allies believe he cannot feasibly do both, citing the difficulty of running for Senate in 2026 and president in 2028. Buttigieg has the tools to lead his party on a national scale, boasting a massive social media following, a national donor network, and a Midwestern charm. However, his decision will be guided by the impact on his young family, who are openly gay and have been targeted by Republican President Donald Trump. Buttigieg has been a more visible presence in his new home of Traverse City, Michigan, but some warn of safety concerns for members of the LGBTQ+ community and other prominent Democrats in the current political environment. A plum opportunity in a key state, Michigan offers a home state advantage to any prospective presidential candidate in 2028 and a rare Senate vacancy ahead of next year's midterms. Buttigieg is leaning on powerful allies to help make his decision, including longtime Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who considers him a close friend and says he'd be a 'very strong' candidate.

She cites the 1912 Progressive Party, led by Theodore Roosevelt, as inspiration for her new party. Satalino's platforms are driven by her personal experiences, including being a lesbian and witnessing the impact of corporate lobbying on queer rights. She hopes to be a force for change, saying, 'I want to get my message out there that this world needs to be changed and we will be able to change it.'

**Kamala Harris needs a running mate and it's not going to be Pete Buttigieg - LGBTQ Nation**
Vice President Kamala Harris is searching for a running mate for the 2024 election, and it won't be Pete Buttigieg, according to LGBTQ Nation. Harris has a long history of supporting the LGBTQ+ community, including officiating same-sex weddings in San Francisco in 2004. She has stated that LGBTQ+ rights will be central to her administration's work. Harris is looking for a running mate who will partner in the fight for fundamental freedoms, including the freedom to love openly and with pride. The contenders for the vice presidential spot include Tim Walz, Andy Beshear, Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro, and Mark Kelly. Harris has already earned the LGBTQ+ vote, and a Black/gay ticket would be a bridge too far for too many undecided voters. The final pick will need to complement Harris and balance a winning ticket.
