**New Pope Elected: Pope Leo XIV Takes Office**
The new Pope, Pope Leo XIV, was elected on the second day of the conclave after the fourth round of voting. The successful completion of the election was signaled by the white smoke rising from the Sistine Chapel's chimney. Cardinal Protodeacon Domenico Mamberti announced the official result from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, saying 'Habemus Papam'. Robert Prevost, born in Chicago, has a rich experience in missionary work in Peru. Before his election, he served as the Prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops and was appointed as a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2023. His reputation as a moderate reformer and advocate for inclusivity may influence the future development of the Catholic Church. The new Pope takes office at a time when the Church is facing several challenges, including internal ideological disagreements, issues of sexual abuse, and global crises such as wars and climate change. Special attention will be paid to strengthening unity within the Church, particularly in the United States, where there are political disagreements among bishops. Pope Leo XIV succeeded Pope Francis, who died on April 21, 2025, at the age of 88, after a long illness. Francis, the first pontiff from Latin America, was known for his progressive stance on issues of migration, LGBT+ inclusion, and climate change. His legacy and appointed cardinals have had a significant impact on the selection of the new Pope.

**Debunking the Fake Video: Pope Leo XIV's Non-Existent Criticism of Trump and Traoré**
A video claiming to show Pope Leo XIV criticizing US President Donald Trump and Burkina Faso's Junta-Chief Ibrahim Traoré has been debunked as a deepfake by Deutsche Welle. The video, which was shared on social media platforms, uses a morphing technique to combine the Pope's lip movements with a KI-generated audio track. Vatican News confirmed that the video is fake and that the Pope never made such statements. The video was created to promote Traoré and uses elements of real events, but the situations and dialogues are entirely fictional. The Pope's official website and Vatican News provide accurate information about his speeches, addresses, and texts. The video's creators used a Chicago accent and a slight lip movement error to make it seem more realistic. Additionally, the video shows the Pope holding an Italian peace flag, not an LGBTQ flag, which has been misinterpreted by some. Deutsche Welle urges viewers to be cautious of deepfakes and to verify information through trusted sources.

**Community Discusses Topics for New Pope Leo XIV**
The community on Facebook and Instagram has been discussing the topics that Pope Leo XIV should address during his papacy. The most discussed topics were the role of women in the church and the acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals and diverse family models. Some users expressed a desire for female priests or deacons, while others called for the recognition of queer families and various family models. @peronospora_77 wrote, 'I wish that he would make women in the church so equal that they could participate in the next conclave.' Another user, @stefaniesandkuhler, requested that the church recognize families with children born through reproductive medicine and families with children living with grandparents or other relatives. However, not all users shared these views, with some expressing concerns that these demands do not align with biblical teachings. @stephanvs_h87 wrote, 'I'm not sure which kind of Christianity you're following.' On the other hand, @stina_van_loewenherz countered, 'I'm Catholic, but I believe in freedom to change and live one's faith as they see fit.' Many users expressed a desire for the new pope to maintain continuity with tradition and uphold the central roles of liturgy, marriage, and family in the church. @Eduardz.1 wrote, 'I wish that the pope would lead the church in the same way as John Paul II and Benedict, close to the people but also remembering the church's teachings and history.'

**A God Who Does Not Exclude: The Need for the Church to Change**
The article discusses the need for the Church to overcome its attitude of rejection and prejudice towards LGBTQ+ believers. The author highlights the suffering and difficulties faced by individuals who have been discriminated against and excluded from their families, communities, and even the Church itself. The article quotes the Pope's message 'todos, todos, todos' (all, all, all) and notes that it was understood differently by different people, with some seeing it as a threat and others as a source of hope. The author argues that the Church should be a place of truth, love, freedom, justice, and peace, but instead, it often reflects the same dynamics of exclusion found in society. The article presents a collection of testimonies from the book 'Testimonios de un Dios que no extraña' (Testimonies of a God who does not exclude), which reveal the fear and struggle faced by LGBTQ+ individuals who have tried to live their faith. The author concludes that the Church needs to change its attitude and become a place of acceptance and respect for all people, regardless of their orientation or identity.

**Cardinal: Conclave Began Long Before the Actual Election**
According to Belgrade Cardinal Ladislav Nemet, the conclave that led to the election of Pope Leo XIV was the result of a long preparation process that began two years ago. Nemet stated in an interview with 'Vatican News' that during the 2023 and 2024 world synods, the question was raised of how to proceed after Pope Francis, who 'moved so much new in the Church'. The conclave itself was 'the last point of a process that begins much earlier', said Nemet. The cardinals were able to learn from each other and develop a common understanding thanks to modern communication tools, and they also had opportunities for exchange between the death of Pope Francis and the conclave. 'It was not the case that there was a central group of Italians, a central group of South Americans, and so on. We had widely dispersed cardinals who could all talk to each other well,' said Nemet. The cardinals have expressed a desire to meet at least once a year, and they have already requested a detailed program for their meetings to prepare for the topics they will discuss. This would also allow the Curia to 'prepare the papal side' so that the meetings can be fruitful for the entire Church, said Nemet.

**Community Wishes for New Pope Leo XIV: Inclusion, Tradition, and Synodality**
The community is discussing the wishes for the new Pope, Leo XIV. Some users are calling for a more inclusive approach to family, such as recognizing queer families, adoptive families, and families formed through reproductive medicine. Others are expressing a desire for a stronger emphasis on tradition and the 'Old Mass'. @stefaniesandkuhler writes, 'I ask that queer families with their children, adoptive families, foster families, and children living in youth groups be recognized as a family.' However, not all users share these views, with some expressing concerns that these demands do not align with the Bible. @stephanvs_h87 says, 'I'm not sure what kind of Christianity you're following?' while @stina_van_loewenherz responds, 'I'm Catholic, but always with room for change. Everyone should be able to live out their faith as they see fit, as long as no one is restricted.' Some users are also calling for a strengthening of the 'Old Mass' and more synodality, while others want the Pope to stop the Synodal Way in Germany. Petra Ferone writes, 'He should spread the Gospel, that's his job.' Edi Arnold adds, 'I hope he listens to the voice and word of God, not the noise around him...' Liane Kever wishes for the Pope to remain 'as kind as he is now.' Regardless of what the Pope decides, Karin Braun writes, 'I don't wish for anything from him, but I wish for him to have a 'listening heart' so he can lead the Church safely and distinguish between good and evil.'

**The Timid Pope: Leo XIV's Lack of Courage**
The new Pope, Leo XIV, has been criticized for his cautious approach and lack of courage in addressing social issues. Unlike his predecessor, Pope Francis, who challenged traditions and supported marginalized groups, Leo XIV has been accused of avoiding controversy and promoting a 'traditional family' agenda. The article suggests that Leo XIV is more concerned with avoiding criticism from conservative groups than with taking a bold stance on issues such as LGBTQ+ rights and social justice. The author compares Leo XIV unfavorably to Pope Leo XIII, who was known for his progressive views and ability to adapt to the modern era. The article concludes that the Catholic Church will need to find a new path forward if it wants to survive in the 21st century, and that Leo XIV's approach is not the right one.

**New Pope's Stance on LGBTQ+ Community Sparks Debate**
The new Pope has stated that 'homosexuality is a sin' in regards to the LGBTQ+ community within the Catholic Church. This stance reflects his pragmatic approach, as seen in his regional treatment of policies. During a meeting in October 2024, Pope León XIV acknowledged the 'unique cultural challenges' faced by African bishops in applying Vatican policies on same-sex marriage. He stated, 'In Africa, our cultural reality is different [...] the application is not viable,' referring to countries where anti-homosexuality laws persist.

**Catholic Church Elects New Pope: Robert Francis Prevost**
The Catholic Church has a new pope, Robert Francis Prevost, who was elected by the conclave in the Vatican after a two-day process. The white smoke rose from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel at 13:08 on this Thursday. The 69-year-old American will take on the name Leão 14 and succeed the late Pope Francisco, who passed away on April 21. The new pope will face numerous challenges, including mediating between different factions within the Church, which has diverse cultural sensitivities. He will have to address issues such as immigration, the role of laity and women, and the Church's stance on LGBTQ+ issues. The 267th successor of Saint Peter inherits a Church with 1.4 billion followers, with an uneven geographical distribution, expanding in the southern hemisphere but declining in Europe. According to the Church's 2023 data, there were 406,996 priests worldwide, a 0.2% decrease from 2022. The number of priests is increasing in Africa and Asia, but decreasing in other regions.

**The Ultimate Father Figure**
Pope Francis will be remembered for his kind and loving personality, as well as his efforts to promote sustainability and inclusivity within the Catholic Church. He urged world leaders to act with 'courage, honesty, and responsibility' and committed the Vatican to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. He also changed the tone of the Church's engagement with LGBTQ+ people, saying 'Who am I to judge?' and promoting love and acceptance. He met with trans people, invited same-sex couples to the Vatican, and expressed support for civil unions. Pope Francis was a humble leader who refused to live in the papal palace and instead lived in a modest guesthouse, treating others with respect. His legacy will be one of love, mercy, and walking with Christ. As Angela Cardoza, a nun and educator, said, 'He reminded us that to be holy is to be human first. His kindness gave us courage to be kinder too.'

**Papst-Nachfolge: Who will be the next Pope?**
The Catholic Church is preparing for the election of a new Pope after the death of Pope Francis. 135 cardinals will gather to choose the next leader, with over 100 cardinals excluded due to age. The favorite to become the next Pope is Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who has been the second-in-command in the Vatican for over a decade. Parolin has a mixed record on LGBTQ+ issues, saying 'I was very sad about the result' of Ireland's vote to legalize same-sex marriage in 2013, but also meeting with LGBTQ+ activists in 2019. Other potential candidates include Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, who has been critical of the Church's treatment of LGBTQ+ people, and Cardinal Péter Erdö, who is considered a conservative and has been critical of Pope Francis' reforms. The election is expected to be a contentious one, with many cardinals holding different views on LGBTQ+ issues.

**LGBTQ Catholics hoping Pope Francis' progression continues**
LGBTQ Catholics are hoping that the progress made by Pope Francis will continue under his successor. During his time as Pope, Francis expressed support for gay priests, stating 'being homosexual isn’t a crime,' and allowed priests to bless same-sex couples, a significant change in Vatican policy. However, McNeill from Dignity Twin Cities worries that this progress could be undone, saying 'That would be very hard for us.' Bishop Barron noted that there may be differences in emphasis and style, but emphasized that the Catholic Church should not be seen as 'lurching from one political view to the other.' McNeill and Dignity Twin Cities will be watching closely as a new pope is selected, hoping for further changes to Vatican policy and greater support for the LGBTQ community in the Catholic Church.

**Pope Francis Approves Three-Year Reform Process for the Catholic Church**
Pope Francis has approved a three-year process to consider reforms for the Catholic Church, according to the Vatican. This move indicates that the 88-year-old Pope plans to continue despite his hospitalization. The process will involve consultations with Catholics worldwide and will culminate in a new meeting in 2028. The Pope has extended the work of the Synod of Bishops, a central initiative of his papacy, which has discussed reforms such as the possibility of women serving as deacons, better inclusion of LGBTQ individuals in the Church, and the involvement of laity in governance and decision-making. 'The Holy Father is helping to drive the renewal of the Church towards a new missionary impulse,' said Cardinal Mario Grech, the ecclesiastical responsible for the reform process. 'This is truly a sign of hope.' The Pope's health remains stable, according to the Vatican's latest medical update.

**Pope Francis Approves Reform Project for the Future of the Church**
Pope Francis has approved the implementation of his reform project for the future of the Church, according to the Vatican. The 88-year-old pope has been hospitalized since February 14 with bronchitis and bilateral pneumonia. 'The Holy Father's clinical condition remains stable, confirming the progress shown in the last week,' said the latest medical report. However, it is still unknown when he will be discharged. Despite his 'gradual improvement', doctors recommended that he remain hospitalized to continue with his respiratory and motor physiotherapy, especially since he still needs oxygen at night. The Vatican announced that the pope approved the launch of the implementation process of the Synod 'For a Synodal Church. Communion, participation, mission,' which will conclude in October 2028 in Rome. The Synod aims to reorganize the formation of priests, increase the involvement of laypeople, and intensify the fight against sexual violence. However, the document left open several topics, including the ordination of women as deacons and the inclusion of LGBTQ+ individuals. The conclusions of the Synod are expected in June. In a letter to bishops around the world, Cardinal Mario Grech announced the start of the implementation phase of the recommendations, which will include an evaluation in 2027 before the final assembly in 2028. The announcement comes as doubts about the continuity of the first Latin American pope increase due to his health problems. Despite this, Pope Francis has dismissed rumors of resignation.

**Pope Francis Continues Project on Church's Future from Hospital Bed**
Pope Francis has approved the continuation of his project on the future of the Church from his hospital bed, according to the Vatican. This move comes as concerns about his health have grown, with the Pope being hospitalized since February 14 for respiratory problems. Despite a recent health setback, Francis has been gradually recovering and has resumed his work, including physical therapy sessions. The project, 'For a Synodal Church: Communion, Participation, Mission', aims to reorganize the formation of priests and increase the involvement of laity in the selection of bishops. The project also emphasizes the need to combat violence by clergy members, particularly against women and the LGBTQ+ community. The implementation phase of the project will begin in 2025, with a review scheduled for 2027 before the final assembly in 2028. As Francis continues to recover, he has dismissed rumors of his resignation, unlike his predecessor Benedict XVI, who stepped down in 2013.

**Pope Francis Initiates Church Reform Process Despite Health Concerns**
Pope Francis has approved a three-year process to review reforms for the global Catholic Church, which will culminate in a 'Church Assembly' (ital. Assemblea Ecclesiale) in October 2028 at the Vatican. The assembly will be preceded by a preparatory process, according to Cardinal Mario Grech, General Secretary of the Synod, in a letter to bishops and patriarchs on Saturday. The call for the assembly by the Pope is seen as a sign that the 88-year-old Pontiff intends to remain in office despite his poor health. The reforms to be discussed at the assembly include the possibility of women serving as Catholic deacons and better inclusion of LGBTQ individuals in the Church. The Synod will now conduct consultations with Catholics worldwide over the next three years before a new summit takes place in 2028. 'The Holy Father is helping to drive the renewal of the Church towards a new missionary impulse. This is truly a sign of hope,' said Cardinal Grech. The Pope has been in the hospital for over a month and his long public absence has sparked speculation that he may decide to follow his predecessor Benedict XVI and resign as Pope. However, his close associates and biographers have ruled out a resignation by Francis. The call for the Church Assembly suggests that the Argentine will continue despite his advanced age and poor health after a bilateral pneumonia. Recent medical reports from the Vatican indicate that his condition has improved and he is no longer in immediate danger. However, it is unclear when he will be discharged from the hospital.
