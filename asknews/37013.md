**Starlink Expands in the Gulf Region, Bringing High-Speed Internet to Remote Areas**
Starlink, a satellite internet service provided by SpaceX, has been making waves in the Gulf region. The service, which was first introduced in the region in 2022, offers high-speed internet connectivity to remote areas. According to Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, the service has been adopted by several countries in the region, including Bahrain, which became the first Gulf country to grant a license to Starlink in 2022. The service has also been used by Qatar Airways to provide free internet to passengers on board their flights. However, the service is not without its challenges, including high subscription fees and equipment costs. Despite these challenges, Starlink remains a crucial technology for various industries, including autonomous driving, robotics, and smart cities. The service is expected to continue to expand in the region, with Saudi Arabia being the latest country to adopt it.

**Elon Musk Offers Free Internet: Starlink to Connect Smartphones Without Cost Until July 2025**
Elon Musk announced that some smartphone models will be able to connect to the Starlink satellite internet network for free until July 2025. This initiative aims to eliminate barriers to internet access in rural, remote, or areas with poor infrastructure, allowing more people to connect without relying on traditional mobile phone networks. Starlink, developed by SpaceX, has been recognized for its ability to provide connectivity in areas where terrestrial networks do not reach. The new feature will allow users in remote areas without access to traditional mobile networks to send text messages, share their location, and even contact emergency services without the need for a nearby mobile phone tower. This improvement will make a significant difference in rural areas and other remote regions where internet connections are limited or non-existent. However, not all devices will have access to this free service, and it will depend on the device model and software update installed. 'T-Mobile SpaceX' will appear on the screen when the phone connects to the Starlink satellite network. It is essential to note that devices must have the latest software version installed to access this network. Initially, this connectivity will only allow text messaging, location sharing, and emergency service contact. In a second phase, the functionality is expected to expand to include voice calls and internet navigation, increasing the utility of the Starlink network.

**Digital Pakistan or Digital Pause? Starlink Awaits a Will While the Region Finds a Way**
Pakistan has been stuck in regulatory limbo with SpaceX's Starlink, despite announcing and retracting timelines for the service. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has given Starlink a temporary registration, but a full license will not be issued until the company secures permanent registration and clears technical and security checks. In contrast, neighboring countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India have approved Starlink, with Bangladesh granting a pair of ten-year operating licenses and Sri Lanka issuing a national service-provider license. India has taken a pragmatic approach, partnering with local giants while capping license tenure. Pakistan's regulators say they are being thorough, but the delay has real-world costs, with over half of the country's citizens still having no fixed broadband. The regional scorecard is stark, with Pakistan being the outlier. As one expert notes, 'where there is a will, there is a way, but in Pakistan, it's just delay.'

**Elon Musk Announces Starlink Availability in Oman**
Elon Musk announced on Thursday that his satellite internet service 'Starlink' is now available in Oman. According to the Omani Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, it has granted a license to Starlink Muscat to provide broadband internet services in Oman using satellite communications systems. The service will cover all geographic areas of Oman, including areas with full service speeds of up to 100 Mbps, as well as innovative solutions for connecting communication towers in difficult terrain, which will contribute to the digital transformation, in addition to serving various economic sectors such as oil and gas, mining, tourism, and agriculture. The launch of the service will have several benefits, including: promoting competition among licensed telecommunications companies, providing multiple options for beneficiaries, improving quality and speed, and providing an enhanced environment for a digital community, as well as serving various business sectors. Anyone, natural or legal, who wants to obtain these services will benefit from Starlink services. The Sultanate of Oman issued a royal decree on June 20, 2023, granting a first-class license to Starlink Muscat and establishing and operating a satellite communications system to provide public fixed telecommunications services. Oman was the first country in the Middle East to announce the launch of satellite internet in 2024. Starlink is the world's first and largest satellite constellation using a low Earth orbit to provide broadband internet capable of supporting streaming, online gaming, video calls, and more, according to its official website. The network provides high-speed internet and shorter data transfer times between the user and the satellite for users around the world. According to the website, most internet services come from a single satellite that orbits the Earth at a distance of 35,786 kilometers. As a result, the time it takes to transfer data between the user and the satellite takes a long time, making it almost impossible to support streaming, online gaming, video calls, or other high-data-rate activities.

**Starlink's Quest to Bring Satellite Internet to Nepal**
Elon Musk's company, Starlink, has been trying to get permission to operate in Nepal for the past two years. The company has been in talks with the regulatory body, Nepal Telecommunications Authority, and has presented a demo of its service. However, the main issue is that the existing law requires a minimum of 20% local participation, which Starlink is not willing to comply with. The company has already been granted a license to operate in India, where there is no such requirement. In Bhutan, Starlink has been operating since 2014, but the service is only available to a limited number of users due to its high cost. In other South Asian countries, such as Maldives, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, Starlink has been granted licenses to operate, but the service is not yet available. The Nepali government is studying the possibility of amending the existing law to allow foreign companies like Starlink to operate in the country. Meanwhile, Chinese companies are also interested in providing satellite-based internet services in Nepal.

OneWeb plans to establish earth station gateways in Mehsana, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu, and will offer satellite broadband services in several South and Southeast Asian nations, including Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. This move comes as Elon Musk's Starlink is set to launch its satellite broadband service in India soon.
