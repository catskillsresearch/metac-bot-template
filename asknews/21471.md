**UK Prime Minister: Russia has shown no seriousness about peace, and we must be prepared**
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said, 'Russia has shown in recent weeks that it is not serious about achieving peace.' He emphasized that the international community 'must be prepared to face the consequences of this escalating position.' Sunak explained that 'recent Russian actions, both militarily and diplomatically, clearly indicate that the Kremlin lacks the genuine will to end the conflict through peaceful means.' This, he said, requires the UK and its allies to 'strengthen their political and defense preparations in the coming period.' Sunak also stated that 'everything we do today will strengthen NATO's power. We will never fight alone, and we will continue to take on more responsibilities in joint defense.' He added that the UK 'is developing new capabilities within its borders, which reflects the strengthening of its allies in Europe and beyond.' The Prime Minister announced plans to establish six new ammunition factories in the country, aiming to boost military readiness and enhance autonomous defense capabilities. He also revealed a £15 billion investment plan to develop sovereign nuclear capabilities, describing it as 'a fundamental guarantee of our security and defense against complex threats.' Sunak concluded by saying, 'It is time to renew our country, our investments, and our defenses, because our security is no longer a choice, but a national necessity.'

**Baerbock Set to Become UN General Assembly President**
Annalena Baerbock, the former German Foreign Minister, is set to be elected as the President of the UN General Assembly. Baerbock has promised to serve all 193 member states, big and small, as an honest mediator and unifying force. She has also vowed to take a more diplomatic tone in her new role, unlike her previous time as Foreign Minister, where she was known for her strong stance against Russia. Baerbock will take office at a time when the UN is facing immense financial pressure, partly due to the Trump administration's cuts. She has pledged to drive reforms and use the General Assembly's resources efficiently. Her priorities include achieving the UN's sustainability goals, combating climate change, and promoting gender equality. The election is seen as a formality, but there is a possibility of a secret ballot if a country requests it. Russia has criticized Baerbock, accusing her of being biased and having 'eklatante Voreingenommenheit' (obvious bias). Baerbock was previously critical of Russia during the Ukraine war, which put her in Moscow's crosshairs. Originally, Helga Schmid was the preferred candidate for the role, but Baerbock's late candidacy after the German federal election was criticized.

**Yulia Navalnaya Launches New TV Channel to Promote Freedom of Expression in Russia**
Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and the organization 'Reporters Without Borders' plan to launch a new television channel called 'Future of Russia' to promote freedom of expression in Russia. The channel will be broadcast through the 'Svoboda' project, which uses a Russian-made satellite. The channel is set to launch on June 4, the anniversary of Navalny's birth, who died in 2024 at the age of 48, according to 'AFP'. 'Reporters Without Borders' previously launched a package of news channels for Russia, which are broadcast through satellites, with most of the content produced by Russian journalists who were forced to leave the country after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The 'Svoboda' package is available to 4.5 million subscribers in Russia and around 800,000 subscribers in occupied Ukrainian territories, according to 'Reporters Without Borders'. 'We created this concept together, but we only got the funding recently to make it possible,' said Jim Philipps, director of the 'Svoboda' project. 'Because there is no independent news in Russia, it is very important to have alternative viewpoints.' Philipps added that Russia relies on satellite TV for around 45% of its broadcasting, with most satellite TV coming from the French company Eutelsat, a partner in this project. The channel will include content produced by Navalny's team. Navalny, who was considered a 'radical' by the Russian authorities, died in a maximum-security prison in the Arctic in February 2024. His family and supporters claim that he was killed on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and his widow Yulia Navalnaya continues to fight from exile. Over the past decade, Navalny has been a thorn in the side of the Kremlin due to his reports and investigative journalism on corruption among officials. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, all forms of opposition were banned, and independent media were prohibited. With the imprisonment or exile of leading opposition figures, Navalny's legacy began to fade in Russia.

**Putin stages major war games on NATO's doorstep as submarine fires torpedoes at mock Western ship and Russia vows to conduct 'dozens' more naval drills this summer | Daily Mail Online**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has staged major war games on NATO's doorstep in the Baltic Sea, involving 20 warships and 3,000 service personnel. The drills aim to train for 'defence of naval bases' and counter marine drones and unmanned planes. Russia has vowed to conduct 'dozens' more naval drills this summer. The Baltic Fleet's military council stated, 'The efforts of the Baltic Fleet will be focused on securing the naval interests of the Russian Federation in the Baltic sea zone.' The drills come amid increasing tension between the West and Russia, with recent airspace violations by Putin's warplanes and the detention of a Greek-owned oil tanker by Russia. A Ukrainian official, Ivan Fedorov, said, 'These are the consequences of the enemy attack on the frontline village of the Pologovsky district.' The Russian strikes on civilians have resulted in the death of a nine-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy being wounded in the Zaporizhzhia region. The drills also come after Ukraine conducted a sabotage operation in Desantnaya Bay, Vladivostok, triggering explosions at the 155th Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Navy.

**Navalnaya Warns Against Negotiating with Putin: 'It's Meaningless'**
Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, warned that negotiating with Russian President Putin to end the Ukraine war is 'meaningless'. She stated, 'Even if you decide to negotiate with Putin, remember that he will lie and betray you.' Navalnaya also said that any agreement reached with Putin would have only two possible outcomes: either he would find a way to destroy the agreement if he remains in power, or the agreement would become meaningless if he loses power. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the leader of the Belarusian opposition, expressed her support for Ukraine's position in the negotiations, stating that 'by letting Ukraine have the upper hand in these negotiations, Belarus, Moldova, and other countries will also be in a favorable position.' She also warned that if Ukraine does not emerge victorious after the war, 'Putin will still be strong enough to maintain his influence over Belarus.' The US push for a negotiated end to the war has been a major focus of the Munich Security Conference, with several European foreign ministers warning that the outcome of the negotiations will have significant implications for global security, including the situation in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.

Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, warned that 'there is no sense in trying to negotiate' with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. 'Even if you decide to negotiate with Putin, just remember that he will lie,' she said at the Munich Security Conference two days before the first anniversary of Navalny's death. 'He will betray you, change the rules at the last minute, and make you play by his rules.' Navalnaya explained that there are only two possible outcomes for any deal with Putin: 'If he remains in power, he will find a way to break the agreement. If he loses power, the agreement will become meaningless.' Navalnaya spoke at the conference alongside Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a leader of the Belarusian opposition. Tsikhanouskaya said, 'By helping Ukraine, you are helping the entire region.' She added that if Ukraine does not emerge victorious after the war, 'Putin will still be strong enough to maintain his influence on Belarus.' 'By putting Ukraine in a strong position during these negotiations, you are also putting Belarus, Moldova, and other countries in a strong position,' Tsikhanouskaya said.
