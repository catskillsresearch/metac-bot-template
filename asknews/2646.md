**Neuroscientist Predicts 'Mind Uploading' Will Become a Reality in the Future**
Neuroscientist Dobromir Rahnev believes that the idea of 'mind uploading', or transferring human consciousness into a computer, will become a reality one day. However, he notes that current technology is not yet advanced enough to achieve this goal. According to Rahnev, the human brain is the most complex structure in the universe, and copying it digitally is a daunting task. Not only would the brain's entire structure need to be digitized, but also all the sensory inputs it is accustomed to, such as sight, sound, touch, smell, and movement. Rahnev estimates that it would take a supercomputer with the necessary processing power and information to simulate these systems. Currently, scientists are unable to create a digital simulation of even a small part of the brain. Rahnev believes that it may take 100 years or more for the technology to advance to the point where mind uploading is possible. However, he is optimistic that it could happen within 200 years.

**Is Mind Uploading Possible? The Quest to Transfer Human Consciousness into a Computer**
The idea of uploading human consciousness into a computer, also known as mind uploading, is gaining attention among scientists. In theory, it is possible to scan and transfer all the information and connections in our brains to a digital platform, creating a digital copy of our being. However, the biggest challenge is that the brain is incredibly complex, with 86 billion neurons and trillions of connections. Currently, scientists can only fully map the brain of a fruit fly, and the process would take much longer for the human brain. Additionally, neurons do not work in a fixed manner; they are constantly changing, learning, and responding. Therefore, it is not enough to just 'take a picture' of the brain; we also need to replicate its dynamic functioning. Two approaches are being considered in the scientific community: one is to scan the entire brain, down to the atomic level, and create a simulation. The other is to understand how the brain works and replicate only what is necessary. However, the latter approach still leaves many questions unanswered, such as 'how does the brain think?' and 'how does consciousness arise?' Furthermore, for the digital transfer of consciousness, it is also necessary to perfectly simulate senses such as sight, touch, and hearing, otherwise the individual would be left in a state of complete darkness or silence, leading to serious psychological problems. Today, this technology is still far away, and even a single neuron's artificial version has not been produced. However, considering the rapid progress of technology, it is possible that this technology could become a reality in the future. Some futurists, such as Ray Kurzweil, predict that this technology could be available by 2045, while more cautious scientists estimate that it could take at least 100-200 years.

**Mind Uploading: A Theoretical Possibility, but a Long Way to Go**
According to Dr. Dobromir Rahnev, a neuropsychologist from the Georgia Institute of Technology, the idea of 'Mind Uploading', or transferring human consciousness into a computer, is theoretically possible. However, the process would require a simulated version of the world for the consciousness to interact with. The complexity of the human brain, with its 86 billion neurons, is one of the biggest challenges in achieving this goal. Researchers have made initial steps in brain mapping, but a detailed 3D model of the human brain does not yet exist. Even if it were possible to scan all neural connections, the dynamics and interactions of these cells would need to be realistically simulated. Additionally, a digital consciousness would require a realistic simulation of the external world, including sensory experiences such as sight, sound, touch, and even breathing and blinking. The necessary computational power is currently beyond what is available, but technological advancements in AI and neuroinformatics are progressing rapidly. Some visionaries hope for breakthroughs that could make Mind Uploading possible by 2045, but a more realistic timeline is 100 to 200 years.

**Scientists: Uploading the Human Mind onto a Chip May be Possible within 20 Years**
Scientists believe that it may be possible to 'download' a human being in its entirety onto a chip within the next 20 years. According to Professor Dobromir Rahnev from the Department of Neuroscientific at Georgia Tech, the idea of 'uploading the mind' is becoming a serious concept. In this hypothetical digital existence, one could eat, drive a car, fly, or even travel between galaxies, thanks to a digital simulation of reality. While the idea is still purely theoretical, neuroscientists agree that it is possible, but we are still far from achieving it. The first condition for uploading the mind is the ability to scan the entire brain and create a precise three-dimensional map of the 86 billion neurons and trillions of connections between them. However, scientists have so far only been able to map the brain of a fly and some parts of a mouse's brain. The challenge goes beyond scanning, as it also requires modeling the behavior of each neuron, which changes constantly. No one knows exactly what level of detail is required to accurately simulate the brain: is it at the molecular level or deeper? Perhaps understanding how the brain works will make it easier to find solutions, like building a car from scratch instead of simulating an old one without understanding its components. However, currently, scientists cannot even replace one neuron with an artificial one. Despite the challenges, the rapid pace of technological progress, especially in artificial intelligence and computing, keeps this dream alive. Billionaires who dream of immortality are willing to fund ambitious research. While some estimates suggest that uploading the mind may be possible by 2045, other experts consider these predictions overly optimistic. It is more likely, according to some scientists, that we will not achieve this within the current century, but perhaps within the next 200 years.

**Virtual Model Replicates Human Body to Understand Cancer Evolution**
A virtual model has been created to replicate the human body and understand how cancer evolves. This model incorporates physical, molecular, emotional, and quality of life information. The goal is to predict how each case will evolve and, in the future, optimize clinical trials in real patients. Artificial intelligence and health are coming together to rethink oncology. The team in Spain is proposing something more ambitious: a digital copy of each patient that allows for real-time tracking of their changes. This development is led by the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), in conjunction with nine hospitals, two universities, and the CRIS Foundation against Cancer. The project aims to use the data from 150 women with metastatic breast, lung, or colon cancer to build models that will help others in the future. The 'digital twins' are replicas created with artificial intelligence that integrate different levels of information, from DNA to the subjective perception of the disease. Instead of applying the same treatment to all patients, this new tool seeks to give each patient what best suits their body, history, and evolution. The project is funded with 2.5 million euros and is part of the Precision Medicine Infrastructure (Impact) initiative of the Carlos III Health Institute. The team has already presented preliminary results at the European Congress of Medical Oncology (ESMO), where it was highlighted that remote monitoring of patients is reliable and the data obtained is robust enough to train predictive models. The research does not stop there. They are preparing to present new conclusions at the ASCO 2025 Congress in Chicago, considered the most important event in oncology. There, they plan to show how daily physical activity, emotional states, and other emotional indicators can anticipate the response to treatment. One of the most innovative aspects of the study is the inclusion of 'biological age' as a central parameter. Thanks to a model developed at the CNIO, it is possible to estimate if the patient's body is aging faster due to treatment, the type of tumor, or even emotional stress. This information would allow for better adjustment of therapy intensity and reduction of side effects in young people. 'Until now, two patients with the same diagnosis received exactly the same treatment. But in practice, they do not react the same way,' explained the CNIO team, according to a series of periodical publications. With the digital twins, they seek to have doctors test treatments first on a computational version of the body before applying them in reality. This type of innovation marks a paradigm shift in the way medicine is thought. No longer is it just about treating a disease, but about deeply understanding the person who suffers from it.

**Can the Human Brain be Digitally Transferred? The Future of Mind Uploading**
The idea of uploading human consciousness into a computer and living digitally is a concept that has been explored in science fiction, but it is theoretically possible. This concept is known as 'mind uploading' and would allow individuals to exist in a digital world, even without a physical body. However, the biggest obstacle to this is the human brain. Scientists consider the brain to be the most complex structure in the universe, with approximately 86 billion neurons and trillions of connections. Currently, only the brain of a fly has been fully mapped, and only small sections of a mouse's brain have been detailed. It could take decades to model the human brain at this scale, and even then, simulating how neurons change over time would be a significant challenge. When a person's mind is uploaded into a computer, not only would their thoughts be simulated, but also their senses, such as sight, sound, and touch, would need to be simulated. Without these senses, the mind could experience severe psychological problems, known as 'sensory deprivation,' which could be equivalent to torture over time. Therefore, a successful mind upload would require not only a highly accurate simulation of the brain but also of the environment and senses. Currently, neither computer power nor scientific knowledge has reached this level. While some scientists believe that this technology could be possible by 2045, considering the current pace of brain research, this date may be overly optimistic. Some experts even suggest that it may not be possible until the end of the 22nd century. However, given the rapid progress of technology, the possibility of achieving this goal in the next 200 years is not negligible. Moreover, billions of dollars have already been invested in research to achieve this goal.

**Scientists Explore the Path to Digital Immortality**
The human desire for immortality has led to the idea of transferring consciousness into a computer, which is now considered a hypothetical but potentially achievable path. The concept of 'mind uploading' involves transferring a person's personality into a digital environment, where they could 'save memories, awareness, and feelings' (Dobromir Rakhnev). Virtual life, according to this idea, would not only allow for the imitation of physical reality but also the realization of the impossible -- 'flying, passing through walls, or traveling to other planets.' The only condition is the accuracy of modeling the brain and its sensory connections. A neurobiologist researching perception is convinced that 'mind uploading will become a reality one day,' although we are still far from technical implementation. The biggest challenge is reproducing the complex structure of the brain, which consists of over 86 billion neurons and trillions of synaptic connections. Simply copying data is not enough -- each neuron adapts, and these changes also require modeling. The existence of a digital world without sensory interaction is a problem that cannot be ignored. Sensory deprivation, or isolation from external stimuli, is considered torture and causes serious psychological disorders. Therefore, simulating senses must be as realistic as possible. Even minor distortions can lead to neurotic states. Researchers are currently at the initial stages, trying to create a complete map of the brain -- a process that includes detailed 3D scanning. So far, achievements are limited to the brain of a fly or parts of a mouse brain. 'Mapping the human brain is like scanning a billion paper clips,' the author explains. However, even with a complete map, it is necessary to determine at what level to stop: cellular, molecular, or even deeper. Despite the futuristic nature of the idea, it is connected to numerous ethical dilemmas: from defining personality to the question of digital rights. Mind uploading is not only a technological but also a philosophical task that requires deep reflection.

**The First Person to Live Eternally May Be Born During Your Lifetime**
According to Omar Kardoudi, a scientist who studies brain perception and mental information transfer, it may be possible for the first person to live eternally during your lifetime. However, this person would not have a physical body. They would be able to perform all the tasks they do in real life, but in a simulated environment. Currently, scientists are struggling to understand the functioning of the brain, with 86 billion neurons and billions of connections that constantly adjust their functioning. It is unclear how many levels of complexity researchers need to reach to simulate a functioning brain. Kardoudi notes that even small distortions could have severe mental consequences, and that the current computational power is not sufficient to scan and map the 3D structure of the human brain. Nevertheless, he believes that the rapid advancements in computing power and artificial intelligence may make it possible to achieve this goal, potentially by 2045 or even sooner.

**Transferring the Human Mind to a Computer: A Theoretical Possibility**
As a neuroscientist, it is theoretically possible to transfer the human mind to a computer, but it would come with significant limitations. Jesus Díaz, a scientist who studies brain perception and information transfer, notes that 'the object most complex in the universe, the brain, needs the same inputs it has always had.' This means that a simulated brain would require a vast amount of computational power to function, equivalent to scanning and mapping the 3D structure of the entire human brain. Currently, researchers lack the necessary computational power to simulate even a small portion of the brain, such as a mouse's brain or a rat's brain. The human brain consists of 86 billion neurons and trillions of connections, making it difficult to determine how many levels of complexity the researchers need to reach to create a functioning simulated brain. 'It's difficult to know how many levels we need to descend to for the simulated brain to work,' Díaz says. 'Do we need to stop at the molecular level? 2045? 2145? Or later?' The development of artificial intelligence and computational power is accelerating, but it may take decades or even centuries to achieve the necessary level of complexity to simulate the human brain.

**If Dune Were Not Fiction: The Warning of Artificial Intelligence**
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in programming has sparked a literary warning: Frank Herbert's 'Dune'. The novel's theme of humans carrying the scars of the Butlerian Jihad, a war against thinking machines that nearly extinguished human autonomy, is eerily relevant. In response, all forms of artificial intelligence were prohibited, with the central dogma stating: 'You shall not make a machine in the likeness of the human mind.' As a result, humans evolved, with Mentats trained to reason like computers, and the Bene Gesserit perfected control over the body, genetics, and psychology. The analogy with the present is clear: while not a total replacement, AI has shifted the function of tasks, automating repetitive, analytical, and creative tasks. Programmers are now challenged to cultivate what AI still cannot replicate with authenticity: human thought and intention. This change represents a turning point, a call to move from being machine operators to strategic thinkers of computational thought. Those who adapt will not be replaced, but transformed. The future of development will not be solely about coding, but about curating thought, modeling intention, and guiding knowledge. It's not just about generating code, but about understanding why and for whom one is programming. Collaboration with intelligent systems will require systemic thinking and contextual awareness. The true power will not be in those who possess the tools, but in those who understand how and why to use them. The influence will be determined not by the amount of code written, but by the clarity of vision and ethical responsibility in applying technology.

**The Gap Between Human and Machine Math: A Simple Challenge Reveals the Power of AI**
A simple yet revealing mathematical challenge has highlighted the gap between the calculation capabilities of machines and the mental agility of humans. The expression 70 ÷ 7 × 5 + 9 - 2, seemingly harmless, has become a viral test that AI resolves in a fraction of a second, while a significant number of people struggle to find the correct answer. This contrast not only showcases the computational power of algorithms but also invites reflection on our own logical and mathematical reasoning skills in the digital era. The final result is 57, but many wonder how the Gemino tool made it so simple. According to the article, AI uses the PEMDAS method, which prioritizes operational hierarchy, taught in primary and secondary school, but often forgotten in daily life. The article also explains how AI has emerged as a powerful and versatile tool, extending its problem-solving capacity to traditionally human-dominated domains, such as mathematics. Various branches and models of AI have demonstrated effectiveness in addressing a wide range of challenges, from solving complex equations to demonstrating abstract theorems.

**Humans think  --  AI, not so much. Science explains why our brains aren't just fancy computers**
Researchers have found that the human brain is not just a network of undifferentiated brain cells, but rather a complex system with specialized neurons that play specific roles in encoding and representing our experiences. These neurons, such as concept cells, place cells, and time cells, are responsible for encoding entire concepts, memories, and experiences, and are not just a result of the distributed firing of many brain cells. This challenges the popular view of the brain as a sophisticated computer, and suggests that AI models may need to be reevaluated to better replicate human intelligence. Jay McClelland, a cognitive scientist, notes that AI models lack the predispositions of various parts of the human brain, and that the differences between human brains and artificial intelligence systems include how we learn and the necessary process of memory formation and retrieval. He suggests that our brains use far different learning algorithms than current deep learning systems, and that AI might do well to look back at how the world has shaped us to better replicate human intelligence.

**Scientists Improve AI by Imitating Human Brain Function**
A group of scientists has presented a new AI model that replicates the functioning of human memory to improve logical and intuitive reasoning in intelligent systems. The advance, published in the Engineering journal, proposes an architecture inspired by the human brain that can overcome structural limitations of current language models, such as ChatGPT. The new structure, called M2I framework (Machine Memory Intelligence), aims to transform the design of artificial neural networks through a distributed storage system, adaptive learning, and collaborative reasoning. This proposal arises as a response to the computational restrictions, catastrophic forgetting, and limited reasoning capacity of current AI. According to the scientists, the M2I framework is organized around four fundamental axes that allow for a more human-like thinking AI: 'This framework represents a revolution in the field of cognitive AI, integrating deeply studied concepts in neuroscience into computational engineering.' The implementation of the M2I framework opens the door to a new generation of intelligent systems, more efficient, interpretable, and capable of facing changing environments. With an AI inspired by the human brain, it will be possible to improve performance in sectors such as medicine, robotics, cybersecurity, and education, where adaptability and reasoning are fundamental.

**Texas A&M Researchers Mimic Brain Function to Build More Efficient AI Systems**
Researchers at Texas A&M University, led by Dr. Suin Yi, have developed a new approach to Artificial Intelligence (AI) called 'Super-Turing AI' that mimics the human brain's neural processes. This new AI system integrates learning and memory, unlike current systems that separate these processes and require immense computing power. According to Dr. Yi, 'These data centers are consuming power in gigawatts, whereas our brain consumes 20 watts. That's 1 billion watts compared to just 20.' The team's research aims to develop AI systems that require less computational power without compromising performance, making it a game-changer for the AI industry. 'We're going to make sustainable AI,' Dr. Yi said. 'Super-Turing AI could reshape how AI is built and used, ensuring that as it continues to advance, it does so in a way that benefits both people and the planet.'

**Why your brain can't be a computer -- even in theory**
Andrew F. Knight's new paper challenges the idea that the brain functions like a digital computer, arguing that the brain's storage capacity is insufficient to support conscious experience. Knight's information-theoretic analysis shows that the required memory space for a single second of conscious experience is approximately 200,000 bits of data, which would exceed the brain's capacity. Additionally, the brain's history-dependence, where consciousness builds upon prior experiences, creates an exponential increase in the amount of information required to represent them. This suggests that the brain cannot function as a classical computational device, and that the idea of reducing the mind to an algorithm or achieving human-like general intelligence through classical computing may be flawed. This raises questions about the nature of consciousness and intelligence, and what it means to be human.

**The Human Brain Faces Significant Challenges and Increasing Information Pressure**
The human brain is facing significant challenges and increasing information pressure. Despite the hype around artificial intelligence, the human brain remains the most efficient computational miracle on earth. It can perform an enormous number of calculations per second, but it only requires a small amount of energy, equivalent to a small light bulb in a refrigerator. The concept of 'brain capital' has emerged, which combines brain health, abilities, and skills. This concept is important for two reasons: first, since the industrial revolution, machines have replaced physical strength and routine mental tasks. A report by the World Economic Forum found that the percentage of activities performed by humans will decrease from 50% to 33% by 2030, meaning that human competitiveness will focus on advanced thinking. Second, with the increase in average life expectancy, government-defined retirement ages are no longer relevant in knowledge-based economies. Brain skills have become long-term investment assets, unlike physical strength, which declines with age. However, 'brain capital' faces significant challenges and increasing pressure. Mental illnesses, addiction, and various neurological disorders have cost the global economy $5 trillion annually. This amount is equivalent to the size of the entire German economy. The situation is expected to worsen, with costs projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030. According to the World Health Organization, depression has become the leading cause of disabilities worldwide, with a 89% increase since 1990. Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia have seen a dramatic increase of 161%. The problem is exacerbated across all age groups, with more people losing healthy years due to declining mental health during working years. Brain power faces another type of pressure. Dan Nixon, an expert in 'attention economics,' explains that our lives have become more distracting than ever, with apps competing for our attention and converting it into profits. The amount of digital data doubles every two years, with 2.5 quintillion bytes of data produced daily. Most of this data is available with a single click. A global study found that the time we spend in front of screens has increased from 9 hours daily in 2012 to 11 hours in 2019, with a two-hour increase in mobile phone use. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the increase. The human brain faces a significant challenge in dealing with the pressure on its attention, according to Thalys Texeira, a former Harvard Business School professor. Research has shown a significant increase in the cost of attracting consumers' attention. For example, the cost of 1,000 TV viewers during a Super Bowl or prime-time event in the US has increased dramatically, especially with the spread of the internet. While spending more time in front of screens may open up new avenues for accessing news, information, and entertainment, excessive exposure to content can lead to negative effects on focus and information processing ability. Dr. Mithu Storoni, author of 'The Efficiency Paradox,' warns that continuous exposure to an endless stream of information and notifications can lead to severe mental fatigue. Scientific research has shown a strong link between excessive information intake and brain health. Studies have found that excessive social media use is linked to increased rates of depression, especially among young people. Prolonged screen time can exacerbate symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The impact of digital technology extends beyond brain capital to the third and most important factor - skills. The irony is that these skills themselves are under significant pressure due to mental fatigue. Digital distractions impede creative thinking, while excessive information leads to burnout and a lack of adaptability. Nixon refers to the phenomenon of 'unconscious phone-grabbing,' where we reach for our phones without a clear reason, driven by a dopamine release from browsing digital content. A comprehensive survey of adult skills by the OECD found that advanced economies have seen a decline in reading and writing skills more than an improvement over the past decade. David Robson, a science writer and author of 'The Intelligence Paradox,' provides an analysis of this phenomenon, saying: 'Studies show that average IQ scores, which rose throughout the 20th century, have begun to decline or stabilize in many countries. Ultimately, the question remains: where are we headed? Despite increased access to information, improved global education levels, and better nutrition, trends in mental health, increasing pressure on attention, and factors that undermine critical thinking are a growing concern. We must recognize that the human brain is a valuable resource that needs continuous strengthening and development to support our well-being, growth, and innovation over the long term, especially in the face of increasing technological influence in our lives and economies.'

**Neuromorphic Computing:**
Neuromorphic computing is a groundbreaking approach to information processing that seeks to replicate the capabilities of the human brain. Unlike traditional computing methods, which depend on binary processing, neuromorphic computing uses artificial neurons and synapses to mimic the complex neural networks of the brain, enabling more efficient, intelligent, and adaptable systems. According to Carver Mead, a pioneer in the field of analog circuits and semiconductor technology, neuromorphic systems can perform highly parallel, event-driven computations, making them ideal for tasks such as machine learning, pattern recognition, and real-time data analysis. Mead's vision was to design circuits that functioned in a way that resembled biological neurons, enabling machines to process information in a more flexible and energy-efficient manner, as he said, 'replicate the brain's neural networks in hardware.'
