**'Free' Government Money Accounts For 19% Of All Personal Income**
Free government money, including Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, and Social Security, accounts for 19% of all personal income in the US. When adjusted for inflation, the numbers remain nearly identical. The US is facing a significant demographic shift, with a record number of people reaching the age of 65 by 2025, which will impact retirement planning, healthcare, and the economy. Social Security payments and Medicare costs are expected to skyrocket, while the number of replacement workers with skills is decreasing. The current path is unsustainable, and the latest tax bill is expected to add $22 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.

**87% of pharmacies sign up to free HRT scheme - IPU**
As of Friday afternoon, 87% of pharmacies in Ireland had signed up to the free hormone replacement therapy (HRT) scheme, according to Tom Murray, President of the Irish Pharmacy Union. Murray anticipates that more pharmacies will sign up over the weekend and into next week, with the goal of reaching 100% coverage. The scheme, which provides free HRT for women, was endorsed by the IPU following government commitments, including a review of the pharmacy fee structure. Murray praised Minister for Health Jennifer Carroll MacNeill for making the scheme free and resolving previous issues that were deterring pharmacists from signing up. He advised non-medical card holders to sign up for the drug payment scheme to access the medicine and encouraged women to speak to their pharmacist for more information.

**Australian actor raising money to cryogenically preserve teen son**
Australian actress Clare McCann is raising $300,000 to cryogenically preserve her 13-year-old son, Atreyu, who died by suicide on May 23 after months of bullying at his school. McCann blames the school for not taking adequate action against the bullies, saying 'This was not his fault. He was let down by the schooling system as he suffered horrendous amounts of bullying.' Southern Cryonics has agreed to freeze Atreyu's body, but there are no guarantees that future medical technology can bring him back. As of Friday, the fundraiser had raised just under $16,000.

**Azerbaijanis Turn to Cryonics for Possible Revival**
The Russian company 'КриоРус' is offering cryonic services, including the freezing of bodies, brains, and DNA, with the goal of possible revival in the future. The company has already signed contracts with several Azerbaijanis, including a woman who was cryopreserved in Russia after dying in Turkey. The company's director, Valeria Udalova, believes that cryonics is a life-affirming technology that should be available everywhere. She notes that the company has not seen any conflict between religion and cryonics, and that many people, including Muslims, are interested in the technology. The cost of cryopreservation is 3.8 million rubles, plus transportation costs. The company is planning to open new offices in China, India, and the UAE.

**After 13YO Son Took His Own Life, Desperate Mom Tries To Raise $195K To Freeze His Body**
Clare McCann, a mother from Australia, is trying to raise $195,000 to cryogenically preserve the body of her 13-year-old son, Atreyu, who took his own life after being bullied at school. McCann believes that cryonics, a process that freezes the body at extremely low temperatures, may offer a chance for her son to be revived in the future. She claims that her son had previously agreed to the procedure and that she has tried everything to notify the school of his declining mental health and bullying problems. The campaign has raised just over $4,750 Australian dollars, and McCann assures donors that the money will go towards immediate cryopreservation, legal transportation, and necessary medical and legal services. Cryonics is a controversial and largely experimental field, but companies offering the service argue that if enough of the brain's structure can be preserved, future medical advancements may allow full revival. Critics argue that these claims stretch the boundaries of science and ethics and are ultimately a gamble that seeks to prey on people's fears, grief, and desire to prolong their existence.

**Brit has body frozen and flown to US in hope of waking up in future**
A British man, known as 'patient 268', has had his body frozen and flown to the US in the hope of being revived in the future. The 3,700-mile journey took 16 days, and the body was cooled to well below freezing over a 25-hour period before being stored indefinitely at the Cryonics Institute in Michigan. The UK has the largest number of Cryonics Institute members outside of the US, with 128 people signed up for various 'suspension' options. As CI president Dennis Kowalksi said, 'cryonics is a gamble that may result in an ambulance ride to a future hospital.' The institute has two sites in Michigan housing over 250 patients who have paid for the outside shot at a revival.

**Brit frozen in liquid nitrogen chamber for chance of reawakening in far future - The Mirror**
A British man, known as 'Patient 268', has been cryogenically frozen in a liquid nitrogen container in the US as part of an advanced programme by the Cryonics Institute (CI). He was transported from the UK to the US after signing up with the CI, a medical organisation based in Michigan. The process, carried out by Cryonics UK, involved cooling the body to a temperature of -196C using liquid nitrogen. The CI's spokesperson said, 'The patient was then transferred to the computer-controlled cooling chamber to cool to liquid nitrogen temperature. The human dry ice program was selected and the time needed to cool the patient to liquid nitrogen temperature was 25 hours.' The CI's facilities are the largest in the world, with over 250 patients across two sites, and offer various programmes for cryopreservation, including a 'lifetime' membership with 'human cryopreservation' costs of $28,000. The organisation's chief, Dennis Kowalski, believes that death is something to be 'defeated' and said, 'The grave is your only real alternative and that's complete oblivion. So we want to defeat man's greatest enemy - death itself.'

**British man's body flown 3,700 miles to 'deep freeze' chamber for 'second life'**
A British man's body was flown 3,700 miles to the US and placed in liquid nitrogen under a cryonic storage scheme, offering a second chance at life. The 'patient' had signed up for the programme, which aims to preserve the body at extremely low temperatures in the hope that future technology can revive it. The Cryonics Institute, where the body was stored, has over 250 patients in liquid nitrogen at -196C (-320F), including pets. CI president Dennis Kowalski described cryonics as a 'gamble' that may result in 'an ambulance ride to a future hospital', but with little to lose and all to gain. Critics view the process as fanciful pseudoscience, but the scheme has gained popularity, with 128 people in the UK signed up for various 'suspension' options or to play a role in the non-profit organisation.

**Cryonic Preservation of Pets: A Russian Company's Offer**
A Russian company is offering cryonic preservation of pets, with prices ranging from 100,000 rubles for DNA preservation to 1.5 million rubles for full-body preservation. The company claims to have preserved 65 animals, including dogs, cats, hamsters, and even birds and fish. The process involves cooling the animal's body to -196°C using liquid nitrogen, and storing it in a Dewar flask. The company's representative, Valeria, explained that the process is similar to taking a biopsy, but instead of removing a small sample of tissue, they remove a thin layer of skin and preserve it. The company's cryonic facility is located near Tver, but it is still under construction. Valeria stated that it is possible to visit the preserved animal, but only with prior agreement. The company has also preserved several human brains, including that of Albert Morenkov, who was the first person to be cryopreserved in Russia in 2003. The cost of cryopreserving a human brain is 1.8 million rubles, and the company claims that it is possible to revive the brain in the future. However, there are no guarantees that the revived brain will be functional or healthy. The company's representative emphasized that they are not gods and cannot guarantee the success of the cryonic preservation process.

**Russia's Growing Interest in Cryonics: Freezing Bodies in the Hope of Revival**
Cryonics, a technology that freezes the human body or brain at extremely low temperatures in the hope of reviving it in the future, has gained popularity in Russia, with a 30% increase in interest in 2025. In Russia, it is possible to freeze the body, and the cost is not prohibitively expensive. Cryonics Institute and Alcor Life Extension Foundation, two of the largest cryonic companies, are based in the US and have been storing bodies and brains of their clients for decades, hoping to revive them in the future. In Asia, interest in cryonics is also growing, with the Yinfeng Life Science Foundation in China having performed several procedures. The process of cryopreservation begins immediately after clinical death, with specialists cooling the body to -10°C to slow down cell destruction. The next step is to replace blood with cryoprotectant, a special solution that prevents the formation of ice crystals that can damage cells. The body is then cooled to -130°C to avoid sudden changes that can harm tissues. When the body is fully prepared, it is placed in a cryostat, a container filled with liquid nitrogen, where it is stored at -196°C in a vertical position, waiting for technologies that can revive it. Clients can choose either full body freezing or brain preservation, hoping that in the future, it will be possible to create a new body or transfer consciousness into an artificial shell. Although cryonics looks promising, it has serious problems, including cell damage even with cryoprotectants, and the lack of technology to revive the frozen. However, supporters of this idea believe that nanomedicine and artificial intelligence will eventually find a way to revive the frozen.

**German Start-Up Offers to Freeze People for a Second Chance at Life**
A German start-up, Tomorrow.Bio, is offering to freeze people for a second chance at life for $200,000. The process involves cooling the body to -196°C and storing it in a cryogenic facility in Rafz, Switzerland. The company's founder, Emil Kendziorra, a former cancer researcher, believes that the idea of reviving the dead is realistic, saying, 'Many things that don't work today simply haven't been researched enough.' However, many scientists are skeptical, including Clive Coen, a professor of neuroscience at King's College London, who says that the method is unrealistic because cell decay begins immediately after death. Despite this, the company is optimistic, citing research on worms and rats that have been successfully revived after cryopreservation. Kendziorra sees cryonics as a breakthrough on par with organ transplantation, which was once considered impossible. However, there are also ethical questions, such as who is responsible for long-term storage and revival, and how to secure the preservation of the body over decades or centuries. The company plans to expand its services to the US this year and aims to develop reversible cryopreservation by 2028.
