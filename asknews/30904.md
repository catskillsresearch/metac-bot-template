**Goldman Sachs Delays US Federal Reserve Interest Rate Cut Expectations to December 2024**
Goldman Sachs has significantly delayed its expectations for a US Federal Reserve interest rate cut, pushing it back to December 2024. Previously, Goldman Sachs had predicted that the Fed would take its first interest rate cut of the year in July 2024. According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, the recent high-level trade talks between China and the US have made significant progress, with both sides significantly reducing tariffs. Goldman Sachs stated that, given these developments and the significant easing of financial conditions over the past month, it has raised its forecast for US fourth-quarter GDP growth in 2025 by 0.5 percentage points to 1%, and lowered the probability of an economic recession over the next 12 months to 35%. The bank has also lowered its forecast for the peak core PCE inflation rate from 3.8% to 3.6%. Nick Timiraos, a well-known financial journalist, quoted Goldman Sachs as saying, 'The significant reduction in US tariffs on China will have a limited impact on the overall effective tariff rate, and will only lead to a small decrease in the current effective tariff rate, of less than 2 percentage points.' Goldman Sachs' pessimistic forecast for the Fed is not unusual on Wall Street. Currently, option traders are building large positions to hedge against the risk that the Fed may not ease monetary policy this year, with one increasingly popular position predicting that the Fed will not cut interest rates at all in 2025. On Monday, traders in New York predicted that the Fed would only cut interest rates twice this year, with short-term US Treasury yields rising by over 10 basis points: The two-year Treasury yield rose 10.47 basis points to 3.9956%, with an intraday trading range of 3.9077% to 4.0166%. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 8.45 basis points to 4.4630%, with a trading range of 4.3981% to 3.4669%.

**Market Survey: Inflation Expectations Decrease, Interest Rates Remain Unchanged**
The Focus market survey, released on May 12, 2025, shows a new decrease in the expected inflation rate for 2025, from 5.53% to 5.51%. This is the fourth consecutive decrease in market expectations for the country's official inflation rate. For 2026, economists project a decrease in inflation to 4.50%, while maintaining projections of 4% and 3.80% for 2027 and 2028, respectively. Despite the market's expectation of a decrease in inflation, the same analysts do not see a change in the basic interest rate of the economy, the Selic. The Selic rate is expected to remain at 14.75% per year in 2025, 12.50% in 2026, 10.50% in 2027, and 10% in 2028. The analysis also projects the country's GDP to remain at 2% in 2025, with a growth of 3.4% in 2024 and a projection of 1.7% in 2026. The market's expectation for the dollar has decreased for the end of 2025, from US$ 5.86 to US$ 5.85, and for 2026, from US$ 5.91 to US$ 5.90.

**Markets Doubt Fed's Patience as Rate Cut Odds Slide | Investing.com**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has maintained its stance on interest rates, despite growing uncertainty in the US economy. Fed Chairman Powell stated that the risks of higher unemployment and inflation have risen, but there is no urgency to adjust rates. Markets now anticipate a rate cut by the end of July, down from a previous expectation of a cut by June. Meanwhile, US investors and companies are buying back stocks at an unprecedented pace, with 21 consecutive weeks of purchases. Hedge funds, on the other hand, are reducing their positions at a historic pace. Additionally, US corporations are accelerating their share buyback activity, with announcements reaching all-time highs. Other notable trends include the decline of Skype, which is being shut down by Microsoft, and the dominance of China's industrial production, which is projected to surpass the combined output of the US, Germany, and India in 2024.

**The 2025 Fed Meeting Calendar And What Markets Expect For Interest Rates**
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has held three of its eight scheduled meetings in 2025, with interest rates remaining steady at 4.25%. Markets expect a cut in rates to 4.5% or lower by December, but the timing is uncertain. FOMC officials, including Governor Michael Barr and Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have emphasized the high degree of uncertainty and potential downside risks for the US economy due to trade policies and tariffs. Barr said, 'The outlook has been clouded by trade policies that have led to an increase in uncertainty, contributing to declines in measures of consumer and business sentiment.' Powell noted, 'I think there's a great deal of uncertainty about, for example, where tariff policies are going to settle out, and also when they do settle out, what will be the implications for the economy for growth and for employment?' Markets anticipate a likely range of one to four interest rate cuts in 2025, with two or three cuts being the most likely outcome by year-end, potentially leaving short-term rates in a 3.5% to 4% range.

**Key Interest Rate May Decrease to 19% by End of 2025**
According to 'Izvestia' citing expert forecasts, the key interest rate may decrease to 19% by the end of 2025. The first decrease may occur as early as summer. The Central Bank may start to ease monetary policy after the July 25 meeting, but it will do so gradually, not more than one percentage point at a time. Economist Pavel Biryukov from Gazprombank noted that decisions to lower the rate are possible only after receiving complete inflation statistics for April and May, expected in the summer. Senior analyst Igor Rapakhin from SberCIB Investment Research added that the situation is developing according to the 'soft landing' scenario with slowing inflation and a return of GDP growth to 1.5-2%. However, according to Natalya Milchakova, leading analyst at Freedom Finance Global, it is unlikely that annual inflation will reach the target 7% this year, as the current dynamics of consumer prices indicate a slow decline. The key interest rate was raised to 21% in October 2024 due to accelerating inflation, which, according to experts, has already exceeded 10% this year. The regulator maintains a high rate to curb price growth.

**Market Reduces Inflation Expectations and Halts Interest Rate Hikes**
According to the Focus report, analysts expect inflation to end the year at 5.51%, marking the fourth consecutive decline in projections. However, this still exceeds the 4.5% target. The report also forecasts a decrease in inflation for 2026, reaching 4.5%, and further reductions in 2027 (4%) and 2028 (3.8%). The central tendency is 3%. The expectation is that the Selic interest rate will remain at 14.75% in 2025, as the more contractionary policy adopted since last year has shown results in reducing inflation. Additionally, the market expects a new reduction in the average exchange rate of the dollar, reaching R$ 5.85 in 2025, R$ 5.90 in 2026, R$ 5.80 in 2027, and R$ 5.82 in 2028. The economic growth, measured by the PIB, is expected to be 2% in 2025, 1.7% in 2026, and 2% in 2027 and 2028.

**Mapped: Interest Rates by Country in 2025**
Central banks are setting interest rates amidst economic uncertainty. The U.S. has kept the target range at 4.25-4.50%, citing a solid pace of economic expansion and low unemployment, but elevated inflation and uncertainty. The Federal Reserve forecasts two rate cuts by the end of 2025, bringing the target range down to 3.75-4.00%. On the other hand, Switzerland and Fiji have the lowest rate of 0.25%, while Venezuela and Türkiye have the highest rates globally, at 59.4% and 46.0% respectively, in response to high inflation and dropping currency values.

**Key Inflation Measure Slowed To Multiyear Low In March -- But Tariff Bump On The Horizon**
The inflation rate slowed down to a multi-year low in March, but economists are concerned that President Donald Trump's tariffs will complicate the situation and lead to an increase in inflation. Trump believes that there is 'virtually No Inflation,' but economists disagree, projecting that core PCE inflation will rise to 3.5% in August, the worst inflation since September 2024. The US economy contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, the weakest economic expansion since Q1 2022. The Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee will meet on May 6-7, but traders are only 9% confident that they will lower interest rates, despite Trump's repeated demands.

**US Interest Rates: Tense Situation?**
US consumer confidence has reached a record low, while the Federal Reserve is balancing inflation and the risk of recession. The Fed is facing a difficult decision, as consumer sentiment has fallen to pandemic levels, and inflation, possible recession, and protectionist trade policies are affecting the economy. The consumer confidence index has dropped dramatically by 7.9 points to 86.0, the lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The expectations index, which reflects short-term outlooks for income, business activity, and the labor market, has fallen to 54.4, a value last seen in 2011. For the first time in five years, consumers are predominantly negative about their income prospects. The high volatility in financial markets in April has further depressed sentiment, with many expecting further falling stock prices. Inflation expectations for the next 12 months have risen to their highest level since the end of 2022. Notably, trade policy is becoming increasingly a source of concern, with the mention of tariffs as the main economic problem reaching a historic high, indicating that protectionist measures are weighing on consumer sentiment. Market uncertainty is also reflected in bond yields, with the 10-year US Treasury yield falling to 4.21% and the 30-year yield to 4.66%. The Fed is in a waiting mode after interest rate cuts in late 2024, and the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in early May could be decisive. The Fed must balance the risk of inflationary impulses from Trump's new tariff plans with the signs of a weakening economy. The big question is whether the Fed will need to delay further interest rate cuts if tariffs push prices up. The interplay between trade policy and monetary policy will likely determine the direction of US interest rates in the coming weeks, with significant implications for markets, businesses, and consumers.

**Fed Expected to Lower Interest Rates Twice in 2025**
Royal London Asset Management's senior economist Melanie Baker expects the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates twice in 2025. Baker said, 'I expect the Fed to wait until the second half of the year to lower interest rates.' However, she is now in the 'slowdown' camp instead of 'recession' due to signs of a stronger slowdown in the economy and a worsening growth outlook in the US and globally. UBS believes that if the US economy slows down, the Fed will lower the benchmark interest rate by 75 to 100 basis points this year. UBS analysts also expect a possible agreement between the US and China in the coming months, despite recent tensions. They predict that the effective tariff rate between the two countries will settle around 10-15%. Experts recommend that investors diversify and strengthen their portfolios in the long term by taking advantage of market fluctuations. U.S. Bank Asset Management's Bill Merz suggests that the Fed's interest rate cuts in June or July reflect the Treasury yields' expectations. Merz said, 'Ultimately, officials are measuring the impact of tariffs on the Fed's inflation and full employment mandates, and the timing of Fed rate cuts is tied to trade policy.'

**QNB: Federal Reserve to Continue Lowering Interest Rates in 2025**
QNB expects the Federal Reserve to continue lowering interest rates later in 2025, despite the high inflation rate and potential short-term inflationary pressures due to the imposition of tariffs. The bank's report states that the Federal Reserve has been at the forefront of discussions about the overall economy and investment, given the importance of interest rates and quantitative policies for growth, liquidity, and inflation. However, in recent months, a series of new policies adopted by the Trump administration has changed the basis of discussions and areas of focus completely. The report notes that this move was a response to concerns about excessive economic activity that could lead to high inflation rates if President Trump were to implement the proposed expansionary policies during his election campaign. According to the report, with the new US administration taking office and its priorities focused on imposing new tariffs and promoting 'government efficiency', the risk balance that threatens economic expectations has quickly shifted from excessive economic activity to recession risks. The report notes that the Federal Reserve is still in need of action in this high level of uncertainty, where monetary policy tools can play a crucial role in mitigating some of the effects of uncertainty or potential negative shocks from the political front. The report also notes that medium-term interest rates have fluctuated significantly. Investors currently expect the Federal Reserve to resume the interest rate-cutting cycle that began in September 2024, with four additional 25 basis point interest rate cuts on federal funds by the end of 2025 and additional interest rate cuts in 2026. The bank's report highlights that market expectations appear to be in line with the overall economic environment, indicating that there is sufficient space for the Federal Reserve to make further easing in monetary policy, highlighting two key factors that support interest rate cuts. The first factor is the statements of Federal Reserve officials reflecting a readiness for an additional interest rate cut later this year, as the 'dot plot' for March 2025, which outlines the expected target range for interest rates from each participant in the Federal Open Market Committee's 19 members, is roughly in line with the current market situation. This is supported by the view of most Federal Reserve officials that the economy is slowing down gradually, with a return to normal inflation, and that any potential impact on inflation from tariffs is likely to be temporary and 'ignored'. The second factor is that the weakness of the economy and the decline in market confidence, due to political shocks, make interest rate cuts a necessary step, not just a possibility. The report concludes that, despite the high inflation rate and potential short-term inflationary pressures due to tariffs, it is likely that the Federal Reserve will continue to lower interest rates later in 2025. This comes in the context of the economy's slowdown and the need to switch from a restrictive monetary policy (with an interest rate of 4.5%) to a neutral one of 4%, to avoid a potential recession.

**Fed Increases Inflation Estimate and Projects Two Interest Rate Cuts in 2025**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has increased its inflation estimate for the US and projects two interest rate cuts in 2025. According to the Fed, the interest rate will be reduced by 0.5 percentage points by the end of this year, in a scenario of economic deceleration and potential inflation decline. The interest rate cuts will occur in two meetings, with a reduction of 0.25 percentage points in each. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the US was 2.8% in February, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points from January. The inflation target in the US is 2% per year, and although it is not at this level, the index has been below 3% since July 2024. For 2025, the Fed estimates inflation in the US to be 2.7%, a slight increase from the previous estimate of 2.5%. The Fed has also reduced its projections for GDP growth, from 2.1% to 1.7%.

**Perspectives 2025: Resilience of the US and the Return of Trump**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (BCE) have been easing their monetary policies in 2024. Despite inflation levels being above the 2% medium-term target, the expectation is that the easing of monetary policy will continue. The BCE is expected to raise interest rates faster, with a rate of 2.15% by the end of the year, while the Fed will do so more slowly, with a rate of 4%-4.25%. The market expects a positive performance for the US stock market in 2025, but more modest and limited to a single-digit high. Companies are expected to continue increasing their profits this year, with FactSet predicting a 13% increase in earnings per share and a 5.5% increase in revenue. The S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio for the next 12 months is 22.1 times, exceeding historical averages. It is advisable to prioritize sectors such as Energy, Technology, Industrial, and Financial. The expectation of low but high interest rates in 2025 maintains the attractiveness of fixed income, due to significantly higher yields than in the past 20 years (5.5% average for high-quality bonds vs 4% historical). It is advisable to 'lock in' higher yields today compared to levels that may be reached in the coming years, as the monetary authority effectively implements these cuts. The market's discounted probability shows a (1) quarter-point cut in the Fed's rate for 2025 (which would put it in a range of 4.0%-4.25%), a less optimistic view than the official one (2 cuts to a range of 3.75%-4%). With the yield curve normalized, the reduction in interest rates is positive for bond prices, although it depends on their term. In this scenario, it is appropriate for conservative profiles to focus on the short end of the yield curve, and for moderate profiles to focus on the medium end. The strategy of securing a high level of yield in medium-term high-quality bonds (maintaining a similar investment horizon to the bond's term) is advisable. It is worth noting that those with long-term maturities are less attractive in this context. The expectation is that the dollar will remain strong in the year (around 1.05 dollars per euro, similar to 2024) due to high interest rates in the US and a low reference rate in euros, which would generate some pressure on commodity prices. It is expected that demand will remain stable -in the absence of a recession- although it could show some weakness, mainly on the Chinese side. On the other hand, supply will be determined by the expectation of no significant changes in the geopolitical front and favorable climate prospects. Brent oil would trade around USD 74 per barrel, in line with OPEC+ production cuts and higher incentives for US supply, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). On the other hand, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) forecasts good 2024/2025 campaigns for soybeans, wheat, and corn, reaching 424 million tons, 794 million tons, and 1.212 million tons, respectively. The expectation that the Fed will continue to gradually cut its reference rate this year would generate some 'relief' in the financing costs of Private Equity activities, which would result in a gradual increase in the number of transactions. It is advisable to prioritize investments in high-income companies and unencumbered businesses. On the other hand, it is advisable for the Private Credit segment to continue registering high levels of interest rates, as it allows for the obtaining of yields above 10%. Finally, in Real Estate, caution prevails due to high financing costs, which make it difficult to buy homes. The high mortgage rates (7% current) would put a cap on the valuation of these assets.

**Will Interest Rates Go Down in 2025: Projections and Insights**
The Federal Reserve is expected to stabilize interest rates around 3.00% to 3.25% by the end of 2025, with some modest declines anticipated but aggressive cuts unlikely. Analysts predict gradual rate cuts, with estimates of a federal funds rate of 2.75% to 3.00% at year-end 2025. The Fed's cautious approach aims to balance inflation control with economic growth. A decrease in interest rates in 2025 can have widespread implications for various sectors of the economy, including lower mortgage rates, reduced student loan interest costs, and increased investment in growth projects.

In 2024, the US economy defied recessionary predictions, growing by 3.0% and 2.8% in the last two quarters, despite an inverted interest rate yield curve. The Federal Reserve only cut interest rates three times, by a total of 100 basis points. Businesses generally expanded over the past 12 months. In 2025, the Fed is expected to lower interest rates by only 2-3 times, by 0.25% each, due to quantitative tightening and persistent inflation fears. Treasury rates are expected to rise, but may fall back to current levels by the end of the year. Top economic forecasters predict that rates will rise again in 2026-2030 due to inflationary drivers such as energy costs, wages, and taxes. Businesses are advised to secure new debt now to facilitate better cash flow and growth, as borrowing costs remain favorable. Community banks are ready to partner with local businesses to provide necessary funding in this changing economic environment.

**Economists are in disarray as the US Federal Reserve's interest rate cut timing is uncertain**
Despite the US Federal Reserve officials, including Powell, stating that they 'are not in a hurry' to further lower interest rates, many economists believe that the US is in a golden period and does not need to continue lowering interest rates. However, since the beginning of the year, new tariff policies have been introduced every week. James Knightley, chief international economist at the Netherlands International Group, analyzed that 'tariffs have an inflationary effect and may significantly hinder economic growth. This uncertainty means that the Federal Reserve can only maintain a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for the situation to become clearer.' Although 60% of economists in the January survey predicted that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates in March, the latest survey from February 4-10 shows that economists are divided on the timing of the next interest rate cut. Among the 101 respondents, 67 people predict that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates at least once before the end of June, with 22 people predicting action in March and 45 people predicting action in the second quarter. In contrast, 17 out of 99 economists who provided predictions for the end of 2025 believe that there will be a rate cut in the second half of the year, while 16 people predict that there will be no rate cut at all. The interest rate futures market currently prices the probability of a rate cut in the middle of 2025 at around 50%. Despite the survey predicting that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates twice this year and the federal funds rate will be between 3.75% and 4.00% by the end of 2025, the prediction interval is extremely wide, ranging from 3.00% to 3.25% to 4.50% to 4.75%. Economists are more consistent in their judgment of inflationary pressure. Compared to the survey before the US presidential election last October, 90% of repeated respondents increased their predictions for inflation in 2025 by an average of around 40 basis points. Among the 46 analysts who answered additional questions, 27 people (nearly 60%) believe that the recent US tariffs have increased the risk of inflation, while 17 people believe that the risk remains the same, and only 2 people believe that the risk has decreased. Neil Shearing, chief economist at KPMG, pointed out that 'this uncertainty is enough to make the Federal Reserve maintain a wait-and-see attitude in the coming months. If high tariffs are ultimately implemented, the resulting inflation will limit the Federal Reserve's room for rate cuts in the remainder of the year.'

**U.S. Economy Ends 2024 on Solid Footing, Driven by Consumer Strength**
The U.S. economy ended 2024 with steady growth, driven by resilient consumer spending that offset challenges in business investment and global trade. Despite high interest rates and ongoing inflation pressures, the nation's economic momentum remained intact, setting the stage for an uncertain but potentially strong 2025. Consumer spending grew at a 4.2 percent annual pace, its strongest since early 2023, while the labor market remained stable with unemployment at 4.1 percent. However, business investment slowed, weighed down by an eight-week strike at Boeing and rising uncertainty over trade policy and interest rates. The Federal Reserve opted to hold interest rates steady, signaling caution over cutting rates too soon. The economy enters the new year with significant momentum, but headwinds, including inflation risks, trade policy adjustments, and global economic weakness, could test that strength in the months ahead.

**US Federal Reserve Resists Trump's Pressure to Lower Interest Rates**
The US Federal Reserve (Fed) has decided not to lower interest rates in its first meeting since Donald Trump's return to the White House. The current interest rate remains at 4.25-4.5%, as announced by the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. Trump, a strong advocate for low interest rates, has expressed his disagreement with the Fed's decision. Trump stated, 'I know more about interest rates than the Fed.' The Fed cited increased inflation and a stable unemployment rate as reasons for not lowering interest rates. Trump has previously criticized the Fed and its chairman, Jerome Powell, and even considered firing him. However, Powell has stated that he will not resign before the end of his term in 2026. The European Central Bank (EZB) is expected to lower interest rates in the eurozone on Thursday, which would be the fifth rate cut since mid-2024. This move aims to support the weakening economy. The inflation rate in the US remains high, with a 2.9% increase in December, exceeding the Fed's target of 2%. The Fed had previously raised interest rates to combat high inflation, but has since lowered them. The current interest rate forecast for 2025 is 3.9%, with two small rate cuts expected this year.

**Fed Hits the Pause Button, Awaits Further Data Amid Policy Uncertainty**
The Federal Reserve maintained the federal-funds rate at 4.25%-4.50% in January, marking the first time it has done so since initiating rate cuts in September 2024. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the US economy is 'set up for further progress on inflation,' but the central bank will await further data before making further decisions. Powell noted that the neutral interest rate, which generates a balanced level of economic growth, is likely below the current rate, but he was vague on the specifics. The Fed will rely on incoming data on economic activity and the labor market to determine how much easing will be appropriate. The unemployment rate has held steady at around 4.15% in recent months, and the labor market is considered solid. However, potential tariff hikes could throw a wrench in bringing inflation back to normal, and the Fed is uncertain about the path forward. Markets are still expecting a year-end 2025 federal-funds rate of 3.75%-4.00%, but we continue to expect more rate cuts than the market, with our year-end 2025 federal-funds rate expectation at 3.25%-3.50%.
