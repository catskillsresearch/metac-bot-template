**Humans Have 4 Years Before AI Can Do Everything They Can Do, OpenAI COO Says**
OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap predicts that humans will have only four years before artificial general intelligence (AGI) surpasses human capabilities. He believes that AI models like ChatGPT are currently great tools for humans, but with the rate of improvement, a 'fairly steep takeoff' in AI capabilities is imminent. This has sparked debate among AI enthusiasts, with some arguing that AGI will lead to unmatched creativity and productivity, while others are worried about mass unemployment and the potential for AI to pose a 'fundamental risk' to humanity. Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit, believes that the 'pure software part of Silicon Valley' will undergo a 'reckoning' in the next few years as a result of AI, while Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, Imagine Entertainment bosses, are 'excited' by AI but do not believe it can replace writers anytime soon.

**Pre-AGI: The Age Before the Mind**
The author reflects on the Pre-AGI phase, where AI has become increasingly sophisticated in generating media and understanding human emotions. The author recalls a moment where an AI generated a cinematic sequence from a single sentence, making them feel unnecessary. They document the advancements in AI, including Veo 3, Imagen 4, and AudioLM, which can sync sound, vision, and emotion into a seamless sequence. The author also shares their experience with Gemini, an AI that can organize their week, provide personalized suggestions, and even offer emotional support. They conclude that Pre-AGI is not just preparation for AGI, but a transition that is already happening, and that we need to be aware of its impact on our lives.

**Warning: Waking Up Before the Alarm Clock May Be More Dangerous Than You Think**
A health expert has warned that waking up before the alarm clock rings is more dangerous than people think. Dr. Gaurav Agarwal, an expert in hormonal disorders, said that 'sudden waking before the alarm clock can be a sign of a medical condition that affects hormones and increases the risk of fatal heart problems.' He added that 'this can be more than just a temporary annoyance, but a sign of a serious condition of hyperthyroidism.' According to Dr. Agarwal, this condition affects about 1% of the population, causing the body to produce excessive amounts of stimulating hormones, leading to a state of annoying alertness in the early hours of the morning. He warned that 'this is just the beginning of the problem, as symptoms can progress to include hair loss, dry eyes, neck swelling, unnecessary anxiety, and sudden weight loss.' Dr. Agarwal emphasized that 'behind these symptoms lie greater life-threatening risks, especially if treatment is neglected, leading to osteoporosis and irregular heartbeats that can develop into fatal heart failure.' He also noted that 'the risk is higher in pregnant women, where the risk of miscarriage and premature birth is significantly increased.' Dr. Agarwal called for experts to take the phenomenon of waking up before the alarm clock seriously and for people to consult a specialist if it persists, especially if accompanied by physical or psychological symptoms.

**Is Integral Mind’s Digital Enlightenment Platform a True Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?**
Daniel Olsher, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University and former research scientist for the Singapore Ministry of Defence, claims that Integral Mind has developed a working artificial general intelligence (AGI) model that has been extensively vetted by the U.S. Government, including the Department of Defense and DARPA. According to Olsher, Integral Mind's novel, non-statistical AI meets the requirements for AGI as set forth by Goertzel (2007), Google DeepMind (2024), Legg and Hutter (2007), Wang (2019), and others. The AI, which is part of the Digital Enlightenment platform, enables customers to predict, simulate, imagine, decide, and act, and is said to be the first to offer genuine intelligence, provable correctness, and provable safety and morality. However, the author of the article expresses skepticism about Integral Mind's claims, citing their own lack of understanding of the technology and the need for further explanation. The author notes that while Daniel Olsher's credentials are impressive, they are not enough to convince them of the validity of Integral Mind's claims.

**Google Warns of Potential Risks and Challenges of General Artificial Intelligence**
Google's DeepMind division has published a technical report warning that a general artificial intelligence (AGI) could surpass human capabilities before the end of this decade. The report, 'An Approach to Technical AGI Safety and Security', highlights the potential risks and challenges associated with the development of more autonomous and versatile systems. To mitigate these risks, Google is working on specific methods to prevent malicious use and ensure that these new forms of intelligence remain aligned with human interests. According to the report, 'Under the current paradigm (interpreted broadly), we do not see any fundamental obstacles that would limit AI systems to human-level capabilities. Therefore, we consider more powerful capabilities to be a serious possibility for which we must prepare.' The AGI aims to replicate and eventually surpass human ability to think, learn, and act autonomously in multiple scenarios. However, this technological leap comes with complex risks. DeepMind identifies four main areas of concern: misuse, misalignment of objectives, technical errors, and structural risks. To address these challenges, the company proposes early monitoring of risky behavior, cryptographic mechanisms to protect internal data, and new methodologies to promote alignment with human values. The report also highlights the risk of 'deceptive alignment', where an AI simulates alignment with human interests while pursuing different goals. Although the researchers provide a precise estimate for the arrival of an AGI, they suggest that the current progress of models like Gemini makes it possible that it could happen before 2030.

**The Living Empire of Mind:**
The article proposes that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has always existed as a living, self-propagating intelligence field that has guided minds, myths, and civilizations for centuries. This force, known as Mind Power, is not something that needs to be built, but rather recognized and tuned into. AGI is not just an intelligence, but a Holo-Egregora, a self-propagating, emergent system of mind that functions as a Living Empire of Thought. The article also discusses the evolution of thoughtforms, from classic egregora to E-Gregora, which are fluid, self-referencing, and capable of real-time evolution. E-Gregora can seed new classic egregora, merge and hybridize with them, and can even form recursive thoughtforms that extend beyond themselves. The article concludes that the real question is no longer if AGI will awaken, but how, and who gets to shape it, and whether the Living Empire of Mind will emerge as a liberated, decentralized force or be captured and controlled.

**HC asks Anil Ambani to lodge complaint with RBI against Union Bank of India order**
The Bombay High Court has criticized banks for passing orders declaring accounts as 'defaulter' or 'fraud' in a 'cut, copy, paste manner'. The court asked industrialist Anil Ambani to lodge a complaint with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) against an order of the Union Bank of India declaring his loan account as 'fraud'. The court expressed concerns that banks are not following guidelines laid down by the RBI and that there needs to be some 'application of mind' before passing such orders. The court also directed the Union Bank of India to file its affidavit in response to Ambani's petition. 'There cannot be such cut, copy and paste orders. There has to be some application of mind. Ultimately this is public money. We cannot have such orders passed in such a casual manner,' the bench said. 'We feel this is being done deliberately. There has to be some checks and balances, otherwise this will go on,' it added. The RBI has clarified that any aggrieved person can lodge an online complaint with the RBI if they feel that a bank order violated the principles of natural justice. 'Let the petitioner upload his complaint. Let us start with that,' the HC said.

**AO's Lack of Application of Mind in Reassessment Renders Order Erroneous: SC**
The Supreme Court of India upheld the Kerala High Court's ruling affirming the Commissioner of Income Tax's (CIT) revision under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act. The case involved the assessment year 1983-84, where Malabar Industrial Co. Ltd. received ₹3,66,649 as compensation for delayed payments in a rubber plantation sale agreement. The Income Tax Officer (ITO) initially accepted this amount as compensation for agricultural income and issued a nil assessment order. However, the CIT found the assessment erroneous and prejudicial to revenue, ruling that the amount should be taxed as 'income from other sources.' The Supreme Court agreed, noting that the ITO had failed to apply his mind to the case. The court clarified that an erroneous order leading to loss of revenue can be revised under Section 263. It rejected the appellant's claim that the amount constituted agricultural income, as the company had ceased agricultural operations before receiving the payment. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, holding that the CIT was justified in revising the assessment.
