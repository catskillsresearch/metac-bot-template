**Australian property bounce after Labor wins second term, early data shows**
Australia's housing market has surged after Labor's election victory, with auction clearance rates rising to 70% in the week following the election. Analysts predict that home prices will rise faster than wages through 2025 due to expected interest rate cuts, and some forecast that the returned government's buyer help schemes could keep property prices rising in 2026. The number of homes listed for sale remains relatively low, with economists expecting nationwide values to rise by at least 3% but potentially as much as 10% over 2025. However, a slower-than-expected recovery in buyers' budgets and a widening gap between property owners and younger renters struggling to get into the market may constrain these forecasts. As Nerida Conisbee, chief economist at Ray White, said, 'There's a higher level of certainty' following the election, which has led to increased buying enthusiasm. 'People are feeling pretty confident that the right outcome has happened,' she added. Eliza Owen, head of research at Cotality, noted that people are still waiting to see the outcome of the interest rate decision in May, but expects the Reserve Bank board to cut its key interest rate on 20 May, leading to further price growth.

**Recession Odds Fall Below 50% On Polymarket As Crypto Bettors Digest US-China Trade Deal News**
The odds of a US recession in 2025 have fallen below 50% on Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market, following the US-China trade deal announcement. The probability dropped from 52% to 49% over the last 24 hours, with over $5 million wagered on the bet. The outcome resolves to 'Yes' if the economy experiences another quarter of negative growth or if the National Bureau of Economic Research declares a recession before January 1, 2026. President Donald Trump said that 'great progress' was made during the talks and that a 'total reset' could be expected, which led to stock futures spiking and the Dow Jones Futures rallying over 400 points Sunday night.

**US Economy Enters Recession: GDP Continues to Decline**
According to data, the US GDP contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter of this year, which is the worst quarter since 2022. The US Commerce Department stated that the contraction in the first quarter GDP indicates that businesses are concerned about the possibility of an increase in import tariffs in the future. As noted by the economists at U.S. Bancorp, the contraction in the first quarter GDP reflects the 'sudden change' in trade policies. This change has significantly dragged down the economy through net exports, with the drag being the highest in over half a century. Multiple economic indicators suggest that a recession in the US economy in 2025 has become a 'basic expectation.' The possibility of a contraction in domestic demand in the second quarter is high, and GDP may continue to decline.

**Labor's 2nd Term Begins Under Shadow of Productivity, Housing Crunch: Economists**
Economists warn that Australia's Labor government faces significant challenges in its second term, including stagnant productivity, unaffordable housing, and a suffocating business environment. While inflation is no longer the immediate concern, economists like Saul Eslake and John Humphreys agree that the country's economic growth remains stagnant and housing is unaffordable. Humphreys believes that Labor's tax measures are symbolic gestures and that the government needs to implement significant tax cuts, less regulation on small business, and cheaper energy prices to kick-start the economy. Gigi Foster warns that Labor's re-election could encourage further interventionist measures, which could exacerbate the country's social decay. Eslake attributes business closure rates to the Australian Taxation Office's resumption of tax enforcement after COVID, while Humphreys says that high construction costs, tight supply, high immigration rates, and urban sprawl are contributing to housing unaffordability. 'Unless there is a sudden change in policy, I expect that inflation will remain under control in the foreseeable future, though the cost-of-living crisis will continue,' said Humphreys. 'Governments of both political persuasions keep doing things that keep house prices going up,' he added.

**Australia's rental crisis is not what you think it is**
The Australian rental crisis is not as severe as it seems, according to experts. While advertised rents have increased by 15% in 2024, this only reflects a small and unrepresentative share of the total rental market. In reality, most renters are not experiencing a crisis, with rents having climbed by 19% over the past five years, which is less than half the reported rate. This is because many renters are in stable situations with landlords who are not increasing rents. However, there are still renters struggling to find properties at a time when the national vacancy rate is at a record low. Experts say that the problems in the housing market have not appeared suddenly and an emergency response is not the way to fix the problems. Instead, long-term, multifaceted programs are needed to address the fundamental issues in the housing system.

**David Roche Warns of a 15-20% Decline in the US Dollar and a Potential Recession by 2025**
David Roche, a strategist at Quantum Strategy, warns that the US dollar may have been overvalued by 20% and could see a significant decline of 15% to 20% in the next 5 to 10 years. He also believes that the US economy may enter a recession by the end of this year. Roche expressed concerns about the ongoing trade war initiated by President Trump, which is damaging the US's reputation in the global financial market and causing investors to shift their funds away from US assets denominated in dollars. Since the Trump administration launched the trade war, the US dollar has continued to weaken, resulting in an 8% cumulative decline in the dollar index since Trump's return to the White House. Roche believes that this downtrend is unlikely to end soon, as foreign investors' confidence in the US and its dollar-denominated assets is waning. Roche notes that the dollar's 'real effective exchange rate' (REER), a measure of a country's currency value relative to multiple currencies, is still overvalued. According to data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the dollar's REER in March was around 112, which is about 20% higher than its 2008 level. Roche argues that the dollar has been overvalued since 2008. He expects a structural shift in global funds out of the US to take 5 to 10 years, but a more direct impact will be felt immediately, with the US potentially entering a recession by the end of 2025 or early 2026. Roche attributes the trade war to the suppression of trade activity and the US economy's growth being hindered by the ongoing trade tensions, with the worst-case scenario being a recession by the end of 2025 or early 2026, as Roche said, 'the trade war will be a major obstacle to economic growth.'

**IMF Warns of Global Recession: A Reconfiguration of the Global Economic Architecture is Needed**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has released new projections for the global economy, showing a significant reduction in growth rates for 2025 and 2026 compared to previous projections. This reduction is particularly notable given the already modest growth rates in many economies, especially in advanced economies. The IMF notes that the growth rates in emerging economies, such as China and India, are also slowing down. The projections for 2025 show a substantial reduction in growth rates compared to 2024, which was not a notable year. The prospects for 2026 are more uncertain due to the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead. The situation in Europe is particularly dire, with a projected growth rate of 0.8% for the eurozone in 2024, compared to 1.8% for the US. Germany is projected to have a growth rate of 0% in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026, which could be considered a recession. France is also facing significant challenges, with a projected growth rate of 0.8% in 2025 and 1.0% in 2026. The IMF notes that the two economies are facing deep structural crises, reflecting their growing disconnection from the global economy. The latest data from the Bundesbank and the Bank of France confirm the bleak prospects for 2025, although there is some recovery expected in 2026. The Eurostat estimates for the eurozone and the EU are slightly more optimistic, but do not change the overall situation. The surprise comes from the US, where the latest data shows a contraction in economic activity of 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, compared to a growth rate of 2.4% in the previous quarter. The contraction is attributed to an increase in imports and a reduction in government spending. However, there were increases in investment and exports that partially offset the declines in other components. The growth of non-resident investment, which increased by 9.8%, is particularly noteworthy. In conclusion, the IMF's projections suggest that the world is on the brink of a global recession, which could have devastating effects in the current context of widespread confrontation and collective irrationality. The IMF warns that the solution will require a reconfiguration of the global economic architecture.

**UBS: Investors should prepare for U.S. avoiding a recession... again By Investing.com**
Jason Draho, Head of Asset Allocation Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, is questioning the consensus on Wall Street that the U.S. will enter a recession this year. He notes that a few years ago, when a recession was the consensus, it turned out to be 'quite wrong.' Draho highlights that last week's GDP report 'rhymed with history in ways that are a reminder to have humility when forecasting the economy.' He points out that in both 1Q22 and 1Q25, GDP data were skewed by supply shocks, yet the labor market stayed strong. Draho reminds investors that in 2022, recession fears grew as the Fed hiked and SVB collapsed, yet the economy still rose 2.85% in 2023 and 2024. He states, 'So it would also be a mistake now to dismiss the possibility that US growth will remain resilient and defy stagflation expectations.' Draho identifies economic dynamism, or the 'Uberfication' effect, as a hard-to-measure X-factor reason the U.S. could avoid recession. He notes that the S&P 500's 14% rebound is not just crowd wisdom, but relief that final tariffs won't be as bad as the 'Liberation Day' announcements. Draho advises investors to consider alternative outcomes and not assume no upside, saying, 'It can be hard to allocate when the data is getting worse, but keep in mind that for two years US equities climbed the wall of worry as investors continually expected data to worsen, which it never did.'

**Heber plans for 2026 despite uncertain economic outlook - Park Record**
Heber City's City Council held its first meeting to review the tentative fiscal year 2026 budget amidst an uncertain economic outlook. According to Matt Brower, Heber's city manager, the U.S. is likely to face a recession this year, with a 60% likelihood, up from 40% earlier this year. Brower recommended deferring hiring for funded positions and large capital requests until there's more clarity, and suggested possibly leveraging property tax increases to fund new positions. Heber City operates on a zero-based budget, where departments are asked to start with zero and work their way up from there. The 2026 fiscal year budget will also include a newer software called ClearGov, designed to make the city's financial projects more transparent to the public. 'We don't know what's in the future and we don't know how serious it might be based on the previous 12,' Brower said, referencing the 12 recessions that have happened since the Great Depression ended in 1939. 'This outlook is showing that we will still have a strong economy but there is price uncertainty on the horizon, primarily due to monetary and fiscal policies on the federal level,' Brower said. 'The departments know their budgets inside and out,' Brower said. 'They know their contracts, they know the demands on their budgets.'

**Australian Elections: Challenges and Opportunities for Germany**
The Australian Labor Party, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, is likely to face a challenge in the upcoming parliamentary elections on May 3, 2025. According to recent polls, the ALP is ahead of the liberal-national coalition, but neither Albanese nor his challenger, Dutton, is expected to secure a clear majority. They may need to rely on the support of independent candidates and smaller parties. The elections will take place in a challenging economic and geopolitical environment, with Australia needing to secure its economic stability while redefining its role in the global economy. 'The real per capita income has been falling for several quarters, reducing consumer confidence in Australia,' says Daniel Lenkeit of Germany Trade & Invest in Sydney. 'Additionally, declining commodity prices are affecting export growth. The country needs structural reforms, including in the housing market, infrastructure development, and reviving the manufacturing sector.' This presents opportunities for deepening economic cooperation with Germany. 'For Germany, Australia is the tenth-largest export market outside the EU,' Lenkeit notes. 'Germany mainly exports machinery and equipment for mining and agriculture, cars, tractors, and pharmaceutical products to Australia.' There are also potential opportunities for cooperation in renewable energy, particularly wind power, where Australia is rapidly expanding its capacity. However, a victory for the opposition Liberal Party could hinder or even stop offshore wind projects and lead to a fundamental shift in energy policy. Lenkeit notes that in the future, Australia will become increasingly interesting as a market for critical raw materials and green energy sources, particularly for battery raw materials and rare earths. Germany has already shown interest in co-financing individual raw material projects. In September last year, Germany and Australia signed a hydrogen agreement to bring together Australian producers and German buyers of green hydrogen.

**Peter Dutton claims Australia headed for a recession under Labor | Evening News Bulletin 8 April 2025**
Peter Dutton claims that Australia is headed for a recession under the Labor government. He stated, 'It is under Labor. The government hasn't prepared our economy. Labor has made decisions in subsequent budgets now which make it harder for the economy to function with international head winds.' Dutton warned that if there are further actions from the US or retaliatory actions from China or other countries, there is a 'very significant chance of a recession in the U-S, of a global recession otherwise.' He compared the potential economic impact to 'huge tsunami waves' that will hit Australia's shores.

**'Recession under Labor': Dutton stokes fears of Trump crash**
Peter Dutton has warned of a recession under Labor, claiming that the party's spending and tax policies have made it harder for the economy to function with international headwinds. However, Treasury modelling does not predict an Australian recession, finding that real GDP will be 0.1 per cent lower than it would be without the tariffs. Labor Treasurer Jim Chalmers said Australia is 'well prepared' and that the direct impact of the tariffs on the Australian economy is 'manageable'. Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock said Australia is 'well placed' to weather uncertainty and that the falling Australian dollar would be a 'bit of a buffer' to any Chinese slowdown. Markets are pricing in an expectation that the Reserve Bank will hand down a double rate cut (50 basis points) in its next meeting, which would see the cash rate fall to 3.6 per cent.

**Australia may dodge global trade war recession but Chalmers flags 'substantial' risks to growth**
New Treasury modelling suggests that a global trade war will not drive Australia's economy into recession, but Treasurer Jim Chalmers flags 'substantial' risks to growth from Donald Trump's new tariffs. Chalmers said, 'We expect more manageable impacts on the Australian economy, but we still do expect Australian GDP to take a hit and we expect there to be an impact on prices here as well.' The modelling shows that the trade shock would trim just 0.1% off Australia's economic growth in 2025 and add 0.2 percentage points to inflation. In contrast, the US economy would be 0.8% smaller by the start of 2027, with most of the damage in this year, and Americans would suffer a 1.4-ppt spike in inflation this year. Warwick McKibbin, director of the ANU's Centre for Applied Macroeconomic Analysis, agreed that Australia could navigate a worst-case trade war scenario relatively unscathed, saying, 'Just as Australia escaped a recession during the Asian financial crisis, Australia's economic and policy flexibility puts Australia in a better position than many countries.'

**Finance guru Mark Bouris issues recession warning**
Finance guru Mark Bouris has warned that a US recession would have a significant impact on Australia's economy, potentially leading to a global trade war and inflationary cycle. Bouris stated, 'If the [US] go into recession, so will we. The rest of the whole world will.' He also suggested that this could lead to a 'really messy period' with major unemployment and inflation. The Reserve Bank of Australia has already taken note of the potential impact, citing the upcoming American import tariffs as a factor invoking caution. Governor Michele Bullock said the RBA is doing a 'scenario analysis' to predict how China, Australia's biggest trading partner, would be affected by the US tariffs and how it would respond. Bouris expects two rate cuts in 2025, with the first already issued in February. The RBA's next decision on May 20 will be made after the release of March quarter inflation data.

He stated that if the US goes into recession, Australia and the rest of the world will follow. Bouris also expressed concerns about the potential for a global tariff war, which could lead to an inflationary cycle and major economic problems. The Reserve Bank of Australia has already taken note of the potential impact, leaving the cash rate on hold at 4.1 per cent and citing the upcoming American import tariffs as a reason. Governor Michele Bullock said the RBA is doing a 'scenario analysis' to predict how China, Australia's biggest trading partner, would react to the US tariffs. Bouris also predicted that the Reserve Bank will cut interest rates twice in 2025, with the first cut already issued in February.

**A US tariff war could push Australian businesses over the edge**
Australia's economy is expected to grow at 2.2% in 2025, but US tariffs threaten to push businesses over the edge. Westpac Economics head of Australian macro-forecasting Matt Hassan said, 'Importantly, the component detail suggests the improved growth pulse is more fragile than it looks.' The tariffs could lead to a significant dampener on economic activity, making it difficult for businesses to pay their trading partners and potentially resulting in more insolvencies. CreditorWatch chief executive Patrick Coghlan warned, 'We certainly hope that the worst-case scenario of a global recession doesn't eventuate, but businesses should nevertheless be taking steps now to manage that risk.' Businesses in western Sydney and Queensland's southeast are at greatest risk of failing due to their exposure to construction and lower income levels. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has condemned the trade measures as 'economic self-harm' and says trade restrictions will mean less growth and more inflation.

**Cyclone drives Australia back into recession**
The Australian economy narrowly exited a per capita recession in Q4 2024 with 0.1% growth, but a recent cyclone is expected to push the country back into recession in Q1 2025. The cyclone, which impacted south-east Queensland and the NSW north coast, has already led to 44,000 insurance claims and estimated losses of $1.7 billion. The government expects to spend at least $1.2 billion on disaster support, adding to the already increased budget of $13.5 billion for disaster support across the country. However, reconstruction activity is expected to stimulate growth in subsequent quarters, and further interest rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of Australia are expected to assist the economy in bouncing back into positive territory.

The Australian economy showed a 1.1% growth in 2024, the sixth-worst year on record. However, the economy is no longer in a 'per capita' recession, with GDP per capita growing 0.1% in the last quarter. The growth was mainly driven by government spending and investment, as well as net exports and tourism. Despite this, the economy is still weak, with households struggling with high mortgage repayments. Economist Zac Gross notes that the per capita picture is skewed by a large spike in migration, which has made the average income lower. The Reserve Bank should be looking at these numbers and wondering why it waited until February to cut rates, and should consider cutting the rate again in April to keep the recovery going.

**Australia's economy ends 21-month per capita recession as GDP grows faster than population**
Australia's economy has ended its 21-month per capita recession, with GDP growing by 0.6% in the December quarter and 1.3% through the year. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has welcomed the data, with Governor Bullock saying the economy is making progress towards rebalancing after the surge in inflation in 2021 and 2022. Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser said the economy is 'making progress towards the ultimate goal of being rebalanced.' Economists agree that the data are positive, with forecasts of moderate growth of 1.6% in 2025, before picking up to 2.3% and 2.7% in 2026 and 2027, respectively. However, productivity remains a concern, with Australian workers becoming less productive in the December quarter. 'The worst is behind us,' said Treasurer Jim Chalmers, 'but we're not complacent because people are still under pressure and global conditions are uncertain.' 'This growth reflects a combination of moderating inflation, solid wage and employment growth, and the government's tax cuts for every taxpayer,' he said. 'This is a meaningful turnaround compared to what we inherited, when real incomes were going backwards 1.6 per cent.'

**RBA drives private sector into recession**
The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) aggressive interest rate hikes have led to a recession in the private sector, with many firms going into insolvency and employment stalling. However, the non-market sector, driven by government spending and high net overseas migration, has created 624,574 jobs since Q1 2023, accounting for 87% of Australia's total job growth. This 'burnout economics' has contributed to Australia's productivity decline, with recent labour productivity growth ranking among the bottom of advanced nations. The RBA must consider the aggregate economy, which is being artificially stimulated by the non-market sector, rather than just the private sector, to effectively slow demand and lower inflation.
