**The Lado B of the Vaca Muerta Boom: Why There Are Fewer Dollars for Gas and Oil**
Argentina is experiencing a significant boom in the energy sector, with the production of hydrocarbons showing a steady growth year after year. However, despite this growth, the provinces that produce hydrocarbons are receiving less income from royalties than the previous year. This situation presents a paradox that contrasts with the favorable general scenario of the sector. The weight of hydrocarbon royalties in the provincial coffers is considerable, representing 12.6% of the total income for the provinces that produce hydrocarbons. For Neuquén, Chubut, and Santa Cruz, these royalties are a significant proportion of their total income, being essential for solving their budgetary requirements. The main reason behind this decline in provincial royalties, even in provinces with growing production, lies in the evolution of oil prices, which have been trending downward since last year. This downward trend has been reinforced by the impact of certain policies of the new US government. The war of tariffs led by President Donald Trump is mentioned as a factor that depressed the price of oil by anticipating a decline in global GDP. According to the analysis, the price of Brent crude oil fell from $82.81 per barrel in March 2024 to $71.37 in March 2025, representing a 13.8% decline. This situation is exacerbated by the comparison for the following month: if April 2025 is compared to the same month in 2024, the decline in the price of the barrel was even more pronounced, reaching 27.6%. Given that most royalties come from crude oil, this significant decrease in its price directly impacts the income of the producing provinces, explaining why they receive less money from royalties despite the general boom in the energy sector and, in the case of Neuquén, even despite its increase in its own volumes of oil extraction.

**Iraq’s oil exports decline by 32,000 barrels per day in May - Iraqi News**
According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), Iraq's oil exports declined by 32,000 barrels per day in May 2025, reaching 3.27 million barrels per day. This is a decrease from 3.30 million barrels per day in April 2025. Iraq's oil exports are expected to be less than 3.2 million barrels per day in May and June 2025 to meet its OPEC+ production quota. In the first five months of 2025, Iraq's crude oil exports averaged approximately 3.33 million barrels per day, compared to 3.45 million barrels per day during the same period in 2024. Iraq's total seaborne exports of oil decreased to 3.66 million barrels per day in May 2025, compared to 3.87 million barrels per day in May 2024. The OPEC+ countries, including Iraq, have resumed their voluntary production cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day since April 2024, with the production limit expected to rise to 411,000 barrels per day in May, June, and July 2025. According to the most recent meeting of the eight OPEC+ countries, Iraq's crude oil production is expected to reach approximately 4.12 million barrels per day.

**Oil Price Rises Amid Wildfires and OPEC+ Production Increases**
The oil price has risen by more than $3 to $63.84 since last Friday. Bloomberg attributes this to wildfires in Canada, which have reduced daily oil production by 350,000 barrels. However, this is a temporary issue, and oil production will resume once the fires are extinguished. Additionally, the Trump administration's nuclear talks with Iran could lead to a shortage on the oil market. Despite this, there are significant reasons to believe that the oil price will fall. Oil reserves have increased rapidly in the past few weeks, which could put pressure on the global oil market due to the higher production rate of OPEC+. According to Kayrros, a company that monitors oil reserves, global oil reserves have increased by around 170 million barrels over the past 100 days. Data from OilX shows that reserves have been increasing since February. The International Energy Agency has warned of a potential surplus for most of this year due to the increased production outside of OPEC+ and the risks to consumption from President Trump's tariff policy. However, in industrialized countries, the oil price is rising again after years of decline due to OPEC+'s production cuts. The OPEC increased its production by around 200,000 barrels per day in May, as the production group began its first month of production increases, according to a Bloomberg survey on Tuesday. Part of the increase is likely due to seasonal refinery work, which dampens demand for crude oil every year. However, this year's developments go beyond the usual annual fluctuations. According to OilX data, oil reserves have grown as quickly in the three months up to April as they have not since 2020, while the amount of crude oil transported worldwide has recently reached its highest level since April 2024, according to Vortexa data. In contrast to the build-up of oil reserves, OilX reported a decline in the reserves of refined fuels in February, March, and April, while the US Energy Information Administration reported last week that diesel reserves are at their lowest level since 2005. This could prompt refineries to buy crude oil and process it into refined fuels. In the second quarter of 2025, 'global oil reserves will have grown 1.5 million barrels per day faster than in the same period last year' by mid-May, wrote Brian Leisen, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a statement.

**Global Refinery Investment to Drop to Under $30 Billion in 2025, Despite Mexico's Continued Investment**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that global investment in refineries will drop to under $30 billion in 2025, the lowest level in a decade. However, countries like Mexico are still investing in refineries, according to the IEA's 'Inversión Energética Mundial 2025' report. The report notes that investment in refineries has decreased by over 50% in advanced economies and around 10% in emerging and developing economies over the past decade. Asia and the Middle East are expected to account for around three-quarters of global investment in 2025. The report also notes that refinery capacity increased by 1.3 million barrels per day in 2024, but is expected to remain flat in 2025. The IEA points out that while new capacity of around 1.1 million barrels per day is expected to come online in 2025, mainly in China and India, this will be offset by around 1 million barrels per day of capacity being retired worldwide, mainly in North America and Europe. The Pemex refinery in Dos Bocas, Mexico, which began its first phases of operation in 2024, could potentially compensate for future retirements in North America. The report also notes that refineries are a significant source of emissions associated with oil production, and are beginning to transition to more environmentally friendly activities, such as capturing and storing carbon, and mixing it with biofuels to meet emissions reduction requirements. For example, Bapco in Bahrain is investing in carbon capture and is investing 20% of its capital expenditure in biofuels and hydrogen. Several oil refineries are diversifying their activities by investing in biofuel production facilities. The capacity for biojet and renewable diesel production increased by 25% in 2024 and is expected to increase another 40% in 2025, reaching 800,000 barrels per day. The US is expected to account for half of this growth, according to the report.

**Russia's $1.95B Oil Boom Is Over -- Crude Revenues Just Crashed**
Russia's oil export revenues have plummeted to $990 million, a 24% drop from the previous week, according to Bloomberg's tanker-tracking data. This is the lowest level since March 2023 and a far cry from the $1.95 billion peak seen in April 2024. Despite a slight rebound in prices for Russia's main export grades, the increased prices were not enough to rescue export revenues. Russia's oil export machine is losing steam, with average seaborne crude shipments sliding to 3.24 million barrels per day, down 170,000 from the prior period. The data suggests that Russia may be nearing the ceiling of what it can produce, and investors may want to focus less on quotas and more on actual loading volumes to gauge its real production firepower.

**US oil production forecasted to peak at 14mbbl/d in 2027: EIA report**
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that US oil production will peak at 14 million barrels per day (mbbl/d) in 2027 and maintain this level until the end of the decade, before declining. The EIA's Annual Energy Outlook suggests that former US President Joe Biden's policies have influenced this trajectory, despite record-setting oil output during his tenure in 2023 and 2024. The Department of Energy (DOE) attributed this decline to Biden's policies, stating they have set a 'disastrous path' for US energy production. US shale oil production is projected to peak at 10mbbl/d in 2027, up from around 9.69mbbl/d this year, before declining to 9.33mbl/d by 2050. The post-pandemic recovery in US oil demand is expected to stabilise next year, with demand edging up slightly from 20.51mbbl/d this year to 20.52mbbl/d next year. Brent crude is expected to average $67.87 a barrel (bbl) this year, down from an earlier forecast of $74.22/bbl. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is forecasted to average $63.88/bbl in 2025, nearly $7 below the prior forecast.

**US Oil Production Expected to Peak in 2027, Followed by Sharp Decline by 2050**
According to the US Energy Information Administration, US oil production is expected to peak in 2027 at approximately 14 million barrels per day, remaining at this level until the end of the decade before rapidly declining. By 2050, production is expected to drop to around 11.28 million barrels per day, down from around 13.69 million barrels per day in 2025. The administration also forecasts that the price of Brent crude oil will be $91 per barrel and US crude oil will be $89 per barrel in 2049.

**US Crude Oil Reserves Register Uptick**
U.S. domestic crude oil inventories have increased by 2.6 million barrels, with a total of 442.3 million barrels, which is 5% lower than the five-year average. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) report suggests that this increase could be due to a jump in overall production, an oversupply, or lower overall usage. Crude oil refinery inputs have also gone up by 69,000 barrels per day, with refineries operating at 86.7% of their operable capacity. The EIA report also predicts that oil inventories will build and place downward pressure on crude oil prices in late-2025 and through 2026, with the Brent crude oil price expected to fall to an average of $68/b in 2026. The decrease in oil production is attributed to lower output from Iran and Venezuela. According to the EIA report, 'We expect oil inventories will build and place downward pressure on crude oil prices in late-2025 and through 2026 when we expect OPEC+ unwinds production cuts and non-OPEC oil production grows.'

**US oil rig count rises to highest since June, Baker Hughes says**
According to Baker Hughes, the number of oil rigs in the US rose to 489, the highest since June, while the total oil and gas rig count fell to 590. Despite this, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that crude output will increase from 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 to 13.6 million bpd in 2025, while gas output is expected to rise to 105.2 billion cubic feet per day in 2025. Analysts forecast a 91% increase in spot gas prices in 2025, prompting producers to boost drilling activity this year. 'The EIA projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 to around 13.6 million bpd in 2025,' said the report. 'On the gas side, the EIA projected a 91% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year.'

**IEA Lowers Oil Demand Growth Forecast for 2025**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has lowered its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2025, expecting a surplus in supply due to the expected increase in production from the 'OPEC+' alliance and the momentum of US supplies. The agency said in its monthly report that it expects global oil demand to grow by more than 1 million barrels per day this year, slightly more than its previous estimate of 1.1 million barrels per day. The IEA noted that the average oil price fell by $7 per barrel in February and early March due to a decline in sentiment caused by the overall economic turmoil and rising global trade tensions, as well as 'OPEC+' plans to increase production in April. The agency also pointed out that US production of crude oil is at record levels at present, and it is expected to be the main reason for global production growth in 2025. The IEA estimated that a surplus of 600,000 barrels per day will occur this year, and noted that this surplus could increase by an additional 400,000 barrels per day if the 'OPEC+' alliance continues to abandon its voluntary production cuts after April without limiting the supplies of member countries that exceed their targeted production levels.

**IEA Lowers Global Oil Demand Growth Forecast for 2025**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has lowered its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2025, expecting a surplus in supply due to the expected increase in production from the OPEC+ alliance and the momentum of US supplies. According to the agency's monthly report released today, it expects global oil demand to grow by more than 1 million barrels per day this year, slightly more than its previous estimate of 1.1 million barrels per day. The report states that Asian countries, led by China, will be responsible for around 60% of the expected growth in demand, driven by the growth of the petrochemical sector in Beijing. The IEA noted that the average oil price fell by $7 per barrel in February and early March due to a decline in sentiment caused by the deterioration of the overall economic situation and the escalation of global trade tensions, as well as OPEC+ plans to increase production in April. The agency also pointed out that US production from crude oil is at record levels at the moment, and it is expected that Washington's supplies will be the main driver of global production growth in 2025. The IEA estimated that a surplus of 600,000 barrels per day will occur this year, and pointed out that the surplus could increase by an additional 400,000 barrels per day if the OPEC+ alliance continues to abandon voluntary production cuts after April without limiting the supplies of member countries that exceed their targeted production levels.
