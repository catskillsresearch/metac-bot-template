**3 Foods to Avoid at Breakfast, According to American Cardiologists**
Two American cardiologists, Dr. Andrew Freeman and Prof. Susan Cheng, shared their morning routine and recommended foods to avoid and include in a healthy breakfast. According to Dr. Freeman, it's best to avoid bacon and processed meats due to their high salt and additive content, as well as the risk of cancer and heart disease. He also recommends limiting the consumption of pancakes and waffles, and instead opting for whole-grain alternatives. Additionally, he suggests avoiding pastries and viennoiseries, which are high in sugar and unhealthy fats. On the other hand, Dr. Freeman recommends starting the day with a whole-grain toast topped with avocado, and incorporating other healthy foods such as oats, fruits, and nuts into the breakfast routine. Prof. Cheng also recommends making a smoothie with fruits, vegetables, and plant-based protein sources like peas, and adding a small amount of water and unsweetened soy milk.

**Clear Labeling of Allergens: A Must for Food Manufacturers**
The Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) has reminded food manufacturers to clearly label the 14 main allergens on packaged products, as required by the EU Regulation 1169/2011. These allergens include gluten, crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soy, milk, nuts, sesame, sulfur dioxide, mustard, and others. If a product does not have a list of ingredients, the label must state 'Contains + allergen'. Additionally, if there is a risk of cross-contamination, the label must indicate 'May contain...'. AESAN emphasizes that this information is not only required for packaged products but also for restaurants, bulk sales, and online orders. The agency also highlights the importance of clear labeling, launching campaigns like #Safe2eat to inform and engage Europeans on food safety. As AESAN states, 'The label is the communication channel between the food operator and the consumer, and it must be clear and accessible to everyone, regardless of age or vision.'

**FDA Issues Warning on Mislabeled Gluten-Free Cookies: Severe Risk Confirmed**
The US FDA has classified the recent recall of several gluten-free cookies by New Grains Gluten Free Bakery as a 'Class I' risk, the highest level, due to the presence of undeclared allergens such as eggs, milk, and soy. The agency found that the cookies, including Chocolate Chip, Frosted Sugar, Coconut Macaroon, and Brownie Chocolate Chip, contained these ingredients without proper labeling, posing a severe risk to individuals with food allergies. The FDA estimates that millions of people in the US live with food allergies or sensitivities, and the agency warns that reactions can range from mild symptoms to life-threatening anaphylaxis. The bakery has not publicly disclosed the number of units distributed, but the recall is limited to the state of Utah. The FDA recommends that consumers who have purchased the affected products do not consume them and instead return them to the point of purchase for a full refund.

**Is Soy a Healthier Option than Meat?**
Many people around the world use soy as a substitute for meat due to its high protein content and perceived health benefits. However, is soy really a healthier option than meat? According to experts, soy is a better choice, especially for those looking to reduce their intake of saturated fats and cholesterol found in red meat. Soy contains all essential amino acids, making it a high-quality protein source. Additionally, it is low in saturated fats and cholesterol, making it a healthier option for those with heart problems and high cholesterol. Dr. [no doctor is quoted in the article] notes that soy also provides a sense of fullness and contains iron and other minerals essential for overall health. Studies have shown that soy can reduce the risk of certain cancers, such as prostate, breast, and colon cancer, due to its isoflavone and saponin content. However, it is recommended to consume soy in moderation, as excessive consumption can have negative effects on some individuals. A balanced diet that includes a variety of protein sources and other nutrients is essential for optimal health. Soy can be used in a variety of dishes, such as tacos, ceviche, and vegan tuna, making it a versatile and delicious ingredient.

**Soy: A Healthy and Sustainable Choice for Women's Health**
A recent study published in Advances in Nutrition has debunked the myth that soy is bad for women's health. In fact, soy may have a positive impact on women's health and contribute to sustainable development. The study found that soy products can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, which are a leading cause of death among women, especially during menopause. Isoflavones, a type of phytoestrogen found in soy, have been shown to have a positive effect on women's health, including reducing the risk of hormone-dependent cancers such as breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. Isoflavones may also improve bone health, memory, and alleviate menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. This makes soy a potential alternative to hormone replacement therapy, which is not suitable for all women, especially those with cardiovascular disease or estrogen-sensitive tumors. Despite the benefits, there are still many myths surrounding soy. Early animal studies suggested that isoflavones may promote tumor growth, but human studies have not confirmed these risks. However, soy consumption remains low in North America, with only about 3-4% of the population consuming soy products daily. In light of new dietary recommendations emphasizing plant-based proteins for human health and the planet, soy is considered one of the most eco-friendly and accessible sources of complete protein. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 40 randomized controlled trials involving 3285 postmenopausal women found that soy isoflavones had no adverse effects on estrogen-sensitive indicators, including endometrial thickness, vaginal epithelial maturation, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol levels. The study's authors conclude that isoflavones are safe and that soy can be a healthy food choice for women's heart health and hormonal balance, as well as a sustainable option from an ecological perspective.

**Soy Debunked: New Study Finds Isoflavones Safe and Beneficial for Women's Health**
A recent study published in Advances in Nutrition has debunked the myth that soy is bad for women.

The study found that soy products can help reduce the risk of heart disease, which is a major cause of death among women, especially during menopause.

Despite the benefits, there are still many myths surrounding soy. However, human studies have not confirmed the risks associated with isoflavones, which were previously found in animal studies. In fact, a new systematic review and meta-analysis published in Advances in Nutrition found that soy isoflavones do not increase estrogenic effects in women. The study analyzed 40 randomized controlled trials involving 3285 postmenopausal women and found no significant increase in estrogen-sensitive indicators after soy isoflavone consumption. This means that isoflavones do not behave in the body like hormone replacement therapy. The effects of soy isoflavones were also found to be consistent regardless of the form of soy consumed - capsules, drinks, or food products. The authors also highlight that whole soy products contain a range of bioactive compounds that may provide additional health benefits, particularly in reducing cholesterol levels.

**Hidden Dangers in Vegetable Drinks: A Nutritional Warning**
The Organization of Consumers and Users (OCU) has published a report titled 'Vegetable drinks: pros and cons', warning about the low nutritional value of popular vegetable drinks, known as 'soy milk', 'oat milk', 'rice milk', or 'almond milk'. According to the analysis of 213 products, these alternatives to cow's milk are composed of 90% water, making them more of a hydrating drink than a nutritious food. High price This data questions their price, 92% higher than traditional milk, and their perception as a healthy substitute. The report highlights that only soy milk provides protein levels comparable to milk, although it warns about isoflavones, compounds that mimic estrogens and could act as endocrine disruptors, advising against their consumption in pregnant women and children. In contrast, oat and rice milk have similar sugar levels to milk, but their protein contribution is minimal. Additionally, although some are enriched with calcium, their bioavailability is lower than that of lactose, according to studies such as those from the Spanish Food Composition Database (BEDCA). Hidden danger The OCU also notes the presence of additives such as stabilizers, thickeners, and added sugars in 63% of cases, which detract from their healthy profile. Among the best options, brands such as Vegetánea Soja sin azúcares (Central Lechera Asturiana) and Ecocesta Avena stand out, although the latter is not suitable for celiacs due to possible gluten. Agencies such as the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) support the idea that vegetable drinks do not have the same nutritional value as milk, recommending that they be complemented in specific diets. This report invites consumers to review labels and reconsider their use as a milk substitute.

**5 'Healthy' Foods to Avoid, According to a Doctor**
According to Dr. Naheed Ali, a cardiologist, 'people who drink this beverage in the morning have a greater hope of life.' However, Dr. Ali warns that just because a product is labeled as 'healthy' doesn't mean it's actually good for you. When shopping, he advises to 'look beyond the marketing and pay attention to how a food really affects you in the long run.' Dr. Ali identifies five 'healthy' foods that are actually unhealthy: 1. Flavored yogurts that seem nutritious are often loaded with added sugars, artificial flavors, and stabilizers. 2. Processed vegetarian alternatives to meat, such as highly processed veggie burgers and fake meats, are another food to avoid. 3. Refined oils like colza, soy, and corn oil, which are often marketed as healthy for the heart, are actually highly refined and contain omega-6 fatty acids. 4. Protein bars that are essentially just chocolate bars with added protein powder are also unhealthy. 5. Even if a product is labeled as 'totally natural' or 'without added sugar,' it often lacks fiber and contains more sugar than a soda. Dr. Ali recommends alternatives like Greek yogurt with fresh fruit or a drizzle of honey, legumes or tofu in their natural form, virgin olive oil or avocado oil for cooking, a handful of nuts, a hard-boiled egg, or homemade energy balls made with nut butter and oats.
