**Experimental quantum-enhanced kernel-based machine learning on a photonic processor - Nature Photonics**
Researchers have experimentally demonstrated the use of quantum-enhanced kernel-based machine learning on a photonic processor. This approach has the potential to improve the performance of classical computers for practical tasks. The team investigated whether quantum computing can enhance the operation of classical computers for machine learning tasks, and found that a quantum feature map can be more suitable for preserving the similarity among data that belong to the same class. They used a photonic platform based on an integrated photonic processor to map the data to be classified and estimate quantum and classical kernels. The results show that photonic kernels outperform classical methods and that the accuracies are further enhanced in kernels displaying quantum interference. This achievement has the potential to revolutionize machine learning and grant new possibilities for classification tasks.

**Do you really need "post-quantum" encryption for your VPN or storage?**
The advent of quantum computing poses a threat to modern encryption algorithms, particularly asymmetric cryptography. Researchers have developed 'post-quantum' cryptography (PQC) schemes to secure data against quantum attacks. PQC algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, and FALCON are being standardized by NIST. However, these new algorithms come with trade-offs, such as larger key and message sizes, and a lack of real-world testing. The practical integration of PQC is a massive hurdle, requiring software and hardware updates. For now, most personal needs are still secure with current encryption, but organizations handling sensitive data should prepare for a post-quantum transition. NIST expects organizations to have transitioned away from RSA-2048 and comparable ECC to PQC algorithms by 2030, and will disallow their use in 2035.

**This tiny quantum computer could blow massive data centers out of the water with speed, power, and pure physics**
Nord Quantique, a quantum computing startup, aims to develop a utility-scale quantum computer with over 1,000 logical qubits by 2031. Their machine uses 'multimode encoding' via the Tesseract code, allowing for excellent error correction capabilities without the need for physical qubits. According to CEO Julien Camirand Lemyre, 'Multimode encoding allows us to build quantum computers with excellent error correction capabilities, but without the impediment of all those physical qubits.' The company claims their machines will be smaller, more efficient, and consume less energy, making traditional HPC systems obsolete. In a technical demonstration, Nord's system exhibited excellent stability over 32 error correction cycles with no measurable decay in quantum information. Yvonne Gao, Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore, said, 'Their approach of encoding logical qubits in multimode Tesseract states is a very effective method of addressing error correction and I am impressed with these results.' However, independent validation and repeatability remain critical for long-term trust. Nord Quantique claims their system could solve RSA-830 in just one hour using 120 kWh of energy, slashing the energy need by 99% compared to traditional HPC systems.

**Anthropic CEO Predicts Technological Singularity in Six Months**
According to the CEO of Anthropic, the human race is only six months away from reaching technological singularity, a concept where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. This prediction contrasts with the most conservative scientific estimates, but reflects the unprecedented acceleration in the development of artificial intelligence since the emergence of models like ChatGPT. The study by AIMultiple, which examines 8,590 predictions from scientists, business leaders, and the tech community, reveals that expectations about the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and singularity have changed dramatically in recent years. While scientists predict AGI around 2040, business leaders are more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The study documents how predictions vary over a nearly 50-year spectrum, from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to estimates that extend several decades. However, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, with industry leaders consistently more optimistic in their predictions than the scientific community in general. The study examines different thresholds of AI, including AGI and superintelligence, providing a comprehensive view of expectations in the field. The research tracks changes in these predictions over time, especially after the emergence of large language models that have transformed the landscape. The analysis offers several perspectives on why many experts consider the arrival of AGI inevitable, including the lack of apparent limits to machine intelligence, the Law of Moore, and the potential of quantum computing to compensate for engineering barriers. Not all experts consider AGI a certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is more multifaceted than the current definition of AGI. Yann LeCun, a pioneer of deep learning, suggests that AGI should be rebranded as 'advanced machine intelligence' and argues that human intelligence is too specialized to be replicable. The report also notes that, although AI can be a valuable tool for making new discoveries, it cannot make these discoveries on its own. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, allowing for more discoveries per experiment,' the analysis details. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer,' the document obtained by AIMultiple states. While individual predictions from experts and scientists about AGI vary over a period of approximately half a century, the message is clear: human society will inevitably face incredible changes as a result of these algorithms. Whether these changes will be good or bad, according to the research, depends on us.

**A one-million-qubit machine could crack 2048-bit RSA in seven days, study finds**
A recent study from Google Quantum AI suggests that a one-million-qubit machine could crack 2048-bit RSA encryption in seven days, reducing earlier estimates by twentyfold. The study demonstrates that using approximation rather than exact modular exponentiation and denser error-correction schemes can cut physical-qubit requirements by a factor of twenty. However, current hardware still lags behind the study's hypothetical machine, with leading processors like IBM's 1,121-qubit Condor and Google's 53-qubit Sycamore remaining orders of magnitude smaller. The study offers a concrete threat model for both hardware designers and policy makers, highlighting the need for migration to post-quantum cryptography algorithms, which NIST urges to be implemented by 2030 and deprecated by 2035.
