**UK Invests Billions in Military and Defense Amid Ongoing Ukraine Conflict**
The UK has announced significant investments in its military and defense, with a focus on achieving 'war-readiness' and strengthening the NATO alliance. According to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the central task is to make the armed forces ready for war, and to contribute to the strength of the western military alliance with a 'Nato-first' approach. Starmer stated, 'The front line, if you will, is here' in reference to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. The government plans to invest £15 billion (approximately €18 billion) in programs related to the production of nuclear warheads, which is expected to create tens of thousands of jobs across the country. The UK's armed forces are expected to be ten times more capable by 2035, according to Starmer. He emphasized that being prepared to secure 'peace through strength' is the most effective way to deter states that directly threaten the UK. The Ministry of Defense had previously announced a £1.5 billion investment in the production of munitions, with plans to build at least six new factories. The armed forces will also receive more advanced weapons with greater range. As Defense Minister John Healey noted, 'Russia's unlawful invasion of Ukraine has starkly shown that a military is only as strong as the industry behind it.'

**UK Defense Strategy Enters War-Ready Mode Amid European Tensions**
British Prime Minister Kier Starmer announced that the UK government is increasing funding for the defense sector to prepare for potential military conflicts in a growingly tense Europe. 'Our goal is to ensure the military's combat readiness,' Starmer emphasized during a press conference broadcast by Sky News. He stated that the country's security will be based on cooperation with NATO allies, and that the UK will not act alone. Starmer also revealed plans to implement innovations in the armed forces at a 'military pace.' By 2035, the British army is expected to become 'ten times more deadly.' It's worth noting that Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly stated that Russia has no intention of going to war with Europe or NATO, nor interfering in their internal affairs.

**UK Shifts to 'War Readiness' Mode Amid Plans to Increase Military Spending**
The UK is shifting to a 'war readiness' mode as part of its new defense strategy, said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. 'We are moving to a state of war readiness, which will be the main goal of our armed forces. When directly threatened by states with advanced military capabilities, the most effective way to deter them is to be ready and show that we are prepared to maintain peace through force,' Sunak said during a press conference in Glasgow, dedicated to the new strategic defense review of the government. The UK government will publish a strategic defense review on Monday, amid plans to increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027. The document will include recommendations on defense policy. The previous review was published in 2021 and was revised after the start of the Ukrainian conflict. Recommendations will cover both external and internal security, the UK's policy on the Ukrainian conflict, military modernization, and nuclear doctrine. The new strategy will solidify Sunak's plan to increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027. The government will also aim to increase defense spending to 3% of GDP, but has not yet made specific promises. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously explained in an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson that Moscow has no intention of attacking NATO countries, as it would make no sense. Putin noted that Western politicians regularly scare their citizens with a fictional Russian threat to distract from internal problems, but 'smart people understand that it's a fake.' Russia has been claiming an unprecedented level of NATO activity near its western borders in recent years. NATO has expanded its initiatives and calls it 'deterrence of Russian aggression.' Moscow has repeatedly expressed concern about the alliance's growing military presence in Europe. The Kremlin has stated that Russia poses no threat to anyone, but will not ignore actions that could be potentially hazardous to its interests.

**Britain to get defence boost to send message to Moscow  --  and possibly Trump**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with Starmer saying 'we have to recognise the world has changed' and 'with greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.' The Government will accept all 62 recommendations made in the strategic defence review, including building new nuclear-powered attack submarines and creating an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defence Secretary John Healey said the changes would send 'a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and even 3% falls short of what some leaders in NATO think is needed to deter Russia from future attacks on its neighbors.

**Nato must be ready for war with Russia by 2029, Germany warns**
Germany's defence chief, Breuer, warned that NATO must be ready for a war with Russia by 2029, citing Russia's rapid production of weaponry, including 1,500 battle tanks and four million rounds of artillery each year. Breuer stated, 'There's an intent and there's a build up of the stocks.' He emphasized that NATO must be prepared to fight tonight, not just in 2029. The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are particularly vulnerable, and Breuer urged fellow NATO nations to rebuild their militaries. The UK has announced plans to build a dozen new nuclear submarines armed with Tomahawk missiles, bolstering its nuclear warhead programme, which Defence Secretary John Healey said is 'what Putin fears most.'

**NATO Warns of Possible Russian Attack by 2029**
NATO's member countries should prepare for a possible Russian attack within the next four years, according to Germany's defense chief, General Carsten Breuer. He told the BBC that Russia is producing hundreds of tanks annually and many of these could be used in an attack on NATO's Baltic member countries by 2029 or earlier. 'We are facing a very serious threat from Russia, a threat I have never seen in my 40 years of service,' Breuer said. He claims that Russia is building up its forces 'to an enormous degree' and producing around 1500 tanks per year, not all of which are being used in the war in Ukraine, but also stored for future use against the West. 'There is an intention and a buildup of reserves for a possible future attack on NATO's Baltic member countries. Analysts estimate that this could happen in 2029. So we must be clear by 2029,' Breuer said. 'If you ask me now if this is a guarantee that it won't happen before 2029, I would say no. So we must be able to fight already tonight,' he added. Breuer pointed out the Suwalki Corridor, a region bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable areas. NATO forces, including those from Norway, have had a significant presence in the Suwalki Corridor in recent years to show muscle against Russia. 'What we need to do now is really to lean in and tell everyone: Come on, step up... engage more in this, because we need it. We need it to be able to defend ourselves and thus also build up deterrence,' Breuer said.

**NATO Faces 'Very Serious Threat' from Russia, Says German General**
According to General Carsten Breuer, the inspector general of the German Bundeswehr, NATO is facing a 'very serious threat' from Russia, which he has never seen in his 40 years of service. Russia is increasing its military forces 'on a massive scale', producing around 1,500 main battle tanks annually. Not all of these tanks are sent to the front for the war in Ukraine, but remain in storage and in new military structures always oriented towards the West, said Breuer. Russia has also produced 4.152 million 152mm artillery shells in 2024, and not all of them have gone to war against Ukraine. Breuer stated that Russia is 'intentional' and 'stockpiling' for a possible future attack on Baltic countries. 'This is an assessment of analysts - (the attack may occur in 2029 - 24 Kanal) in 2029. Therefore, we must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it will not happen before 2029, I would say no, it is not. Therefore, we must be able to fight today,' said Breuer. The minister named the Suwalki Corridor, a territory bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable points for an aggressor's attack. 'The Baltic countries are indeed very vulnerable to the Russians, are they not? And as soon as you're there, you really feel it... in the negotiations we're conducting there,' said Breuer. According to him, Estonians compare a possible war to being near a forest fire, where they 'feel the heat, see the flames, and smell the smoke', while in Germany 'it's probably just a little smoke on the horizon, and no more.' General Breuer said that this demonstrates different views among European states on the threat of a possible Russian attack.

**UK Prepares for Military Confrontation with Russia, Increases Defense Spending**
British Defense Minister John Helly stated that the UK is prepared for a military confrontation with Russia, considering the increase in the country's military spending and industrial base as part of its preparations for war. According to the Daily Express, Helly said, 'This is a message to Moscow. Britain is strengthening its military forces and industrial base. This is part of our preparations for war if necessary.' Helly also announced that the UK aims to spend 3% of its GDP on defense by 2034, stating that he has 'no doubts' about the country's ability to achieve this goal. Recent Western rhetoric has escalated around a potential 'military confrontation' with Russia, with repeated statements in the West about the possibility of a direct military conflict between NATO and Moscow, citing unprecedented activity near Russia's western borders.

**NATO Recognizes Russia as Long-Term Threat, Warns of Potential Attack**
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg (not Mark Rütte, as mentioned in the article, which seems to be a mistake) stated that the US and its European partners recognize Russia as a long-term threat to NATO. 'We all in NATO agree that Russia is a long-term threat to NATO territory - to the entire Euro-Atlantic territory,' he said. The US remains committed to NATO, despite its growing focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Western media have reported on the possibility of a Russian attack on NATO countries in 2025, with some sources in intelligence suggesting that Russia may be planning a strike. In Germany, officials have warned of a potential Russian attack from 2026 or later. US intelligence has stated that Russia does not want a direct military conflict with the US and NATO, but will continue to engage in asymmetric activities that do not cross the threshold of a global war. Finland's Iltalehti reported in December 2024 that Russia had been practicing an attack on Finland and the Baltic countries, including Estonia, and had not ruled out carrying out the plan. Polish Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz stated on January 10, 2025, that Poland could be attacked by Russia, and that the country needs to be prepared for any scenario. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on January 23, 2025, that the growing Russian army makes it possible that Russia could attempt to attack NATO countries in 2029-2030. He emphasized the importance of strengthening the alliance's defense capabilities by that time. Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski stated earlier that Russia is currently unable to attack another country due to its involvement in the war against Ukraine, but that preparations should be made for another Russian aggression by 2030.

**Europe's War with Russia: A Military Expert's Perspective**
A military expert, Alexander Tikhansky, shares his opinion on the potential war between Europe and Russia in 2030. He questions whether the US has a strategy and a well-thought-out plan, or if their actions in international relations and domestic policy are impulsive. Tikhansky notes that Europe has failed to form a strong coalition on Ukraine, starting with peacekeepers but ending up with an unclear goal. He also mentions that the US is distancing itself from NATO exercises after 2025. The expert believes that Europe is preparing for war with Russia and Belarus, with 2030 being a turning point towards full combat readiness. He also suggests that the US idea of 'war until the last Ukrainian' is a contradiction, as the US is now prioritizing peace and mercy towards both Ukrainian and Russian people. Tikhansky concludes that the situation in NATO is too volatile, with internal conflicts and contradictions, and that the US and Europe are not prepared for a potential humanitarian catastrophe or civil war.

**Germany's BND Warns of Russia's Plans for Large-Scale War with NATO**
According to the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND), Russia is preparing for a large-scale war with NATO. The BND report states that the Kremlin views its relations with the West as a systemic conflict and is willing to use force to achieve its goals. The BND estimates that by the end of the current decade (2030), Russia may be fully prepared for a 'large-scale conventional war'. The Lithuanian intelligence service believes that while Russia is not yet ready to attack the entire alliance, it may 'test NATO' by launching military operations against one or more member countries to understand how the alliance will react to a threat. The BND report notes that despite the full-scale war with Ukraine, Russia's air force and navy remain combat-ready. If the war in Ukraine ends, Russian troops may be redeployed to the borders of Baltic countries. The report also states that Russia is replenishing its losses in the war against Ukraine and the Russian defense industry is producing more weapons than needed for the current war. Russia's military spending is growing at a record pace, reaching nearly €120 billion in 2025, which is 6% of its GDP. The Kremlin also plans to increase the size of its army to 1.5 million personnel and increase the amount of equipment and technology on its borders with NATO by 30-50%. As a reminder, Russia has already predicted 15 possible military conflict scenarios by 2045. About half of these scenarios relate to Northern Europe. 'Russia will try to resolve the Ukrainian issue by 2026,' said Vadim Skibitsky, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, during a roundtable discussion 'New contours of European security'. 'If the war continues for another 5-10 years, Russia will never be able to catch up with the US and China,' Skibitsky added. The Kremlin's geopolitical calculations relate to the period 2026-2035, with consequences extending to 2045. Countries in the Baltic region and Poland are at particular risk, according to Skibitsky.

**Russia Predicts 15 Possible Military Conflict Scenarios by 2045, Direct Threat to Poland**
Russia has predicted 15 possible military conflict scenarios by 2045, with six of them affecting Northern Europe. According to General-Major Vadim Skibitsky, deputy head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, countries in Northern Europe, particularly the Baltic states and Poland, are aware of the potential threat. Skibitsky stated that Poland is directly threatened by four possible military conflict scenarios. 'For Poland, there are only four scenarios of a possible military conflict. Poland now understands that this is a direct threat,' he said. Russia has previously prepared a forecast of events from 2026 to 2035 with a perspective to 2045, identifying four possible scenarios of the world order. The first scenario involves the absolute dominance of the US, the second the strengthening of China's role, the third a multipolar world where Russia aims to become one of the key players, and the fourth regionalization, or the division of influence into separate regions. Skibitsky noted that Russia's strategic documents clearly state the intention to complete the 'Ukrainian question' by 2026. He believes this is because a prolonged war for 5-10 years would prevent Russia from reaching the level of the US and China, leaving it a regional player in Eastern Europe. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius previously stated that, considering the growth of the Russian army, there is a possibility of Russia attempting to attack NATO countries in 2029-2030. In response, he emphasized the importance of strengthening the Alliance's defense capabilities before then.

Russia has identified 15 possible scenarios for military conflicts by 2045, with six of them related to Northern Europe.

Russia previously prepared a forecast of the development of events for 2026-2035 with a perspective to 2045, identifying four possible scenarios of the world order. The first scenario assumes the absolute dominance of the US, the second - the strengthening of China's role, the third - a multipolar world where Russia seeks to occupy a place among key players, and the fourth - regionalization, i.e. the division of influence into separate regions. Skібіцький noted that in Russian strategic documents, it is clearly stated that Russia intends to complete the 'Ukrainian question' by 2026. He believes that this is related to the fact that a prolonged war for 5-10 years will prevent Russia from reaching the level of the US and China, leaving it a regional player in Eastern Europe. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius stated in January that, given the growth of the Russian army, there is a possibility of Russia's attempt to attack NATO countries in 2029-2030. In this regard, he emphasized the importance of strengthening the defense capabilities of the Alliance by that time.

**German Intelligence Chief Warns of Russian Threat to Europe**
The head of German intelligence, Kahl, stated that if the war in Ukraine were to last another 5 years, it would be safer for Europe. However, he believes that if the war between Russia and Ukraine ends before 2029-2030, Russia will be able to use its resources to create a threat to Europe sooner. 'A quick end to the war in Ukraine would allow the Russians to use their energy where they really want to, namely against Europe', Kahl said. According to Kahl, Russia aims to restore the world order that existed in Europe in the late 1990s, without American troops on the continent and with an expansion of Russian influence in the West. Kahl also stated that Russia wants to test the unity of Western countries and the effectiveness of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which considers an attack on one NATO member country as an attack on all. 'We very much hope that this will not happen... But we must assume that Russia wants to test us, to check the unity of the West', Kahl said. The head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, responded to Kahl's statements. 'No, dear, you will still not avoid war with Russia in four-five years because you are lazy and do not want to change your society. Only the Nordics, Poland, and France are ready to resist. Germany is not even able to make a Tauros one move faster than in a year and a half', Kovalenko wrote in Telegram. He also stated that 'it will never be safer' and called on people to prepare 'already now'. 'I understand the psychology of the Russians - they will attack NATO countries regardless of us, as long as you are weak', Kovalenko emphasized.

**German Intelligence Chief: Russia May Test NATO's Collective Defense Before 2030**
The head of German intelligence, Bruno Kahl, believes that Russia will likely try to test the effectiveness of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on collective defense. He suggests that if the war in Ukraine ends in the near future, this risk will become greater. 'We very much hope that this will not happen... But we must assume that Russia wants to test us, to check the unity of the West,' Kahl said in an interview with Deutsche Welle, as reported by 'European Truth' citing dpa. Kahl believes that the time and likelihood of such a 'test' are directly related to the development of events in the Russian-Ukrainian war. If the war ends before 2029-2030, Kahl said, Russia will be able to become a threat to Europe more quickly. 'It is also possible that a specific threat or attempt at blackmail by Russia against European states will occur earlier than previously thought... An earlier end to the war in Ukraine would allow the Russians to redirect their energy to where they want it most - against Europe,' Kahl said. According to Kahl, Russia hopes that the future contours of the world order will be similar to those in the 1990s, and that Russia's sphere of influence will expand further westward, with the United States withdrawing its troops from Europe in the most desirable scenario.

**Russia's Plans to Test Western Unity and NATO's Article 5**
According to Tysklands etterretningssjef Bruno Kahl, Russia has intentions to test Western unity and NATO's Article 5 with an attack on a NATO country. Kahl said, 'We hope it's not true and that we won't be put in the difficult situation of it being tested. But we must assume that Russia will test us, that Western unity will be tested.' The timing of a test of NATO's collective defense clause depends on the outcome of the war in Ukraine. If the war ends earlier than 2029 or 2030, Russia may use its technical, material, and human resources to build a threat to Europe earlier, Kahl said. 'It's also possible that concrete threats or extortion attempts from Russia against European countries can occur earlier than expected,' he added. Kahl believes that a earlier end to the war in Ukraine would allow Russia to focus on its main goal, which is Europe. According to Kahl, Russia wants a future power balance that resembles Europe in the 1990s, but with weakened NATO influence and stronger Russian influence westward - ideally without American presence in Europe.

**20 countries lined up to join PM's 'coalition' to face down Russian aggression**
Twenty countries are set to join a coalition led by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to counter Russian aggression, as Ukraine outlines its plan for peace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized that any peace deal must include a cessation of air and sea attacks, and the release of all prisoners of war. Zelensky stated, 'Everyone needs to make sure that Russia, as the sole source of this war, accepts the need to end it.' Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned that direct involvement from NATO members would not be allowed. Polish President Andrzej Duda called for all NATO countries to increase their defence spending to 3% of GDP immediately, saying, 'We cannot wait until 2030.' The coalition plans to present its proposals to US President Donald Trump when finalized.
