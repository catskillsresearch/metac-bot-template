**China Warns US Not to 'Play with Fire' on Taiwan Issue**
China warned the US not to 'play with fire' regarding Taiwan in response to a speech by US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at a defense forum in Singapore. Hegseth stated that the US will not leave its allies in the Indo-Pacific region alone in the face of China's growing military and economic pressure, and emphasized the need for them to contribute more to their own defense. China's embassy in Singapore condemned Hegseth's speech, calling it 'provocative' and 'instigative'. Hegseth claimed that China is preparing to use military force to alter the balance of power in Asia, a region it seeks to dominate and control. He added that China is improving its capabilities, training daily to invade Taiwan. The Chinese government stated in a statement that Taiwan is a purely internal matter of China and that no country is in a position to interfere. 'The US should never imagine that it can use the Taiwan issue as a lever against China. The US should never play with fire on this issue,' China urged. 'China calls on the US to fully adhere to the principle of one China and stop supporting and encouraging separatist forces seeking Taiwan's 'independence'.'

**China rejects US defence chief's warnings on Taiwan invasion threat**
China has rejected US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's warnings about the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, calling them 'groundless accusations'. Hegseth had warned that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan 'would result in devastating consequences'. China's National Defence University vice president, Hu Gangfeng, said the accusations were 'nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region'. Australia's Defence Minister, Richard Marles, pointed out that China's largest conventional military build-up since World War II is happening without strategic reassurance and without a clear strategic intent. Australia is increasing its defence spending, aiming to reach 2.33 per cent of GDP by 2033-34, and is on track to receive eight new nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS agreement.

**China slams Hegseth speech, accuses US of seeking to use Taiwan issue as 'leverage' against Beijing**
China has slammed US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, accusing the US of seeking to use the Taiwan issue as 'leverage' against Beijing.

The spokesperson reiterated that the Taiwan issue is purely China's internal affair and called on Washington to cease support for 'Taiwan independence' forces and fully adhere to the One-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques.

**US Warns of Devastating Consequences if China Attempts to Conquer Taiwan**
US Defense Secretary Hegseth warned that there would be 'devastating consequences' for the region and the world if China were to attempt to 'conquer' Taiwan. He stated this at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a prestigious security forum in Asia. Hegseth also mentioned that it is public knowledge that Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered his military to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027. However, he added that President Donald Trump has also stated that China will not invade Taiwan under his supervision. Hegseth's goal is to prevent war, make its costs too high, and make peace the only option.

**Taiwan's Experience: A Lesson from Ukraine in the Face of Chinese Aggression**
The experience of Ukraine could serve as an example for Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack, according to former Australian Prime Minister. Taiwan and the People's Republic of China are separated by the Taiwan Strait. Since 1949, Taiwan has been governed by its own administration, with the flag and some other attributes of the former Republic of China remaining in place, but it has not officially declared its independence. According to China's official position, the island is considered one of its provinces. Relations between China and Taiwan have deteriorated in recent years. In 2021, Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to conduct a peaceful 'reunification' with Taiwan. In response, Taipei pledged to defend its freedom and emphasized that only the Taiwanese people can decide their own future. The US Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, which allows the US to supply Taiwan with defensive arms and serves as a guarantor of the island's security. The Biden administration supported Taiwan and provided it with hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid. Former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated in the summer of 2023 that the US does not support Taiwan's independence, but will help it defend itself.

**US Defense Secretary Makes Strongest Statement on Taiwan Issue**
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has made the strongest statement on the Taiwan issue since taking office in January, saying that if China tries to 'conquer' Taiwan, it will bring 'catastrophic consequences'. Austin stated at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore that 'we don't have to sugarcoat it. The threat posed by China is real and may be imminent.' He reiterated former President Trump's statement that China will not invade Taiwan during his presidency. Austin emphasized that 'everyone must recognize that Beijing is indeed preparing to use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region.' China's ambassador to Singapore condemned Austin's remarks as 'provocative' and accused the US of escalating tensions in the region and creating a war risk. Austin said that Beijing wants to dominate and control the region, and is training every day to invade Taiwan, increasing military exercises around the island. He stated that Beijing is making it clear that it is preparing to use military force to change the balance of power in the region. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson responded to Austin's comments, saying 'the US should not fantasize about using the Taiwan issue as a card to contain China, and should not play with fire.'

**US Warns Allies of China's Growing Threat: 'Invading Taiwan in 2027'**
US Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, has warned allies not to 'look away' from the 'imminent risk' posed by China, which is investing in high-level nuclear arms and armament technology to 'invade Taiwan in 2027'. Hegseth has reiterated that China's attempts to conquer Taiwan 'by force' would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. China has warned the US that military aid to Taiwan increases the 'risk of conflict'. Hegseth has called for increased defense spending 'to prevent war, make the cost too high, and peace the only option'. Analysts interpret this as a signal from Washington to increase arms sales in Asia. Hegseth has also highlighted the 'risk' of economic dependence on China, which 'deepens its malign influence' globally. This comes as tensions rise, with China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, not attending the Singapore meeting, and instead sending a delegation from the National Defense University.

**Song Yinhua Appointed as Ambassador for 2025 Taipei Film Festival**
 Taiwanese actress Song Yinhua has been appointed as the ambassador for the 2025 Taipei Film Festival, which will take place from June 20 to July 5. Song, who has been in the industry for over a decade, expressed her excitement about the role, saying, 'I often think about what it means to 'meet the right person at the right time.'

**Taiwan Affairs Office Spokesperson Urges US to Support Reunification and Oppose 'Taiwan Independence'**
Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said at a press conference on April 16 that the US should support reunification and oppose 'Taiwan independence'. She stated that the recent military exercises by China were a warning and punishment for 'Taiwan independence' and external interference. Zhu Fenglian also criticized the US for selling arms to Taiwan, saying that it would only accelerate Taiwan's entry into a 'dangerous situation'. She emphasized that the US should abide by the 'One China' principle and the three joint communiques, and oppose 'Taiwan independence' and support 'Chinese reunification'. Zhu Fenglian also responded to the criticism of China's 'cognitive warfare' by Taiwan, saying that it was a 'habitual trick' used by the Taiwanese authorities to smear China. She added that the Taiwanese authorities were trying to use China's 'cognitive warfare' to cover up their own weaknesses. Additionally, Zhu Fenglian criticized Taiwan's participation in the 2025 Osaka Expo, saying that it was a 'self-indulgent' behavior that was 'whistling past the graveyard' and trying to deceive the Taiwanese people and the international community.

**China Urges US to Respect Core Interests and Avoid 'Taiwan Card' Strategy**
Chinese Ambassador to the US, Xie Feng, emphasized that the US' strategy of using Taiwan to contain China is not only futile but also dangerous. He urged the US to respect China's core interests and not challenge the 'red lines' and 'bottom lines'. Xie Feng stressed that supporting Taiwan independence is equivalent to interfering in China's internal affairs, while tolerating Taiwan independence would lead to instability in the Taiwan Strait. He also pointed out that the 'One China' principle and the three Sino-US joint communiques are the foundation of Sino-US relations, and must not be violated. Xie Feng stated that Sino-US cooperation is not a zero-sum game, and that the US' export to China and Chinese companies' investment in the US have created around 1 million jobs. He warned that excluding China from the market and using tariffs as a weapon would be self-destructive. Xie Feng expressed China's willingness to resolve differences through dialogue and consultation on an equal and mutually respectful basis. However, if the US insists on shifting the blame and suppressing China, China will take necessary measures to protect its legitimate rights and interests. Xie Feng concluded by saying that 'war is a painful lesson that teaches us that we cannot win or should not fight, whether it's a cold war or a hot war.' He emphasized that the world is in a state of turmoil and that international society is eager for peace and stability, and expects China and the US to maintain peaceful coexistence.

**Chinese Ambassador Warns US: Tariff Weaponization Will Backfire**
Chinese Ambassador to the US, Qian Feng, stated at the 2nd Jimmy Carter US-China Relations Dialogue that the US has weaponized tariffs like a boomerang, which will ultimately backfire. Qian Feng emphasized the importance of recognizing the historical logic of peaceful coexistence between the two great nations, mutual benefit as the essence of the relationship, and equal dialogue as the only way to resolve issues. He expressed hope that the US and China can move forward together, implement the important consensus reached by the two leaders, and explore a 'new era of correct Sino-US relations' based on mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation. Qian Feng also pointed out that 'excluding China from the market and enterprises is a self-defeating move, and weaponizing tariffs like a boomerang will ultimately backfire.' He emphasized that China has provided various assistance to the US to address the fentanyl issue, and the US's unilateral tariffs are an act of retaliation. Qian Feng stressed that the two great nations will inevitably have differences and contradictions, but it is essential to respect each other's core interests and not challenge the red line. He also emphasized that supporting 'Taiwan independence' is an interference in China's internal affairs, and tolerating it will destroy the stability of the Taiwan Strait. Qian Feng reiterated that the one-China principle and the three joint communiques are the political foundation of Sino-US relations, and must not be violated at any time.

**Chinese Ambassador Xie Feng: US 'Using Taiwan to Contain China' Will Ultimately Harm Itself**
Chinese Ambassador to the US, Xie Feng, stated that long-term peace and coexistence between China and the US is both a responsibility and a necessity. He emphasized that the US will only harm itself by using tariffs as a means to 'contain China' through Taiwan. Xie Feng said, 'If we view each other as opponents, engage in vicious competition, both China and the US will lose, and the world will suffer.' However, if the two countries work together as partners, they can achieve mutual success and prosperity, benefiting the world. He stressed that the US must genuinely adhere to the 'One China' principle, handle the Taiwan issue in accordance with the three joint communiques, and firmly oppose 'Taiwan independence.' Xie Feng also pointed out that the US should stop upgrading its relations with Taiwan and assisting Taiwan in expanding its international space, as 'using Taiwan to contain China' will ultimately lead to self-destruction. Regarding tariffs, Xie Feng noted that the US-China trade volume exceeded $68 billion last year. He argued that 'decoupling and cutting ties' would cause significant harm and that the trade war and tariff war would ultimately harm both sides. China has been at the forefront of global efforts to combat fentanyl, and recent cooperation between China and the US on anti-drug efforts has been notable. Using fentanyl as an excuse to wield the 'tariff big stick' will only backfire.

**Two US scholars say military aid to Taiwan should be conditional | Taiwan News | Feb. 26, 2025 11:32**
Two American security experts, Jennifer Kavanagh and Stephen Wertheim, have suggested that US military aid to Taiwan should be conditional on Taiwan boosting its defense spending and reforms. They recommend that Taiwan increase its defense spending to 4% of GDP by 2030 and develop an 'asymmetric denial defense' strategy by investing in anti-ship missiles, sea mines, air defense systems, and cheap drones. Kavanagh and Wertheim also suggest that US President Donald Trump should encourage Taiwan to increase military conscription to two 'more intense' years. They argue that the cost of preserving Taiwan's de facto independence is not worth a US-China war, and that the US should consistently apply the policy of strategic ambiguity and 'shore up the 'one China' policy.'

**U.S. State Department website drops wording on not supporting Taiwan independence**
The U.S. State Department has updated its website to remove the statement that it does not support Taiwan independence. The change, which was made on February 13, 2025, also adds a reference to Taiwan's cooperation with a Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and states that the U.S. will support Taiwan's membership in international organisations 'where applicable'. Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung welcomed the change, saying it demonstrates a positive stance on U.S.-Taiwan relations. The move has been seen as a shift in U.S. policy, with some analysts suggesting that it could lead to increased tensions with China, which claims Taiwan as its own. 'We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side,' the State Department website now reads. 'We expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to the people on both sides of the (Taiwan) Strait.' Taiwan has faced stepped-up military pressure from Beijing, including almost daily forays by Chinese warplanes and warships into the waters and skies around the island. 'Taiwan will not bow' to China's pressure, said Taiwan's president. 'We will continue to strengthen our military and our international relationships to ensure our security and sovereignty,' he added. The U.S. has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer, bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. 'Taiwan's cooperation with the U.S. on the semiconductor project is a significant development,' said a Taiwan government official. 'It shows that the U.S. is committed to supporting Taiwan's development and security.'

**World News | US Lawmakers Push to End 'One China' Policy, Back Taiwan Ties | LatestLY**
US Representatives Tom Tiffany and Scott Perry reintroduced a resolution urging the US to end its 'One China' policy and resume formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The resolution, backed by 22 Republican members of the House, calls for President Donald Trump to recognize Taiwan as an independent country and appoint an official US ambassador. It also praises Taiwan for its commitment to democracy, civil liberties, and human rights. The resolution points out that Taiwan and the US had maintained normal diplomatic relations until 1979, when President Carter abruptly abandoned them. According to the resolution, the 'One China' policy is obsolete and fails to reflect the reality that Taiwan has been a sovereign and independent country for over 70 years. If the bill passes, it would be a 'sense of Congress' resolution, meaning it would not require the President's approval and would not have the full force of law.

**US Congress Members Urge Trump to Abandon 'One China' Policy and Restore Ties with Taiwan**
Twenty-four Republican members of the US House of Representatives, led by Tom Tiffany and Scott Perry, have introduced a concurrent resolution urging the Trump administration to abandon the 'One China' policy and restore formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The resolution also encourages the US and Taiwan to negotiate a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) and supports Taiwan's participation in international organizations. The resolution argues that the 'One China' policy is outdated and cannot reflect the interests of the American and Taiwanese people, and that Taiwan has been a sovereign and independent country for over 70 years. It calls on the US President to recognize Taiwan's independence, legitimacy of its democratically elected government, and to normalize diplomatic relations with Taiwan, including the exchange of ambassadors. The resolution also urges the US Trade Representative to initiate formal negotiations with Taiwan for an FTA, and for the US President, Ambassador to the UN, and other relevant officials to take measures to support Taiwan's full membership in the UN and other international organizations. Tom Tiffany stated, 'Taiwan has never been under the control of the People's Republic of China for even one day. It is a free, democratic, and independent country, and it is time for US policy to reflect this undeniable fact.' This is not the first time Tiffany has proposed similar resolutions, having done so in 2020 and 2024.
