**NASA's Europa Clipper Mission Canceled, but Technology Could Explore Enceladus Instead**
NASA has announced that the Europa Clipper mission, originally planned to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, has been canceled in 2023. However, the technology that supports it can be used to explore Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons. According to Interesting Engineering, the subsurface oceans of both Europa and Enceladus could potentially harbor life, making them prime targets for searching for extraterrestrial life in our solar system. If the Europa Clipper mission had launched, it would have collected data on the possibility of life on Europa. The mission was not an easy one, as the intense radiation from Jupiter would damage electronic devices, and communication time would be limited due to Europa's short orbital period of 85 hours. As NASA's Dr. said, 'The mission was not feasible due to the harsh environment of Jupiter.'

**Musk: Chances of Starship Flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50**
Elon Musk said that the chances of Starship flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50. The spacecraft has already completed nine test flights, with the last one taking place on May 27. However, the mission ended in an emergency due to a fuel leak. The previous flights in January and March also ended in failure, with the spacecraft exploding within the first 10 minutes of flight. Despite this, Musk is optimistic about the progress made and believes that the data collected will help improve the spacecraft. The next version of Starship, Version 3, is expected to be 124.4 meters tall and will be capable of flying to Mars. The spacecraft will be reusable and will have a refueling system on orbit, which is necessary for long-distance space travel. The first flight of this version is planned for the end of this year, and if successful, Starship may fly to Mars as early as next year. SpaceX plans to send five Starship Version 3 spacecraft to Mars in 2026 to test the spacecraft and its technologies. However, Musk believes that it will be challenging to achieve this goal, citing the need to master the refueling of Starship in space as the main problem. He estimates the chances of success as 50/50. If successful, SpaceX plans to send around 20 spacecraft to Mars in 2028-2029, which may be crewed. However, Musk also suggests that two robotic landings may be conducted before sending humans. The final decision will be made later. In the third launch window (2030-2031), up to 100 Starship spacecraft may be sent to Mars, and in the next window (2033), up to 500. SpaceX is currently searching for a suitable location for a Martian city, which should be relatively far from the poles, have access to water ice, and have a flat surface for landings and takeoffs. The main candidate is the Arcadia Planitia region. The ultimate goal is to create a self-sufficient settlement on Mars with a population of over a million people, which will require transporting millions of tons of cargo. According to Musk, the construction and maintenance of such a city will be carried out using Starship, possibly its future 142-meter version. During periods of Earth-Mars alignment, thousands of upper stages of the spacecraft will be able to arrive and depart.

**NASA's Europa Clipper Mission Canceled, but Technology Could Explore Enceladus for Life**
NASA announced that the Europa Clipper mission, which was originally planned to land on Jupiter's moon Europa in 2030, has been canceled in 2023. However, the technology that supports it could be used to explore Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons. According to interesting engineering, the subsurface oceans of Europa and Enceladus could potentially harbor life, making them promising places to search for extraterrestrial life in our solar system. If the Europa Clipper mission had launched, it would have collected data on the possibility of life on Europa. The original plan was to send a lander to search for biosignatures if the Clipper mission found good evidence of a habitable environment. However, the mission was challenging due to the intense radiation from Jupiter, which would damage electronic devices, and the limited communication time due to Europa's short orbital period of 85 hours.

**NASA's Robot Ready for Encelado: New Hope in the Search for Life**
After years of development and testing, a sophisticated robot designed to land on Europa, a frozen moon of Jupiter, may now be directed towards Encelado, a moon of Saturn, considered a more suitable destination for searching for extraterrestrial life. The prototype, initially linked to the Europa Clipper mission, was designed with advanced technical solutions to tackle extreme environmental conditions: temperatures between -160 and -220 degrees Celsius, intense radiation, and difficult communication with Earth. The lander features articulated legs for a safe descent on irregular surfaces, a stereoscopic camera for visual exploration, and a mechanical arm with sensors for collecting samples up to 20 cm deep using the ICEPICK tool. The machine has successfully passed tests on terrain similar to Europa's icy surface, such as the Matanuska Glacier in Alaska. However, the latest planetary exploration strategy developed by NASA in 2023 excluded the possibility of a landing mission on Europa due to the high levels of radiation from Jupiter, which would make it unlikely for any biosignatures to survive on the moon's surface, compromising the effectiveness of the entire operation.

**Elon Musk say it's '50/50' he'll land on Mars next year and he needs to 'get lucky' - Daily Star**
Elon Musk says there is a '50/50 chance' of landing a spaceship on Mars next year, and he needs to 'get lucky'. Despite recent test flight failures, Musk remains optimistic about progress towards establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars. He believes reusable rockets will enable more than a million people to live on Mars within 30 years. Musk hopes to send 20 ships to Mars between 2028 and 2029, with the goal of building a self-sufficient city that could survive even if cut off from Earth. He is scouting possible sites for a Mars city, with Arcadia Planitia being the leading candidate. Musk aims to fly 100 ships to Mars between 2030 and 2031 and 500 more in 2033. He said, 'This is, like, an incredible thing to have - this amazing city on Mars, the first city on another planet and a new world.'

**Elon Musk targets 2026 for first space mission to Mars**
Elon Musk aims to launch the first space mission to Mars by the end of 2026, but acknowledges that overcoming technological hurdles, particularly in-orbit refueling, is crucial for the long journey. A favorable planetary alignment in late 2026 provides a unique opportunity for a relatively short transit between Earth and Mars. If Starship is not ready by then, a new mission in 2028 would be targeted. The first mission would consist of -built Optimus humanoid robots. Despite failed test flights, including a fuel leak and uncontrolled spinning on the ninth test flight, Musk remains optimistic, citing each failure as valuable data for accelerated testing. NASA relies on Starship for its Artemis program, which aims to send astronauts to the moon as early as 2027, a stepping stone to possible human missions to Mars in the 2030s. Musk's ultimate vision is to launch up to 2,000 Starships every two years to establish a permanent and self-sustaining human settlement on Mars.

**NASA Considers Enceladus as a More Promising Target for Searching for Extraterrestrial Life**
The NASA mission to deliver a lander to Jupiter's moon Europa was canceled in 2023. However, the technologies developed for this expedition can be used to study another icy moon, Enceladus, which orbits Saturn. The Europa Clipper project's robotic prototype successfully passed testing, but the extreme conditions on Europa made landing too risky. Now, NASA considers Enceladus a more suitable target for searching for extraterrestrial life due to its subsurface ocean and relatively low radiation levels. As NASA's deputy associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, Maria Zuber, said, 'Enceladus is a more accessible and more promising target for searching for life beyond Earth.' The technologies developed for the Europa Clipper mission, such as the ICEPICK instrument, which can take ice samples from a depth of up to 20 centimeters, can be adapted for a mission to Enceladus. The Enceladus moon is similar to Europa in that it has a large subsurface ocean, making it a promising object in the Solar System where life forms may exist.

**NASA's New Probes to Search for Alien Life**
The NASA project, called ORCAA (Oceanic World Recognition and Astrobiological Analog Characterization), aims to search for extraterrestrial life. In 2023, the team conducted a test mission at the Echo glacier in Alaska, using a hot water drill to collect samples from the glacier's bottom. They found traces of ATP and chlorophyll-a, key molecules for life. The team is now preparing for a second campaign in North Basin in 2025, where they will use a cryobot to simulate the conditions they will face on Jupiter's moon Europa. The goal is to test the autonomous operation of the cryobot, from drilling to sample analysis, to determine if these technologies can be used in a future real landing on Europa. The study aims to detect changes in the environment and find potential indicators of habitability, such as microorganisms or organic compounds. The research is advancing, with the Europa Clipper mission already en route to Jupiter's moon. This spacecraft will fly over Europa 49 times starting in 2030, searching for areas where the ice crust is thinner. This will help choose the most promising location for a future landing mission, such as the Europa Lander. While this mission will not penetrate the ice, it will test the first key instruments for that stage. Other oceanic worlds in the solar system where these probes could be used include Enceladus and Titan (Saturn), Triton (Neptune), Ganymede and Callisto (Jupiter), and even Ceres and Pluto. Enceladus, for example, has active geysers that eject water into space and have already been analyzed by the Cassini mission, which found water vapor, carbon dioxide, and organic compounds: basic ingredients for life.

**ExoMars Rosalind Franklin Rover to Land on Mars in 2030**
The European Space Agency (ESA) has commissioned Airbus to design and build the lander for the ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover, which is set to launch in 2028 and search for signs of life on Mars starting from 2030. The rover will be the first to drill up to two meters deep into the Martian surface, collecting samples buried beneath the surface and protected from radiation and extreme temperatures. The mission will also demonstrate key technologies needed for future planetary exploration missions, including safe landing, surface mobility, and autonomous sample analysis. The lander will use a combination of parachutes and retro-rockets to slow down the descent from 45 m/s to less than 3 m/s before landing, and will have multiple ramps to allow the rover to reach the surface safely. The rover is expected to land on Mars in 2030, avoiding the global dust storm season. The ESA, European industry, and NASA are working together to maintain and modernize the rover in preparation for its launch in 2028 on a US rocket, which includes installing heating units to keep the rover warm on the Martian surface and a new software mode for autonomous operation after landing, as stated by the ESA. 'This mission will be a major step forward for European space exploration,' said the ESA. 'It will demonstrate the technologies and capabilities needed for future missions to the Red Planet and beyond.'

**NASA's Europa Clipper Mission: A Journey to Jupiter's Moon**
The NASA's Europa Clipper mission, launched in October 2023, is on its way to study the habitability of Jupiter's moon, Europa. The spacecraft will travel approximately 2.9 billion kilometers over the next six years to reach Jupiter in 2030. Before that, it will pass close to Mars in March 2025, at a distance of 884 kilometers, using a gravitational assist maneuver. This will also be an opportunity for scientists to test the radar and thermographic camera instruments. The spacecraft will then fly by Earth in December 2026, using the planet's gravity to gain speed and set course for Jupiter. Europa Clipper is the first mission to conduct a detailed study of Europa's surface, subsurface ocean, and composition, with the goal of determining if it can support life. The spacecraft is the largest developed by NASA for a planetary mission, measuring 5 meters in height, 30.5 meters in length, and weighing 3,241 kilograms.

**Europa Clipper’s Mars Gravity Assist: Pioneering the Future of Space Exploration**
The Europa Clipper mission, launched on October 14, 2024, is set to execute a critical maneuver on March 1, 2025, by flying within 884 kilometers of the Martian surface, performing a gravity assist. This maneuver will bend and reshape the spacecraft's trajectory as it embarks on its journey to Jupiter. The mission aims to determine if Europa harbors conditions suitable for life, with a vast ocean believed to lie beneath its icy shell. The spacecraft is equipped with sophisticated instruments to study Europa's surface, subsurface, and atmosphere. The Mars flyby is essential for the mission, as it will allow the spacecraft to decelerate and adjust its path around the sun. Brett Smith, a systems engineer, explained, 'We arrive very fast and gravity Mars on the probe bend its track.' The Europa Clipper will then perform a gravity assist at Earth in December 2026, further accelerating the probe and propelling it toward Jupiter, which it is expected to reach in April 2030. The journey to Jupiter is a carefully choreographed dance through the solar system, leveraging the gravitational forces of planets to gain momentum and adjust course.

**Here's How NASA's Life-Hunting Spacecraft Will Use Mars to Slingshot to Jupiter**
The Europa Clipper, a NASA spacecraft, is set to use a gravity assist maneuver with Mars to slingshot itself to Jupiter. The spacecraft, launched in 2024, is on a mission to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, which is believed to harbor life. The gravity assist maneuver, which will take place on March 1, will bring the spacecraft within 550 miles of Mars' surface, allowing it to slow down and change its trajectory. The spacecraft will then perform a series of trajectory correction maneuvers before using Earth's gravity to gain speed and continue its journey to Jupiter. The Europa Clipper is equipped with nine instruments, including radars and magnetometers, which will be used to scan the surface of Europa during 49 close flybys. The mission is expected to last until 2034. 'It will take the Europa Clipper a long time to reach its destination, given that the place is five times farther out from Earth than the Sun,' said NASA. 'The ship will not have completed the 1.8 billion-mile (2.9 billion km) trip until April 2030.'

**NASA's Europa Clipper Spacecraft to Fly by Mars in 2025**
The NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft is scheduled to fly by Mars on March 1, 2025, at a distance of 884 kilometers. This close flyby will provide an opportunity for scientists to test the spacecraft's radar and thermal imaging camera. The spacecraft will calibrate its thermal imaging camera about a day before the flyby, resulting in a multicolor image of Mars in the months following the flyby. The radar instrument will also be tested during the flyby, as it is too large and complex to be tested on Earth before launch. The spacecraft will use the gravity of Mars to change its trajectory and speed, and will then continue on its journey to the Jupiter system. 'We're coming in very fast and the gravity of Mars is acting on the spacecraft to bend its trajectory,' said Brett Smith, mission systems engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 'Meanwhile, we're exchanging a small amount of energy with the planet, so we're coming out on a path that will take us back beyond Earth.' The spacecraft is expected to arrive at Jupiter's orbit in April 2030.

**Europa Clipper's Journey to Jupiter's Moon Europa**
The NASA mission Europa Clipper will take almost six years to reach its destination, Jupiter's moon Europa, on April 11, 2030. The spacecraft was launched with a trajectory that includes a gravitational assist from Mars, which will give it an extra boost. This technique, called gravitational assistance, is used to alter a spacecraft's trajectory and speed by flying close to a planet or moon. The concept was first proposed by Russian mathematician Yuri Kondratyuk in 1938 and has since been used in various space missions. The Europa Clipper mission will use this technique to reduce its orbit around Jupiter and study the moon's subsurface ocean, which could potentially harbor life. The spacecraft will make 49 flybys of Europa over three years before crashing into Ganymede, another moon of Jupiter, in 2034. The mission is part of a larger effort to explore the Jupiter system and search for the 'ingredients' necessary for life beyond Earth. 'The trajectory of Europa Clipper includes a gravitational assist with Mars,' explains Ricardo L. Restrepo, the mission's trajectory designer. 'After flying by Mars, the spacecraft will return to Earth's vicinity, but with more energy than when it was launched and will use our planet for a final boost.'

**Europa Clipper on a mission to probe an alien water world**
The Europa Clipper mission, launched in October 2024, is set to arrive at Jupiter's moon Europa in 2031 and will be the first to study the moon in detail. The mission aims to determine whether Europa is habitable, with a focus on its ice-covered surface, ocean, and atmosphere. The spacecraft will use a specially designed vault to shield its electronics from Jupiter's radiation and will make 49 flybys of Europa, each lasting around one day. During these flybys, the spacecraft will use its nine scientific instruments to capture data and images relating to Europa's core, interior, ocean, ice shell, atmosphere, and surrounding space environment. The instruments include the Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface (REASON), which will look directly into Europa's icy shell, and the Mass Spectrometer for Planetary Exploration/Europa (MASPEX), which will analyse Europa's atmosphere. The mission has the potential to fundamentally reshape our understanding of our place in the universe and to accelerate an exciting new era of planetary exploration.
