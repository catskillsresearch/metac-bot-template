**The Future of Food: 10 Trends to Watch by 2050**
By 2050, the way we produce, buy, and prepare food will undergo significant transformations. According to predictions, ten main trends will emerge. 1. 'Community meals' will continue to play a central role in our lives, with a focus on shared experiences and emotional connections. 2. The weekly grocery shopping trip will become a thing of the past, replaced by AI-powered meal planning and box delivery services. 3. Clothing will become a source of food production, with wearable technology that can grow food on the go. 4. Urban agriculture will become increasingly integrated into city landscapes, with shared gardens, vertical farming, and community-supported agriculture. 5. Food will be designed to absorb CO2, rather than emit it, with the help of oceanic agriculture and sustainable aquaculture. 6. AI will help reduce food waste by optimizing meal planning and transforming scraps into new dishes using 3D printing. 7. Climate change will lead to the adoption of new crops, such as mangoes and papayas in the Mediterranean, and quinoa and soy in Northern Europe. 8. Ancient crops, such as sorrel and dandelion, will make a comeback, providing a source of biodiversity and resilience. 9. 'Niche' crops, such as teff and fonio, will become more mainstream, providing a source of nutrition and sustainability. 10. Food will become a form of preventive medicine, with AI-powered meal planning and personalized nutrition tailored to individual needs and genetic predispositions. According to Dr. Joseph Poore, 'it's likely that our diet in 2050 will be significantly different from what we have today, although not necessarily in the ways we expect.' Dr. Morgaine Gaye adds, 'the next decade will see significant transformations in our daily habits and food models.'

**Meta Seeks to Enter Military Industry through Partnership with Anduril**
Meta is seeking to enter the military industry through a partnership with 'Anduril', as part of a comprehensive plan by the US military to update its wearable equipment, with an estimated total budget of $22 billion. The contract, worth around $100 million, has not been officially awarded yet. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, stated that this technology 'will protect our interests at home and abroad', highlighting the strategic importance of this partnership. Palmer Luckey, co-founder of Oculus VR, which was acquired by Meta, expressed his support for the partnership, saying 'Using Meta's massive investments in XR tech to support our military will save lives and money'. This collaboration between Meta and Anduril marks a return to the spotlight for Luckey, who was fired from Meta in 2017 after donating $10,000 to an anti-Hillary Clinton PAC. However, it appears that Luckey's relationship with Zuckerberg has improved, as he joked 'I finally got all my toys back'. Luckey also emphasized the importance of collaboration between tech companies and the military, stating that he believes the world needs to transition from being a 'global police force' to a 'global arms dealer'. Anduril is one of the leading emerging companies in the defense industry, having secured government contracts worth $6 billion globally, and has expanded its partnerships with Silicon Valley giants, particularly during Trump's administration, which Luckey openly supports.

**Meta Enters Defense Services Market with Anduril Partnership**
Meta, a social media giant, has officially entered the defense services market by partnering with Anduril Industries to develop military AR/VR devices. This collaboration is significant as Palmer Luckey, the founder of Anduril, was previously fired by Meta in 2017. Luckey was the co-founder of Oculus, which was acquired by Meta in 2014. Meta has invested around $80 billion in various reality technologies since then, with its Reality Labs department still operating at a loss. The company expects the military market to generate a return on investment. According to Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO, 'Meta has spent the past decade building AI and AR technologies to realize future computing platforms. We're honored to be working with Anduril to bring these technologies to the American military, who protect our domestic and overseas interests.' Luckey expressed his positive attitude towards re-cooperating with his former employer, stating, 'I'm thrilled to be working with Meta again. In the realm of dual-use technologies that can change America for the better, this is one of the most exciting ones. My mission has always been to turn warriors into tech wizards, and the products we're developing with Meta are exactly that.'

**The Current State of the Metaverse: Predictions and Comparisons of Apple Vision Pro's Features and Security**
In 2022, people were forced to stay at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a surge in interest in virtual spaces for social interaction. Trend Micro conducted a comprehensive survey to understand the potential cyber threats to the metaverse. The following year, Apple's announcement of the AR/VR headset 'Apple Vision Pro' provided an opportunity to verify these predictions and highlighted both the advancements and persistent challenges in areas such as data privacy, biometric data protection, and multi-vendor interoperability. According to Trend Micro, the metaverse's lack of immersive AR/VR headsets and integrated operational environments contributed to waning interest in the technology, as people's attention shifted to the emerging field of generative AI, led by Open AI's 'ChatGPT 3.5' and 'ChatGPT 4'.

Brian Wang, a Futurist Thought Leader and popular Science blogger, has ranked 8th in Baseline Accuracy out of 34617 forecasters on Metaculus, with a 99.98 percentile ranking. According to Wang, some people misunderstand the concept of percentile, which is a mathematical term that indicates his accuracy was around 98%. Wang explains that the Peer Accuracy score, a new metric created by Metaculus, takes into account the time component of predictions, which can penalize forecasters for being late to enter a prediction. Wang's Baseline accuracy is based on points earned for correct predictions and losses for incorrect ones. Wang is a well-known expert in identifying cutting-edge technologies and has a strong track record of predicting future trends.

**Running hot? Server sales forecast to cool in 2025**
TrendForce forecasts that AI server sales will cool off in 2025 due to supply chain and regulatory hurdles. Despite a 46% growth in AI-configured system shipments last year, driven by orders from cloud service providers, TrendForce sees uncertainty ahead. The most likely scenario is a lower annual growth rate, exceeding 30%, driven by increased capital expenditure in cloud and AI infrastructure by Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google. However, a worst-case scenario of 20-25% growth is also possible due to stricter US regulations on AI chip exports to China and delays in Nvidia rack systems. A more optimistic view assumes proactive policies will accelerate AI server deployment, leading to a 35% increase in shipments. IBM chief Arvind Krishna predicts that the release of DeepSeek will help fuel AI adoption, as 'costs come down' and 'usage will explode.' TrendForce expects DeepSeek's influence to drive cloud operators toward lower-cost proprietary chips, leading to servers optimized for inferencing making up a larger slice of the market.
