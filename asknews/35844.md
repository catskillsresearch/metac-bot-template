**Daily on Energy, presented by CRES Forum: Legislative text - Washington Examiner**
The House Ways and Means Republicans have released a reconciliation text that aims to cut clean energy tax credits established by the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. The proposal would terminate the $7,500 tax credits for electric vehicles, commercial clean vehicle tax credits, and the Clean Hydrogen Production 45V tax credit. The bill would also phase out the Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits and the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is set to mark up its portion of the budget reconciliation package, which would cancel up to $6.5 billion in unspent funding from the IRA. The Department of Energy is also moving forward with the president's deregulatory agenda by walking back 47 different climate and energy-related regulations. Oil prices surged after the US and China announced a temporary trade agreement to lower tariffs. Chinese battery company CATL plans to raise at least $4 billion to expand overseas. The European Union is asking the Czech Republic to delay signing a nuclear contract with South Korea amid an investigation into foreign subsidies.

**House GOP unveils bill text for slashing Biden energy tax credits**
The House GOP has unveiled a bill that would terminate and modify clean energy and manufacturing tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was passed by Democrats in 2022. The bill would eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, terminate the Clean Hydrogen Production 45V tax credit, and block wind energy from the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax. The legislation also subjects the Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits to a phase-out period and restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) criticized the bill, saying it would 'jack up prices on American families,' 'kill jobs,' and 'create chaos in the business community.'

**GOP moves to repeal EV credit, other climate law incentives**
House Republicans are proposing to repeal electric vehicle tax credits and other climate law incentives, according to legislation released by the Ways and Means Committee. The legislation, dubbed 'THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL', would terminate programs tied to the Democrats' 2022 climate law, including home energy efficiency and clean hydrogen production credits. The Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit would be phased out by 2031, and new domestic sourcing requirements would be added. The nuclear power production incentive would also go away by 2031. Additionally, the legislation includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling increase.

**Trump Must Bury Biden's Subsidies for Russian and Chinese Minerals**
The US is heavily reliant on mineral imports from China, which is using its control of supply chains to exert leverage. To break China's hold, the US needs to increase the competitiveness of its mining industry and strengthen incentives for domestic production. However, Section 45X of the Internal Revenue Code, enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, has failed to achieve its goal due to loopholes that allow foreign-mined minerals to be processed in the US and receive tax credits. This hands subsidies to refiners who import minerals from China and Russia while denying access to US-based mining operations. The author argues that Congress should fix 45X to support American production at every level of the supply chain, close loopholes, and expand eligibility to include domestic mining operations. This would strengthen US competitiveness, take on China, and keep American tax policy focused on supporting domestic investment, jobs, and national security.

**US House Republicans Propose Massive Rollback of Climate and Energy Policies**
US House Representatives have proposed a massive rollback of climate and energy policies in the budget draft, aiming to repeal tax credits for clean energy, drastically cut funding for electric vehicles and renewable energy, and recover additional climate-related funds. The Republican plan aims to push through a multi-trillion-dollar budget that aligns with President Donald Trump's agenda. The Energy and Commerce Committee presented a proposal that would bring in $6.5 billion by repealing climate-related parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. The Financial Committee, on the other hand, suggested abolishing or letting expire several lucrative tax credits from President Joe Biden's central climate law. According to the proposal, the tax credit for consumers when buying electric vehicles would expire at the end of this year, not in the next decade. Various central tax credits for clean energy would expire by 2031, and a large tax credit for hydrogen production would be ended prematurely. Trump had promised during the election campaign to end state support for electric vehicles and roll back Biden's comprehensive measures against global warming, arguing that these measures were unnecessary and harmed automakers, oil and gas companies, and mining companies. Trump hopes that his first budget after taking office again will fulfill his promises and drastically reduce the federal bureaucracy. The Energy Committee's plan also includes repealing important environmental regulations from the Biden administration, including a regulation from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that would reduce emissions for cars and light trucks starting from model year 2027. The proposal also includes measures to speed up the approval for the export of liquefied natural gas and over $1.5 billion for the Energy Department to refill the strategic oil reserve. 'This law would recover funds that were intended for green misinvestments through 'environmental and climate justice block grants' and other expenditure mechanisms of the EPA and the Energy Department,' wrote Energy Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie in a guest article in the Wall Street Journal, announcing the proposal on Sunday. The law also includes the elimination of the remaining, unused funds from the $27 billion fund to reduce greenhouse gases - a central goal of EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who claimed in court proceedings that the money was being used fraudulently. Unspent funds from nine funding programs of the Inflation Reduction Act for renewable energy and electrification, such as guarantees for energy loans to indigenous communities and the financing of transmission lines, as well as unused funds from the Energy Department's credit office would also be recovered. Unused funds from the Inflation Reduction Act for methane reduction in oil and gas facilities, greenhouse gas reporting, reducing air pollutants in ports, production facilities and schools, and funds that should enable low-income communities to access clean energy would also be repealed. 'Your proposal destroys investments that lower energy costs, drive a boom in domestic industry, and bring essential health services to communities that need them most,' criticized Lena Moffitt, Executive Director of the environmental organization Evergreen Action. The proposed cuts by the Financial Committee also include a quick expiration of the 'technology-neutral' 45Y tax credits for wind, solar, and other clean energy sources. These credits had no expiration date and would now end in 2031. Also, the transferability, a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which allowed developers to sell their tax credits and use the funds to finance the construction of their projects, would be abolished according to the proposal.

**In Defense of the Consumer: A Call for Action**
Many people are struggling with the rising cost of living, including increased energy prices. According to the Federal Government, prices of goods and services will increase by 5.4% this year, while inflation will remain at least 3%. Energy prices are expected to rise by 7%. For Latinos, the situation is even more concerning, as a study by the University of Indiana found that two out of five Latinos have struggled to pay their electricity bills, and 18% have had their electricity disconnected at least once. However, solutions and benefits exist to help make life and finances brighter. Unfortunately, the administration is trying to end funding for the Home Appliance and Home Efficiency Rebate Project, but funds seem to be flowing again, benefiting low-income families. In Congress, important tax credits, such as the Home Energy Efficiency Improvement Credit (25C), are also under threat. These initiatives are part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which dedicates billions to help consumers save money on their energy bills. Despite political attacks on this law, there is growing Republican support to preserve tax credits in the manufacturing sector, which is creating good jobs for making batteries and electric vehicles. These savings initiatives should not be politicized because they benefit everyone in a non-partisan way. The 50 states, excluding South Dakota, have received approval to launch these rebate programs. Twelve states, including several with high Latino populations, have already launched their rebate programs, and 15 others have been granted funds after the November elections. These programs are extremely popular, with over 3.4 million families benefiting from the IRA in 2023, receiving $8.4 billion in tax credits to electrify and make their homes more efficient. Additionally, they promoted the creation of 142,000 jobs in the clean energy economy. In summary, rebate programs achieve: Reducing energy inflation costs. Creating local jobs. Boosting the manufacturing sector. And strengthening the national electrical grid and energy security. Consumers face significant inflationary pressure, labor market uncertainty, and the rigors of the climate crisis. The Inflation Reduction Act and its historic aid and benefits approved by Congress constitute a well-deserved relief, especially for low- and moderate-income families.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee has released its section of the Republicans' reconciliation bill, which aims to cut spending and mandates from the Democrats' 2022 climate law. The legislation includes plans to repeal unobligated dollars from EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and scrap Biden-era vehicle-emissions rules. According to Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.), the bill would 'reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, returning $6.5 billion in unspent funds.' The committee plans to begin marking up the legislation on Tuesday afternoon, but it's unclear when lawmakers will advance it. The bill also includes a new fee on natural gas export project permitting, with the Secretary of Energy deeming the application 'in the public interest' upon receipt and collection of the fee.

**The Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are at risk**
The Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are at risk due to the high cost of the legislation, estimated to be around $1.16 trillion over the next 10 years. The Joint Committee on Taxation's initial estimate of $366 billion was challenged by Goldman Sachs, the Cato Institute, and the Treasury Department. The Republicans are struggling to make the math of tax reform work, with not enough votes to put all tax reform preferences on the credit card. They have three choices: reduce spending on Medicaid, increase the debt, or cannibalize the Inflation Reduction Act to pay for additional tax and spending reductions. It is likely that the tax credits will be at risk, as voters and members of Congress may prioritize preservation of Medicaid over tax credits for a small group of companies and rich individuals. The competition for tax reform includes provisions that benefit the donor base of the majority party, making the climb more difficult.

**Revise Or Repeal? Commercial Clean Vehicle Tax Credit Awaits Its Fate**
The commercial clean vehicle tax credit under section 45W of the Inflation Reduction Act may be vulnerable to repeal or revision due to its larger size and potential regulatory challenges. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated the revenue effect of the credit at $14.4 billion between 2024 and 2028, compared to $5.6 billion for the clean vehicle credit. The proposed regulations for section 45W have been met with criticism from industry commentators, who argue that the rules are too narrow and would exclude certain types of vehicles from qualifying for the credit. The proposed recapture rules, which would require taxpayers to recapture the credit if the vehicle ceases to be used for business purposes within 18 months, have been criticized for being too harsh and potentially causing significant economic losses. The effective date of the proposed regulations has also been questioned, with some commentators arguing that it would cause commercially retroactive recapture despite standard leasing transactions. Despite these criticisms, some aspects of the proposed regulations, such as the safe harbor guidance for the incremental cost of a vehicle, have been praised by industry commentators.

**Hydrogen tax credit could get a gas makeover**
The 'clean' hydrogen tax credit in the Inflation Reduction Act may survive the GOP's plans for a tax cut, but Republicans are considering modifications that could make it unrecognizable to Democrats and environmentalists. These changes could also make the credit more expensive, which could be a stumbling block for the Republican Party. The 45V tax credit provides generous incentives to producers who use low-carbon sources to generate hydrogen, a fuel that is seen as essential for the industry's growth. As Republicans consider cutting tax credits, the hydrogen tax credit's job-creating benefits to red states may help it survive.

**Treasury Department Releases Final Regulations Applicable to the Hydrogen Tax Credits**
The US Department of the Treasury has released final regulations for the hydrogen production tax credit under Section 45V and the investment tax credit for hydrogen production facilities under Section 48(a)(15). The Hydrogen Tax Credits, passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, incentivize the production of low-carbon hydrogen. The Final Regulations make material changes to the proposed regulations, including adding exceptions to the requirement that electrical power used to produce hydrogen must be from new generation sources. The regulations also eliminate the requirement that renewable natural gas (RNG) originate from the 'first productive use' of the relevant methane. Hydrogen producers can rely on the version of the GREET model in effect at the time that the hydrogen production facility began construction. The future of the Hydrogen Tax Credits is unclear, with a full repeal or expansion of the regime possible under the Trump administration.

**Strange bedfellows unite to kill carbon capture credit**
Reps. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) have introduced legislation to repeal the 45Q tax credit, which incentivizes energy and polluting companies to capture and store carbon dioxide. The move comes as Republicans consider the fate of climate-friendly energy incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. According to the lawmakers, the goal is to 'kill' the carbon capture credit, with Perry stating, 'It was a great day' to announce the legislation, although the context of this quote is unclear. The 45Q allowances are considered among the least imperiled of the climate-friendly incentives.

**Treasury and IRS Release Final Hydrogen Production Tax Credit Regulations**
The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service have released final regulations for the tax credit for the production of 'qualified clean hydrogen' under Section 45V of the Internal Revenue Code. The regulations implement the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and provide a 10-year production tax credit or an investment tax credit for taxpayers who produce qualifying clean hydrogen at a facility placed into service after December 31, 2022. The credit amount is based on the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rate of each hydrogen production pathway, as calculated using the GREET Model or through a Provisional Emissions Rate (PER) filing process. The regulations also provide a safe harbor for calculating lifecycle GHG emissions, allowing for a 10-year lock-in associated with the GREET Model. Additionally, the regulations clarify that a single hydrogen production 'facility' cannot claim both the Clean Hydrogen Credit and the Section 45Q carbon oxide sequestration credit. The regulations also provide a new beginning of construction safe harbor to mitigate concerns about subsequent updates to the GREET Model. Hydrogen produced from cracking man-made chemicals, such as ammonia, is not eligible for the Clean Hydrogen Credit. The regulations also provide a detailed synopsis of the regulations as they apply to a variety of production scenarios, including the definition of clean hydrogen production facility, calculation of GHG emissions, and anti-abuse rule.

**Treasury Department and IRS Release 45V Clean Hydrogen Rule**
The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released final rules for the 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The credit applies to clean hydrogen produced after 2022 and provides clarity on how hydrogen producers can determine eligibility. To qualify, the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of the hydrogen production process must be no greater than four kilograms (kg) of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per kg of hydrogen (H2) produced. The credit is technology-neutral and enables pathways for hydrogen produced using both electricity and methane. The final rules maintain the 'Three Pillars' for determining eligibility of renewable electricity for tax credit-qualified electrolytic hydrogen production: incrementality, temporal matching, and deliverability. The rules also provide clarity on the eligibility of 'blue hydrogen' produced using methane reforming technologies with carbon capture and storage. Construction of eligible facilities must begin before 2033, and the credit is reduced by a factor of five if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are not met.

**Treasury Finalizes Rules For Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (Section 45V)**
The US Treasury has finalized the rules for the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (Section 45V), a key component of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The rules provide a pathway for hydrogen producers to claim a tax credit of up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen, provided they meet certain requirements. The rules require hydrogen producers to obtain and retire Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) that meet the 'three pillars' requirements: incrementality, temporal matching, and deliverability. The rules also provide a pathway for existing nuclear plants to power hydrogen production, exempt hydrogen producers in certain 'Qualifying States' from the incrementality requirement, and extend the deadline for hourly matching of clean power generation to hydrogen production. Additionally, the rules clarify key requirements for determining lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using the 45VH2-GREET model. Hydrogen producers can choose to lock in an emissions rate for the 10-year duration of their credit based on the version of the model in effect at the time they start construction. The rules also establish pathways to produce creditable hydrogen from biogas, renewable natural gas (RNG), and fugitive methane. The Trump administration could seek to rescind or modify the rules, but it's still too soon to tell what actions it might take.
