**Wes Moore and Tim Walz Go to a Fish Fry and Spatter 2028 Gossip Everywhere**
Governors Wes Moore of Maryland and Tim Walz of Minnesota visited South Carolina, a key state in the 2028 presidential primary election. Moore emphasized the importance of Democrats showing up in red states and presented himself as an action-oriented pragmatist, suggesting that his party should respond with urgency to President Donald Trump and offer its own affirmative vision. Walz encouraged his party to embrace 'big, bold ideas' while also challenging Trump. Former Governor Jim Hodges said that South Carolina Democrats want candidates who can win a general election and have 'a little swagger and confidence.' The 2028 presidential campaign is years away, but some South Carolina Democrats are already thinking about who can win a general election and are viewing potential candidates through the prism of their general election appeal.

**Tim Walz Calls on Democrats to Adopt New Strategy Ahead of 2028 US Presidential Election**
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has called on Democrats to adopt a new strategy ahead of the 2028 US presidential election. He argued that the party has strayed from its core values as a champion of the working class and that it needs to be 'honest' about its failures. Walz suggested that Democrats should take a cue from President Donald Trump's tough tactics and be less concerned with offending people. He criticized party leaders for being too cautious and not taking bold action. Walz said, 'Maybe it's time for us to be a little meaner.' He also drew parallels with Senator Bernie Sanders' criticism of the party for not doing enough for the working class. Walz stated, 'No one votes for overhyped animals,' and 'We don't want to see us standing like a deer in the headlights.' He emphasized the need for Democrats to be more competitive in Republican-dominated states and to engage with voters on a personal level. Walz' strong words have drawn comparisons with Sanders' criticism of the party.

**Democratic Party Criticized by Its Own Member: 'Roadkilled' and Losing Its Progressive Image**
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has criticized the Democratic Party, saying 'we need to get worse' if Trump is being aggressive. He stated, 'if Trump is being a bully, then you need to be even more aggressive.' Walz, who was the Democratic vice presidential candidate in the 2024 US presidential election, made the comments at a party event in South Carolina and California. He said, 'when people ask me how they see the Democratic Party, I say it's like a deer in the headlights.' He added, 'no one votes for a party that's been roadkilled.' Walz praised the party's historical achievements, such as the social safety net, but criticized its inability to deliver big changes after winning elections. He said, 'the party used to be bold and daring, but it's become a party that can't deliver after winning elections.' He also criticized the party's loss of its 'progressive' image, saying it has become a party that only cares about the interests of the elite and the powerful. The Washington Post analyzed Walz's comments as a reflection of Bernie Sanders' criticism that the Democratic Party has failed to meet the expectations of working-class voters. The article also noted that Walz's comments are a clear signal that he is considering running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028.

**Democrats Fixate on Trump, But Ignore the Voters**
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) predicts that Democrats will regain control of the House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm election, citing historical trends. However, Democrats' focus on investigating and impeaching President Trump has been criticized as a lack of substance. Representative Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) vowed to investigate Trump's business dealings and potential violations of the Emoluments Clause. Democrats have no plans to improve the lives of American people, and their agenda will be centered around Trump hatred. A new CNN poll shows that only 16% of Americans view Democrats as a 'party with strong leaders,' and 19% believe they are a 'party that gets things done.' The leading candidate for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination is Pete Buttigieg, followed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Kamala Harris. Democrats are in disarray, and their focus on Trump-bashing and radicalism is not impressing the American people.

**The 2028 podcast primary is underway as Democrats try to reshape their image**
The 2028 Democratic presidential primary is underway, with potential contenders like Govs. Gavin Newsom, Andy Beshear, and Gretchen Whitmer, as well as former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, using podcasts to connect with voters. Newsom has appeared on conservative podcasts, including one with Charlie Kirk, while Beshear has brought on his children to discuss slang terms. Whitmer has faced backlash for sharing a hug with President Trump, but says it was a moment of 'service above self.' Buttigieg has discussed his personal life and accused Trump of failing to deliver on economic promises. The use of podcasts is seen as a way for Democrats to connect with younger voters and show a more authentic side, as President Trump did in his 2024 campaign.

**Tim Walz claims Trump's 2024 victory was a 'primal scream' from angry...**
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz described President Trump's 2024 victory as a 'primal scream' from voters who were angry and alienated by the Democratic party. Walz said the loss of the Democratic ticket in swing states was emblematic of the party's hemorrhaging of working-class voters. He argued that Democrats need to be more feisty and 'meaner' in their resistance to Trump, saying 'we've got to find some goddamn guts to fight for working people.' Walz has been touring the country, delivering tough assessments of the Democratic Party's state and calling for a more adversarial approach to Trump. In contrast, Kamala Harris has largely laid low since her electoral defeat, with some speculating that she may run for California governor in 2026 or try again for the presidency in 2028.

**Pete Buttigieg Leads Democratic Poll for 2028 Presidential Election, JD Vance Tops Republican List**
A recent poll by AtlasIntel shows that Pete Buttigieg, the former US Transportation Secretary, is the most popular choice among Democrats for the 2028 presidential election, with 31.5% of the vote. JD Vance, the current US Vice President, is the most popular choice among Republicans, with 37.3% of the vote. The poll also found that 50.9% of respondents would vote for a Democratic candidate in a mid-term election, while 41.7% would vote for a Republican candidate. Kamala Harris, the current US Vice President, saw a decline in her popularity, with 16.6% of the vote, possibly due to the recent controversy surrounding Joe Biden's health. Pete Buttigieg has not ruled out a potential presidential run, and some speculate that he may be preparing for another bid. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has not commented on speculation that she may run for president in 2028, but some believe she could be a potential candidate for the Senate.

**Surprising Candidate Emerges As Clear Democrat Frontrunner for 2028 (It’s NOT Kamala Harris Or AOC) - Conservative Angle**
A new poll has emerged showing Pete Buttigieg as the clear frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic presidential election, surpassing Kamala Harris and AOC. According to the poll, Buttigieg has 32% of the vote, with AOC at 20% and Harris at 15%. However, Buttigieg has stated that he is undecided about running for president in 2028, saying 'there are times I follow that process and decided to run, and there are times I followed that process and decided not to run — and the process can lead you to surprising places.' If Buttigieg does decide to run, he may face off against JD Vance, the current Republican frontrunner for the 2028 presidential election.

**There's a Surprise Leader in Polling for Next Democrat Presidential Nominee -- and It's Not Kamala Harris**
A recent national poll has found that former Transportation Secretary and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the current leader among potential Democratic candidates for the 2028 presidential election, with over 31% of Democratic-identifying respondents supporting him. This puts him ahead of prominent party figures such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former Vice President Kamala Harris. However, the article also highlights Buttigieg's questionable record as Transportation Secretary, including his failure to visit East Palestine, Ohio, after a chemical spill and his oversight of an EV charging station project that burned through billions with little output. The article concludes that it is unlikely that Buttigieg will become the next President, citing the Democrat Party's declining popularity and voters' rejection of their globalist agenda.

**Potential Democratic Candidates for 2028 Presidential Election**
The Democratic Party is struggling to find a suitable candidate for the 2028 presidential election. The party has a significant image problem, with only 27% of voters in swing states believing that the Democrats care about their concerns. The party's internal debates are dominated by self-criticism and blame-shifting, rather than finding a consensus as an opposition party. Despite this, speculation is already underway about potential candidates for 2028. Several governors from the battleground states in the Midwest are being mentioned as possible contenders. Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, has been mentioned as a potential candidate, having already run for president in 2020 and 2024. Pete Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary, has also been mentioned, having run for president in 2020 and having a strong track record of building bridges with Trump supporters. Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, has also been mentioned, having run for vice president in 2024 and having a strong relationship with former President Barack Obama. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, has also been mentioned, having built a reputation as a centrist and having a strong track record of building a coalition of Democrats and independents. J.B. Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has also been mentioned, having run for president in 2020 and having a strong track record of building a coalition of Democrats and independents. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the representative from New York, has also been mentioned, having built a reputation as a progressive and having a strong track record of building a coalition of Democrats and independents. Kamala Harris, the former vice president, has also been mentioned, having run for president in 2020 and having a strong track record of building a coalition of Democrats and independents. However, it is unlikely that she will run again in 2028, given her poor performance in the 2020 election.

**What it takes for a Democrat to win in 2028 | Will Bunch Newsletter**
The article discusses the potential Democratic candidates for the 2028 presidential election. The author, Will Bunch, presents a list of six candidates who he believes have the potential to lead the resistance against Donald Trump's authoritarianism. The list includes: New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. The author argues that these candidates have shown leadership and a willingness to take a stand against Trump's policies, and that they have the potential to unite the Democratic Party and lead it to victory in 2028. The article also touches on the controversy surrounding Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's efforts to work with Trump, and how this has damaged her reputation among core Democrats. The author concludes by highlighting the importance of resistance against Trump's authoritarianism and the need for a strong leader to lead the Democratic Party in 2028.

**The only way Democrats can easily win in 2028**
The author believes that the only way Democrats can easily win in 2028 is if the Republican Party and America's conservatives repeat the same mistakes they made in the UK, where the Conservative Party's betrayal of their constituents led to a massive loss of votes. The author argues that President Trump is a once-in-a-century leader who has the potential to unwind and trash progressive and woke policies, laws, and corporate dictates. However, if the Republican Party and its supporters fail to back Trump and his vision, tens of millions of American voters will stay home in 2028, making a difference in the election. The author warns that the 'uni-party' will fight back with a vengeance if Trump's grip on power is threatened, and that the establishment will sabotage him in the White House, Congress, the federal government, the courts, and the mainstream media. The author concludes that Trump's supporters must have his back and not make mistakes, as they have poured all their hope, trust, and faith into him.

**Star search: The future Democratic presidential field can't escape the past - Washington Examiner**
The Democratic Party faces significant challenges in the future, particularly in light of their defeat in the 2024 presidential election. The party's reliance on progressive ideology and its failure to appeal to the broader electorate are major concerns. Former Vice President Kamala Harris is currently the favorite to win the 2028 nomination, but her history of moving up the career ladder without significant accomplishments raises questions about her viability. Other potential contenders, such as Governor Gavin Newsom and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, also face significant challenges in appealing to the party's base and the broader electorate. The article suggests that the party may need to move towards a more centrist approach to win in 2028, but this would require a significant shift in the party's ideology and messaging.

**Democrats May Be Down, but Their Appetite for Voting Hasn’t Dimmed**
Despite the Democratic Party's current struggles, their appetite for voting has not diminished. In special elections, Democrats have shown strength, particularly in Florida's First and Sixth Districts and Wisconsin's Supreme Court election. While these results may not be indicative of a high-turnout presidential election, they suggest that Democrats will likely win many elections between now and November 2028. The continued Democratic strength in special elections may also erode President Trump's support among congressional Republicans, particularly in lower-turnout midterms. As Republican members contemplate a challenging cycle, they may decide it's in their interest to distinguish themselves from the president. As noted by The Downballot, Democrats' strength in special elections is similar to their strength in 2017 and stronger than it was during the Biden years. As one observer points out, 'Democrats, despite their challenges, are probably going to win a lot of elections between now and November 2028.'

The author speculates about the 2028 elections, predicting a young, vibrant president with widespread support in the base. They believe Democrats will win, and third parties will do well as the Republican party declines. The author hopes for a more open and inclusive Democratic party, where age, experience, and traditional barriers are not as important. They mention several potential candidates, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who they consider the 'best choice' due to her intelligence, communication skills, and anti-corruption stance. They also highlight her bilingualism, youth, and online engagement.

**2028 US Presidential Election: Top Democratic Candidates Emerge**
Despite the 2028 presidential election being relatively far away, the competition within the Democratic Party is already heating up. Several prominent leaders are seeking to strengthen their national presence and build strong support networks in preparation for the biggest race in the United States. While no official candidate has announced their candidacy yet, the actions of some political figures clearly indicate their future ambitions. Amidst the ongoing uncertainty within the party about how to deal with President Donald Trump's policies after his 2024 win, the competition between Democrats in 2028 appears more open than ever. A report by Axios highlighted the top names vying for the potential presidential race, and their political moves that may pave the way to the White House. Pete Buttigieg has shown his national ambitions clearly by running for president in 2020 while serving as the mayor of South Bend in Indiana. He served as the Transportation Secretary in President Biden's administration, where he faced numerous crises. He was considered a strong candidate for the Michigan governor or Senate race next year, but he announced his withdrawal from both races last week. Stacey Abrams has long been considered a potential Democratic presidential candidate, as she has worked to build a national network of supporters and donors over the years and has received more media attention. After Trump's 2024 win, Abrams called for a special legislative session in California to raise funds to challenge the Republican president's policies legally. Abrams has recently tried to present himself as a moderate politician to expand his base of support, and he sparked controversy when he said in a conversation with right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk that allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' and women's sports is 'extremely unfair.' Emanuel, who served as the US Ambassador to Japan during the previous Biden administration, has raised questions about his potential candidacy. Emanuel was Obama's White House Chief of Staff and has appeared in several public events warning of the need for Democrats to reassess their political strategies before the 2026 midterm elections. Emanuel joined CNN as a commentator last month and writes an article in The Washington Post. Walz announced last month that he would not run for the new Senate seat in Minnesota in 2026, leaving the door open for a potential presidential candidacy. Walz, who served as the Governor of Minnesota for two terms and was the Democratic nominee for Vice President in the 2024 presidential election, began a national tour of town halls in Republican-leaning districts. Pritzker is a wealthy businessman who has established himself as one of the symbols of 'Democratic resistance' in Illinois. He has worked to strengthen his national image in recent years and was included in unofficial lists as a potential alternative to President Biden after his poor performance in the first presidential debate last year. Whitmer is considered one of the rising stars in the Democratic Party and has presented herself as a pragmatic and moderate leader since Trump's win. She met with Trump this week to discuss issues related to jobs, tariffs, and defense investments. In recent weeks, she has praised the deployment of National Guard troops to the border to combat illegal immigration and expressed openness to imposing new tariffs to protect industry. However, she refused to join a multi-state lawsuit against Trump's attempt to ban birthright citizenship. Polis, who served as Governor of Colorado for two terms, was one of the names floated as a potential alternative to Biden in the 2024 election. Like Yoder, he has taken a centrist approach since Trump took office, saying in his address to the state that he hopes to work with Trump and Congress 'to secure the border, stop human trafficking, and prevent the flow of illegal weapons and drugs.' He supported Trump's controversial nomination of Robert Kennedy Jr. for Secretary of Health and Human Services. The list of potential candidates also includes Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, and Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy. Axios believes that Democratic leaders are divided on how to face Trump, given the party's identity crisis after the 2024 elections. This time, there is no consensus on the strategy, as Democratic leaders are taking different paths.

**Stephen A. Smith argues he can win presidential election after Democrats' 'pathetic' 2024 run**
ESPN host Stephen A. Smith has sparked speculation about a potential presidential bid in 2028, stating that the Democratic Party looks 'pathetic' after the 2024 election. However, he clarified that he has no plans to run, saying, 'My lifestyle is quite lovely, I would not want to ruin that by running for the presidency of the United States of America.' Smith believes that a candidate with broad recognition like himself could win the election, citing the Democratic Party's current divided state and lack of a clear frontrunner. He also expressed his opposition to the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, criticizing former President Donald Trump's stance on the issue, saying, 'It's one thing to get rid of it all together, it's another thing entirely to articulate and verbalize the position that... everybody that was associated with DEI are unqualified individuals.'
