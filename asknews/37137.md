**US Government Reports 757 UFO Sightings, Including One That Damaged an F-16 Fighter Jet**
In 2023, a unidentified flying object (UFO) was reported in the US, colliding with an F-16 fighter jet during a training mission over Arizona, causing damage to the aircraft. According to The New York Post, these unidentified objects have been seen in groups of up to eight and have been classified as drones on occasion. 'Pentagon investigators and the Federal Aviation Administration have confirmed that these sightings have been documented every time a pilot has reported them to the corresponding air traffic control facility', says the medium. The incident is just one of a number of mysterious objects that have been spotted over the US Air Force's training fields in Arizona, according to multiple reports by The New York Post. Three more encounters with these objects were detected the following day. 'There has been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things from Arizona, particularly at the border' with Mexico, said former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo to the medium. The US government has presented 757 reports of this type between May 2023 and June 2024, of which 708 occurred in the air, and only 49 were marked as 'Case closed' in the latest report issued by the Office of Anomaly Resolution. The US government has dismissed, for now, the security threat posed by these sightings, but some officials, including Ron Vitiello, principal advisor to the US Customs and Border Protection Office, suggest that the mysterious objects could be drones used by foreign cartels to spy or smuggle drugs. Vitiello stated that the 'unlimited funding' of the cartels could explain the advanced technology never seen before. 'Perhaps they have technology that we are not used to seeing in the drone sector', said Vitiello.

**UFO crashes into US Air Force fighter jet over Arizona**
A US Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet was hit by an unidentified flying object, believed to be a drone, over Arizona on January 19, 2023. The collision cracked the canopy protecting the pilot, but no injuries were reported. The incident is one of 22 reported UFO sightings by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), there have been hundreds of UFO reports made in recent years, with Arizona becoming a hotspot for sightings. AARO, the Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, has received 757 UAP reports worldwide between May 2023 and June 2024, with at least 410 occurring over the US. Whistleblowers have revealed that many UFO sightings are taking place in Arizona, particularly on the border, and some believe that Mexican cartels may be involved in launching high-tech spy missions into the US. 'A lot of people reporting a lot of things out of Arizona, particularly on the border,' said Luis Elizondo, a former government intelligence officer. 'I've seen orbs that were off in the distance. I've seen crafts that were cigar-shaped, I've seen triangles,' said Bob Thompson, a former US Customs and Border Protection agent.

**UFOs Are Swarming U.S. Military Zones -- And One Just Crashed Into a Fighter Jet**
A U.S. F-16 fighter jet collided with an unidentified flying object (UFO) during a training mission over Arizona in January. The object, described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system,' or UAS, hit the plane's canopy mid-flight. This incident is one of dozens of reported midair encounters between military pilots and strange objects over restricted airspace in the Southwest. Since 2020, military pilots have reported encountering objects such as metallic spheres, drones, and objects moving at high speeds. Former Pentagon UAP investigator Luis Elizondo said, 'These reports are coming in constantly,' and former CBP official Ron Vitiello speculated that the technology behind these objects may be more advanced than what's publicly known. The U.S. government has logged 757 sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena from May 2023 to June 2024, with only 49 marked 'case closed.'

**US Scientists Report 757 Documented UFO Sightings, Cartels Suspected of Using Drones for Espionage and Drug Trafficking**
US scientists have reported 757 documented cases of UFO sightings. According to Ron Vitello, a US Customs and Border Protection advisor, cartels have 'unlimited funding' that allows them to implement new technologies, including drones, to smuggle drugs into the US. In 2023, a US military F-16 Viper fighter jet was damaged by a UFO while flying over Arizona, forcing it to be temporarily taken out of service. The incident was confirmed by official documents from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA has confirmed that it is investigating all reports of UFO sightings, especially those that are confirmed by radar data. The US government has documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of them occurring in airspace. Only 49 cases have been officially closed. Many of the sightings occurred in areas where military exercises were taking place in Arizona and surrounding states. Some officials, including Vitello, believe that these objects may be drones used by cartels for espionage or drug trafficking. According to NewsNation, cartels have already used similar devices to transport up to 10 kg of cargo at a time. Vitello stated, 'They have unlimited funding, which allows them to implement new technologies that the US has not seen before.' This, he believes, is part of the business model of criminal organizations that continuously improve their methods of delivering prohibited substances into the US.

**Mysterious UFOs Swarm Over US Air Force Training Fields in Arizona**
A UFO that collided with a US Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet in January 2023 is just one of a swarm of mysterious objects buzzing around the Air Force's training fields in Arizona, according to multiple reports. The unidentified flying object struck the 'bubble canopy' of a $63 million F-16 Viper, damaging it and temporarily grounding the aircraft, according to FAA documents. The military aircraft was hit by an orange and white 'UAS' (unmanned aerial system) while in the air, according to the FAA documents. 'There's been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things from Arizona, particularly along the border with Mexico,' said former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo to NewsNation this month. The FAA told The Post in a statement that the agency 'documents unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) sightings whenever a pilot reports one to a air traffic control facility.' The government reported 757 such incidents between May 2023 and June 2024 (708 of which occurred in the air) and only 49 were marked as 'Case closed' in the latest report from the Office of Anomaly Resolution. The small unidentified objects seen in Arizona fly in groups of up to eight and are sometimes characterized as drones, according to War Zone, which noted that the incidents took place at high altitudes near military combat training sites since January 2020. 'They're clearly being transmitted through multiple military reporting channels,' added War Zone. Some US officials, including Ron Vitiello, chief advisor to US Customs and Border Protection, speculate that the mysterious flying objects could be drones used by foreign cartels to spy or smuggle drugs. 'Maybe they have technology we're not used to seeing in the drone space,' said Vitiello.

**Unidentified Flying Objects: A Mysterious Phenomenon in Arizona**
The US Air Force has reported multiple incidents of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in Arizona, with some incidents involving collisions with military aircraft. According to the New York Post, a report by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that a mysterious object collided with an F-16 fighter jet worth $63 million in January 2023, causing damage and temporarily grounding the aircraft. The FAA documents also mentioned three other encounters with drones in the same day. Former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo told NewsNation that there was a lot of activity and many reports of strange phenomena in Arizona, particularly along the US-Mexico border. The FAA stated that it investigates reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) whenever a pilot reports them to the Air Traffic Control Center. If the information is confirmed, the FAA shares the report with the US Department of Defense's Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, which is responsible for investigating UAPs that pose a threat to national security or safety. Between May 2023 and June 2024, the US government received 757 reports of UAPs, with 708 of them being investigated in the air and 49 cases being closed. The small, unidentified objects have been spotted in groups of up to eight and are sometimes classified as drones. Some US officials, including Ron Vitello, the US Customs and Border Protection's chief of operations, believe that the mysterious objects could be drones used by foreign cartels for espionage or drug trafficking.

**US Air Force Pilots Report Multiple UFO Encounters in Arizona**
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has confirmed that US Air Force pilots have reported multiple encounters with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) near a training area in Arizona. In one incident, a UFO collided with an F-16 Viper fighter jet, causing significant damage. NewsNation border reporter Ali Bradley believes that drug cartels are using drones to smuggle drugs or gather intelligence. Bradley stated, 'Drug cartels want to get information from the US, that's their modus operandi, their primary goal is to stay one step ahead of us.' She added, 'What's better than infiltrating our military facilities?' In the past decade, drug cartels have used drones to transport up to 10 kilograms of drugs, but the technology used in these French and Russian-made agricultural drones makes them difficult to track. Luis Elizondo, a former Pentagon UAP investigator, testified in Congress that he had heard about these encounters. He told NewsNation, 'I can tell you that in Arizona, especially in the border area, there has been a lot of activity, many people have reported various anomalous phenomena.' In December 2024, then-US Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas stated that the federal government is taking action to address the frequent sightings of unidentified drones in New Jersey and other areas. He said, 'There is no evidence that foreign entities are involved in the drone sightings over New Jersey and other areas of the US East Coast, but the Department of Homeland Security is being vigilant in its investigation, and the federal government has provided additional resources, personnel, and technology to assist the New Jersey State Police in investigating the drone sightings.'

**US Air Force Pilots Report Multiple UFO Encounters in Arizona**
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has confirmed in recent files that US Air Force pilots have reported multiple encounters with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) near a training area in Arizona. In one incident, a UFO collided with an F-16 Viper fighter jet, causing significant damage. NewsNation border reporter Ali Bradley believes that drug cartels are using drones to smuggle drugs or conduct surveillance. She stated, 'Drug cartels want to get US intelligence, that's their modus operandi, their primary goal is to stay one step ahead of us.' Bradley added, 'What's better than penetrating our military facilities?' In the past decade, drug cartels have used drones to transport up to 10 kilograms of drugs, but the technology used in these French and Russian-made agricultural drones makes them difficult to track. Luis Elizondo, a former Pentagon UAP investigator, testified in Congress that he had heard about these encounters.

In 1952, US pastor Louis A. Gardner wrote to physicist Albert Einstein asking for his opinion on UFOs, and received a brief response: 'Those people have seen something, what it is, I don't know, and I don't want to know.'

**Alleged KGB report detailing encounter between Soviet soldiers ans a UFO**
A report claiming that Soviet soldiers were 'petrified' by extraterrestrial beings in Ukraine has been refuted by experts as a fake. The report, presented as a declassified CIA file, describes a UFO encounter where 23 soldiers turned into stone after opening fire on aliens. However, former CIA agent Tracy Walder said, 'This is not a document that the CIA originated,' and explained that the report actually came from an open-source service called the Foreign Broadcast Information Service. Walder reassured the public that the report wasn't written by the CIA. The report has sparked interest in UFOs, now officially termed UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena), which surged in recent years. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense formed a UAP Task Force to track, analyze, and catalog unusual aerial sightings. According to The Economic Times, last year alone, the Pentagon received 757 UAP reports from the public between May 2023 and June 2024.

**What did the Pentagon reveal about bizarre egg-shaped UFO case in new announcement?**
The Pentagon has launched an investigation into claims made by US government contractor Jake Barber, who alleges he was involved in secret missions to recover alien technology. Barber described piloting helicopters during classified operations and encountering an 'egg-shaped' craft with no visible engine or thermal signatures. The case has been added to the 21 ongoing UAP investigations being conducted by the Department of Defense, which recently disclosed receiving 757 UAP reports between May 2023 and June 2024. Despite increased government acknowledgment of UAP encounters, skepticism remains, with investigative journalist Ross Coulthart raising concerns about the extent of disclosure. Congress is also stepping in, with Representative Anna Paulina Luna leading a new task force aimed at declassifying government secrets, including information related to UFOs.

**Military pilot reports 'weird' encounter with UFO during secret mission**
A US Air Force pilot, identified as 'Troy 21,' reported a close encounter with a UFO while on a secret mission over California on September 17, 2024. The object, described as a 'dark grey cylindrical object' roughly the size of a football, passed within 10 feet of the pilot's aircraft wing. Former FBI agent Ben Hansen speculated that the object was travelling at Mach 2, eliminating any normal explanation, such as a drone. The incident has raised concerns for aircraft safety in controlled airspace. This encounter adds to the growing list of close UFO sightings that are fuelling public belief in alien visitors to Earth.

**Leaked recording: US Air Force pilot reports UFO over California in 2024**
A US Air Force pilot reported a UFO sighting in September 2024 while flying a Beechcraft 350 in California. The pilot, identified as 'Troy 21,' described a football-sized, dark, cylindrical object passing underneath his wing. The incident was reported to the National UFO Reporting Center. Radar systems on the plane detected an object 60 miles away, but it is unclear if it was the same object. The UFO's speed exceeded Mach 2 within two minutes, which is not possible for most drones. This incident is one of several recent UFO sightings, including a temporary suspension of operations at the Gaziantep Airport in Turkey due to a reported UFO sighting.

**UFO Sighting Causes Temporary Halt in Flights at Turkish Airport**
A UFO sighting by a pilot on February 17 led to a temporary halt in flights at Gaziantep Airport in southern Turkey. According to 'Türkiye Today', the incident occurred at around 10pm local time when a pilot reported seeing a bright UFO at an altitude of 8,000-10,000 feet. Although the object did not appear on radar, air traffic control was notified and flights were suspended as a precautionary measure. After a 3-hour investigation, officials confirmed that there was no direct threat and flights were resumed. A Turkish expert suggested that the light seen by the pilot could have come from a Starlink satellite, while officials speculated that it might have been a drone. This is not the first time Gaziantep Airport has been closed due to a UFO sighting, with a similar incident occurring on May 20, 2023.

**US Pilot Claims to be Part of Secret UFO Program**
A former US Air Force pilot, Jake Barber, has come forward with claims of being part of a secret program to study and retrieve UFOs. Barber alleges that he was involved in the evacuation of a crashed UFO to a secret base in Nevada, and that he has experienced strange symptoms, including hair loss and severe burns, which he believes are related to his exposure to the UFO. The US government has acknowledged the existence of a secret program to study UFOs, and a former CIA agent has confirmed that the program is still active. The FBI has also confirmed that it has a special unit dedicated to investigating UFO sightings. Barber's claims have been corroborated by other witnesses, including a former Navy pilot who claims to have seen a UFO while on a mission. The US government has been criticized for its handling of UFO sightings, with some accusing it of covering up the truth. A former NASA employee has come forward with claims that the agency has been aware of UFOs for decades, but has been silenced by the government. The issue of UFOs has sparked a heated debate, with some arguing that it is a national security issue, while others believe that it is a matter of public interest. The Russian Academy of Sciences has also been involved in the search for extraterrestrial life, with a giant radio telescope in Karachay-Cherkessia capable of detecting signals from millions of light-years away. Scientists are searching for exoplanets similar to Earth, and have discovered 18 potential candidates. The search for extraterrestrial life is an ongoing effort, with scientists using a variety of methods to search for signs of life, including the detection of biosignatures in the atmospheres of exoplanets. While there is currently no conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life, scientists remain hopeful that one day they will find evidence of life beyond Earth.
