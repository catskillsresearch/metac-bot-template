**The moon: Why we want to go back**
NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole, called Artemis Base Camp, and launch a new space station, Gateway, into the moon's orbit. A joint China-Russia project, the International Lunar Research Station, also plans to build a moon base by 2035. The moon's resources, including water, regolith, and helium-3, make it an attractive destination for future space missions. These resources can be used to sustain lunar bases, extract minerals from asteroids, and even provide fuel for nuclear fusion power. The moon's distance from Earth also makes it an ideal location for testing technologies and equipment for future Mars missions. According to Sara Pastor, ESA's Lunar and Gateway Program Manager, 'Humans have had a continued presence in space for the past 20 years aboard the International Space Station. But the ISS is only 250 miles away in low-Earth orbit, which is as little as four hours after launching from Earth. The moon is 250,000 miles away -- about three days' spaceflight -- and a far riskier journey for astronauts.' The first research on the moon aims to make that journey safer and easier, and to determine how human activity affects the lunar environment. 'ESA is developing instruments for radiation environment measurements, drilling and in-situ sample analysis, geophysics and lunar space weather,' Pastor said. The long-term goal of building surface and orbital moon bases is to serve as a staging post for more distant space travel, and to provide a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration, as Pastor noted, 'A colony on the moon will be extremely useful and a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration.'

**Russians Eager to Travel to Mars: 27% Want to Take the Leap**
According to a survey conducted by SuperJob for RIA Novosti among 1600 respondents, approximately one in four Russians (27%) are interested in traveling to Mars. The desire to travel to Mars is stronger among younger people. Despite this, 73% of respondents are not willing to trade Earth for Mars. Men are 1.5 times more likely to dream of flying to the Red Planet than women. In cities with a population of over a million, the most enthusiastic about traveling to Mars are residents of Ufa (38%), Yekaterinburg (37%), and Rostov-on-Don (33%). Residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg are less interested in traveling to Mars, with 25% and 26% respectively. As a reminder, Elon Musk recently announced a roadmap for Mars colonization and presented a new generation of the Starship rocket, which will travel to the Red Planet, first with robots and then with people, as Musk said, 'It's a big step for humanity.'

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**Algeria among top 5 nationalities of permanent residents in Quebec**
In 2024, Quebec continued to attract a significant number of permanent immigrants, with increasingly diverse geographic origins. Algerians are now among the top 5 nationalities of permanent residents. According to the 2025 demographic report published by the Institut de la statistique du Québec (ISQ), the migration movements added 156,700 people to the Quebec population, a figure among the highest in its history, although lower than the record of 193,000 in 2023. The decrease is mainly due to a decline in international migration gains, with an international migratory balance of 158,600 people compared to 200,300 the previous year. Non-permanent residents (NPR) - temporary workers, international students, and asylum seekers - continued to play a major role in demographic growth. Their number increased by 103,700 in 2024, bringing their total to 616,600 as of January 1, 2025. Although their contribution remains higher than that of permanent immigrants, it was less important than in 2023 (152,100). Quebec: Cameroon in the lead, Algeria in the top 5. In 2024, Quebec welcomed 59,500 permanent immigrants, a slightly higher figure than in 2023 (52,800). Nearly half (48%) of them had previously held a non-permanent resident status, a proportion much higher than in the early 2010s, where it was around 20%. Among these admissions, economic immigration dominated, representing 69% of the total. Family reunification accounted for 17%, while refugees and people in similar situations made up 12% of new arrivals. For the first time, Cameroon became the main country of origin of permanent immigrants to Quebec in 2024, with 7,327 admissions (15% of the total). France came in second place (12%), followed by China (8%), Tunisia (7%), Algeria (6%), and Morocco (5%). With 3,650 new permanent residents, Algeria thus confirmed its place among the top 5 nationalities in Quebec immigration. This growing presence reflects a diversification of migration flows, marked by a strong increase in African origins. 'This trend is part of a broader diversification of immigration to Quebec,' said an ISQ spokesperson. 'We are seeing a significant increase in the number of immigrants from Africa, particularly from countries such as Cameroon, Algeria, and Morocco.'

**Turkey Aims to Become First Country to Send Two Exploration Vehicles to Moon's South Pole Simultaneously**
Turkey aims to become the first country to send two exploration vehicles to the south pole of the Moon simultaneously. The 'CHERI' rovers, developed in collaboration with China, will be designed to operate in the challenging surface conditions of the Moon's south pole, using artificial intelligence to create a 3D map of the surface. The project, led by the Middle East Technical University (ODTÜ), involves international cooperation with the China National Space Administration (CNSA), Zhejiang University, and STAR.VISION. The mission aims to support China's plan to explore the Moon's south pole and determine the location of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) by 2030. The 'CHERI' rovers, weighing approximately 5 kilograms, are expected to be sent to the Moon's south pole by the end of 2028. Turkey will become the 6th country to send a spacecraft to the Moon's south pole and the first to send two simultaneously, according to ODTÜ researcher, 'This is a historic moment for Turkey, and we are proud to be a part of this international collaboration.'

**Elon Musk targets 2026 for first space mission to Mars**
Elon Musk aims to launch the first space mission to Mars by the end of 2026, but acknowledges that overcoming technological hurdles, particularly in-orbit refueling, is crucial for the long journey. A favorable planetary alignment in late 2026 provides a unique opportunity for a relatively short transit between Earth and Mars. If Starship is not ready by then, a new mission in 2028 would be targeted. The first mission would consist of -built Optimus humanoid robots. Despite failed test flights, including a fuel leak and uncontrolled spinning on the ninth test flight, Musk remains optimistic, citing each failure as valuable data for accelerated testing. NASA relies on Starship for its Artemis program, which aims to send astronauts to the moon as early as 2027, a stepping stone to possible human missions to Mars in the 2030s. Musk's ultimate vision is to launch up to 2,000 Starships every two years to establish a permanent and self-sustaining human settlement on Mars.

**3.7 Billion-Year-Old Organic Molecules on Mars: A Step Towards a New Era of Life?**
NASA and private space companies are in a priority race, while organic molecules discovered on Mars have caused excitement in the scientific community. Andy Weir's 'The Martian' novel and film, which has become a reality, is a step-by-step process. What does this mean for humanity and our world? In recent years, Mars has become the biggest excitement for the scientific community and space enthusiasts. Mars, being a neighbor to Earth, has a potential for new life and exploration. Searching for life signs on Mars, solving the planet's past climate, and establishing permanent settlements, are considered important milestones for humanity's future in space. The Martian film, which was adapted to the big screen in 2015, detailed and realistically portrayed NASA's plans to send humans to Mars by 2035. The film tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, who is left behind on Mars after a storm and must survive with limited resources. NASA also makes a great effort to rescue him. The Martian has turned into a reality. In the US, there is a debate about whether Mars or the Moon should be prioritized. Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman thinks that Mars should be prioritized. However, Elon Musk's priority is also Mars, but he has been criticized for his approach. China's increasing activity on the Moon is also affecting the US's strategic decisions. Trump and Musk's priority on Mars can be interpreted as follows: 'Mars, although it seems like both of their priorities, has not been left out of the equation. Ultimately, Mars is a difficult road, and the Moon is an important station. It's a destination, as well as a stopover.' 'Of course, Mars is much more important and has a much greater return. Both scientifically and technologically, Mars travel requires significant investments. The work done will result in technologies that can be adapted to daily life on Earth, changing our lives in different forms.' 'Even if humans are not on Mars by 2031, they will be very close to it in the 2030s.' Elon Musk has announced that he will send an 'unmanned' spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026 and that humans can go to Mars by 2031. Do you think humanity is close to achieving this goal? 'Because this work has long exceeded the realm of imagination. This process can be described as 'a very ambitious goal.' The fact that large companies are investing so much in this indicates that they have significant commercial expectations. The timeline may be a bit behind schedule. Humans may not be on Mars by 2031, but they will be very close to it in the late 2030s.' 'The fact that Mars has signs of past life, which may indicate that the necessary conditions for life exist there, is a significant discovery.' Sabancı University Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Astrofysics Professor Ersin Göğüş recently discovered large organic molecules on Mars. This has raised questions about biological activity on Mars. The molecules found on Mars are similar to those produced by life on Earth and have remained intact for approximately 3.7 billion years without being affected by geological activity, moisture, or heat. This suggests that the molecules on Mars are as old as life on Earth. What does this mean? Can Mars give us clues about our world's past and future? 'Of course, it can.' 'We know that the first signs of life appeared on Mars and Earth around the same time, approximately 4 billion years ago. We also know that Mars lost its atmosphere due to extreme solar winds, which could have led to the end of life. Although this is not a risk for Earth, humanity's excessive use of the planet could have negative consequences.' 'The Mars mission is motivating the development of new technologies.' Some people criticize the billions of dollars spent on sending humans to Mars, saying that 'it's a luxury to invest in space while solving problems on Earth.' Do you think this criticism is justified?

**Elon Musk's Ambitious Plan to Colonize Mars: 5 to 500 Starships by 2033**
Elon Musk plans to send five Starships to Mars in 2026, followed by a drastic increase in the number of launches, with 20 ships in 2028, 100 in 2030, and 500 in 2033. According to Musk, this plan is a crucial step in colonizing Mars. As Musk said, 'It's a very ambitious plan, but I think it's necessary to make humanity a multi-planetary species.' However, some people are skeptical about the feasibility of this plan, questioning whether it's a point of inflection for humanity or just a sign of Musk's mental detachment.

**China and Russia Sign Agreement to Build Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon**
Russia and China have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. The reactor will provide energy to the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), a permanent scientific base led by the two countries. The plant will be built autonomously, without human presence. According to Roscosmos director-general Yury Borisov, the technological stages of the project are 'almost ready'. The ILRS will conduct fundamental space research and test technology for long-term, unmanned operations, with the prospect of human presence on the Moon. The project has attracted global interest, with 17 countries already joining, including Egypt, Pakistan, Venezuela, Thailand, and South Africa. The first step for the lunar base installation will be in 2028, with the launch of the Chang'e-8 mission, which will mark the first Chinese astronaut landing on the Moon. Between 2030 and 2035, China and Russia will use five heavy-lift rockets to transport and assemble the first robotic parts of the base on the Moon. Wu Yanhua, head of China's space exploration project, said that after the installation of the basic parts, the country will make further launches to expand the project, connecting the base to a lunar-orbiting space station and creating two support points, one on the lunar equator and the other on the far side of the Moon. This agreement comes at a time when China is growing increasingly in the space scene. In 2013, China landed a rover on the Moon through the Chang'e 3 mission, and has since sent more spacecraft to the lunar surface to collect samples and map the Moon's surface.

**The New Space Race: Who Will Be the First to Return to the Moon?**
The competition to explore and potentially exploit the Moon has been ongoing for decades, with various nations and private companies participating. The United States and the Soviet Union were the first to engage in this competition during the Cold War, with the US ultimately landing the first humans on the Moon in 1969. Since then, 12 American astronauts have visited the Moon, with the last two being Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt in 1972. The private sector has recently become involved in the competition, with China successfully landing a spacecraft on the Moon's far side in 2019 and announcing plans to send humans to the Moon by 2030. The US has also announced plans to return humans to the Moon by 2027, although this has been delayed due to budget cuts. The US is counting on private companies to participate in the competition, with companies such as Intuitive Machines and Firefly Aerospace already working on lunar missions. As the competition heats up, other nations such as India and the UAE are also joining in, making the Moon a focal point of space exploration and potential resource exploitation.

**China's Plans to Send a Manned Mission to the Moon in 2027 Revealed**
A leaked document has revealed China's plans to send a manned mission to the Moon in 2027, although it is possible that the mission could be delayed to 2029 if the 2027 and 2028 tests are successful. According to the document, China's strategy differs from that of the United States, which is using a complex combination of the Orion capsule, the SLS rocket, and the Starship spacecraft. China, on the other hand, will use a simpler architecture, launching its new Long March 10 (CZ-10) rocket to send the Mengzhou spacecraft, crewed by three astronauts, and the Lanyue spacecraft, which will wait in lunar orbit to dock with the crew before beginning the descent. The CZ-10 is expected to debut in 2027 with an unmanned mission, paving the way for future launches. In 2028, new tests will be conducted in lunar orbit to validate the docking and descent systems without crew, before attempting a manned mission. The landing, which could take place in 2029 or early 2030, would mark the arrival of the first two Chinese people on the Moon, and the first people since 1972. It is likely that one of the selected crew members will be a woman, in a strategic move that could take the achievement of sending the first woman to the Moon away from NASA, due to the constant delays of the Artemis III mission. If the mission is successful, two Chinese astronauts, known as taikonauts, will walk on the lunar surface, solidifying Asia's victory in the new space race.
