**Trump's Return to the White House Damages US Reputation Worldwide**
The perception of the United States in the world has significantly deteriorated since the return of President Donald Trump to the White House. According to the 'Democracy Perception Index' (DPI) 2025, published by the 'Alliance of Democracies' foundation on Monday, May 12, the indicator of relations with the US worldwide has plummeted from +22% in 2024 to -5% in 2025, lower than China's (+14%) and close to Russia's (-9%). The share of countries where the US is viewed positively has decreased from 76% to 45% over the same period. Former NATO Secretary-General and founder of the 'Alliance of Democracies' foundation Anders Fogh Rasmussen stated that he is not surprised by the sharp decline in the US reputation. 'President Trump unleashed a trade war, insulted the Ukrainian president in the Oval Office, made allies feel vulnerable, and enemies feel emboldened,' Rasmussen said, as quoted by Reuters. Meanwhile, China has improved its global positions, surpassing the US for the first time and recording predominantly positive perception in all regions except Europe. Russia, whose reputation worsened after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, is still slightly less popular than the US, but its image is also improving. In allied countries such as Israel, South Korea, Japan, Poland, and Ukraine, Washington is clearly preferred over Beijing. However, in many European countries, China's perception is more positive than the US, as well as in most Asian and Latin American countries. The survey showed that Donald Trump is less popular in the world than his Russian and Chinese counterparts, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. The US president is viewed negatively in 82% of countries worldwide, significantly worse than Putin's (61%) and Xi's (44%) ratings. The 'Democracy Perception Index' is based on the results of a public opinion poll conducted by the research company Nira Data from April 9 to 23, 2025, with over 111,000 respondents from 100 countries worldwide. The study was published ahead of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit, which will take place on May 13-14.

**Dems Won't Like This: Latest Poll About Direction of Country Hits Astonishing Number**
A recent Rasmussen poll has found that 49% of Americans believe the country is headed in the 'Right Direction', a three-point net positive, with 46% thinking it's on the 'Wrong Track'. This is the highest 'Right Direction' number in 20 years, according to Mark Mitchell, a commentator for Rasmussen. President Donald Trump's approval rating is also at 52%, which is high. Mitchell notes that this number may increase further due to recent positive developments, such as ceasefires and trade deals. This poll is in contrast to the Democratic Party's stance on issues like immigration and their treatment of ICE facilities.

**Are Trump's Approval Ratings Already Going Up?**
President Donald Trump's approval ratings have shown signs of improvement, with his net approval going up from -9.2% on April 27 to -4.8% on May 11, according to Decision Desk HQ's average. Recent polls, including those from RMG Research, Quantus Insights, and Big Data Poll, have also shown improvement in Trump's numbers. The president's success in trade deal negotiations and his handling of immigration and crime have contributed to this improvement. In contrast, Democrats remain in disarray, with record-high unfavorables/disapproval numbers. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's 17% favorable rating and his comments on Trump's numbers have sparked criticism. Meanwhile, the Republican Party is seeing improvements in comparison to the Democratic Party, with internal polling showing Republicans in a better position for the 2026 midterm elections.

**Donald Trump's approval rating changes direction**
According to a Quantus Insights poll, Donald Trump's approval rating is in a statistical tie, with 48.2% of people approving and 48.3% disapproving. However, other polls have shown mixed results, with some suggesting a slightly positive approval rating and others pointing to negative perceptions of Trump. Scott Lucas, a professor in international politics, believes that Trump's language on tariffs may have contributed to an improvement in his approval rating. Nevertheless, Democratic pollster Matt McDermott cautions against reading too much into the polls, stating that small shifts in the numbers are just 'statistical noise' and not signs of growing support. Trump's approval ratings will likely remain sensitive to news about tariffs, economic data, and foreign policy developments in the coming month.

**U.S. Presidents' Approval Ratings After 100 Days (1953-Today)**
Donald Trump's second term has started with low public support, with an approval rating of 47% in January and 44% by April, marking one of the weakest starts to a presidential term in modern history. This is only slightly higher than the 40% approval rating he held during the first 100 days of his first term, the lowest ever recorded for a newly elected modern U.S. president. In contrast, most of Trump's predecessors benefited from a 'honeymoon period,' with early approval ratings well above 50%. According to Gallup, the average first-quarter approval rating for presidents elected between 1952 and 2020 is 60%, with John F. Kennedy leading the pack at 81%. The U.S. economy has also struggled, with GDP projected to shrink by 0.3% in Q1 2025, and the U.S. stock market has seen major volatility amid tariff announcements and rollbacks, falling 21% from its peak in February.

**US Reputation Plummets Globally, China Seen More Favorably**
According to a recent international survey, the reputation of the United States has suffered significantly under President Donald Trump. In more than 75% of the countries surveyed, there is a more positive perception of China than of the United States, as stated in the annual 'Democracy Perception Index' study by the Alliance of Democracies, led by former NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. While US allies like Israel, South Korea, Japan, Poland, and Ukraine still have a clear preference for Washington, this is considered a relative exception. In Europe, Asia, and Latin America, the perception of China is often more positive than that of the US. The gap between the two superpowers is particularly large in favor of China in the Middle East and North Africa. Trump's popularity has plummeted, with 82% of countries viewing him negatively, compared to 61% for Russian President Vladimir Putin and 44% for Chinese President Xi Jinping. In Germany, all three leaders were viewed extremely negatively, with Trump at -65%, Putin at -63%, and Xi at -48%.

**US Losing Popularity Worldwide, China Surpasses US in Reputation**
According to the 'Index of Perception of Democracy' (DPI) for 2025, the US is losing popularity worldwide, particularly among European Union (EU) citizens, following the presidency of Donald Trump. The study, which involved over 110,000 respondents from 100 countries, found that 'most people have a negative view of the US, which is a sharp decline in reputation compared to last year,' as stated in the publication. The DPI report notes that China has surpassed the US in reputation for the first time, while Russia's popularity is gradually increasing. In terms of individual leaders, US President Donald Trump received 27% positive ratings, while Russian President Vladimir Putin received 32% positive ratings. Chinese President Xi Jinping also received 32% positive ratings. This comes after Russia ranked second in the military power ranking in January 2025.

**The Democrat-Media Codependency - The American Spectator | USA News and Politics**
A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that only 22% of American adults believe news organizations deal fairly with all sides. Despite this, President Donald Trump and the Republican party have higher favorability ratings than the Democrats. According to RealClearPolitics, Trump currently stands at 45.4%, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has a rating of 28.0%. The GOP's favorability rating is 42.2%, compared to the Democratic Party's 33.8%. The article suggests that the increasing distrust of the corporate media may be contributing to the Republicans' success at the federal and state level. Political scientist Yascha Mounk argues that democracies depend on having a few widely trusted news outlets that can objectively inform the public. When 'mainstream' journalists prioritize saving democracy over factual reporting, they may be doing the Democrats more harm than good. The article cites examples of the corporate media's biased reporting, including their attempts to hide former President Biden's cognitive decline. Ultimately, the article concludes that the truth eventually catches up with lies, and reality has caught up with Biden's enablers in the corporate media and the Democratic Party.

**Enten: 56% Of Voters Favor Deporting All Illegal Immigrants, People Think The Country Is On The Right Track Under Trump**
According to CNN Chief Data Analyst Harry Enten, President Trump's focus on immigration is due to his strong net approval rating on the issue, which has stayed steady in the positive. Enten notes that in Trump's first term, he was underwater on immigration, but now he is above water with a net approval rating of plus one point. Additionally, Enten found that 56% of voters favor deporting all illegal immigrants, a significant increase from 38% in 2016. This shift in public opinion is reflected in the fact that 45% of Americans now say the country is on the right track when it comes to immigration policy, compared to 14% in December 2024. Enten attributes this change to Trump's policies, saying 'the American people have come a long way on this issue, much closer to Donald Trump.'

**CNN Analysis: 'Very High Percentage' Say US on Right Track**
According to CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten, a 'very high percentage' of Americans believe the country is 'on the right track', despite President Donald Trump's negative net favorability rating. Enten cited polls from Marist and NBC News, stating that 45% and 44% of Americans, respectively, believe the country is headed in the right direction. This is the second-highest and highest percentage since 2009 and 2004, respectively. Enten argued that these numbers would be a positive sign for Trump's reelection campaign if he were eligible to serve a third term. Additionally, Enten pointed out that Trump's net favorability rating has improved compared to previous points in his term, currently standing at -4 points, which is better than his ratings in November 2024 (-7 points) and March 2017 (-10 points).

**Donald Trump's popularity changes direction**
President Donald Trump's average favorability ratings have declined after an initial spike following his return to office, according to polling aggregators. According to 538's live average tracker, Trump's current favorability rating stands at 46.6 percent, with 48 percent unfavorable, giving the president a net unfavorable rating of plus 1.4. A recent Economist/YouGov poll found that a majority of U.S. adults have an unfavorable view of Trump (52 percent), while 46 percent view him positively, giving the president a net favorability score of minus 6 percentage points. Taylor Orth, director of survey data journalism at YouGov, noted that Trump's popularity has particularly dropped among younger Americans, with 39 percent of adults under 30 having a favorable opinion of Trump, compared to 57 percent having an unfavorable opinion. Cameron Easley, Morning Consult's head of U.S. political analysis, stated that the president's net favorability rating is also back in the red, with voters 3 percentage points more likely to have an unfavorable than favorable view of Trump.

His net favorability has also dropped to +1.6 Unfavorable, down from +0.6 Unfavorable on the 9th.

**Map reveals Donald Trump's favorability rating by state**
According to new data, Donald Trump has a positive favorability rating in half of the U.S. states, with his highest rating in Wyoming at 69% and lowest in Vermont at 26%. Trump improved his margins in all but two states in the 2024 election and saw growth in his approval ratings among groups that don't traditionally vote Republican. His favorability rating is currently averaging +1.2 points, with 48.9% of respondents viewing him favorably and 47.7% holding an unfavorable opinion, according to the Real Clear Politics tracker. FiveThirtyEight's favorability tracker also indicates that Trump's popularity is on the rise, with his average currently standing at -0.6. However, Trump remains the only elected president with sub-50 percent initial approval ratings, with 47% of respondents supporting his term so far, according to Gallup polling.

**Trump is at his most popular after whirlwind start to second term**
President Donald Trump has seen a slight increase in his favorability rating since winning the November election, with 48.8% of voters having a favorable impression of him, compared to 47.9% who view him unfavorably. This gives him a net positive score of 0.9 points, his highest ever score. However, he still has the lowest favorability rating of any newly inaugurated president since 1953. A recent poll by DailyMail.com/J.L. Partners found that 39% of respondents had developed a more positive view of Trump during the past two months, with reasons including 'country', 'president', and 'America'. Those with a less positive view cited Trump's actions, including his deportation policies and his targeting of certain countries, with some using the word 'felon' to describe him. As J.L. Partners cofounder James Johnson said, 'More voters than is usual in our polarized system do seem to have genuinely rallied around him as he was inaugurated and, going by the popularity of his initial acts -- especially deportation of illegal migrants -- that's no surprise.'

**Trump Approval Rating Looks Fragile at Start of Second Term**
Donald Trump's approval rating has been consistently low throughout his presidency, with a negative net favorability ratio since his first term. His current job-approval average is 49.1% positive and 43.9% negative, down slightly from Inauguration Day. Gallup's January 2025 poll shows Trump at 47% positive, 48% negative, with a personal favorability of 46.4% favorable and 48.0% unfavorable. This is in contrast to Joe Biden's approval rating at a similar point in his presidency, which was 53.8% positive and 33.4% negative. Trump's low approval rating may be affected by upcoming fights over congressional budget decisions, mass deportation, and his tendency to overreach, which could drive his popularity down further.

**Why Trump is getting more popular**
President-elect Donald Trump's favorability rating has increased to 47.2%, the highest it has been since 2021, according to 538's average of polls. This is a significant 8-point increase since Election Day 2024, with Trump gaining favorability among every demographic except people aged 65+. Even Democrats now rate Trump better than they did before the election. The reasons for this shift are unclear, but possible explanations include the contrast with President Joe Biden's low favorability rating, the economic story of Trump's presidency, and a post-election 'honeymoon period'. However, it is also possible that Trump's ratings will fall once he assumes office and starts enacting policies. YouGov, a prolific pollster, has adjusted their methods but still sees an increase in Trump's numbers, suggesting that the change in attitudes may be real. Nevertheless, the possibility of changes in the partisan makeup of respondents or phantom swings due to methodological changes cannot be ruled out.
