**Egypt Calls for Israel's Accession to Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty**
Egypt's Foreign Minister, Dr. Badr Abdel Ati, called for Israel's accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear state, noting that 'the current treaty imbalance regarding the commitments of countries in the context of non-proliferation in the Middle East exacerbates the instability in the region.' Abdel Ati made this statement during a meeting with the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, on June 2, 2025. Abdel Ati emphasized that 'Israel remains the only state in the region that has not joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty and refuses to submit its nuclear facilities to the Agency's guarantees.' He expressed his hope that the Director General would make efforts to implement the annual resolution adopted by the General Conference of the Agency regarding the application of guarantees in the Middle East. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry's official spokesperson, Tameem Khalaf, stated that the Minister appreciated the Agency's vital role in supporting regional security and stability through promoting the principles of nuclear non-proliferation and expanding the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes serving sustainable development goals. He also praised the Director General's achievements since taking office in late 2019, particularly his active participation in climate change conferences, including the 2022 Sharm el-Sheikh Summit, which significantly contributed to the international recognition of the positive role that nuclear energy can play in combating climate change and adapting to its consequences. The spokesperson highlighted Egypt's efforts to utilize peaceful nuclear applications to serve national development goals, particularly through the project to establish a nuclear power plant in Dabaa, which is a significant step in this direction. He emphasized the importance of strengthening cooperation with the Agency and benefiting from its technical expertise to ensure the implementation of the highest international standards in nuclear safety and security. This project, he added, will open up wider horizons for Egypt in its comprehensive development journey.

**Britain's 'War Readiness': £15 Billion Investment in Nuclear Programs**
In light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, British Prime Minister Starmer stated that 'the things have changed' and that the 'frontline' is 'here'. To address this, the government plans to invest £15 billion (approximately €18 billion) in programs for producing nuclear warheads, creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country. The British military is expected to be ten times more powerful by 2035, with Starmer emphasizing that being 'prepared to secure peace through strength' is the most effective way to deter countries that directly threaten the UK.

**Britain is getting a defense boost aimed at sending a message to Moscow, and to Trump**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 'a battle-ready, armor-clad nation,' according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is aimed at sending a message to Moscow and Washington, with a focus on countering Russia's growing threats. The government will accept all 62 recommendations from a strategic defense review, including increasing production of submarines and weapons, establishing a cyber command, and investing 15 billion pounds in Britain's nuclear arsenal. Starmer said the measures will create a 'defense dividend' of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs. Defense Secretary John Healey stated that the changes will send 'a message to Moscow,' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. The government aims to reach a defense spending target of 2.5% of national income by 2027, with an 'ambition' to reach 3% before 2034.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**British fighter jets to carry nuclear weapons in face of threat of Russia**
The UK government is in talks with US officials to introduce jets armed with nuclear weapons for the first time, as part of the latest defensive expansion against Russia. This move would be the UK's biggest deterrent development since the Cold War. The Defence Secretary, Radakin, views this as the UK's number one defence priority, citing rising nuclear risks across the globe. He said, 'The world is definitely becoming more dangerous. Nuclear risks are rising. For the first time since the Cold War, we face seriously increasing risks of state-on-state conflict.' The government also plans to increase defence spending to three per cent GDP by 2034 and move to wartime levels of arms production by building six new munitions factories. Labour leader, Sir Keir, has also called for a transformation in how the UK defends itself, saying, 'We will meet this moment head on -- by mounting the kind of response not seen before in most of our lifetimes.'

**Top Gun! British fighter jets will soon carry nuclear weapons for the first time ever as part of biggest defence expansion since the Cold War | Daily Mail Online**
The UK government, led by Defence Secretary John Healey, is planning to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034, the largest sustained increase since the Cold War. This move includes purchasing US fighter jets capable of launching gravity bombs with lower power than conventional nuclear weapons. The goal is to increase the resilience of Britain in an 'ever more dangerous world.' The funding will be found by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI. Sir Keir Starmer said, 'In an ever more dangerous world, increasing the resilience of our country so we can protect the British people, resist future shocks and bolster British interests, is vital.' A Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated, 'This Government has announced the largest sustained increase to defence spending since the end of the Cold War.' The UK is also set to meet with NATO heads of government in The Hague next month to discuss defence spending targets, with NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte suggesting a high defence spend target of 5%.

**Agenda for Nuclear Non-Proliferation Review Conference Still Unclear**
The Preparatory Committee for the 2026 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has concluded without reaching a consensus on the agenda. Despite the urgency of the nuclear issue, countries failed to agree on transparency and accountability measures. Florian Eblenkamp, an advocacy officer for the International Coalition Against Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), emphasized that the non-proliferation norm must not be allowed to collapse under geopolitical cynicism. Ambassador Harold Agyeman, the committee's chair, stated that the success of the review conference in 2026 depends on the political will of state parties to demonstrate progress on their obligations and strengthen accountability. Reaching Critical Will nominated Ambassador Dang Hoang Giang, Permanent Representative of Vietnam to the United Nations, expressed confidence that collective wisdom and shared determination can lead to meaningful progress. However, the presence and threat of nuclear weapons loom large, and the international community must remain vigilant in advocating for the NPT and other disarmament treaties.

**France Can't Deploy New Air-Launched Nuclear-Tipped Missiles Before 2035**
French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed that France take over the role of 'nuclear protector' of the EU, citing Russian aggression as a threat. However, the reality of France's capabilities shows that it can barely defend itself. Macron announced that France will increase and accelerate orders for 'Rafale' jets, which will be equipped with a hypersonic nuclear missile called the ASN4G. However, the deployment of the new 'Rafale' squadrons and the ASN4G missile is not expected until 2035, a decade away. Macron claimed that the development of the ASN4G is 'not linked to the international context', but many media outlets have portrayed this as a 'signal that France could deploy strategic weapons in defense of the EU/NATO'. The deployment of the ASN4G missile along Russian borders could cause a dangerous escalation. France's nuclear arsenal is significantly smaller than Russia's, and the country's military sources report that the new missile can fly between Mach 6 and 7, far behind Russian hypersonic weapons.

**Macron Announces Nuclear-Armed Rafale Fighter Jets for French Airbase**
French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Tuesday, March 18, that from 2035, the airbase in Luxeuil-les-Bains, located near the German border, will host Rafale fighter jets with nuclear warheads. Macron stated, 'In 2035, Luxeuil will become the first base to host the new Rafale modification with nuclear supersonic warheads.' However, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed opposition to the idea of European countries having nuclear weapons, citing a decrease in US interest. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, on the other hand, emphasized the need for Poland to access nuclear and modern non-conventional weapons, including through the French nuclear umbrella initiative. Tusk stated, 'Poland will use all available opportunities to strengthen its defense capabilities, despite potential criticism.'

**China Accelerates Nuclear Development: Arsenal Approaching 1,000 Warheads**
According to a recent report by the Federation of American Scientists, China currently possesses around 600 nuclear warheads, with many more in production. The study highlights that China is developing its nuclear arsenal at the fastest rate among the nine nuclear-armed states, despite having signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The report, published by the Nuclear Information Project, reveals that since May 2024, China has continued to develop three new missile silo fields for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with solid fuel, as well as proceeding with the construction of new silos for its ICBMs DF-5 with liquid fuel. China is also advancing the development of new ICBM variants and advanced strategic launch systems. The report suggests that Beijing has produced excess warheads for these systems, ready to be used once the launchers are operational. The study also notes the Pentagon's projections, which indicate that China's arsenal will surpass 1,000 warheads by 2030. The 2024 report presented to the US Congress by the Department of Defense revealed that China could have around 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. However, the Nuclear Notebook notes that the growth of the arsenal will depend on China's stockpiles of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and tritium. In 2023, the International Panel on Fissile Materials estimated that China possessed approximately 14 tons of HEU and around 2.9 tons of separated plutonium available for nuclear weapons.
