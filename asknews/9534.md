**Xi Jinping could save America with a simple ad | Notice**
Matt Robison suggests that Xi Jinping could save America by announcing that China will be the first nation to win a human on Mars within the next ten years. This would spark a new space race and motivate the US to invest in space exploration, potentially leading to a boost in the US economy and a renewed sense of national pride. Robison argues that this kind of competition is exactly what America needs, and that China needs it too. He notes that two-thirds of Americans, including 80% of Republicans, already support the idea of maintaining a technological edge over China in artificial intelligence. Robison concludes that a simple announcement from Xi Jinping could be the kick that America needs to get back on track.

**Children Born in Last Three Months of the Year Show Higher Cognitive Performance**
Research suggests that children born in the last three months of the year (October, November, and December) tend to perform better in cognitive tests during childhood. A 2006 study by the University of Harvard analyzed over 21,000 children from birth to age seven and found that those born in these months scored higher on intelligence tests compared to their peers. While the exact cause is unknown, scientists point to pre-natal seasonal factors such as vitamin D exposure, maternal nutrition, and stress levels during pregnancy as potential contributors. October stands out in the studies for its consistent results, with many births coinciding with less exposure to extreme temperatures or seasonal illnesses, reducing potential risks during pregnancy. November adds a curious dimension, with research showing that people born in this month perform better physically, surpassing their peers by up to 15% in sports tests. December, often associated with holidays, also offers surprises, with data from the UK's National Office for Statistics showing that people born in this month are more likely to pursue a career in medicine, particularly dentistry. However, neuroscientist Russell Foster cautions that these findings are not about astrology, but rather seasonal influences that may have some impact on development. He emphasizes that factors like pregnancy duration, nutrition, education, and family environment are much more significant in determining intelligence development.

**New AI Tool Predicts Postpartum Depression Risk**
Researchers in the United States have developed a new tool based on artificial intelligence (AI) that can predict, in advance, which people are more likely to develop postpartum depression. The discovery, published this week in the American Journal of Psychiatry and reported by Nature, could revolutionize mental health care in the postnatal period. Postpartum depression is a mental health condition that affects around 17% of people who give birth worldwide. Unlike the 'baby blues', a mild and temporary sadness common in the first days after birth, postpartum depression is more intense and lasting. Symptoms include deep sadness, anxiety, loss of interest in daily activities, and difficulty connecting with the baby. The condition can occur up to a year after birth and affects not only the mother but also the baby's development and family well-being. The research team used data from over 29,000 mothers who gave birth in the United States between 2017 and 2022. The machine learning model was trained with electronic medical records and mental health screening results from that period. The goal is to help hospitals identify, in a preventive manner, which parents and mothers can benefit from emotional support and psychological follow-up shortly after the baby's birth. The system excluded from analysis people who already had a recent history of depression, a group already recognized as high-risk. Thus, the AI showed effectiveness: among those classified as high-risk, 30% developed the condition - a rate three times higher than the overall average of the sample. According to the scientists, the value of the tool lies in its ability to anticipate critical situations and offer support before symptoms worsen. 'If we know that someone is at higher risk, we can try to develop strategies to help prevent depression,' explains psychiatrist Roy Perlis, from Mass General Brigham Hospital in Boston, co-author of the study. Among the suggested actions are specific therapies and stress management techniques.

**No more US varsities through Mara**
Majlis Amanah Rakyat (Mara) will stop sending its students to the United States for further studies starting this year due to uncertainties over US administration policies. Mara chairman Datuk Dr Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki said, 'We do not want to place any risk on our students by sending them there.' Instead, the 131 students who were supposed to go to the US in October will be sent to top universities in other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and China. Mara is also considering sending them to local universities. Asyraf Wajdi said, 'The most important thing is that we don't want to demotivate them.' Mara is also working closely with Cambridge University for the benefit of its students and educators, including a research collaboration and co-funding in areas such as quantum technology and artificial intelligence. Additionally, three universities in the UK have agreed to offer discounts of between 10-20% in tuition fees for Mara-sponsored students.

**Adriana Smith's Case Sparks Debate on Anti-Abortion Policies and Maternal Health in the US**
Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old pregnant woman, was declared brain dead after suffering a stroke, but her body was kept on life support to allow the fetus to develop. The case has sparked a debate about the ethics and legality of anti-abortion policies in the US, particularly in states with Republican governors. Smith's family, including her 5-year-old son, continues to visit her in the hospital, but they are not allowed to disconnect her life support machines because of a state law that prohibits abortion after the detection of fetal activity. The law was passed in 2019, but only took effect in 2022 after the Roe v. Wade case was overturned. Experts, including Kimberly Mutcherson, a reproductive rights specialist, have expressed concerns about the impact of such policies on women's health and the potential harm to the fetus. 'It's a kind of experiment: allowing a fetus to develop in a woman's body with brain death. Knowing the enormous effort a pregnant woman's body needs to sustain and nourish a pregnancy, it's impossible to know for sure the damage a fetus may suffer while remaining attached to a body without a functioning brain,' Mutcherson said. The case highlights the need for better healthcare and reproductive rights in the US, particularly for women from low-income backgrounds. According to the CDC, 80% of maternal deaths in the US are preventable. The country has one of the highest maternal mortality rates among developed countries, with 18.6 deaths per 100,000 births in 2023. The rate has decreased from 22.3 deaths per 100,000 births in 2022, but the number of deaths among black women has increased, reaching 50.3 per 100,000 births in 2023. 'In Tennessee, for example, we have one of the strictest abortion bans, with no exceptions for rape, incest, or young girls. It's also one of the states with the highest infant mortality rate (6.6 per 100,000) and maternal mortality rate (41.1, the highest in the country). At the same time, Republicans have complete control,' said Senator London Lamar. 'So, instead of fighting a lost battle, I changed my strategy to raise the banner of maternal health.'

**Primorye Hospital Directors Among Suspects in Newborn Sale Case**
According to RT, three hospital directors in Primorsky Krai are among the suspects in a case involving the sale of newborns. 'Among the medical workers suspected of selling babies in Primorye, three hospital directors of private clinics are', RT reported. Eight medical workers are currently involved in the case. Investigators believe that the suspects forged documents about their clients' infertility and genetic parents between 2018 and 2020, and then used assisted reproductive technologies to cultivate embryos, claiming they were treating infertility. The suspects sold 13 babies abroad, earning over 53 million rubles. The case will be heard by the Frunzensky District Court in Vladivostok, where the suspects face up to 15 years in prison.

**Experts call for escalation of AI tool to improve health outcomes - THE AUTHORITY NEWS**
Experts in the health sector have called for the escalation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool in other health programs like malaria and Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (RMNCH) to strengthen health initiatives and improve health outcomes. They commended the Institute of Human Virology Nigeria for its ground-breaking impact of the use of AI in the fight against Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV in Nigeria. Dr. Adebobola Bashorun suggested a more centralised government approach to facilitate rapid scale-up and scale-out of the AI solution. Dr. Emmanuel Vincent explained that the AI platform was adopted across 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, reaching over 5,300 healthcare facilities. The platform has driven unprecedented improvements in efficiency, accountability, and coordination of the national TB/HIV response, with 65% reduction in performance standards, 100% compliance, and 11,307 supervision and mentorship engagements tracked. Dr. Jerome Mafeni added that 'This is about building a culture of performance.'

**Rwanda: How New Centre Is Set to Make Rwanda Regional Leader in Cattle Genetics**
A $20 million centre in Rwanda's Huye District is set to become a regional and continental leader in genetic improvement for cattle production. The Rwanda Dairy Development Project - Phase 2 (RDDP 2) is funded at $128 million and is described as the largest dairy single project Rwanda has ever had. According to Dagmawi Habte-Selassie, IFAD Country Director, the centre will have state-of-the-art technology, including sex semen technology, which will allow farmers to choose the sex of their calves. Habte-Selassie said, 'So, we're building Songa, the National Artificial Insemination Center, which is going to be state-of-the-art in the whole region. In the next year or so, Rwanda will be a leader in genetics for dairy and other animals.' The centre will also have the best productive bulls from which semen will be collected for treatment and delivery to dairy farmers. Solange Uwituze, Deputy Director General in charge of Animal Resources Development at RAB, said that the centre will have four major technologies: artificial insemination, sexing technology, multiple ovulation transfer, and embryo transfer. She added that the centre will not only be a leader in artificial insemination, but in the entire cattle genetic improvement. The centre is expected to reduce Rwanda's import bill by producing sexed cattle semen and embryos domestically, currently relying on imports from countries including The Netherlands and France. Uwituze said that the cost of sexed semen technology will be much cheaper because the logistics around importation will be abolished.

**Bioethics: The Italian Law on Medically Assisted Procreation Under Attack**
The Italian law on medically assisted procreation (PMA) has been subject to intense opposition since its introduction. The law aimed to protect the fundamental values of human life and the family, but the judiciary has been gradually dismantling it. The Corte Costituzionale has issued 12 rulings since 2006, some of which have introduced significant changes. The 2009 ruling (n. 151) allowed for the production of surplus embryos and their freezing, while the 2015 ruling (n. 96) permitted access to assisted reproduction for couples with genetic diseases. The 2015 ruling (n. 229) lifted the ban on eugenic embryo selection, and the 2014 ruling (n. 162) recognized the 'right to a child' as 'incoercible'. The 2025 ruling (n. 68) granted parental status to the 'intentional mother' who consented to the in vitro conception of a child carried and born by her partner. The article argues that the cultural push to prioritize individual will over traditional family values is concerning, and that the complementarity of masculinity and femininity is essential for child growth and care.

**IQ in a Test Tube: Elite University Eggs Become a New Fad in the US**
In the US, there is a growing demand for eggs from students and graduates of elite universities, such as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. 'Intellectual' oocytes (female cells that form an embryo after fertilization) have become a new fad among future parents. While previously Americans focused on the health and genetics of donors, now they are looking for high academic achievement and a red diploma. The price for these 'premium' eggs can reach up to $100,000 (over 8 million rubles) per egg, which is more than the cost of a year at Harvard. As Harvard is not just a university, but a temple of the American dream, where presidents, Supreme Court justices, and billionaires are born, it's no surprise that the demand for 'smart' children is on the rise. However, the problem is that America is not reproducing as quickly as it used to. Young people are busy with their careers and mortgages. According to the CDC, the average number of births per American woman has decreased from 2.1 in 1990 to 1.62 in 2023. The number of births among teenagers has also decreased significantly, from 61.8 per 1000 girls aged 15-19 in 1991 to 12.7 in 2024. This is a good thing, as fewer children mean more chances to complete education. However, the number of women aged 20-29 with children is also decreasing. After the 2008 economic crisis, young people realized that first comes the safety net, then diapers. As of 2024, there are 91.4 births per 1000 women aged 25-29, compared to 117.5 in 2007. American women want to plan their lives, and it's not surprising. Today, almost 70% of mothers with children under 18 work, and they are not enthusiastic about the idea of 'sacrificing themselves for the ideal of motherhood.' So, yes, the demand for eggs from elite universities is not just about smart children. It's also a symptom of an era where personal success is more important than biological duty.

**AI in Assisted Reproduction: A 7% Reduction in Conception Time**
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in assisted reproduction has revolutionized the selection of eggs, sperm, and embryos, allowing for a 7% reduction in the time needed to conceive a child, according to a study led by researchers at IVI Valencia. The study, presented at the 11th International Congress IVIRMA, found that applying AI to embryo selection also increases the pregnancy rate by 5% and up to 7% in multiple attempts. 'AI is a reality in assisted reproduction and is giving great results in research and clinical practice,' said Juan Antonio García Velasco, scientific director of the congress and IVIRMA. 'We are talking about distinguishing the spermatozoid with the highest capacity to fertilize the ovocyte and give rise to an embryo, as well as identifying the best quality eggs, which undoubtedly contribute positively to achieving better success rates, reducing time and increasing pregnancy rates.' The AI also shows promising uses in personalizing fertility treatments, providing women with information on the expected number of eggs and the best day to visit the clinic, reducing unnecessary visits. However, beyond AI, the IVIRMA Congress has also presented advances in genetics, stem cell biology, and tissue engineering. Dr. Antonio Capalbo, responsible for genomics at IVIRMA Global Research Alliance, presented a study suggesting that sequencing the complete genome of embryos before implantation could identify not only major chromosomal abnormalities but also subtle variations that may compromise their development and future severe diseases in offspring. 'With current genetic tests (such as trophoblast biopsies), approximately half of the embryos considered normal do not implant in the endometrium, and another 10% end in spontaneous abortion,' Capalbo explained. However, the specialist admitted that more studies are needed to evaluate the impact and how to manage the new genomic information obtained before applying complete genome sequencing of embryos in clinics.

**First Baby Born Using Fully Automated ICSI Procedure**
A biotechnology company, Conceivable Life Sciences, has developed a robotic system that can perform all 23 stages of the intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedure in an automated manner. This approach reduces the risk of human error in such procedures. The system uses artificial intelligence to select the healthiest sperm for fertilization based on their appearance, and then injects them into the egg in a laboratory setting. The company tested the system with a childless couple from Mexico, where the man had low sperm motility and the woman had problems producing eggs, and they used donor eggs. The system successfully fertilized four embryos, and one of them led to a healthy baby boy born at 38 weeks. The procedure took around 10 minutes, with the operator controlling it remotely from 3700 km away. The authors of the study note that this approach does not necessarily produce healthier embryos than traditional ICSI, and more research is needed to confirm the results.

**World's First Baby Born Using AI-Assisted IVF Technology**
The first baby in the world has been born using AI-assisted IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) technology. According to reports, the AI system has replaced the traditional manual process of Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) in IVF, where a sperm is directly injected into an egg. The new process uses AI or remote digital control to complete all 23 steps of the ICSI procedure without human intervention. In a fertility clinic in the US, AI technology was used to select the best embryo, and the AI-selected embryo was then implanted into a woman's uterus, resulting in a successful pregnancy and the birth of a healthy baby. AI has helped in selecting the right embryo, which is a challenging task for doctors. The AI algorithm analyzed microscopic images to select the best embryo, which is a difficult task for any doctor to do by eye. The AI technology has also improved the success rate of IVF by scoring the embryo's growth, cell division speed, and other biological signals. This has made the process easier and more efficient. Experts say that IVF is often a costly and exhausting process, but AI can help make it faster and more accurate, saving time and money.

**First Child Born Using Fully Automated IVF System**
A fully automated system for in vitro fertilization (IVF) has successfully led to the birth of a child, according to NewScientist. The system, developed by Conceivable Life Sciences, uses artificial intelligence to select healthy sperm and implant them into donor eggs. In an experiment, the system was used to fertilize five out of eight donor eggs, resulting in four embryos. Two of the embryos, selected by the AI, were implanted and one led to a successful pregnancy and birth. However, as noted by Jacques Cohen, founder of the company, further research with a larger number of participants is needed to confirm the effectiveness of the method. This breakthrough has raised hopes for reducing the risk of human errors in IVF procedures.

**Weâre All Eugenicists Now**
The author argues that eugenics is no longer a taboo topic, citing the New York Times' article 'Should Human Life be Optimized?' which discussed the use of embryo selection to ensure children get the best genetic start in life. A survey from Harvard Medical School found that 24% of people approve and 13% strongly approve of screening embryos for positive traits such as intelligence. The author also mentions in-vitro gametogenesis, a technology that could increase the chances of having a genius baby or an Olympic gold medalist. The author believes that eugenics improves people, just as selective breeding improves plants and animals, and that it's time for the country to return to common sense. They argue that the fear of eugenics has been driven by the fear of acknowledging genetic differences between races, and that it's time to step out of the 'deliberate ignorance' of the past.

**The Rise of Pronatalists in the US: Selecting Children Based on Genetic Traits**
The Collins family claims to have used a special technology during their in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure to screen their embryos for traits such as intelligence. They stated, 'Research allows us to know our genetic predisposition to IQ, -- they said in 2023 to an undercover reporter. -- We would never choose a child who is less gifted in terms of IQ than we are'. The Collins family is part of the growing movement of 'pronatalists' in the US, who are seeking support from former President Trump. According to the Collins, they used this technology to select embryos with higher IQs, showing a growing trend of selecting children based on genetic traits.

Dr. Seval Taşdemir, a specialist in obstetrics and IVF, discussed the latest developments in IVF treatment, including the use of artificial intelligence in embryo selection, the importance of genetic testing, and the importance of timely medical checks for couples trying to conceive. According to Dr. Taşdemir, artificial intelligence has greatly benefited IVF treatment, allowing for easier selection of embryos with high fertility and healthy genetic makeup. 'We can now more easily select embryos with high fertility and a strong genetic makeup,' she said. Dr. Taşdemir emphasized the importance of genetic testing in ensuring a healthy pregnancy process, stating that 'we now have the ability to analyze the genetic makeup of the embryo and determine whether it is healthy or not.' She also stressed the importance of timely medical checks for couples trying to conceive, saying that 'women tend to become mothers at an older age, but their egg reserves decrease, so we aim to develop 10-15 eggs using the 'pooling' method.'

**Trump's IVF Decree: A New Form of Eugenics?**
US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at improving access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) for Americans. However, the normalization of selecting embryos for IVF based on their genetic heritage could lead to a new form of eugenics. The US has a history of eugenics, including forced sterilization of people deemed 'inferior' and the promotion of 'better babies' and 'fitter families.' The use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in IVF has also raised concerns about the potential for designer babies. A survey found that 28% of Americans would consider having a genetically modified child to increase their child's chances of getting into top universities, and 38% would consider selecting embryos based on their IQ. The IVF industry in the US is a lucrative business, with a market value of $5.28 billion in 2023 and expected to reach $7.24 billion by 2030. However, the facilitation of access to IVF could lead to an increase in the demand for gametes and gestational carriers, exacerbating the risks of commodification and exploitation.

**The Rise of Embryo Screening for the 'Best' Babies**
Companies like Heliospect Genomics are using pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) to screen embryos for IQ, allowing parents to choose the 'best' baby. While PGT is primarily used for disease prevention, some companies are pushing the boundaries of what risks PGT can assess in embryos, potentially leading to 'superbabies'. However, experts like Arthur Caplan are concerned about the line between testing for disease and testing for enhancement getting fuzzy. Regulation is necessary to prevent mass consumer-driven eugenics, as seen in sex selection, where parents are already selecting embryos based on sex, potentially leading to an imbalanced sex ratio across a specific generation. The technology already exists, and if it becomes good enough, parents will use it to improve their child's IQ, but policy-makers need to keep up with the research to prevent unintended consequences.
