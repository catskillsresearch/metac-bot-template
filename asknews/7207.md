**Bitcoin price prediction for June: Will BTC rise or fall in June? | Invezz**
Bitcoin's price rose to a record high of $111,900 in May, with spot Bitcoin ETFs adding over $5.2 billion in inflows and the total value traded reaching over $73 billion. The surge in inflows brought the cumulative inflows to over $45 billion, making Bitcoin the most successful ETF launches ever. Companies such as Strategy, Twenty One, and Trump Media have also been purchasing Bitcoins, with Strategy acquiring over 580,235 coins. The supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has continued falling, moving from over 3.1 million in 2020 to 1.2 million today. Technical analysis suggests that the BTC price has more upside to go this month, with a target price of around $143,000. However, the risk of a drop in price is also present, particularly due to the start of the summer season and potential trade wars.

**Can Bitcoin Price Slip Below $100K After Meta Treasury Rejection - The Market Periodical**
Meta shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to allocate part of the company's $72 billion cash reserves to Bitcoin, with over 4.98 billion votes against and only 3.92 million in favor. This decision follows similar rejections at Microsoft and Amazon. U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs also reported a massive $616.1 million outflow on May 31, with Ark Invest's ARKB leading the losses at $120 million. Bitcoin price hovers at $103,874 with liquidation risk below $103,800 and resistance near $106,000. Analysts now view $100,000 as a psychological and technical level of interest, and traders are questioning whether the price could fall below this mark in early June. According to analysis by Bull Flash, Bitcoin is holding above a demand zone between $103,800 and $104,800, supported by an ascending trendline. However, if support is broken, the Bitcoin price might drop as low as $101,000.

**Why Is Crypto Going Down? Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP & Dogecoin Prices Are Falling Today**
The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant decline on May 30, 2025, with major digital assets experiencing substantial losses. Bitcoin price tumbled below the psychological $105,000 level, while Ethereum price, XRP price, and Dogecoin price all suffered substantial losses. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization plummeted by 2.6% to $3.34 trillion, marking one of the most significant single-day declines in recent weeks. Several interconnected factors explain the decline, including stalled US-China trade talks, massive liquidations, technical breakdown, and ETF outflows. Despite the current correction, crypto price predictions remain cautiously optimistic, with historical patterns suggesting that such corrections often precede significant rallies. Bitcoin price could find support around current levels, with analysts maintaining targets between $220,000 and $330,000 for the longer term. Ethereum price predictions remain bullish for the medium term, with expectations of a range between $2,700 and $2,900 in June 2025.

**Bitcoin Breaks Through $100,000 USD Mark, Reaching New All-Time High**
Bitcoin has broken through the $100,000 USD mark, reaching a new all-time high. The cryptocurrency has gained 39% since its low point under $75,000 USD and is now trading above the psychological threshold of $100,000 USD. The all-time high of $109,000 USD is within reach. Bitcoin's value has increased since its creation in 2009 as a reaction to the financial crisis, and it has developed into a scarce, censorship-resistant asset with global relevance. Like gold, Bitcoin is knapp, easily transportable, and independent of individual states. In combination with its digital component, Bitcoin meets the zeitgeist, which is characterized by macroeconomic uncertainty and dollar skepticism. Bitcoin enables decentralized, transparent management and transfer of wealth without intermediaries. Countries like China, which are increasing their gold reserves due to tensions with the US, may also be interested in the independence of this digital asset. Ethereum and other alternative cryptocurrencies (Altcoins) have also shown signs of recovery, with Ethereum experiencing a 21.9% increase in a single day, its largest daily gain since 2021. However, Ethereum still has a long way to go to reach its all-time high.

**Cryptocurrency Market Plunges: Bitcoin Falls Below $90,000**
The cryptocurrency market has experienced a dramatic drop, with Bitcoin falling below $90,000 in a single day. According to Coinmarketcap, over $1.3 billion in positions have been forced sold in the last 24 hours, affecting more than 364,000 investors. The leading cryptocurrency has fallen over $9,000 from its previous week's peak of $99,500. Ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies have also experienced significant drops, with Ethereum falling below $2,500. The total market value of cryptocurrencies has fallen to $3.1 billion, a loss of nearly $200 billion in a single day. This is the lowest level since mid-November, according to data from CoinGlass and CoinMarketCap. Several factors have contributed to the sharp price drop, including ETF outflows and a major hack on the Bybit exchange, where hackers stole $1.4 billion in cryptocurrency. Neobank Infini was also targeted, with thieves making off with $49.5 million in USDC. Fidelity led the ETF outflows, followed by Grayscale and Bitwise, creating increased uncertainty in the market. The largest single forced liquidation occurred on Binance, with a loss of $20 million. Over 90% of all forced liquidations were in long positions, where investors had bet on a price increase. Cryptocurrencies such as Solana, Chainlink, and Avalanche have experienced double-digit percentage drops. The market's fear and greed index has fallen to its lowest level since September, indicating 'extreme fear' with a value of 25. Analysts warn of further falls, with experts advising that Bitcoin must hold above $93,700 to avoid further drops. If support levels are broken, the price could potentially fall to $75,600. Makroinvestor Raoul Pal notes that such sharp corrections have occurred in previous cycles and are normal. February has historically been a strong month for Bitcoin, with positive returns in all years except 2014 and 2020. To avoid the third negative February month in history, Bitcoin must rise above $102,500 by the end of the month. However, it is expected that actions taken by Donald Trump will help cryptocurrency exchanges, as reported by PBS News. Financial Times previously looked at his actions in a larger context in February, while hedge fund company Elliot warned of a 'possible collapse' based on the actions.
