**Russia's Military Casualties: A Growing Concern**
Independent Russian media, including Mediazona, Meduza, and the Russian BBC, have been collecting and analyzing data on Russian military casualties since the start of the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. They use both official and unofficial sources, such as social media, blogs, obituaries, and observations of newly created graves. So far, they have identified 106,223 Russian soldiers killed in the war. However, experts estimate that the actual number of casualties may be significantly higher, with identified names accounting for only 45-65% of total losses, estimated to be between 164,200 and 237,200. The worst day for the Russian military in 2024 was February 20, when four Ukrainian HIMARS rockets hit a training ground near Volnovakha, occupied by Russian forces. 65 soldiers were killed, including their commander, and many others were injured. The Russian Ministry of Defense did not report this incident in any of its daily reports. According to data from the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), in 2024, Russia managed to capture 4,168 km² of Ukrainian territory. This means that on average, 27 Russian soldiers were killed for every kilometer squared captured. Most of the casualties were volunteers from rural areas, with 38% having no prior military experience. The report suggests that many of the recruits come from regions where stable employment is difficult to find. In the city of Ufa, a one-time payment for signing a military contract is equivalent to 34 times the average salary in the region, which is approximately 67,575 rubles (around 3,000 PLN). Soldiers also receive additional benefits, including tax breaks.

**Russia could run out of tanks by 2026: Report**
According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Russia could run out of tanks by the end of 2026 due to the high rate of tank losses in the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The IISS estimates that Russia lost around 1,400 main battle tanks (MBTs) in 2024, along with other high losses of infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) and armored personnel carriers (APCs). IISS Director-General and Chief Executive Bastian Giegerich stated, 'While its defense industry demonstrated resilience, its current rates of production and the refurbishment of stored vehicles will not offset battlefield losses indefinitely.' Giegerich added, 'The IISS assesses that Russia will not have sufficient main battle tanks to conduct effective offensive operations beyond early 2026 if it maintains the same operational tempo and suffers the same losses as in 2024.' Despite the high equipment losses, Russia is continuing to spend huge sums on its military, with expenditure growing by 42 percent in real terms in 2024 to an estimated $145.9 billion.
