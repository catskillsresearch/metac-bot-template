**Israel warns Hamas of annihilation as Trump says ceasefire 'very close'**
As ceasefire talks stall, Israel warns Hamas of annihilation if they do not accept a hostage deal, while the UN accuses Israel of using starvation as a weapon. The conflict in Gaza has resulted in over 70 deaths and 270 injuries in just 24 hours, with over 54,000 Palestinians killed since the war began. Meanwhile, India has developed a game-changing intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) called Agni-V, capable of hitting targets in Asia, Europe, and parts of Africa in minutes. The missile features a solid-fuel, three-stage system, ensuring rapid launch readiness and superior reliability, and has a range of up to 8,000 km. As tensions rise in global geopolitics, Agni-V positions India alongside major nuclear powers like the U.S., Russia, and China, cementing its strategic defense capabilities and global influence.

**The global crisis behind America's new nuclear bomb**
The US dropped 'Little Boy', a uranium bomb, on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, killing 245,000 people. The 'Fat Man' plutonium bomb in Nagasaki three days later ended World War II but opened the door to nuclear terrorism. Historian Hobsbawm noted that Hiroshima marked 'the beginning of nuclear blackmail.' The US government initially justified the bombings as a 'humanitarian action to end the war,' but the true motive was to avoid a costly war of attrition on the mainland and demonstrate nuclear deterrence to the Soviet Union.

**Russia-Ukraine Conflict Escalates Ahead of Peace Talks in Istanbul**
As direct peace talks between Ukraine and Russia are set to take place in Istanbul, the conflict has escalated. A strategic highway bridge in Russia's Bryansk region was blown up, killing 388 people, and Ukraine launched a long-range missile attack on Russian nuclear-capable bombers in Siberia. According to a Ukrainian intelligence official, the attack was carried out using drones loaded with explosives that were secretly transported to the airbase. Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed the attack, stating that 41 warplanes were targeted and fires broke out on some aircraft in the Murmansk and Irkutsk regions. In response, Russia launched its largest drone attack on Ukraine to date. These developments have heightened tensions between the two countries ahead of the peace talks in Istanbul. Ukrainian President Zelenskiy announced that his Defense Minister Umerov will attend the second round of peace talks in Istanbul. Meanwhile, former US President Trump called for peace between the two countries, warning that the US may withdraw its support if they fail to reach an agreement. In other news, global markets are experiencing volatility due to the shift from rule-based to discretionary policies under Trump. The uncertainty caused by court decisions has led to market fluctuations. Trump's actions have caused the dollar to lose value, while in the absence of his influence, the dollar has gained value. The PCE inflation rate, closely watched by the FED, came in below expectations at 2.1% annually, alleviating inflation concerns. Despite this, the market's guide, the 10-year government bond, fell to $4.40 after four weeks of consecutive gains, ending the week at a low.

**Korean Atomic Bomb Victims' Concert: A Call for Peace and Hope**
This year marks the 80th anniversary of Korea's liberation and the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, the history of the atomic bombing is not one-dimensional. The Soviet Union's involvement in the war had a greater impact on Japan's surrender, and the use of atomic bombs led to the division of Korea, a victim nation, rather than Japan, the aggressor. Korea is the second-largest victim of atomic bombing in the world, with 70,000 people affected and 31,000 killed. Among them, 100,000 Koreans were exposed to radiation, with 50,000 killed. Many survivors returned to their homeland, but many died sooner than Japanese survivors. Korean atomic bomb victims have experienced a 'triple hardship' of forced labor, radiation exposure, and neglect. The Korea Anti-Nuclear Peace Citizens' League and the Peace Tree Chorus are hosting a concert titled 'I am an atomic bomb victim: embracing peace, spreading hope!' on June 10th at the Korean Buddhist Cultural History Museum in Seoul. The concert will feature four parts, including songs about the pain of radiation exposure, nostalgia for their hometown, and a commitment to nuclear disarmament. The event is part of the 14th International Anti-Nuclear Peace Festival, which will be held on August 5th in Hapcheon. The festival aims to comfort atomic bomb victims and their descendants and to strive for a nuclear-free world. 'We hope that many victims will overcome despair and pass on hope,' said the organizers. 'We will work towards a world where all nuclear weapons, nuclear power plants, and nuclear materials are abolished.'

**India and Pakistan: A 7-Decade Conflict Escalates**
A recent attack by armed men, believed to be from the Pakistani militia known as the Front of Resistance (TRF), on tourists in the Pahalgam area of Indian-administered Kashmir resulted in the deaths of 26 people, all of Indian origin except for one Nepali. India blamed Pakistan for the attack and responded by suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, canceling visas for Pakistani citizens, and expelling diplomats. Pakistan retaliated with similar measures, including canceling visas for Indian citizens and expelling diplomats. The situation escalated with India launching a military operation, known as Operation Sindoor, which included missile strikes on Pakistani territory. The conflict between India and Pakistan, which has been ongoing for 7 decades, has raised concerns about a potential nuclear war. According to a study, over 100 million people could die immediately in the event of a nuclear war between the two countries, and a global famine could occur. The situation remains tense, with both countries accusing each other of aggression and maintaining a state of high alert.

**Russia, Ukraine step up the war on eve of peace talks**
On the eve of peace talks, Ukraine and Russia escalated the war with a major drone battle, a highway bridge blown up over a passenger train, and an attack on nuclear-capable bombers. Despite talk of peace, at least seven people were killed and 69 injured in the bridge explosion, and 40 Russian warplanes were struck in the attack on the military base in Siberia. Russia launched 472 drones at Ukraine overnight, the highest nightly total of the war so far. US President Donald Trump has demanded that Russia and Ukraine make peace and has threatened to walk away from the talks if they do not. According to a document seen by Reuters, Ukrainian negotiators will present a proposed roadmap for reaching a lasting peace settlement, which includes no restrictions on Ukraine's military strength, no international recognition of Russian sovereignty over parts of Ukraine, and reparations for Ukraine. 'The two sides will in Turkey present their respective documents outlining their ideas for peace terms,' said Trump envoy Keith Kellogg. 'It is clear that after three years of intense war, Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart.'

**Russia Confirms Explosions on Two Bridges, Resulting in Seven Deaths and 69 Injuries**
Russia confirms that explosions caused the collapse of two bridges, resulting in seven deaths and 69 injuries. The incident, related to the intense conflict with Ukraine, raises questions about possible sabotage and the impact on the imminent peace negotiations. Explosions on two bridges in the Bryansk and Kursk regions, bordering Ukraine, left a tragic toll of seven dead and 69 injured. The Russian Investigative Committee confirmed that both bridges were intentionally blown up. The first incident occurred at 22h50 local time, when a railway bridge in Bryansk collapsed while a train with 388 passengers was heading to Moscow. Many passengers were forced to leave the destroyed wagons in the dark. Images of the scene reveal the devastation caused by the explosion, with the locomotive crushed and the wagons in ruins. Alexander Bogomaz, governor of the region, confirmed that the Klimovo-Moscow train was passing when the structure collapsed. Four hours later, another explosion was recorded on a railway bridge in the Kursk region, which was also hit by parts of a moving cargo train. The Investigative Committee highlighted a clear connection between the two events, characterizing both as acts of sabotage. Vladimir Putin, Russian president, was quickly informed about the incidents by the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Ministry of Emergency Situations. The Kremlin revealed that Putin had conversations with Bogomaz about the matter, indicating the seriousness with which the Russian government is treating these attacks. The regions bordering Ukraine have been recurring targets of attacks during the conflict that has been ongoing since 2022. Russian investigators and authorities push the narrative that these attacks are perpetrated by Ukrainian forces. Despite the risks, both Russia and Ukraine dismiss the intention of causing civilian casualties. Russian lawmakers quickly blame Ukraine, categorizing the events as sabotage operations aimed at compromising peace negotiations that have been discussed. Andrei Kartapolov, chairman of the Defense Committee of the Lower House of the Russian Parliament, reaffirmed this position, attributing the attacks to Ukrainian special services and suggesting a strategy to intensify the crisis. With the escalation of violence and growing uncertainty, Russian and Ukrainian diplomats will meet in Istanbul, Turkey, on Monday (2) to discuss a possible end to this devastating conflict. Reports indicate that the war has resulted in casualties ranging from 1.2 million dead and injured, according to Washington data. Additionally, former US President Donald Trump made an appeal for both parties to seek peace, warning that the lack of progress in negotiations could lead to a significant change in military support to Ukraine, transferring that responsibility to European countries. Speculations about the motivations behind the explosions and their consequences on peace negotiations remain high, highlighting a critical moment in the region's geopolitics.

**15 Jahre nach tödlichem Bombenunglück: Gefahr besteht weiterhin**
Fifteen years after the deadly bomb explosion in Göttingen, the danger of unexploded bombs remains. An investigation is underway at six suspected sites, where possible unexploded bombs may be located. In 2010, three men from the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit were killed when an unexploded bomb exploded while they were trying to defuse it. According to Luftbilder from World War II, there are 80 possible unexploded bombs still buried in the ground. The next phase of the investigation will begin on June 10, with ground-penetrating radar and magnetometer surveys at six suspected sites, three of which are on private property. Wojtek Bolimowski, a 73-year-old retired violinist, is worried about the potential costs of the investigation, which could be up to €400,000. However, the city of Göttingen has decided to exempt people with a net worth of up to €500,000 from paying for the investigation and potential removal or detonation of the bomb. Christian Schmetz, the First Mayor of Göttingen, stated that the city believes the current regulation is in need of revision and that the federal and state governments should take on more responsibility for the costs. The city of Göttingen has already paid a seven-figure sum for the removal of unexploded bombs in recent years. In Niedersachsen, unexploded bombs with long-delay fuses are no longer defused, but detonated instead. The 'Göttingen Model' has been developed to safely detonate these bombs: a 'bunker' made of water-filled containers is built around the bomb, and a roof is placed on top. However, the work is still hazardous, according to Sprengmeister Thorsten Lüdeke. The investigation is expected to be completed by the end of July, and residents within a 50-meter radius of the suspected sites will be required to leave their homes during the day for safety reasons.

**CDS General Anil Chauhan on India-Pakistan Conflict: No Risk of Nuclear Weapons**
Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan said that India suffered air damage on the first day of the conflict with Pakistan this month, but quickly changed its strategy and gained a decisive advantage over Pakistan within three days. The conflict began on April 22 after a terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 people. On May 7, Indian fighter jets launched airstrikes on Pakistani terrorist camps, and on May 10, both countries announced a ceasefire. General Chauhan said that Pakistan claimed to have shot down Indian jet fighters, but India improved its strategy and launched a large number of airstrikes, targeting Pakistan's internal air bases. He said that the Indian Air Force launched precise attacks on May 10 with various types of aircraft and ammunition, with most attacks being accurate to within one meter. General Chauhan clarified that there was no risk of nuclear weapons being used during the conflict, saying, 'I believe that nuclear escalation takes a lot of time and signals. I don't think such a situation arose during this conflict.' He also said that there is enough scope for traditional military operations and that this will be the new strategy for future wars. General Chauhan added, 'In my opinion, the most rational and responsible decisions during war are made by uniformed military officers. Both sides showed a lot of restraint and wisdom during this operation.' Pakistan's Joint Chief of Staff General Sahir Shamshad Mirza also supported General Chauhan's statement, saying that there was no serious consideration of nuclear weapons during the conflict.

**Catastrophic Consequences: 'Nuclear Winter' to Hit Earth in Case of Russia-US War**
According to a study published in Environmental Research Letters, a nuclear war between Russia and the US would have catastrophic consequences. The researchers estimate that nuclear explosions and fires would release around 150 million tons of soot into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight and potentially lowering global temperatures by 15 degrees Celsius on average. This phenomenon is known as a 'nuclear winter', and it could last for over 10 years. Another threat is the destruction of the ozone layer, which would allow more UV radiation to reach the Earth's surface. Within 8-9 years after the conflict, UV-B radiation would reach its maximum, leading to the collapse of photosynthesis and the death of plants. In the first years after a nuclear conflict, precipitation and solar radiation would decrease by around 70%, the study found. Agriculture would be severely impacted, with corn yields potentially decreasing by 80% in the worst-case scenario. It would take 7-12 years to recover the agricultural sector. Furthermore, disruptions to global supply chains would exacerbate the food crisis and could lead to widespread famine, as noted by the researchers.

**The Real Apocalypse: WSJ Suggests What Will Happen to the World in the Event of a Nuclear War**
The world is on the brink of a climate apocalypse caused by nuclear war, not gradual greenhouse gas emissions. The possibility of such an event has become more apparent due to the conflict between India and Pakistan. According to Ted Nordhaus, an expert on ecology for The Wall Street Journal, a nuclear war would lead to an immediate nuclear winter. 'The worst consequences unfold long after the weapons explode. A massive thermonuclear exchange would envelop the atmosphere in soot, plunging the world into darkness and starting a winter that would last for decades,' Nordhaus said. While hundreds of millions of people would likely die in the initial fires, most of the world's population, including those in warring countries, would probably die from subsequent winter famine, Nordhaus wrote. 'It's reassuring to think that a nuclear exchange in a regional conflict, such as between India and Pakistan, might be more limited. The number of deaths from detonating a few dozen warheads could be counted in only a few million, and that would have little impact on the planet's temperature,' Nordhaus suggested. However, if India bombs Islamabad and Pakistan retaliates by bombing Mumbai, it would be difficult to prevent further escalation. Moreover, if intercontinental ballistic missiles are in the air, other nuclear states would essentially be unable to determine where they are headed, Nordhaus emphasized. 'Leaders in Washington, Moscow, and Beijing will have to make a decision within minutes about whether to launch their own weapons. Scenarios of medium level, including several hundred warheads, would lead to a cooling of the climate, sufficient to destroy global food production and trade, and would likely kill hundreds of millions of people,' Nordhaus predicted. In the worst-case scenario, droughts and crop failures would quickly spread around the world, resulting in hundreds of millions of refugees migrating to other continents in search of food, safety, and shelter. However, some would still die from diseases and malnutrition, and most would die from starvation. Therefore, as Nordhaus wrote, in such a scenario, human civilization would come to an end. 'The regime of arms control, which world leaders have carefully built up in the final stages of the Cold War, is crumbling into pieces. In February next year, the term of the new Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed in 2010, which limits the number of deployed warheads in Russia and the United States to 1550 units, will expire - this is still enough to destroy civilization. Russia and the United States have over 5,000 warheads in reserve. China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal,' Nordhaus reminded. According to him, conflicts between nuclear opponents remind humanity that there is no greater risk to society than nuclear war. 'Zero nuclear weapons may be as unattainable a dream as zero carbon emissions, but for politicians, philanthropists, and leaders of civil society, regardless of their political views, there should be no higher priority than de-escalating this threat,' Nordhaus concluded. Earlier, Axios reported that the United States plans to spend one trillion dollars on nuclear weapons over the next 10 years. This amount is greater than the budget for many federal agencies. According to experts, this means that the US Department of Defense will have to make a 'difficult choice' about which programs to continue. Meanwhile, analysts also say that 'rapidly rising' costs divert resources from 'other more pressing human needs and national security priorities.' General Nikolai Filatov also responded to whether the Ukrainian military would shoot down enemy missiles with nuclear warheads. According to him, Ukrainian troops should shoot down these enemy targets without immediately determining whether they are nuclear or not. In addition, he explained whether there would be a detonation in the event of shooting down a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead, using the example of short- and medium-range missiles. 'When they shoot down short- and medium-range missiles, theoretically, the warhead should not detonate. Depending on where they hit. If they hit the engine and it's damaged - one situation, i.e., the missile will fall and there will be no explosion. Regarding the warhead, we need to explain the principle of operation. The warhead is made up of several segments, located so that there is no uncontrolled chain reaction. When these parts of the charge are applied, they rapidly approach each other, a critical mass is formed - a nuclear explosion occurs,' Filatov noted.

**India Pakistan war 'would spark Armageddon with 125m deaths and global starvation' - The Mirror**
Experts warn that a nuclear war between India and Pakistan could result in the deaths of over 100 million people, with tens of millions perishing immediately and billions affected by global famines. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists published a study that found the use of nuclear weapons would release huge plumes of dust into the atmosphere, triggering famines and reducing the amount of sunlight reaching Earth's surface by 20-35%. Alan Robock, a Distinguished Professor at Rutgers University, said, 'Such a war would threaten not only the locations where bombs might be targeted but the entire world.' The study also found that nuclear fallout would spread radioactive poisoning across a wide area, and it could take up to a decade for things to return to normal.

**Third World War Possible Within 5-10 Years, Survey Finds**
A recent YouGov survey conducted by The Guardian found that many people in the US and Western Europe believe that a third world war is likely to occur within the next 5 to 10 years. The survey also found that a majority of respondents believe that the events of World War II and its aftermath are still relevant today and should continue to be taught to young people. According to the survey, 68-76% of respondents believe that a new conflict would involve nuclear weapons, while 57-73% believe that it would result in greater loss of life than World War II. 25-44% of respondents believe that such a war would result in the greatest number of deaths worldwide. Mark Lynas, author of 'Nuclear Winter in 6 Minutes: How to Survive a Nuclear War', writes that in the event of a nuclear war, cities around the world would still be burning for weeks after the initial blast, with 4,000 explosions causing widespread destruction. Annie Jacobsen, a US researcher and nuclear war expert, estimates that 6 million people could die within 72 days of a nuclear war, citing a 1959-60 analysis by nuclear physicist and former Pentagon scientist Herb York.

**A nuclear conflict can claim millions of lives**
A nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan could claim 50 to 125 million lives, resulting in global climate catastrophes, lower global temperatures, and unprecedented famine. The direct effects of a nuclear exchange would be apocalyptic, with both countries having 300 nuclear weapons collectively. According to reliable data, Pakistan has 130 nuclear weapons and India has 172. The writer notes that both sides would likely use thermonuclear 200 kiloton weapons in the event of a conflict. This would have devastating consequences, as seen throughout world history, where only 268 out of 3,428 years have been without war.

**Zhirinovsky's Prophecy: 200 Million Deaths on the Horizon?**
Vladimir Zhirinovsky predicted 20 years ago that global catastrophes could lead to the deaths of 200 million people. Today, events are unfolding that confirm his ominous predictions. A recent terrorist attack in Kashmir, a disputed region between India, Pakistan, and China, has resulted in the deaths of nearly 30 people. The terrorist group responsible for the attack has ties to Pakistani radicals. India has responded by closing a key border crossing with Pakistan and suspending visa-free travel. Zhirinovsky predicted that a nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan could lead to the deaths of 200 million people. Experts estimate that a nuclear war between the two countries could result in the deaths of 50-125 million people. 'The attack in Kashmir could be the first act of a new war,' says military correspondent Semen Pegov. Zhirinovsky's words often prove prophetic, and some of his predictions concern India and Pakistan. 'In the end, a nuclear conflict will occur between Israel and Palestine, and between India and Pakistan. Millions of Palestinians, Syrians, Lebanese, and others will die,' he said. These words, once a dark prediction, now seem like a harsh forecast becoming a reality. In some cases, it seems that the world is developing according to Zhirinovsky's predictions.

**US Nuclear Arsenal: A Legacy of Toxic Waste and a Growing Risk of Accidental War**
For 40 years, the United States produced four nuclear bombs per day, leaving a vast legacy of toxic radioactive waste. The plants in South Carolina, Washington, Ohio, and Idaho that helped produce the 60,000 atomic bombs have tons of waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years. The production of plutonium and bombs stopped in 1989, but with technological improvements, the country plans to reach a production capacity of at least 80 plutonium cores per year by the mid-2030s. Dr. Carlos Umaña, co-president of the International Association of Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, warns that a large-scale nuclear war would not only be quick but also extremely destructive: 'According to the Federation of American Scientists, there are currently 12,000 nuclear warheads in the world, of which 2,000 are at maximum alert, ready to be detonated in just 60 seconds,' he said. Umaña also explains that the detonation of these types of arms in the context of a large-scale nuclear war could destroy the planet in just 72 minutes. Umaña also highlights the risk of cyberattacks or human errors that could trigger a nuclear explosion accidentally, 'As technology advances, so does the risk of cyberterrorism and human error,' he said.

**US Cities and Military Bases at Risk in a Nuclear War: A Study Reveals the Devastating Consequences**
A new study by Halcyon Maps, based on data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and nuclear impact simulations, reveals the regions most affected by a large-scale nuclear war in the United States. The study shows that up to 250 million people could die, equivalent to 75% of the US population. The main cities, military bases, and defense installations would be the first targets of such an attack. The study explains that the main cities, such as New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Houston, and Washington D.C., would be the first targets due to their economic, political, and military importance. The silos of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and North Dakota would also be priority targets, as they house the country's main nuclear deterrent. The study warns that the destruction of these areas would have a devastating impact on the economy and make it difficult to respond to the crisis. 'The detonation of multiple bombs would cause massive destruction in the affected cities, with explosions capable of leveling buildings, roads, and infrastructure within a radius of several kilometers,' the study said. 'Millions of people would die instantly, while many others would suffer severe burns and injuries from the shockwave.' The study also highlights the dangers of radiation, which would spread throughout the affected area. 'The radioactive rain, consisting of contaminated debris, would disperse with the winds, exposing the population to lethal levels of radiation,' the study said. 'Those who receive high doses of radiation would experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin damage, and in extreme cases, convulsions and coma.' In the long term, the US would face a nuclear winter, a phenomenon in which the dust and particles generated by the explosions would block sunlight, causing a drastic drop in temperatures. 'This scenario would affect the supply of water and food,' said John Erath, director of policy at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, as reported by Daily Mail.

**Map shows where 75% of US population will die in WWIII nuclear attack**
A new map created by Halcyon Maps reveals the devastating effects of a large-scale nuclear attack on the US, with 75% of the country's population, approximately 250 million Americans, at risk of death. The map, based on data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), shows that every populated city on the East Coast, Midwest, West Coast, and South could be targeted, with severe fallout and radioactive debris affecting parts of California, the East Coast, and the Midwest. Even areas that would avoid immediate obliteration would become uninhabitable in the nuclear winter that would follow. The map highlights the risk of nuclear war, with Russia leading the world in nuclear warheads and China having a significant stockpile. As Princeton researchers wrote, 'The risk of nuclear war has increased dramatically in the past two years.' John Erath, Senior Policy Director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, stated, 'Any nuclear war or weapons detonation would be bad for everyone.' The map shows that no area is truly 'safe' from fallout and other consequences like contamination of food and water supplies and prolonged radiation exposure.
