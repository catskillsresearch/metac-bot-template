**European Countries Affected by Disinformation and Russian Propaganda**
The European Observatory on Disinformation has highlighted the existence of two websites linked to a campaign of influence in the Polish elections, which spent almost 40,000 euros on social media ads to attack Spanish parties PP and VOX, according to the organization, citing the Spanish fact-checker Maldita. These websites have less than 200 followers on Facebook and Instagram, but their ads generated over 18 million impressions. In France, the organization notes disinformation related to tests conducted by an American laboratory on samples of fast-food products in California, which revealed the presence of rat DNA and human DNA in some burgers, according to a fact-checking agency from France Presse. In Italy, disinformation generated using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) reached a new high in April, increasing from 5.8% in the previous month to 11.6%, the highest value ever recorded, according to the Italian Digital Media Observatory (IDMO). In Luxembourg, AI generative platforms are becoming increasingly accessible and are sometimes used to analyze information circulating on social media, according to the EDMO Belux, which covers the linguistic communities of Luxembourg and Belgium. In May, Germany and Lithuania were affected by disinformation related to a case involving German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, during a visit to Ukraine at the beginning of the month. 'After the visit, a low-quality video circulated on the internet falsely claiming that Macron was hiding a bag of cocaine during a photo shoot. In reality, he was holding a paper handkerchief,' said the German Press Agency (dpa). In Denmark, Norway, and Finland, Nordic fact-checkers discovered that AI chatbots use Russian disinformation network Pravda's websites when asked in Nordic languages, sometimes reproducing Russian propaganda, according to the Nordic Digital Media and Disinformation Observatory (NORDIS).

**Klingbeil's Relief Package: A Challenge to Convince the States**
Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil is pushing for a swift approval of the first package of relief measures for the economy, which includes the 'Investitionsbooster' to be voted on by the cabinet on Wednesday. The goal is to boost the economy, stimulate growth, and secure jobs. However, the plan also includes reducing the corporate tax rate from 2028, which would result in a loss of around 5 billion euros for the states by 2029. The government expects that the improved economy will generate additional revenue elsewhere. Klingbeil is under pressure to convince the states to support the plan, as they have expressed concerns and are upset about the coalition agreements.

**Rainbow Map 2025 Shows Alarming Setbacks in LGBTQIA+ Rights in Europe**
The Rainbow Map 2025, released by ILGA-Europe, shows alarming setbacks in LGBTQIA+ rights in Europe. The map evaluates the legal and political situation of LGBTQIA+ individuals in 49 European countries, with a scale ranging from 0% (severe human rights violations) to 100% (full equality and human rights protection). The evaluation considers concrete laws and political measures that directly affect the lives of LGBTQIA+ people. According to Katrin Hugendubel, a lawyer at ILGA-Europe, 'democratic erosions' are a major concern, with national laws that do not serve societal needs but rather aim to marginalize LGBTQIA+ individuals. She cites the example of Hungary's constitutional amendment, which states that 'the mother is a woman and the father is a man' and that 'gender is determined by birth.' Hugendubel says, 'Courts can be a source of hope, as they have already overturned some decisions or are currently considering cases to defend the rights of rainbow families, such as in Italy.' ILGA-Europe's Executive Director, Chaber, notes that the Rainbow Map 2025 not only shows the legal situation but also 'how acute the pressure on democracy is across Europe. If we don't act now, the deliberate erosion of rights will become the norm.' The current numbers show a clear picture: many European countries lack fundamental rights and protection mechanisms for LGBTQIA+ individuals. Only 10 countries in Europe have banned 'conversion therapies' legally. In 6 countries, there is no legal protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Only 9 countries, including Belgium, Spain, and Denmark, provide comprehensive protection regarding sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender characteristics (SOGIESC). Only a few countries, including Belgium, Iceland, and Malta, explicitly prohibit hate crimes and hate speech against LGBTQIA+ individuals. 22 countries recognize marriage for same-sex couples. 18 countries offer no legal protection for same-sex partnerships. Trans-parenting is only fully recognized in 8 countries. Only 6 countries, including Germany, Greece, Iceland, and Spain, prohibit medically unnecessary interventions on intersex children. In 11 countries, there is no legal possibility to recognize one's own gender. In Bulgaria, Hungary, and Russia, a legal gender recognition is even completely prohibited. Only 12 countries allow the change of gender entry based on self-determination, without medical or psychological assessments. In at least 14 countries, the assembly and association rights of LGBTQIA+ organizations are restricted or systematically under pressure. In 27 countries, sexual orientation and gender identity are considered asylum grounds. Only 6 countries explicitly protect intersex refugees in asylum law.

**France to Restrict Smoking in Public Spaces: A Step Towards a Smoke-Free Generation?**
France will restrict smoking in public spaces from July 1st. Many people find smoking in enclosed spaces annoying, but in public areas, opinions are still divided. In Holzwickede, the city has banned smoking, including e-cigarettes, at public events organized by the municipality. This move is part of a broader trend in Europe to protect non-smokers. In the UK, disposable e-cigarettes have been banned since Sunday, with the goal of creating a smoke-free generation. France and Belgium have also banned disposable e-cigarettes, while in the Netherlands, cigarettes are only available in specialty stores and some gas stations. According to the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), a smoking ban in public areas could have a positive impact on society, particularly for children and young people. If people are less likely to see others smoking, it may become less of a normal behavior. Additionally, restricting advertising and sales, as seen in many European countries, has shown positive effects. 'If fewer people are seen smoking in public, it will be perceived as less normal behavior,' said Katrin Schaller from the DKFZ. 'A complete ban on tobacco and e-cigarette advertising would be a good step towards reducing smoking rates.'

**UK to Ban Disposable Vapes in 2025**
The UK will ban the sale and supply of disposable vapes from June 1, 2025, in an effort to reduce youth access to vaping and the waste generated by these devices. According to official data, vaping in England grew by over 400% between 2012 and 2023. Although the long-term health effects of vaping are unknown, the UK government has acknowledged the addictive effects of nicotine. The ban aims to also reduce waste, as an estimated 5 million disposable vapes are discarded weekly in the UK. Over 40 countries currently prohibit the sale of e-cigarettes, with five banning disposable ones and seven banning flavored ones. The World Health Organization notes that e-cigarette accessories are still unregulated. France and Belgium have already banned disposable vapes, with France following suit in February 2025 and Belgium since January 1, 2025. Germany and Spain are also preparing similar measures. As a precursor, Spain has imposed an indirect tax on the purchase of e-cigarette liquid since April 1. Most European countries, however, limit vaping restrictions to public places. Norway has banned the importation and sale of e-cigarettes and nicotine refills until July 1, 2025. The Netherlands only allows the sale of tobacco-flavored liquids. Cambodia and Singapore have banned the possession, use, and sale of e-cigarettes since 2014 and 2018, respectively. Thailand has prohibited e-cigarettes since 2014, with penalties including fines and imprisonment. India has banned the production, importation, sale, and advertising of all e-cigarettes, including disposables, since 2019. China, which produces approximately 90% of the world's vapes, has banned the sale of e-cigarettes with flavors other than tobacco since 2022. Hong Kong will ban the possession and use of e-cigarettes in public by mid-2026, although importation, manufacturing, and sale are prohibited since April 2022. Argentina, Brazil, Nicaragua, Panama, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela have banned the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes. Mexico has banned e-cigarettes since January 18, 2025, with a constitutional reform regulating their production, distribution, and acquisition. In the US, laws vary by state, but e-cigarettes are generally classified as either 'derived from tobacco' or 'therapeutic products.' Qatar, Jordan, Kuwait, and Lebanon have formally banned the importation and use of e-cigarettes. New Zealand has announced the ban on single-use e-cigarettes, along with restrictions on the proximity of vape shops to schools and the regulation of available flavors. Australia has made e-cigarettes available only in pharmacies since July 1, 2024, as part of a reform to combat smoking that includes penalties of up to seven years in prison and multimillion-dollar fines.

**Klingbeil's Investment Package: A Boost for the Economy?**
Bundesfinanzminister Lars Klingbeil has presented a draft law for the planned investment package, which includes new depreciation rules and a reduction in corporate tax. The goal is to boost the economy, which has been in recession for three years. The draft law provides for 'degressive' depreciation, allowing companies to write off a larger portion of their investments in new machines, vehicles, or materials at the beginning, rather than spreading it evenly over the useful life. Additionally, the corporate tax rate is planned to be reduced from 15% to 10% over five years, starting from 2028. The hope is that further reforms, including a reduction in bureaucracy and lower electricity costs, will have already boosted growth by then, making the tax losses more manageable. The total costs of the planned measures are estimated to be around 2.5 billion euros in the current year, 8.1 billion euros in 2026, 11.8 billion euros in 2027, 12 billion euros in 2028, and 11.3 billion euros in 2029. However, the costs will not only be borne by the federal government, but also by the states and municipalities. As Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz pointed out, the states have already negotiated the coalition agreement and will receive 100 billion euros from the planned 500 billion euro investment package. He expects the state representatives to 'stand by the common decisions we have made'.

**Europe's Nuclear Renaissance: A Shift Towards Energy Sovereignty**
Most European countries are reevaluating their stance on nuclear energy in response to the climate crisis and increasing electricity demands. The energy source has seen a resurgence in interest, with countries like France, the UK, and Poland planning to expand their nuclear capabilities. France, with 57 reactors, remains the most nuclearized country per capita. The country has announced a new program to build 6 to 14 new reactors, with the first expected to come online in 2038. Other countries, such as Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands, are also considering a return to nuclear energy to reduce their dependence on imported fossil fuels and volatile energy prices. The European Union is expected to realign its energy policies to prioritize carbon neutrality, competitiveness, and sovereignty, without discriminating against low-carbon energy sources. The shift towards nuclear energy is driven by the need for energy sovereignty and decarbonization, as well as the desire to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels.

**EU Farmers Feel Abandoned, Survey Finds**
A year after massive protests by European farmers, a new survey by Ipsos, commissioned by CropLife Europe, shows that farmers feel abandoned by EU institutions, especially when it comes to accessing new technologies for sustainable and competitive farming. The survey, which interviewed nearly 2,000 professionals from France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland, Romania, Ireland, Belgium, and the Netherlands, found that while half of European farmers joined the protests in 2023-2024, 91% are still dissatisfied with the political response at both EU and national levels. Despite media attention and public sympathy, farmers report few concrete changes in policy or income. The survey highlights the pressure of financial constraints, with 69% of farmers and livestock breeders saying their income is insufficient to maintain their businesses. They call for simplifying administrative processes and improving access to financial aid, which is often complicated to request. The survey also addresses the issue of limited access to innovation, citing biosolutions, biotechnology, and precision agriculture tools as crucial for improving productivity and sustainability. The top priority for European farmers is reducing bureaucracy, which would free up time and resources. The survey also shows a high level of pessimism about the future, with over half of farmers concerned about the long-term. According to the survey, a fair distribution of benefits throughout the agricultural value chain is necessary to ensure farmers receive a fair compensation. Olivier de Matos, director general of CropLife Europe, commented: 'Farmers have expressed their concerns. Now it's time to act together. Solving technological gaps and training farmers by the EU would help build a sustainable, competitive, and resilient agricultural future in all countries.' Carlos Palomar, director general of AEPLA, agreed, adding: 'The concerns of Spanish farmers are the same as those of their European colleagues. From AEPLA, we work to respond to these concerns by developing integrated plant health solutions. Along with conventional pesticides that have proven their safety and efficacy, we bet on digital and precision agriculture. The future is here, and innovation is our path. It's not an option, so it's essential to create conditions that favor its development and do not discourage it.'

**France Takes Step Towards Legalizing Euthanasia, Joining Other European Countries**
France has taken a significant step towards legalizing euthanasia by approving a bill in the National Assembly that allows patients with incurable diseases to end their lives with dignity. This decision follows countries like the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain, which have already regulated the right to die with dignity. However, the legislative process is not yet complete, and the bill will need to pass the Senate in the fall and be debated again in the National Assembly in early 2026. The Netherlands was the first European country to legalize euthanasia in 2001, followed by Belgium, Luxembourg, and Spain. However, other countries like Germany, the UK, and Portugal are still debating the issue. Germany decriminalized assisted suicide in 2020, but has not yet passed a law to regulate it. The UK is considering a bill to allow assisted dying for people over 18 with terminal illnesses, but the process is still ongoing. Portugal's law was rejected by the Constitutional Court in April, and Italy maintains a more rigid stance on the issue, with the government recently challenging a regional law in the Toscana region. Russia maintains a strict ban on euthanasia, but a recent survey found that 49% of Russians would support legalizing it in cases of incurable diseases.

**As France Votes On Bill Today, A Look At Nations That Allow Assisted Dying**
Several European countries have already legalized assisted dying for terminally ill patients. The Netherlands and Belgium were the first to allow euthanasia, with strict regulations in place since 2002. Luxembourg decriminalized euthanasia and assisted dying in 2009. Switzerland has allowed assisted suicide for decades, but has seen an increase in 'suicide tourism'. Austria legalized assisted suicide in 2022, while Spain adopted a law in 2021 with strict conditions. Portugal decriminalized euthanasia in 2023, but the law has not come into force. Italy's Tuscany region has adopted regulation for assisted suicide, but the central government has challenged it. The UK has approved a bill to legalize assisted dying for adults with an incurable illness, but it still needs further scrutiny. The Scottish parliament has also passed its first vote on a bill to legalize assisted dying. 'It is a complex issue that requires careful consideration,' said a spokesperson. 'We need to ensure that any law is in place to protect the rights of all individuals.'

**EU Member States Seek to Increase Military Spending without Violating Deficit Rules**
Sixteen European Union member states have announced their intention to use a derogation clause to increase their military spending without violating the EU's deficit rules. The countries, including Belgium, the Czech Republic, and Germany, want to allocate up to 1.5% of their GDP to military expenses for four years. France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands have decided not to use this scheme, citing their high public debt levels. The French government stated, 'Our priority is to reduce the deficit, which is a matter of sovereignty that goes beyond EU rules.' The EU Commission aims to mobilize up to 650 billion euros by 2030 to rearm the continent, but this goal seems unattainable due to the abstention of several major countries. The EU will analyze the requests and submit its conclusions to the finance ministers in June, with the goal of formalizing the exemptions before the summer.

**Eurozone Deficit Decreases to 3.1% of GDP in 2024**
The Eurozone's deficit has decreased to 3.1% of GDP in 2024 (from 3.5% in 2023), and the EU's deficit has decreased to 3.2% (from 3.5% in 2023). The public debt has slightly increased in the Eurozone to 87.4% (from 87.3%) and to 81% in the EU (from 80.8%). This is according to Eurostat. The highest deficits were recorded in Romania (-9.3%), Poland (-6.6%), and France (-5.8%). Among the 27 European countries, Italy's deficit of 3.4% is ranked 10th. As for the debt-to-GDP ratio, Italy remains second (135.3%) behind Greece (153.6%). France (113%), Belgium (104.7%), and Spain (101.8%) follow. Eurostat notes that it has not made any changes to the data provided by the countries. The annual data on public deficit and public debt as a percentage of GDP are relevant for the EU's surveillance of accounts, with the commitment to keep the first below 3% of GDP and the second below 60% of GDP. For the Stability and Growth Pact, the 90% debt-to-GDP threshold is also relevant, with a greater return required if exceeded. According to Eurostat, the EU has a procedure for excessive deficit (based on 2023 data) for eight countries (Italy, Hungary, Romania, France, Poland, Malta, Slovakia, and Belgium), with Austria under review. The Eurostat 2024 report shows that eight countries have a public debt below the 3% threshold (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Sweden), while seven countries have a surplus (Denmark, Ireland, Cyprus, Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal, and the Netherlands).

**Expert: Schengen Zone Ruined by Illegal Migration**
The creation of the Schengen zone was a useful idea, but it was ruined by illegal migration, and now the official exit of one country can trigger a 'domino effect', said Hungarian political expert Georg Spetle to RIA Novosti. 'The Schengen zone was created 30 years ago to allow EU citizens to travel from one country to another without border control. It also facilitated the transportation of goods, drivers of trucks no longer had to wait for hours or even days at the border, and food became cheaper, so it was a great achievement. But all was spoiled by illegal migration, which started in 2015,' Spetle said. According to him, the influx of migrants from the Middle East and the Sahel region led to the return of partial border control within the Schengen zone, as Brussels 'did not want and still does not want to suppress illegal migration.' The expert also noted that as long as the Schengen zone has a chance to survive, but a resonant terrorist attack involving migrants can lead to a situation where the leader of one of the EU countries 'finds enough political will and declares the exit from Schengen.' 'Of course, then it can trigger a 'domino effect', then other countries will say the same,' Spetle said, adding that even countries with conservative governments, such as Hungary, are focused on protecting the external borders of the EU and are not aimed at leaving the Schengen zone. Germany introduced border control on all its land borders, including those with Schengen countries, in the fall of 2024, citing high levels of illegal migration, as well as protection from Islamist terrorists and transnational crime. In the fall of 2024, Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia temporarily returned control to the borders within Schengen due to the threat of terrorism. The Netherlands introduced internal border control from December 9, 2024, which will last six months. This decision was made by the authorities to combat illegal migration and transnational crime. After the migration crisis in Europe, the authorities of Hungary began to conduct a tough policy towards migrants and refugees crossing the country's borders. For this, Budapest was subjected to sharp criticism from humanitarian agencies of the UN and the EU. The EU Court in Luxembourg in June sentenced Hungary to a fine of 200 million euros and daily payments of 1 million euros for refusing to comply with previous court decisions related to the violation of European rules for accepting migrants. The Prime Minister of Hungary stated that Budapest will not change its migration policy, and the EU Court is controlled by American billionaire George Soros.

**Spain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Luxembourg advance in creating a European savings product**
Spain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Luxembourg are advancing in the creation of a European savings product to overcome the blockage of the Capital Market Union, which would allow the EU to have a common financial market to pool savings, drive stock market integration, and facilitate joint debt. Spanish Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo proposed in October to implement 'pilot projects' to move in this direction, even if it's just for a group of countries, which would then be joined by others interested in what he called a 'European Competitiveness Laboratory.' The ministers of the seven countries, representing the main European economies, met in Brussels on Monday before the Eurogroup meeting to address this proposal, which, according to Cuerpo, would provide European countries with 'a tool that is agile to advance in the matter of integration in the single market.' The idea is for this group of countries to serve as a 'vanguard' for projects that would deepen the internal market and 'do it in a coordinated manner with the initiatives of the European Commission and integrative allowing other countries to join.' Cuerpo explained that the first projects being analyzed are those related to the Capital Market Union with the ability to direct all savings produced towards projects that give us greater strategic autonomy, greater economic security,' referring specifically to the 'creation of a European savings product.' The preparations will continue in June with the intention of having the instrument ready by the second half of the year. 'We do not have a European financial market and all our savings, due to this reason, are going to the United States, are feeding the US economy and are strengthening US companies. These savings are returning to Europe to buy our companies,' warned former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, who wrote one of the reports on competitiveness that are serving as a guide for the EU to not fall behind. The project in which Spain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Luxembourg are working is a EU-level savings label to promote the mobilization of retail savings towards investment, according to government sources, which point out that the intention is 'to direct millions of euros in financing to develop the European industry and strengthen its security' in a context in which the EU is suffering the 'pinch' between the US, which has raised the pressure of commercial war since the return of Donald Trump, and China. Cuerpo reiterated that the instrument proposed by Ursula von der Leyen to grant credits to countries is insufficient. 'We believe that we have to go even further (...) also with an element of transfers,' he defended. This is a debate that is hovering in the EU, but which initially counts on the rejection of countries like Germany, the Netherlands, or Austria, which do not want to know anything about joint debt.

The topic of sending European 'peacekeepers' to Ukraine is being pushed forward slowly. French President Macron regularly promises but is afraid that soldiers will return in coffins. Germany does not even make promises. Poland has firmly stated that they will not go. The Baltic states are resolute, ready to send French and German troops. Britain is willing to participate, but only if they are going with the French. Italy is observing Trump and will not send anyone. Sweden is preparing for war on its own territory and defending Gothenburg, which it can do safely. The Netherlands has sent its top NATO representative and considers this sufficient participation. Belgium is silent. The Czech Republic wants to participate but cannot. Denmark is busy building dog sleds to defend Greenland against Trump. Spain is quietly sitting on the Iberian Peninsula, hoping to be forgotten. Portugal is willing to provide the Azores Islands for the transportation of 'peacekeepers' and is confident that this is already a lot. Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Finland are all the same, meaning nothing. Hungary and Slovakia are categorically against it. Norway and Liechtenstein are left, but they lack both people and determination.

**EU Defense, Numbers, and Challenges**
The European Union's informal summit on February 3, 2024, highlighted the division among the 27 member states on two key issues: how to finance the additional 500 billion euros of investment needed over 10 years, and how to strengthen the European defense industry. The right-wing is trying to use defense as an excuse to cut social spending. Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries have rejected the idea of issuing a common European debt to finance the qualitative leap in the EU's military capacity, as requested by France, Poland, and Spain. Creating a European preference for the acquisition of military material from the 27 to strengthen their own industry and stop financing the industries of other powers clashed with the opposition of Poland, the Netherlands, and Sweden, among others, who fear upsetting US President Donald Trump. According to the report on the EU's deficiencies by former ECB President Mario Draghi, the 63% of military supplies acquired by the 27 come from the US, and 15% from other countries outside the EU, resulting in tens of billions of euros annually being spent to strengthen the industry and economy of other countries instead of the European one. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has opened the possibility of relaxing the rules of the stability pact to exclude defense investment from public deficit limits. This proposal, whose details are still to be concretized, would increase the military spending capacity of the states without violating European rules, but does not solve the fundamental problem of where the 27 will get the additional funds in a context of social unrest and weak growth in most countries. The 24 EU member states of the NATO still do not meet the goal of dedicating at least 2% of their GDP to defense, with Spain, Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Croatia, Slovenia, and Luxembourg not meeting the target, according to the Atlantic Alliance. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte proposes raising the target to 3% as a minimum to strengthen European defense against Trump's pressures. In the case of Spain, reaching the 2% target would require an additional 11,500 million euros annually, and reaching 3% would require an additional 16,000 million euros annually. In the case of Italy, reaching the 2% target would require an additional 11,000 million euros annually, and reaching 3% would require an additional 21,300 million euros annually. In Germany, when the special defense fund of 100,000 million euros created in 2022 expires in 2027, the government will face a 40,000 million euro hole in its defense budget to continue meeting the 2% NATO target, and reaching 3% would require an additional 42,000 million euros annually. Liberals and conservatives plan to use the defense theme to cut social spending. Liberal Rutte, the former Dutch prime minister, has already proposed this, insisting that now the priority is defense and that means spending less on other priorities. The European Commission proposes allocating 100,000 million euros to defense in the next EU financial framework 2028-2031, and without an increase in the budget, it will be at the expense of agricultural, social, or regional funds. Ignoring the social unrest and discredit of institutions will fuel the advance of the far right. NATO Secretary-General Rutte is an example. His austerity policy as Dutch prime minister led to his defeat in the 2023 regional elections against the newly created populist Movement of Rural Citizens (BBB) and in the subsequent legislative elections, the far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) won with 23.5% of the votes, while his liberal party (VVD) came in third with 15%. Rutte's political legacy has been to leave the Netherlands with a government led by the far right.

**European Banks Face Urgent Review Amid Concerns Over Competitiveness**
Germany, France, and Italy have intensified their efforts to impose an urgent review of the weaknesses in the European banking sector, including 'lender options' to support them in competing with their American counterparts. The three largest economies in the European Union have asked other member states, including Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Spain, to join their initiative to launch a 'temporary' review of the competitiveness of the banking sector by the end of this quarter. According to a draft joint letter obtained by Bloomberg, 'several indicators suggest that European banks have become less competitive, especially when compared to their international counterparts.' The letter states, 'This potential negative trend - if confirmed and not addressed - poses significant risks, including on the European Union's ability to finance defense and other key industries.' The three countries first proposed the review last year as part of a broader call to ease restrictions on banking systems and focus instead on promoting growth. France has also called for a 'massive' standstill on regulatory rules under President Donald Trump's administration. The draft letter calls for recommendations to improve competitiveness to be presented to lawmakers by the end of the year, with the final version ready by June 2026. This will be several years before the European Commission's current plan to review banking regulation in 2028. The German Finance Ministry said that 'the draft was prepared jointly by several member states, but has not been finalized and sent yet.' It added that Germany shares 'the main concern that the European Commission will issue a preliminary report on the competitiveness of the banking sector.' Many informed people confirmed that the draft has not yet received full political backing and is still under discussion at the working level. A European diplomat said that the Netherlands is participating in the discussions because an external perspective on the issue of banking competition may be useful. However, the country does not consider this report a top priority, and prefers instead to develop a capital markets union within the group, the diplomat added. A second European diplomat said that other countries, including Sweden, are also participating in the discussion, but believe it is too early to say whether they will officially join the initiative. A person familiar with Spain's position said they have also participated in the talks. In an interview with Bloomberg last week, Maria Luisa Albukerk, the European Union's financial services commissioner, said she would not support 'a race to the bottom' on regulation.
