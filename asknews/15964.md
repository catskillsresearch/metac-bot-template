**Walmart Tops Fortune 500 List for 13th Consecutive Year**
The Fortune 500 list for 2025 has been released, showing the top 500 companies in the US by revenue. Walmart remains at the top for the 13th consecutive year, followed by Amazon and UnitedHealth Group. The top 10 includes Apple, CVS Health, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet, ExxonMobil, McKesson, and Cencora. Together, these companies generated $4.2 trillion in revenue in the 2024 fiscal year. The total revenue for all 500 companies was $19.9 trillion, with $1.87 trillion in profits, both records. Despite economic uncertainty and fears about the impact of tariffs, this year's list was one of the most stable in history, with only 22 companies replaced from the previous year. Matthew Heimer, editor of the publication, wrote, 'You might be surprised to learn this: the Fortune 500 has never been so stable.' Seven of the top 10 companies have remained in the elite group for a decade. However, the recent economic measures, such as new tariffs, have not yet been reflected in the list. Companies like General Motors, UPS, and Delta Air Lines have withdrawn their profit forecasts due to the uncertainty. Tariffs on imports, especially from China, are starting to affect supply chains, with Walmart and small Amazon sellers already passing on higher costs to consumers. 'This will mean higher prices, which generate more revenue -- unless they scare off many buyers,' notes the magazine. Despite this background, the representation of women has reached a milestone: 55 companies on the list are led by women, the highest number ever recorded (11%). Notable examples include Mary Barra (General Motors), Jane Fraser (Citigroup), and Corie Barry (Best Buy).

**The Inevitable Decline of the European Economy: A Warning from Marc Vidal**
According to Marc Vidal, by 2050, there will be no European economy among the top 10 in the world, and neither will Spain. This is reflected in the report 'El Mundo en 2050' by Price, which collects prospective analyses from the IMF and the study 'Potencias mundiales 2050-2075' by Goldman Sachs. The report highlights economic stagnation, political fragility, and clear geopolitical changes that show a significant decline. The European Union's growth is expected to be only 0.7% in 2024 and 0.9% in 2025, losing competitiveness to powers like India, China, and even the US. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated this trend, accelerating the decline of Western hegemony. Additionally, the intermittent commercial war with the US, driven by Donald Trump, has further contributed to this decline. Vidal states that the European model of well-being, although admirable in many ways, is becoming unsustainable without deep reforms in defense, energy, and industry. He concludes that it is 'irremediable' unless significant changes are made, citing the study's findings that an empire in decline reveals its downfall when its laws become arbitrary, complex, and disconnected from social consensus. Vidal also criticizes the official discourse, which promotes an artificial morality where poverty is sold as virtue and the destruction of tradition is presented as inevitable progress.

**Big Tech Companies Unite to Triple Nuclear Capacity by 2050**
The Big Tech companies, including Amazon, Dow, Google, and Meta, have joined forces with 14 major banks and financial institutions, 140 nuclear industry companies, and 31 countries to support the goal of tripling the world's nuclear capacity by 2050. This is a first, as both consumers and producers from outside the sector have signed such an agreement. The tech giants are also urging other energy consumers to support this ambitious goal. The World Nuclear Association (WNA) is facilitating the movement, which advocates for equal access to nuclear energy financing. The agreement aims to address the growing interest in nuclear energy from various sectors, including maritime, aviation, and oil and gas. According to the WNA, 'the potential of nuclear energy to develop beyond the traditional electrical grid, providing abundant and continuous energy to support high-performance and competitive operations for energy consumers,' is a key aspect of the pact. However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warns that global electricity consumption is expected to grow at its fastest rate in recent years, with a 4% annual increase until 2027. This would be equivalent to adding more electricity consumption than Japan's annual consumption each year. The IEA points to emerging and developing economies as the largest demanders over the next three years, with China's electricity consumption growing at a rate faster than its overall economy since 2020. The US is also experiencing a strong increase in electricity demand, with the equivalent of California's current consumption being added to the national total over the next three years. Europe's growth in electricity demand is more modest, and is expected to return to its 2021 level only by 2027.

**10 Best Performing Data Center Stocks So Far in 2025**
The data center industry is experiencing rapid growth, driven by the increasing demand for digital technologies and data-intensive applications. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, global data center capacity demand could increase annually by 19% to 22% between 2023 and 2030, reaching 171 to 219 gigawatts. However, power supply constraints are becoming a pressing concern, with Stephen Byrd estimating that the U.S. could face a power deficit of 36 GW by 2028. To mitigate this, 'de-bottlenecking solutions' such as leveraging nuclear energy and deploying fuel cells are being considered. The report also forecasts that hyperscalers will account for nearly 60% of the data center industry's growth from 2023 to 2028, increasing their share of global power consumption from 35% to 45%. We take a closer look at the 10 best-performing data center stocks in 2025, including Nutanix Inc. (NASDAQ:NTNX) and Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:WDC), which have outperformed the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index) by 11% and 12.1% respectively.
