**Israel-Europe Relations in Crisis: Threats and Consequences**
The relations between Israel and Europe are experiencing unprecedented crisis due to Israel's continued war on Gaza. European countries such as Britain, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Belgium, and others have threatened to cut ties with Israel, impose sanctions, and suspend cooperation agreements. Several countries have taken initial steps against Israel, including recalling ambassadors, cutting cooperation agreements, and municipal and academic ties. Others have announced plans to impose sanctions on Israel. According to expert Adel Shdeed, the European threats are unprecedented and pose a significant threat to Israel's image in the West. He notes that while the threats have not yet been translated into concrete actions, they can still be accommodated by Israel. However, if Israel does not respond to the threats, the scenario is that Europe will escalate its actions on all levels, including raising the cover on Netanyahu, imposing economic sanctions, and possibly banning goods. In addition, countries may take security measures, which would be the most significant, including banning the export of arms to Israel, which would affect the performance of the Israeli army in the ongoing war. According to expert Anton Shalhat, the current crisis is a result of Netanyahu's policies, and if he does not change course, the scenario is that Europe will take more severe actions, including imposing sanctions and possibly banning goods. He notes that the European position is crucial for Israel, and if it is not taken seriously, it will lead to a crisis in the relations between Israel and Europe.

**EU Reconsiders Israel Trade Deal Amid Gaza War Crimes Accusations**
The European Union (EU) is reconsidering its trade deal with Israel due to allegations of war crimes in Gaza. The EU has issued strong statements and threatened sanctions, including the potential suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. The agreement currently gives Israel privileged access to the EU's largest single market. The review focuses on whether Israel is violating Article 2 of the agreement, which defines human rights as an 'essential element'. If the review concludes that Israel has indeed violated Article 2, EU ministers will decide next steps, potentially suspending the agreement or key parts of it. This could impose real economic costs on Israel through higher tariffs and restricted market access. The EU is Israel's largest trading partner, accounting for 32% of Israel's total trade. Reaching a qualified majority to suspend preferential access is still challenging, but pressure is growing, and suspension remains a real possibility if Israel does not radically change course.

**Europe's Interest in Imposing Sanctions on Israel**
Martin Sandbu, an economic commentator for the Financial Times, believes that it is in Europe's interest to impose sanctions on Israel. He argues that limiting trade and travel, and freezing foreign reserves, would show the EU's willingness to act independently of the US. Sandbu notes that in recent weeks, EU foreign ministers have called for a review of the Israel-EU partnership agreement, the UK has suspended trade talks, Norway's sovereign wealth fund has blacklisted an Israeli company to facilitate the delivery of energy to West Bank settlements, and French, British, and Canadian leaders have threatened to impose sanctions on Israel. Even Germany, Israel's strongest supporter in Europe, has criticized its behavior. Sandbu says that it is possible that some people may think that Israel has the right to wage war on Hamas in Gaza, but that this right has been exceeded for a long time. He notes that the UN has found clear evidence of Israeli war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza, and of the increasing and brutal occupation of the West Bank. Sandbu emphasizes that it is time for Europe to clarify how to impose sanctions on Israel, and to develop its own policies on sanctions. He notes that if European countries choose to impose sanctions, they will have to do so without the US. Therefore, it is time to identify areas where European sanctions alone (or with any other willing allies) would have the greatest impact on Israel. Sandbu believes that financial and economic sanctions would be ineffective, as the US could easily repeat any payment and financing channels. However, there is one exception: freezing foreign reserves, as done by the West against Russia, would impose an economic cost. Sandbu notes that the Bank of Israel invests about a quarter of its large reserves in Europe, which could be frozen and used over time to pay any compensation owed to Palestinians. He believes that trade and travel restrictions would have a greater impact. Israel imports about half of its goods from Europe and sends more than a third of its exports to the continent, according to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics. A significant portion of the imports comes from fuel, which is a trade that Europe has significant influence over due to its dominance in shipping services. Also, a quarter of Israel's large trade in services is also with European markets. Restrictions on business and tourism services would be devastating. Sandbu emphasizes that the readiness to impose sanctions is important, going beyond the immediate moral and political need to respond to international law violations. The EU, in particular, needs to improve its decision-making process on sanctions, which it has taken strong measures against Russia due to its war on Ukraine despite political disagreements and claims of legal uncertainty. In conclusion, Sandbu says that by showing its readiness to act against Israel if it chooses to do so, the EU will demonstrate its readiness to act against any serious violations of international law by any party. The legal coherence, credibility, and incentives for respecting EU red lines will be enhanced by the sanctions, and the threats of sanctions will be more effective and warn of the consequences of crossing them.

**Who Supplies Israel with Arms?**
Spain has called on European countries to suspend arms supplies to Israel due to its actions in the Gaza Strip. 'We all need to agree on a joint embargo. The last thing the Middle East needs now is more arms,' said Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albarès before the 'Madrid Group' conference, which included Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Morocco, and Brazil, as well as several intergovernmental organizations. However, most arms supplies to Israel come from three countries: the US, Germany, and Italy. Israel is also one of the world's largest exporters of arms, so it has a significant stockpile of its own. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Israel is the 15th largest importer of arms in the world, despite being actively involved in the conflict. The US is the largest supplier of arms to Israel, with shipments accounting for around two-thirds of Israel's military imports from 2020 to 2024, according to SIPRI. This includes aircraft, tanks, and guided missiles. Israel has historically been the largest recipient of US aid, receiving $228 billion (200 billion euros) in military support from Washington between 1946 and 2024. According to existing agreements, Israel will receive an additional $3.8 billion by 2028, with most of these funds to be spent on purchasing American military equipment and services, according to the US Council on Foreign Relations. It is unlikely that the US will change its policy, as attempts by independent Senator Bernie Sanders to stop the multi-billion-dollar military aid to Tel Aviv were rejected by the US Senate in both November 2024 and April 2025. Germany has also long provided Israel with diplomatic and military aid. From 2020 to 2024, Germany accounted for around a third of arms supplies to Israel, mainly consisting of naval frigates and torpedoes, as well as tanks, trucks, anti-tank weapons, and ammunition. This course is unlikely to change, despite Spain's calls for an embargo. However, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated on May 26 that he 'no longer understands' the purpose of Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip and that Israel's actions 'can no longer be justified by the fight against Hamas.' The next day, the head of the German Foreign Ministry, Johann Wadephul, also joined in the criticism, saying in an interview with WDR: 'Our resolute fight against anti-Semitism and our full support for the right to exist and security of the State of Israel should not be used in the interests of the conflict and war that is currently being waged in the Gaza Strip.' Despite this, any future restriction on German arms supplies to Israel would be a significant event. According to official statistics, in 2024, Germany supplied arms worth over 131 million euros, and in 2023, it was 326 million euros. Italian arms make up around 1% of Israel's military imports. However, Italian laws prohibit the state from selling arms to conflict zones. The Italian government has criticized Israel's actions, but according to last year's reports, Rome continued to supply Israel with arms after the start of military operations in October 2023. In the last quarter of that year, arms worth 2.1 million euros were sold, and in 2024, it was 5.2 million euros. Some European countries have either stopped or suspended arms exports. These include France, Spain, and the UK, although their contribution is less than 0.1% of the total volume of supplies to Israel. However, British trade statistics, cited by The Guardian in May, showed that the country sent thousands of military goods to Israel, despite a ban on exports.

**Israel Between Europe and Itself: An Identity Crisis at the Heart of the Western Alliance**
The European Union has taken a significant diplomatic stance against Israel, with Britain suspending talks on a new free trade agreement and France openly supporting a review of the EU-Israel partnership. The EU's High Representative, Josep Borrell, has stated that there is sufficient support for a proposal to put the future of the agreement with Israel up for discussion. This move is seen as a significant shift in the EU's relationship with Israel, with some countries that have traditionally supported Israel without condition, such as Germany, Hungary, and Poland, now criticizing its government. The German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has expressed his concerns about the current government's actions. The EU's stance is not just a reaction to Israel's actions in Gaza, but also a response to the country's drift towards a 'national-religious' identity that is closed to Western liberal values. The EU is trying to correct this drift and maintain Israel's liberal, Jewish, and Western identity. The US has been silent on the EU's move, but this silence is seen as a deliberate attempt to let the EU take the lead in pressuring Israel. The EU's move is not just symbolic, but also has significant implications for Israel's economy and politics. The EU is Israel's largest trading partner, and any changes to their partnership or the threat of its cancellation would be a significant blow to Israel's economy. The EU's recognition of a Palestinian state would also be a significant blow to Israel's legitimacy and would reframe the Palestinian issue as a priority for the international community. The EU's move has sparked different reactions within Israel, with some seeing it as a conspiracy to overthrow the government, while others see it as a sign of the government's failure to maintain Israel's liberal identity. The EU's move has also sparked a debate within Israel about its relationship with the EU and its place within the Western liberal order. The question remains: will the EU's move lead to a stop in the war on Gaza and the failure of plans to expel Palestinians, or is the EU's ultimate goal to save the Israeli project from its new extremist leaders?

**Escalating European Criticism of Israel's Violence in Gaza**
The European criticism of Israel's violence in Gaza is escalating, with France joining Spain in proposing sanctions against Netanyahu. The Italian region of Emilia-Romagna has also cut ties with Israel, and the city of Barcelona has severed all institutional relations with the Israeli government. The mayor of Barcelona, Jaume Collboni, said that 'any relationship' between the city and Israel is 'not possible' due to the 'extreme violence' and 'genocide' in Gaza. The city council of Barcelona has also cut ties with the Israeli government, citing the need to 'respect international law and human rights'. In addition, a street art display in Lisbon, Portugal, has highlighted the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with children's toys and clothes forming a poignant representation of the suffering of Palestinian children. According to the UN, over 50,000 children in Gaza have been killed or injured since the start of the war, making it one of the most devastating conflicts in the region's history. The Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, has called on Israel to end its attack on Gaza, saying 'enough war now', and the Spanish foreign minister, Manuel Albárez, has also proposed sanctions against Israel. French President Emmanuel Macron has called for 'strengthening' the EU's stance on Israel if there is no 'satisfactory' response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and has proposed suspending the EU-Israel association agreement or even imposing sanctions. Macron has also reiterated the possibility of recognizing Palestine as a state, which he sees as a 'moral obligation' and a 'political necessity'.

**Europe's Shift on Israel: A Review of Commitment to EU-Israel Agreement**
The European Union has changed its stance on Israel, and a review of the country's commitment to the EU-Israel Association Agreement is underway. The agreement includes clear standards for human rights and democratic principles. French President Emmanuel Macron recently stated, 'If there is no response that matches the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe in the coming days, it is clear that the collective position (of the EU) must be tightened, and what we have committed to must be applied, namely, putting an end to (the agreement) that requires respect for human rights, which is not happening now, and applying sanctions.' This move is a culmination of a long period of European unease with Israel's policies in the occupied Palestinian territories. Despite the EU's previous reluctance to take action, the recent statements from European leaders, including a formal announcement by EU Foreign Policy Chief Kaya Kalas, have marked a significant shift in the EU's stance. The review of Israel's commitment to the agreement is a critical step towards holding Israel accountable for its actions. However, the EU's ability to take concrete action is hindered by the need for consensus among its member states, which is increasingly difficult to achieve due to the rise of far-right parties in several European countries. In the background, there are deeper changes in the global balance of power, with the United States, Israel's traditional ally, now acting without a clear direction in defining friends and enemies. This uncertainty is reflected in the actions of US allies in the Middle East, who have found themselves often on the receiving end of US decisions. Amidst this complex landscape, Iran remains a key player in the US's calculations, with Washington seeking to contain rather than confront it. As a result, the issue is no longer about slogans or rhetoric, but about reading the moment and responding with calm and balance. Some countries in the Middle East are emerging as models of states that do not get carried away with the wave, but rather read and analyze it, and move accordingly, recognizing that managing interests requires cool nerves and flexible tools, not high-flying slogans or loud postures.

**EU Raises Red Card Against Israel, Threatens Sanctions and Recognition of Palestinian State**
The European Union has raised the red card against Israel, imposing penalties and acknowledging the Palestinian state. The EU has announced that it will review the association agreement with Israel, which has been in place since 1995. The agreement is a framework for relations between the two parties and regulates trade, cooperation, and other areas. The EU has also threatened to impose sanctions on Israel if it does not stop its war on Gaza. The move has been seen as a significant escalation of the crisis and has been met with strong reactions from Israel. The Israeli government has accused the EU of hypocrisy and has warned that the move will have severe consequences for Israel's economy and international relations. The EU has also announced that it will consider recognizing the Palestinian state, which would be a major blow to Israel's international standing. The move has been seen as a significant shift in the EU's policy towards Israel and has been welcomed by the Palestinian leadership. The EU's decision has been met with mixed reactions from other countries, with some expressing support and others criticizing the move. The situation remains highly volatile and it is unclear what the future holds for Israel and the EU.

**Europe Calls for Stronger Actions Against Israel, Including Economic Sanctions**
European countries are calling for stronger actions against Israel, including imposing economic sanctions, in an effort to pressure Tel Aviv to stop its military operations and create a political solution. Some voices are calling for a ban on arms sales to Israel, as well as targeted economic sanctions against officials who hinder peace efforts. This move is a rare change in the European stance on the crisis. The calls come as several European countries, including Spain, France, and the UK, are reviewing their trade agreements with Israel, amid growing concern over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Spain has recently called for a 'ban on arms sales to the Israeli government to end the war in Gaza', during a meeting of the Madrid Group in the Spanish capital. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albaras proposed targeted sanctions against individuals 'who hinder the two-state solution'. He said, 'We must all agree on a common ban on arms', adding, 'The Middle East does not need arms now'. He also announced that Spain will propose suspending the EU-Israel trade agreement, which is currently being reviewed in Brussels. According to a report by Deutsche Welle, Spain, one of the strongest critics of Israel in the EU, which angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year when it officially recognized Palestine as a state, has also been joined by Ireland, Slovenia, and Norway in recognizing Palestine in 2024. Albaras emphasized that 'nothing being discussed here is directed against the State of Israel', but added that 'the Palestinian people have the same right to peace and security as the Israeli people'. The recent meeting in Madrid came as several Western allies of Israel joined international calls for it to halt its military operations. In addition to the Spanish position, France has also expressed its readiness to impose further national sanctions on Israel, saying that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is unbearable. French Foreign Ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine said in a press conference: 'We will not hesitate to take further action, including imposing targeted sanctions'. He added that they are 'prepared' to take 'concrete actions' if Israel continues its attack on Gaza, and that 'nothing is ruled out' in terms of sanctions, although he added that these sanctions will be discussed at the 'European level'. The UK, Canada, and France have joined the French position. The leaders of the three countries issued a joint statement on the situation in Gaza and the West Bank, saying that they oppose any attempt to expand settlements in the West Bank, and that 'Israel must stop building illegal settlements that undermine the existence of the Palestinian state and the security of Israelis and Palestinians alike. We will not hesitate to take further action, including imposing targeted sanctions'. From London, economic expert Anwar Al-Qasim told Sky News Arabia that the European public opinion is moving forward significantly compared to the European political stance on the Israeli war on Gaza, and that this is evident in the European governments' response to the public's demands for imposing sanctions. He added: 'It is now clear that 17 EU countries have decided to review the agreement, as complete cancellation requires consensus, while parts of the agreement can be canceled by majority'. He pointed out that 'the American shield protecting Israel in international forums is currently receding in Europe, and can also recede in the United Nations'. He continued: 'After more than 19 months of war, the Netherlands, which has always been with Israel, has announced a red line against continuing its aggression, and has called for reviewing agreements with Israel. The leaders of France, Britain, and Canada have also raised the slogan 'enough', and announced their intention to examine imposing sanctions on Israel if it does not stop its war. Twenty-five Western countries have expressed their deep concern over the situation of the Palestinians in Gaza. In practice, Britain has frozen trade negotiations with Israel and imposed sanctions on settler leaders. Sweden has also announced its intention to impose sanctions on Israeli ministers, particularly advocates of starvation and displacement. He added: 'If the principle of 'reviewing' is adopted, it does not only put at risk the most important trade agreements of the Israeli state, which are worth around 50 billion euros annually, but it also puts a question mark on all other agreements between Israel and European countries. A report by The Washington Post notes that:

**Is Europe Finally Shifting its Stance on Israel?**
According to Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, the European stance on Israel may be shifting. Lovatt notes that European governments strongly backed Israel after the Oct. 7 attacks, but have since grown increasingly alarmed by its mass violence against Gaza's civilians. This frustration has been compounded by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's obstruction of international diplomacy and rejection of a two-state solution. Lovatt argues that European pressure and the threat of sanctions are necessary to demonstrate to Israelis that ethnic cleansing and annexation of Palestinian territory come with real costs. He believes that the aim of European policy should be to shift the Israeli public's calculations away from perpetual domination over Palestinians and towards acceptance of de-occupation, which is the only viable means of securing a sustainable future based on mutual equality and security.

**EU to Review Association Agreement with Israel Amid Gaza Crisis**
The European Union (EU) will review the Association Agreement with Israel, following a request from over a dozen countries, including Spain, due to Israel's systematic violations of international law in its war against Gaza, announced EU High Representative Kaja Kallas on Tuesday. 'Pressure is necessary to change the situation,' Kallas said in a press conference after the meeting, criticizing Israel's blockade of humanitarian aid in Gaza. 'It's clear after today's meeting that there is a large majority of countries in favor of reviewing Article 2 of our Association Agreement with Israel, so we will start this exercise,' added the Estonian, emphasizing that this shows that more governments see the situation in Gaza as unsustainable. 'It's Israel's responsibility to unblock humanitarian aid. Saving lives must be our priority,' she underscored. Countries such as the Netherlands, with the support of a dozen other countries, had requested the move, a year after Spain and Ireland made the same request. In total, 17 countries joined the request on Tuesday. 'The European Union must act and must act with all its instruments at hand to put all its diplomatic pressure on Israel and put an end to this war, which allows humanitarian aid to enter without any obstacles,' said Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares on Tuesday in Brussels. 'We have to tell the Israelis that there are situations for which we no longer find words, no justification, no excuses,' said Luxembourg Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel. 'It's time to tell Israel that we won't stay quiet and won't close our eyes,' he added, joining the request to review the agreement. The initiative was initially presented by Spain and Ireland a year ago, but barely had any support. However, the situation in Gaza and Brussels has changed. With a notably larger group of countries behind the proposal, the Commission will have to react or explain to the majority why it doesn't, a diplomatic source pointed out before the meeting.

**EU Considers Reevaluating Association Agreement with Israel**
The European Union is considering reevaluating its association agreement with Israel due to the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. The agreement, which has been in place since 2000, has been criticized for not doing enough to address the situation. EU foreign ministers, led by Estonia's Kaja Kallas, have called for a review of the agreement, with 17 out of 27 member states supporting the move. Germany, however, has chosen not to join the effort, citing a desire to keep all channels of communication open. Kallas described the situation in Gaza as 'catastrophic' and called on Israel to lift its blockade on humanitarian aid. The move could have significant consequences for Israel, which relies heavily on trade with the EU, with exports to the bloc totaling 42.6 billion euros in recent years. As Kallas put it, 'Israel should use this time to completely lift the blockade of humanitarian aid for Gaza.'

**EU Increases Diplomatic Pressure on Israel Over Gaza Destruction**
The European Union has increased its diplomatic pressure on Israel over its decision to completely destroy the Gaza Strip, but taking concrete action is proving difficult. A dozen European countries, including Spain, Ireland, and Belgium, have joined the Netherlands in calling for a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, which was first proposed over a year ago. The EU's foreign ministers will discuss the proposal on Tuesday in Brussels, with Irish Minister Neale Richmond stating, 'The momentum is growing.' However, the EU's high representative, Kaja Kallas, and the European Commission have not yet commented on the proposal, awaiting the outcome of the meeting. EU leaders, including President Ursula von der Leyen and President of the European Council António Costa, have condemned the situation in Gaza, with Costa stating, 'Israel must stop now.' The EU's goal is to pressure Israel to respect international law and human rights, but a decision to suspend relations or break preferential agreements would require a level of support that currently does not exist.

**EU to Discuss Revising Agreement with Israel Amid Gaza Crisis**
The European Union is set to discuss revising its agreement with Israel, following a request from Spain and Ireland due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The agreement, which has been in place since 2000, has been criticized for not addressing human rights concerns. The EU has been under pressure to take action, with several member states, including France, Sweden, and the Netherlands, calling for a review of the agreement. The Spanish government had initially requested a review of the agreement in February 2024, citing the 'insostenible' war in Gaza. Since then, several other countries have joined the call, including Portugal, Finland, Slovenia, Malta, Luxembourg, and Belgium. However, a veto from countries like Hungary and Germany could block any potential changes to the agreement. The EU's High Representative, Kaja Kallas, has expressed support for the International Court of Justice's ruling that Israel is committing acts of genocide in Gaza. The EU has also called for Israel to respect human rights and international humanitarian law. The situation in Gaza has been described as 'catastrophic' by the Dutch Foreign Minister, Caspar Veldkamp, who has called for a 'line in the sand' to be drawn. France has also increased its criticism of Israel, with President Emmanuel Macron announcing plans to recognize the State of Palestine. The EU's next step will be to discuss the agreement at a meeting on May 20, where a decision on whether to suspend or revise the agreement will be made. 'Any decision to suspend the Association Agreement or part of it would require the unanimity of the Council,' a spokesperson for the European Commission said. 'The pressure from the EU and the threat of sanctions - also from Israel - has been the reason that has led the Israeli Foreign Minister, Gideon Sa'ar, to announce the decision to allow basic food into Gaza to avoid a humanitarian crisis,' according to the Israeli newspaper Kan. 'The EU is deeply concerned about the number of civilian casualties, especially women and children,' the EU's High Representative said in a statement. 'We urge Israel to respect international humanitarian law and to take immediate and effective measures to protect the Palestinian population in the occupied Gaza Strip from the risk of genocide.' The EU has also expressed support for the International Criminal Court's request for the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'We are monitoring the situation closely and will evaluate the consequences,' an Israeli government spokesperson said. The EU's next move will depend on the outcome of the meeting on May 20. 'We will see if the re-establishment of some humanitarian aid to Gaza will calm the European mood or if we have already passed the point of no return,' a source close to the Israeli government said. 'We will also see if there will be consensus to convince Hungary, as we did in the case of Russia,' the source added.

**Lithuania's Kestutis Budris: Ukraine Can Join EU Before 2030**
Lithuania's Foreign Minister Kestutis Budris believes that Ukraine can join the European Union before 2030, with 2030 being the 'ultimate deadline'. According to Budris, setting this deadline will help establish a timeline for other important decisions that need to be made. However, he also expressed confidence that Ukraine can achieve this goal sooner. 'We believe you will be able to do it by 2030. That's why we are so committed to this, because you inspire us with your dedication and motivation,' Budris said.

**Nauseda: Ukraine May Join EU Before Western Balkan Countries by 2030**
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda stated that Ukraine may join the European Union before Western Balkan countries, potentially becoming a member by 2030. Nauseda made this statement upon arriving at the European Union summit in Brussels on Thursday, March 20. According to 24 Kanal, citing Politico, Nauseda said, 'If Ukraine can complete all the necessary requirements before 2030, and Western Balkan countries are lagging behind, then everything is possible. It depends on the will, it depends on the benevolence, and we see that the benevolence of our Ukrainian friends is very high.' Nauseda also mentioned that Lithuania is preparing for a possible Russian attack on NATO countries by 2030, planning to create a national division with necessary infrastructure. He stated that Lithuania and other NATO member countries will actively develop divisions to counter potential armed aggression over the next 4-5 years, and that lifting sanctions against Moscow could shorten the preparation time.

**Israeli strikes have reignited Gaza—now Europeans must take action**
The recent Israeli strikes in Gaza have reignited the conflict, and European governments and the EU must take action to oppose the Israeli government's 'destabilising and politically-motivated war'. According to the European Council on Foreign Relations, after one-and-a-half years, Israel can make no further military gains, and a diplomatic track is needed to release all hostages and end Hamas's governance and security control over Gaza. The EU-Israel Association Agreement and the ICC arrest warrant must be enforced to prevent further escalation. As the European Council on Foreign Relations notes, 'The European Council on Foreign Relations does not take collective positions. ECFR publications only represent the views of their individual authors.'

**Israel and EU Seek Future of Gaza Amid Divided EU**
Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid will meet with senior European officials in Brussels on Monday to revive dialogue with the European Union, as the bloc considers its role in rebuilding Gaza after last month's ceasefire agreement. The meeting marks the first time since 2022 that the Israeli and European sides have sat down together. The talks will focus on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, Israeli-Palestinian relations, and developments in the Middle East. According to Israeli Ambassador to the EU Hayim Regev, 'This meeting represents a significant opportunity to reaffirm and strengthen the partnership between Israel and the European Union.' The Gaza war exposed deep divisions within the EU, with some member states condemning Hamas' attacks while others strongly defended Israel's actions against the Gaza Strip. Some EU leaders have also called for a review of Israel's compliance with human rights obligations under the 2000 EU-Israel Partnership Agreement. However, before the meeting, EU member states discussed taking a middle ground stance that praises areas of cooperation with Israel while also expressing concerns. According to a draft document seen by Reuters, the EU will reaffirm its commitment to Israel's security and express its 'need to ensure the safe and dignified return of displaced Palestinians from Gaza to their homes.'

**EU Staff Protest Upcoming EU-Israel Partnership Council Meeting**
Around 100 European Union staff members gathered in front of the EU Commission building to protest the upcoming EU-Israel Partnership Council Meeting on February 24. The staff members, who have previously come together to protest the EU's silence on Israel's genocide in Gaza, are now protesting the meeting. They held signs that read 'EU staff are for peace and justice', 'Ceasefire now', 'Stop impunity', 'Respect the rights of Palestinians', and 'End the Israeli occupation'. Claudio Francavilla, the EU Director of Human Rights Watch, joined the staff members and said, 'It is unsustainable to continue working with a government led by a prime minister who has a warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court.' Francavilla called for the EU to stop trade with illegal settlements, support the UNRWA's activities, and end the apartheid in Israel. John Doyle, an EU staff member, said, 'We came together to show solidarity with the people of Gaza, West Bank, and Lebanon against Israel.' Doyle referred to the EU-Israel Partnership Council's founding agreement and said that the agreement's second article binds the continuation of the agreement to respect for human rights and international law, and that the agreement should be terminated due to Israel's genocide, ethnic cleansing, and massacres. Doyle described the meeting as 'Shameful. Clearly a partnership in crime.' The EU-Israel Partnership Council Meeting will take place on February 24, with EU High Representative Kaja Kallas and Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar co-chairing the meeting. The meeting will also be attended by EU Commissioner Dubravka Suica and representatives of EU member states. Some member states, including Ireland and Spain, are calling for the EU to terminate the Partnership Council Agreement due to the 'respect for human rights and international law' clause in the agreement.
