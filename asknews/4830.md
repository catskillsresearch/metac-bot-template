**10 Trends That Will Shape the Future of Food by 2050**
By 2050, the world's food system will be under pressure due to the need to reach net-zero emissions and a projected global population of over 10 billion people. To reduce food waste, companies will need to rethink the food chain. According to food futurists Morgaine Gaye and Joseph Poore, there will be 10 key trends in food production, consumption, and preparation. These include: 1) 'community meals' where food is shared and valued for its emotional and relational aspects; 2) the end of weekly grocery shopping, replaced by AI-powered meal planning and home delivery; 3) clothing that can grow food, such as shirts with built-in gardens; 4) urban agriculture, with shared gardens, vertical farming, and local food systems; 5) food that absorbs CO2, such as seaweed and shellfish; 6) AI-powered food planning to reduce waste and use 'imperfect' fruits and vegetables; 7) climate-resilient crops, such as quinoa and soy in northern Europe; 8) a return to ancient crops, such as sorrel and dandelion; 9) 'niche' crops, such as teff and fonio, becoming mainstream; 10) personalized nutrition, with AI-powered meal planning to prevent disease. According to Poore, 'it's likely that our diet in 2050 will be significantly different from what we have today, although not necessarily in the ways we expect.' Gaye added, 'in the future, we will see significant changes in our daily habits and food models.'

**Europe's Aging Population: A Growing Concern**
The median age in Europe has reached 44.7 years, with some countries, such as Italy, already exceeding 48.7 years. According to Eurostat, the population of the EU will begin to decline in 2026, with a projected decrease of 50 million people by 2100. The main cause of this demographic shift is the decline in fertility rates, which have fallen below the replacement level. In 2023, the global fertility rate in the EU was 1.38 children per woman, down from 1.44 in 2003 and below the replacement level of 2.1. Eurostat estimates that the proportion of people aged 65 or older will increase from 21.6% in 2024 to 32.5% in 2100, while the proportion of people aged 80 or older will multiply by 2.5, from 6% to 15%. The tasa de dependencia, which measures the relationship between the number of young people and those of older age, will tend to worsen, with a projected ratio of two people in work for every one dependent in 2024. As stated by Eurostat, 'the process of aging is so accelerated, linked to the increases in longevity, that Eurostat predicts that the proportion of people aged 80 or more in the population of the EU will multiply by 2.5 between 2024 and 2100, passing from 6% to 15%.'

**Korea's birth crisis far from over**
South Korea's total fertility rate reached 0.82 in the first quarter of 2025, a 7.4% year-on-year increase, the highest since records began in 1981. Experts are cautiously optimistic, but warn that even if the government's target of a 1.0 fertility rate by 2030 is met, Korea would still be at the bottom globally in terms of fertility. The prolonged low birthrate has eroded the population of people capable of having children, and an increase in fertility rates may not translate into more births due to a smaller base population of parents. According to Statistics Korea, even under the agency's high-fertility projection scenario, the national population will fall to the 30-million range within 45 years. Complacency is not an option, and a fertility rate must rise to two or three children per woman to avoid a shrinking society. 'We must remember that we have merely bought a little more time to prepare for the demographic shock ahead,' said a warning from the article.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**The Invention of the Fourth and Fifth Age**
The concept of the fourth and fifth age is emerging as the global population ages. According to the World Health Organization, in 2020, the population over 60 surpassed that of children under 5 for the first time. By 2050, there will be over 2 billion people over 60 worldwide. In the US, centenarians are expected to quadruple in the next three decades. Harvard researcher David Sinclair predicts that the first person to live to 150 is already alive, and that advances in AI will accelerate discoveries and help find cures for complex diseases. However, there is a lack of thought and writing on how new older adults will adopt new customs, what social rules they will establish, and how they will differ from each other. Journalist Dariela Sosa has launched an investigation into this topic, asking questions such as how families with four or five generations will function, and how inheritances will be transferred between generations. The concept of retirement may also be replaced by new rhythms of work, pause, and re-invention. The invention of the fourth and fifth age is underway, and we are creating a new universe of ideas, objects, and interpretations.

**'Great Death'... Elon Musk Comments on Decline of Fertility Rates in Europe**
Elon Musk has commented on the decline of fertility rates in Europe, calling it 'the greatest threat to humanity's civilization'. He shared a graph showing the low fertility rates in most European countries, with only a few countries like Moldova and France showing slightly better rates. Musk also compared the population of Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority country, to Russia, a non-Muslim country, despite their vastly different land areas. The global fertility rate has been declining since 1950, and is expected to continue declining until the end of the century, leading to a deep demographic shift. According to a UN report, the global fertility rate has decreased from 4.84 in 1950 to 2.23 in 2021, and is expected to decrease to 1.59 by 2100. The UN also predicts that the world's population will continue to grow for several more decades, reaching 8.5 billion by 2030 and 9.7 billion by 2050.

**Muslim population to surge by 1161780000 in 2050, Islam to become..., India will be...**
A new study by the Pew Research Center predicts that the global Muslim population will surge by 70% in the next 35 years, breaching the 3 billion mark by 2060. This will make Islam the dominant faith globally, surpassing Christianity as the world's largest religion. The study attributes this growth to a young population, high fertility rate, and religious conversion. According to the report, Muslim women have a fertility rate of 3.1, the highest among religious groups. In developing countries, the fertility rate is high and mortality rate is low, leading to rapid population growth. India's Muslim population is expected to increase to 19.4% by 2060, with an estimated 33 crore Muslims by 2050. The Christian population is expected to increase by 34%, while the Hindu population will grow by 27%, below the global average.

**Global Population Growth Slows Down: What's Behind the Decline?**
The world's population growth has slowed down significantly over the past few decades, according to IFLScience. The population has reached 8 billion people in 2024, but the UN predicts that the growth rate will slow down significantly in the next 60 years, adding only 2 billion people. By the 2080s, the population is expected to reach 10.3 billion, and by the end of the century, it will decrease to 10.2 billion. The probability of the population reaching its peak by 2100 is estimated to be 80%. This is largely due to a sharp decline in fertility rates. In most countries, the fertility rate is below the critical threshold of 2.1 children per woman. In fact, over 20% of countries have a 'below-replacement fertility rate', where a woman has fewer than 1.4 children. China, which was once the most populous country, is also experiencing a decline in population. According to forecasts, the population of these countries will decrease by approximately 14% from now until 2054. The decline in fertility rates can be attributed to the demographic transition phenomenon, where women have fewer children as societies become more industrialized. This is due to increased opportunities for women's career growth, leading to delayed family formation. Additionally, lower child mortality rates and reduced need for large families for agricultural work contribute to lower fertility rates. In combination with increasing life expectancy, this decline in fertility can significantly alter the demographic composition of the population, with people over 60 years old making up an increasingly large proportion. By 2070, people over 60 are expected to outnumber those under 18.

**World Population Growth Slows Down: A New Era of Decline?**
The world's population growth has significantly slowed down in recent years. According to iflscience.com, the population in many countries has reached its peak and is expected to decline by the end of the century. In 2024, the planet reached a new milestone, becoming home to 8 billion people. However, according to the latest UN forecasts, population growth is slowing down, and over the next 60 years, there will be an additional 2 billion people. Experts predict that by the 2080s, the population will reach 10.3 billion, and by the end of the century, it will decrease to 10.2 billion. The likelihood of the world's population peaking before 2100 is 80%. The main reason for this change is the significant decline in the birth rate, which reflects the number of children born to each woman. To maintain a stable population, the birth rate should be around 2.1. However, in more than half of the countries, this indicator is below the critical threshold. In fact, almost a fifth of all countries now have 'ultralow fertility', with less than 1.4 births per woman. China, which was once the most populous country in the world, is also part of this group. Along with Russia, Japan, and more than 60 other countries, China has already passed the peak and is moving towards a decline in population. It is expected that by 2054, the population in these countries will decrease by about 14%. While many factors influence the birth rate, experts believe that the main explanation for this global decline is the phenomenon known as the demographic transition. In more industrialized countries, women often decide to have children later, as they have new career opportunities, and the decrease in child mortality and the need for large families for work also contribute to a decrease in the number of births. When combined with the constantly increasing life expectancy, a decrease in fertility can significantly change the demographic composition of the population, resulting in older people making up a larger part of society. In addition to the predicted overall decline in population growth, statistics predict that by 2070, the number of people over 65 will exceed the number of children under 18.

**Decline in Fertility Rates: A New Challenge for the World's Population**
The world's population is expected to reach 8 billion in 2024, but this growth is expected to slow down significantly in the coming decades, according to the United Nations. The main reason for this slowdown is the decline in fertility rates among women. According to statistics, the world's population is expected to reach 10.3 billion by the 2080s, before starting to decline to 10.2 billion by the end of the century. The likelihood of reaching the peak population growth before 2100 has increased to 80%, up from 30% just a decade ago. The main reason for this slowdown is the decline in fertility rates, which is the number of births per woman. Any country needs a fertility rate of 2.1 to maintain a stable population. However, more than half of the world's countries are now below this threshold, and about a quarter of them are classified as having 'very low fertility', with rates below 1.4 births per woman. China, which was until recently the world's most populous country, is among these countries, along with Russia, Japan, and more than 60 other countries. According to projections, the population of these countries will decline by 14% by 2054. This decline in birth rates is due to a phenomenon known as 'demographic transition', where birth rates tend to decline as societies progress in the path of industrialization and development. In more developed environments, women have more job opportunities, which leads them to delay their decision to have children. Additionally, the decline in child mortality rates and the reduction in the need to have large numbers of children to work in agriculture or family businesses have also contributed to this transition. This decline is accompanied by an increase in life expectancy, leading to a significant change in the population structure. It is expected that the number of people over 65 will exceed the number of people under 18 by 2070. This transition will reshape economies and societies around the world, imposing new challenges related to the labor market, retirement systems, and population policies in the coming decades.

**Global Population Growth Is Rapidly Declining - Here's Why**
According to the UN, the world's population growth has rapidly declined over the last few years, with many countries having already peaked and set to decline by the end of the century. Experts predict an 80% chance that the world population will peak before 2100, down from a 30% chance just a decade ago. The drastic reduction in fertility rates, which is below 2.1 in over half of all nations, is the main reason for this change. China, which was once the world's most populous country, has now surpassed its peak and is on the way down, with a predicted 14% decrease in population by 2054. The widespread drop-off in fertility rates can be largely explained by demographic transition, where women have fewer babies as nations become increasingly industrialized. This downturn in fertility rates, combined with increasing life expectancy, will fundamentally shift the demographic make-up of a population, with older people outnumbering under 18s by around 2070.

**Charted: When Every Continent’s Population Will Peak This Century**
According to UN estimates, the global population is expected to peak at 10.3 billion in 2084 and then begin to decline. However, some regions will hit their peak much sooner. Europe has already peaked in 2020 at 750 million people, while Asia and Latin America will reach their peaks in the 2050s. Africa, Northern America, and Oceania will continue to grow slowly past 2100. The difference in peak population years is due to fertility rates and migration patterns. European countries have low fertility rates, while many African nations have high fertility rates, leading to a growing population. International migration into Northern America and Oceania will help offset declining birth rates until 2100. However, these estimates are based on current assumptions and can change drastically in the future.

According to the United Nations World Fertility Report 2024, Pakistan's fertility rate has declined significantly over the past three decades, dropping from 6 live births per woman in 1994 to 3.6 in 2024. Despite this decline, Pakistan is still on track to become the third-most populous nation by 2050, surpassing the United States, Indonesia, Brazil, and Russia. The UN projects that Pakistan's population will exceed 380 million by 2050, with a fertility rate expected to decline further to 2.5 by 2054. The report highlights the need for measures such as ending child marriages, improving access to sexual and reproductive healthcare, and enhancing maternal care for young mothers. 'Reducing growth in the numbers of live births in the future would allow governments and families to allocate resources more efficiently to invest in children and adolescent health and well-being,' the report said.

**World Population Growth Slows Down, According to UN Report**
According to a report by the United Nations, the world's population is growing at a slower rate than previously predicted. The population is expected to reach 10.8 billion by the end of the century, 200 million fewer than previously forecast. The growth rate of the population is slowing down, with the number of people on Earth growing at its annual rate since 1950. By 2030, the population could reach 8.5 billion, and by 2050, it will reach 9.7 billion. The peak population is expected to be 10.4 billion, which will be reached in the 2080s and will remain at that level until 2100. The key factor behind this slowdown is the decrease in fertility rates, with 61 countries experiencing a decline of 1% or more in fertility rates between 2022 and 2050. Additionally, more than half of the population growth expected by 2050 will be concentrated in eight countries: Egypt, Ethiopia, India, the Philippines, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the United Republic of Tanzania. The population in the working-age group (25-64 years) has been increasing due to recent reductions in fertility rates. As a result, the population is becoming more unevenly distributed across regions, with Africa being the main driver of population growth. This growth is expected to be a challenge to sustainable development, with the population aged 65 or older increasing from 10% in 2022 to 16% in 2050, coinciding with an increase in life expectancy.
