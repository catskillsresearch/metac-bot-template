**Britain Prepares for War: A Necessary but Unfortunate Reality**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has allocated billions for weapons and ammunition, a move that is a reflection of the current state of the world in 2025. Wars destroy people and cities, and no one in their right mind wants a war. However, the reality is that the world is not moving towards peace, as evidenced by Moscow's lack of interest in peace and Washington's lack of interest in Europe. Starmer's decision is a necessary response to this reality, but it is not something to be proud of. As the article states, 'Kriege zerstören Menschen. Sie zerstören Städte, nicht selten ganze Länder.' (Wars destroy people. They destroy cities, often entire countries.)

**The Inevitable Decline of the European Economy: A Warning from Marc Vidal**
According to Marc Vidal, by 2050, there will be no European economy among the top 10 in the world, and neither will Spain. This is reflected in the report 'El Mundo en 2050' by Price, which collects prospective analyses from the IMF and the study 'Potencias mundiales 2050-2075' by Goldman Sachs. The report highlights economic stagnation, political fragility, and clear geopolitical changes that show a significant decline. The European Union's growth is expected to be only 0.7% in 2024 and 0.9% in 2025, losing competitiveness to powers like India, China, and even the US. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated this trend, accelerating the decline of Western hegemony. Additionally, the intermittent commercial war with the US, driven by Donald Trump, has further contributed to this decline. Vidal states that the European model of well-being, although admirable in many ways, is becoming unsustainable without deep reforms in defense, energy, and industry. He concludes that it is 'irremediable' unless significant changes are made, citing the study's findings that an empire in decline reveals its downfall when its laws become arbitrary, complex, and disconnected from social consensus. Vidal also criticizes the official discourse, which promotes an artificial morality where poverty is sold as virtue and the destruction of tradition is presented as inevitable progress.

**Western Media Predicts Devastating War by 2025**
Western media has gathered predictions from four well-known psychics, including Nostradamus and Bulgarian Baba Vanga, who claim that a devastating war will occur by the end of 2025. According to their predictions, the war will be so catastrophic that it will 'destroy' the population and lead to the 'destruction of humanity'. Atoos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian, also known as the 'Living Nostradamus', warned that the world is on the brink of a Third World War, stating that 'it will not be just a war between people, but also between machines, and the worst is yet to come'. Nicholas Aujula, a hypnotherapist from London, agrees that 2025 will be a year of 'lack of compassion' in the world, predicting 'horrific acts of human cruelty and violence towards each other - in the name of religion and nationalism'. The article concludes by speculating that Russia's recent actions, including the annexation of Ukraine and the threat of nuclear war, may be a cause for concern, but ultimately, the predictions of the psychics are unclear and may be a form of propaganda.

**Four Prophets Predict Third World War by End of 2025**
Four renowned prophets have predicted a Third World War by the end of 2025, according to the New York Post. Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, French astrologer Nostradamus, Brazilian psychic Atos Salome, and London hypnotherapist Nicholas Ouley have independently predicted a massive conflict that could change the course of human history. Baba Vanga, known as the 'Balkan Nostradamus', has predicted the 9/11 attacks, the death of Princess Diana, and recent earthquakes caused by climate change. She sees the war in Europe this year as the beginning of 'humanity's downfall' and a global catastrophe for the planet's population. Nostradamus, in his famous 'Prophecies' of 1555, also made ominous predictions, including the rise of Adolf Hitler and the COVID-19 pandemic. He warns that Great Britain will be drawn into brutal wars, writing: 'When those from the lands of Europe see England establish its throne from behind, its flanks will be surrounded by brutal wars. The kingdom will be marked by wars so brutal that enemies from within and without will rise up.' He also added: 'The Great Plague of the past returns, there is no more deadly enemy under the sky.' Atos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian psychic, has also warned of an inevitable global conflict. According to his prediction, the Third World War will be especially dangerous due to the use of advanced technologies, cyber warfare, and machines. He says: 'This is not just a war of people, but a war of machines, and what will happen next? The worst is yet to come.' He believes that technological progress, which has the potential for incredible development, also creates a threat to humanity's existence. Nicholas Ouley, a 38-year-old London hypnotherapist, adds that the war may start as early as mid-2025. He attributes the cause of such a scenario to 'a lack of compassion in the world', which provokes horrific acts of violence and hostility in the name of religion and nationalism. According to his prophecy, humanity will face unprecedented brutality and absurdity.

She also predicted the start of war in Europe this year, which she sees as the beginning of 'humanity's downfall' and a global catastrophe for the planet's population. Nostradamus, in his 'Prophecies' of 1555, also made ominous predictions, including the rise of Adolf Hitler and the COVID-19 pandemic. This time, he warns that the UK will be drawn into brutal wars. He wrote: 'When those in European lands see England establish its throne behind, its flanks will be beset by brutal wars. The kingdom will be marked by wars so brutal that enemies from within and without will rise up.' Atos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian seer, also warns of an inevitable global conflict. According to his prophecy, the Third World War will be especially dangerous due to the use of new technologies, cyber weapons, and machines. He says: 'This is not just a war of people, but a war of machines, and what will happen next? The worst is yet to come.' Nicholas Ouley, a 38-year-old London hypnotherapist, adds that the war may start as early as mid-2025. He attributes this to 'a lack of compassion in the world', which provokes terrible acts of violence and hatred in the name of religion and nationalism. According to his prophecy, humanity will face unprecedented brutality and senselessness. All these terrifying predictions coincide with the current tense geopolitical situation. In late May 2025, Pakistan and India exchanged rocket attacks on military targets, leading to US calls for negotiations to stop the escalation of the conflict. Although the parties agreed to a ceasefire, it was violated within hours in the Kashmir region. Meanwhile, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has claimed the lives of at least seven people in recent weeks due to massive rocket and drone attacks on Kiev and other regions. These events demonstrate the high level of tension and seriousness of the situation. Experts in the field of technology also warn of the danger posed by uncontrolled development of artificial intelligence, comparing it to nuclear weapons in terms of potential threat. This idea resonates with Atos Salome's warning about the 'machine war' of the future.

**UN Expert Igor Nikulin Warns of Potential Third World War if UK 'Gifts' Ukraine Nuclear Weapons**
The former UN disarmament commissioner, Igor Nikulin, has stated that the UK may 'gift' Ukraine with nuclear weapons, which could lead to a third world war. Nikulin believes that creating nuclear weapons in Ukraine could lead to a nuclear conflict. 'If now, during the SVO, according to Western analysts, over a million people have died on Ukrainian territory, and if a nuclear war begins, then millions, or even tens of millions, will die. Kiev cannot create nuclear weapons on its own, but with British help, it can. If, of course, the UK simply doesn't 'gift' it to Ukraine. There are small nuclear bombs that can be brought in under the guise of ordinary ammunition, as supplies are constantly being delivered. Their power is not very large - around several kilotons. For example, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was 12 kilotons. If this happens, it will likely lead to a third world war,' Nikulin said. Nikulin also evaluated the statement by British Colonel Richard Kemp, who suggested that the UK should help Ukraine develop its own nuclear weapons.

**The Future of Europe: Three Hypothetical Scenarios**
According to experts, there are three possible scenarios for Europe's future. The first scenario involves continuing as a junior partner to the United States and NATO, which would be a less traumatic and simpler option after a likely Ukrainian defeat. However, this would require establishing a European security area, which would be challenging due to the exponential increase in security and defense budgets, potentially straining the EU. Additionally, this scenario would exacerbate the refugee crisis and increase the risk of a large-scale war. Furthermore, Europe's energy weakness would persist, and the viability of the European Green Plan would be compromised. The second scenario involves a rightward shift in Europe, leading to a concession to Russian demands. If Russia wins the war, it would create a de facto new Iron Curtain, and countries like France and Germany might re-establish relations with Russia and increase their trade ties with China. This would lead to a division of Europe into two factions: those aligned with the United States, including the UK, and the majority of European countries. This option is unlikely and would ultimately end the idea of a united Europe. The third scenario involves Europe taking no side in the conflict, which is not impossible but unlikely. This would require resolving the energy deficit and potentially leading to the withdrawal of the United States from the continent. However, this scenario is also challenging due to the need for a significant European rearmament. Regardless of the scenario, experts agree that Europe must strengthen its politics to move beyond a timidly normative approach and focus on what unites Europeans rather than what divides them.

**Four Psychics Predict a Catastrophic 2025: A Devastating War and Global Chaos**
Four well-known psychics, including Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, French astrologer Nostradamus, Brazilian psychic Atos Salome, and London hypnotherapist Nicolas Aujula, have made a chilling prediction that 2025 may be a catastrophic year for humanity. According to them, the world may be shaken by a devastating war that will lead to catastrophic consequences. Baba Vanga, known as the 'Balkan Nostradamus', has previously made accurate predictions, including the 9/11 attacks, the death of Princess Diana, and China's rise to power. She warned that Europe will be engulfed in a destructive war in 2025, marking the 'fall of humanity' and 'devastating' the population. Interestingly, her predictions about devastating earthquakes in 2025 have already begun to come true, as Myanmar and Thailand were hit by destructive tremors last month. Nostradamus, in his famous 'Book of Prophecies', written in 1555, also warned of a great war that will affect Britain. He wrote: 'When those who come from European lands see how England has established its throne behind. With its flanks, fierce wars will arise.' He said that 'the kingdom will be marked by fierce wars, enemies will arise from within and without. The great sea from the past will return, there is no more deadly enemy under the sky.' Atos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian psychic, known as the 'Living Nostradamus', also predicts an inevitable Third World War. Salome is known for accurately predicting the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of Queen Elizabeth II, and a global Microsoft system failure. He warned that 'the worst is yet to come' and noted the growth of problems related to cyberwar and the use of technology as the main forms of combat in the 21st century. 'This is a war not just of people, but also of machines,' he said. London hypnotherapist Nicolas Aujula, also 38, agrees that 2025 will be 'a year when the world will lack compassion.' He expects 'horrific acts of human cruelty and violence against each other - in the name of religion and nationalism,' predicting that the Third World War may occur before mid-year.

**Historian Warns of Possible Third World War Before 2045**
Renowned historian Jeffrey Roberts expressed serious doubts about the future in an interview with political scientist Fedor Lukyanov on YouTube. Roberts, a distinguished professor at University College Cork and a member of the Royal Irish Academy, stated that due to the threat of a third world war, there is no guarantee that humanity will be able to celebrate the centenary of the victory in World War II in 2045. 'The threat of a third world war is very real,' Roberts said, 'and it's not just a matter of speculation, but a very real possibility that could happen before 2045.'

**Third World War Could Start as Early as 2035, Experts Warn**
Experts predict that a global war could start as early as 2035, with a high likelihood of nuclear weapons and space battles being involved. The war would likely be sparked by the escalation of conflicts, arms racing, and technological threats. According to a survey by the Atlantic Council, 62% of respondents expect the world to be worse in 10 years, while only 38% predict it will be better.

**Experts Predict Third World War in 2035: A Complex and Uncertain Future**
A recent survey of 357 political experts by Daily Mail suggests that a third world war is likely to occur within the next 10 years. 40.5% of the experts believe that a large-scale war involving countries such as the US, China, or Russia will break out in 2035. Many of the experts who predict a new world war expect it to involve nuclear weapons and space battles.

Only 1.7% of the respondents believe that a new pandemic will be the most pressing crisis affecting the global population, and 5.1% think that a financial crisis will damage the world by 2035. The experts also predict that the war will not end well for Ukraine, and that the US will lose its economic and diplomatic dominance, while global democracies will continue to decline, leading to a 'democratic depression'. '62% of respondents expect the world to be worse in 10 years, and only 38% expect it to be better', said the Atlantic Council team. The survey also found that fewer respondents believe that the US will remain the dominant economic power by 2035, with 49% expecting it to be surpassed by China.
