**Argentina's Inflation Continues to Decelerate, but Risks Lurk**
Consulting firms have lowered their inflation estimates for May to around 2%, citing stability in the official and financial dollar, a decline in food and fuel prices, and reduced pressure from regulated prices. However, analysts warn that the calm may be fragile, with potential risks from the exchange rate and political context, including the upcoming October legislative elections. The risk of a debt default by the Central Bank of Argentina, fiscal adjustments, and a lack of solid agreements with the opposition could affect future expectations. The government aims to consolidate this trend of deceleration with fiscal control measures and structural reforms, but the next few months will be crucial to determine if the current relief is sustainable.

**Argentina's Inflation Conundrum: A 33-Year-Old Problem**
Thirty-three years ago, there were discussions about removing dollars from under the mattress and getting inflation down to 2% or starting at 1%. In April of that year, a Peronist government (Carlos Menem) announced a currency whitening and, on the same day, inflation was at 1.3%. These two topics are relevant in Argentina 2025. The current government will argue that comparisons with the 1990s are incorrect due to two key differences: a fixed exchange rate and fiscal imbalance. The first point is true. The second point is only partially true. In 1992, the dollar was pegged to the peso (convertibility regime), and there was a primary surplus (1.7% of GDP). However, it is true that after debt repayment, there was a slight deficit (0.4%). The fiscal balance would start to deteriorate after 1994 and definitively after the Tequila Effect of 1995.

**Argentina's Economic and Labor Balance After One Year of Javier Milei's Presidency**
The economic and labor balance after the first year of Javier Milei's presidency shows a strong recession, a decline in real wages, and an increase in informality. Between November 2023 and February 2025, the number of registered employees decreased by almost 182,000 (a 1.8% reduction). The contraction was concentrated in two key sectors: construction and industry, which explained 80% of the deterioration of formal employment in the private sector. The economic recovery began slowly after the second quarter of 2024, but in March 2025, economic activity fell 1.8% due to exchange rate tensions. The purchasing power of salaries also suffered a strong blow at the beginning of the new administration. Although there was a partial recovery driven by the deceleration of inflation, the rebound found a limit in November 2024. Since then, the context of higher unemployment and the official decision to contain salary increases below inflation have stopped the improvement. In March 2025, the registered real salary was 6.0% below the level of November 2023. Private registered salaries almost equaled inflation between November 2023 and March 2025, although they presented a real decline in March and face negative projections. In real terms, that salary was 5.6% below the level of November 2019 and 23.5% below the level of November 2015. Public salaries showed an even more pronounced decline: by the end of the first quarter of 2025, these incomes were 15.1% below the level prior to Milei's assumption and almost 20% below the level registered at the end of Mauricio Macri's term. Comparing with November 2015, the total loss reached an alarming 38.4%.

**Argentina's Economic Plan at Risk Due to Rising Dollar and Falling Reserves**
The economic plan of President Javier Milei and Minister of Economy Luis Caputo is at risk due to the rising dollar and falling reserves. The inflation rate increased by 2.8% in April, mainly due to a 6% increase in imported products. The reserves of the Central Bank fell by $33 million, reaching $38.299 million. According to an estimate, the reserves will be negative by $2.746 million by June 13 and will remain negative until September. However, by the end of the year, the reserves are expected to be positive, accumulating an additional $4.6 million in the last quarter. The demand for dollars is repressed due to the restrictions on foreign exchange, and companies have accumulated a significant demand for dollars. The sector private is expected to demand an additional $60,000 million between 2026 and 2030. The 'dollar barato' rule suggests that when the dollar is cheap, the officialism does well, and when it is expensive, they do poorly. This rule has been observed in the past, with the officialism doing well only three times in the last 16 years: in 2011, 2017, and 2025 (so far).

**The Economy Outside the 'Gran Hermano' House: A New Opportunity**
The economy outside the 'Gran Hermano' house has changed significantly since the contestants entered. The inflation rate has decreased from 2.7% in December 2024 to around 3% in May 2025, which is a rare occurrence in Argentina. The dollar has also stabilized, with a band of fluctuation between $1,000 and $1,400. The government has eliminated the emission of new money to finance the deficit, which has helped to reduce inflation and maintain the stability of the dollar. However, this has also meant that there are fewer pesos available for salary increases. The contestants, including Luz, Ulises, and Juan Pablo, have seen their salaries increase, but they are still relatively low. The cost of living has also increased, with prices in the supermarket rising from $80,339 to $92,373. The government has also implemented changes to the monotributo regime, which affects those who want to start a business or maintain themselves. The contestants are still competing for the grand prize of $100 million, which they can use to make important financial decisions. They have the option to keep the money in a low-risk FCI, invest in a fixed-term deposit, or invest in the cryptocurrency market. Alternatively, they can invest in real estate or buy a vehicle. Overall, the economy outside the house is less convulsive than in previous years, and the contestants have a rare opportunity to make a new start.

**Argentina's AUH to Increase by 2.8% in June 2025**
The Argentine government has confirmed that the Asignación Universal por Hijo (AUH) will increase by 2.8% in June 2025, corresponding to the inflation rate of April. This is due to the formula of mobility that has been in effect since July last year, which takes into account the Índice de Precios al Consumidor (IPC) of two months ago and proposes an increase in social benefits proportional to this data. The total value of the AUH will be $109,519 per child, but beneficiaries will only receive 80% of this amount ($87,615.20), as ANSES retains 20% and charges it in a single installment with the presentation of the Libreta AUH. The goal of this economic aid is to reach the canasta básica alimentaria (CBA) and improve the nutritional security of the most vulnerable sectors of the population. It is available for recipients of the AUH, Asignación Universal por Embarazo (AUE), and mothers of seven or more children who receive a Pensión No Contributiva (PNC). The payment is deposited in the same account where beneficiaries receive the central allowance, such as the AUH or AUE, and is credited automatically along with the monthly allowance. However, the value of the Tarjeta Alimentar (Food Card) remains frozen at last year's level and will not be affected by the increase. The amounts of the Tarjeta Alimentar will be: 'It is available for titulares of the AUH, AUE, and madres de siete hijos or more that reciban a PNC,' said the government. 'The objetivo of this ayuda económica is to alcanzar la canasta básica alimentaria (CBA) and mejorar la seguridad nutricional de los sectores más vulnerables de la población.'

**Javier Milei Predicts Economic Improvement and Compares it to the Fall of the Berlin Wall**
President Javier Milei spoke on Radio Mitre about the future of Argentina and predicted a significant economic improvement. He stated that the country is on the verge of ending inflation and that by mid-2026, inflation will be around 0%. Milei also compared the current economic situation to the fall of the Berlin Wall, saying that it is a 'collapse of the Berlin Wall' for Argentina. He emphasized that the economy, taxes, regulations, and laws were all a result of trying to fix the problem without addressing the root cause. Milei also spoke about his relationship with Luis 'Toto' Caputo, saying that they share the same ideological and management views, particularly on the importance of fiscal issues in solving Argentina's problems. He revealed that he asked Caputo to be his Minister of Economy, and that he was impressed by their shared vision.

**Prepagas in Argentina to Increase Rates in June 2025**
The prepagas in Argentina will increase their rates in June 2025, but below the inflation rate. According to the Union Argentina de Salud (UAS), the increases will be between 2% and 2.5% on average, with Medicus being the only one to increase by 3.15%. The UAS warned that following the inflation rate would be more suitable, as it takes into account the evolution of inflation, salaries, inputs, public services, and financing to the sector. The Ministry of Health has established a resolution requiring prepagas to inform the Superintendence of Health Services about any rate increase before notifying their users. For those who cannot afford their prepagas, there are alternative, more affordable options available in the market.

**Argentina's Economic Activity Declines for Second Consecutive Month**
The economic activity in Argentina has shown a second consecutive decline in April, according to private indicators. The decline is linked to the reduction of income from salaried sectors. The new whitening decree, approved by the government, is expected to have little impact due to its 'weak' nature and the many legal doubts surrounding it. 'The deceleration of inflation in April compared to March slowed down the salary decline but did not yet recover the previous loss of purchasing power,' said a report by CP Consultores. The Estimador Mensual de Actividad Económica (EMAE) indicator, developed by Equilibra, showed a 0.8% decline in April compared to March, following the negative result already shown in March compared to February, of 1.8%. The government's measures to curb salary increases have led to a recession, and the economic activity had shown signs of recovery at the end of last year and in the first half of this year. However, the latest data from the EMAE indicator shows a 1.8% decline in March compared to February, and a deepening of the deceleration of the 'cyclical trend' from 0.4 in January to 0.3 in February and 0.2 in March, which anticipates the behavior of the economy for the next few months.

**Argentina's Economic Outlook: Higher Inflation, Stronger Dollar, and Decreasing Interest Rates**
The Argentine Central Bank (BCRA) released new market expectations, showing an increase in the dollar by the end of 2025, with a change in regime expected after the elections. Inflation also increased, and GDP growth forecasts improved compared to previous months. According to the Relevamiento de Expectativas de Mercado (REM) report, the estimated dollar exchange rate for December 2025 is $1.253, a 7% increase from the February REM. The top 10 consulting firms with the best track record in forecasting estimated the dollar exchange rate for April at $1.097, slightly above the average, and projected that the dollar could reach $1.313 by the end of the year, representing a 22.8% annual variation. In terms of inflation, the report also adjusted upward its expectations. For March, a monthly inflation rate of 2.6% was estimated, with similar figures for the IPC Núcleo (excluding seasonal and regulated prices), which meant a 0.4-point adjustment compared to the previous report. According to the projections, the monthly inflation rate would decrease gradually throughout the year, but it would not reach a figure below 2% until June. The annual inflation rate projected for 2025 increased to 27.5%, a 4.2% increase from the previous report. The GDP showed signs of growth, with an estimated expansion of 1.5% between January and March compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. For the following quarters, a more moderate growth of 0.6% and 0.8% is expected. In terms of annual growth, a 5% increase is projected compared to 2024, with the top 10 consulting firms estimating an improvement of 5.5%. The labor market also shows signs of improvement, with an estimated unemployment rate of 7% for the first quarter of 2025, representing a slight decrease from the previous report. For the last quarter of the year, a unemployment rate of 6.5% is expected. In terms of interest rates, a decrease is projected throughout the year. For April, the fixed-term rate would reach 30.2%, while for December, a decrease to 24.1% is anticipated. Additionally, the projections for foreign trade estimate a commercial surplus of USD 10,335 million for 2025, with exports of USD 83,269 million and imports of USD 72,934 million. Finally, the REM report does not take into account the effects of the economic policies implemented after March 31, such as the reciprocal tariff adjustment announced by the United States in early April. Neither does it include the effects of the regime change that could be implemented in the last quarter of 2025, which could alter the current projections. The economic scenario expected for 2025 shows a higher inflation rate, an increase in the dollar exchange rate, and a decrease in interest rates, posing a challenge for the government of Javier Milei. Despite these corrections, analysts maintain their confidence that the government will be able to balance the fiscal accounts and avoid a primary deficit during this election year.

**Argentina's Economic Forecast: Inflation, GDP, and Dollar Exchange Rate**
According to a report by LatinFocus, the general inflation rate (IPC) is expected to reach 26.6% by the end of this year and 18.6% by 2026. The consensus among economists reduced the estimate by two percentage points from the previous report. The analysts predict that the official dollar exchange rate will be around $1294 by December. They also expect the GDP to grow by 4.6% this year, with a slight increase of 0.1 percentage points from the February report. The estimated economic growth for 2026 is 3.6%. The experts from FocusEconomics mentioned the new agreement between the Government and the IMF, stating that 'the agreement will be key to helping the country meet its debt obligations and lift capital controls.' They also expect the inflation pressures to decrease due to a solid base from the previous year, fiscal restraint, commercial deregulation, reduced taxes on goods, and a less pronounced currency depreciation. The analysts predict that the official dollar exchange rate will be around $1294 by December 2025 and $1530 by the end of 2026.

**New Projections for the 'Dollar Barato', Inflation, and GDP Growth**
According to the Encuesta de Expectativas Macroeconómicas de El Cronista (EMEC), the inflation rate in Argentina is expected to remain at 2.2% in February, followed by a slight decrease to 2% in March and 1.85% in May.

For the year, the mediana of response arrojó that the second year of President Javier Milei's term will end with an inflation rate of 30.6%. The analysts also expect the government to modify its exchange rate policy, with the dollar official expected to reach $1,368.50 by the end of December. The dollar informal, also known as 'blue', is expected to reach $1,490 by the end of 2025. The Producto Bruto Interno (PBI) is expected to grow by 4.8% in 2025, a slight decrease from the previous forecast of 5% by the FMI. The fiscal primary surplus is expected to be 1.2% in 2025, a decrease from the previous forecast of 0.3 points per year.

**Argentina's Inflation and Dollar Projections for 2025 and 2026**
According to a report by FocusEconomics, over 40 banks and consultancies have revised their projections for Argentina in 2025 and 2026. They expect inflation to continue to slow down and for there to be greater monetary flexibility in the short term. The report estimates that the general IPC inflation rate will be 28.8% by the end of this year (almost 3 points less than the previous estimate) and 20.2% in 2026 (0.1 point less than the previous month). The official dollar exchange rate is expected to be $1311.11 by December, slightly below the previous estimate. The experts highlighted the reduction in tax burden implemented by the government of Javier Milei, which they believe will exert downward pressure on inflation in the future. They also noted the reduction in retentions and considered that the measure should boost exports. The economy is expected to grow by 1% from June 2024, driven by disinflation and the advancement of reforms faster than expected. The growth of the GDP 'should be approximately double the Latin American average in 2025, thanks to lower inflation, strong credit availability, and ongoing government reforms', they assured. The report estimates that inflation will end the year at 28.8%, a decrease of 2.9 percentage points from January, and estimates that the 2026 closing will be at 20.2%. The analysts estimate that the pressures on prices should 'continue to decrease in the future on a high basis of comparison, fiscal austerity, trade liberalization, tax cuts on goods, and a deceleration of the peso depreciation allowed by the exchange rate'. The experts also estimated that the official dollar exchange rate will be $1311.11 by December 2025 and $1567.5 by the end of 2026. Regarding monetary policy, the analysts noted that the Central Bank 'lowered the monetary policy rate from 32% to 29% at the end of January due to the decrease in inflation and a strict fiscal posture'. This represents a cumulative reduction of 104 percentage points since the end of 2023. 'Our consensus expects greater monetary flexibility in the future, which is a good omen for credit and investment. The FocusEconomics panelists project that the monetary policy rate will close 2025 at 27.02% and 2026 at 18.47%',

**Argentina's Economy Shows Signs of Recovery, Inflation to Decelerate**
Argentina's economy is showing signs of recovery, according to banks and analysts. The latest report from FocusEconomics has improved its projections for the country. More than 40 banks and consultancies surveyed believe that inflation will continue to decelerate and that there will be greater monetary flexibility in the short term. According to LatinFocus, the general IPC is estimated to be 28.8% by the end of this year (almost 3 points less than the previous estimate) and 20.2% for 2026. The analysts expect the GDP to grow 4.5% this year, double the rate they predict for other countries in Latin America. The experts also highlighted the reduction in tax burden implemented by the government of Javier Milei, which should exert downward pressure on inflation in the future. They also noted the reduction of retentions and considered that the measure should boost exports. The specialists revised their growth forecasts for the Argentine economy for this year, estimating a rise of 1% from June 2024 due to 'deflation and a faster-than-expected advance of reforms'. The growth of the GDP 'should be approximately double the Latin American average in 2025, thanks to lower inflation, strong credit availability, and ongoing government reforms', they assured. The analysts estimate that inflation will end the year at 28.8%, a decrease of 2.9 percentage points from January, and estimate that the 2026 closing will be at 20.2%. The experts also expect the official exchange rate to be $1311.11 for December, slightly below the previous forecast. For 2026, the estimate for the official exchange rate is $1567.5. Regarding monetary policy, the analysts highlighted that the Central Bank 'lowered the monetary policy rate from 32% to 29% at the end of January due to the decrease in inflation and a strict fiscal stance'. This represents a cumulative reduction of 104 percentage points since the end of 2023.

The FocusEconomics panelists project that the monetary policy rate will close 2025 at 27.02% and 2026 at 18.47%.', concludes the report.

**Argentina's Economy: Projections for the End of 2025**
According to the LatinFocus Consensus Forecast, the official exchange rate is expected to reach $1311 by the end of 2025, a decrease of 37 pesos from the previous report. Inflation is expected to be 28.8% at the end of 2025, 2.9 points lower than the January estimates. The new exchange rate scheme, which involves a 1% monthly devaluation of the official exchange rate, has led to a decrease in projections for the end of the year. Camilo Tiscornia, director of C&T Asesores Económicos, explained, 'Perhaps not all participants in the survey believed that the crawling peg would finally start to decline in February. And, in the future, each one will project what they think. Not everyone will think that the devaluation will remain at 1%. In our case, it is the base scenario, although there are always risks.' Santiago Bulat, partner and director of Invecq, stated that the decrease in the dollar's projection is due to the market believing that the government will be able to maintain the crawling peg. The forecast for Invecq is that the dollar will close the year at $1450. The inflation rate is expected to decrease to 20.2% in 2026. 'In January, inflation fell to 84.5% from 117.8% in December, the lowest level since September 2022, due to the decrease in price pressures in several subsectors. Price pressures should continue to decrease in the future on a high base of comparison, fiscal austerity, trade liberalization, tax cuts on goods, and a slowdown in depreciation under the mobile exchange rate,' they concluded. The panel also estimates that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow by 4.5% this year (0.1 points more than the previous edition) and 3.6% in 2026.

**Argentina's Inflation Resists Decline: Challenges for the Government to Reach the 1% Target in 2025**
According to private consultants' estimates, January 2025 is expected to close with a monthly inflation rate between 2% and 2.5%, a slight decrease from the 2.7% recorded in December 2024. However, factors such as seasonal prices and the services sector continue to put upward pressure, complicating the official goal. The impact of seasonal goods, particularly in the tourism sector, is a major obstacle to reducing inflation. In Buenos Aires, the categories of Recreation and Culture, Insurance, and Restaurants and Hotels recorded increases of 7.7% and 6%, respectively. Additionally, in the Food and Beverages sector, products such as meat and fruits experienced increases of 2.9% and 5.7% in the last week of January. The weight of services in the IPC basket is also a key factor, as they have been growing above goods since February 2024, but have not yet reached equilibrium. The Government has identified three key areas to control inflation: wages, the dollar, and public services. In the case of wages, the Executive seeks to maintain moderate increases in collective bargaining agreements, with ceilings of 1% for state employees and 3% monthly for other sectors. This strategy aims to avoid further pressure on prices. The Government has also implemented a 1% 'crawling peg' to reduce exchange rate volatility, and expects the arrival of fresh funds from the IMF and increased foreign exchange sales from agriculture to contribute to stabilizing the foreign exchange market. Finally, the Government has decided to postpone tariff increases for public services to avoid immediate inflationary pressures, but this measure could generate complications in the future by delaying price adjustments and making it more difficult to achieve a more pronounced reduction in inflation in the long term. According to the REM (Relevamiento de Expectativas de Mercado) projections, inflation is expected to follow a downward trajectory, reaching 1.6% in July 2025. For the entire year, an inflation rate of 23.2% is expected, 2.7 percentage points lower than in the previous forecast. However, the Government's challenge will be to keep prices aligned with the inflation target without affecting the expected economic growth for the year. The evolution of wages, the dollar, and public services will be key to achieving this.

**Argentina's Inflation Rate to Drop to 23.2% in 2025, According to Market Projections**
According to market projections, the inflation rate for 2025 is expected to be 23.2%, a significant drop from the 117.8% recorded in 2024 and the 211.4% in 2023, as per the official measurement by the Indec. The REM projected a nominal exchange rate of 1.054.50 Argentine pesos for February, a 1% monthly increase in the exchange rate parity, within the reduced crawling peg range set by the Banco Central. For the year 2025, the participants in the REM expect the following exchange rates: $1.066.58 in March, $1.077.50 in April, $1.089.80 in May, and $1.101.40 in June, with a predicted nominal exchange rate of $1.201 by December 2025, representing a 17.6% annual variation. The unemployment rate is expected to decrease to 7% of the Economically Active Population (PEA) in the fourth quarter of 2025, 0.2 percentage points lower than the previous REM. The analysts consulted in the REM also anticipate consecutive quarterly increases of 1% in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the first half of 2025, with an average increase of 4.6% in the GDP for the entire year 2025, 0.1 percentage points higher than the average of 2024.

**REM Survey Predicts 23.2% Inflation Rate for 2025**
The Relevamiento de Expectativas del Mercado (REM) survey, conducted by the Banco Central (BCRA), predicts a 23.2% inflation rate for 2025, a decrease of 2.7% from the previous month's projections. The survey also projects a 1% devaluation rate for the next few months. The median of the projections for the nominal exchange rate is $1.055 per dollar for the average of February, implying a monthly average increase of 1% in the parity exchange rate. By December 2025, the experts consulted estimate a nominal exchange rate of $1.201. The inflation rate for January is expected to be 2.3%, while February is expected to be 2.1%. The president, Javier Milei, stated that 'the problem of inflation has not been resolved and we must continue working to eradicate it.' The survey also projects a 4.6% increase in the PBI for 2025, a 0.1% increase from the previous year's average. The unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of the year is estimated to be 7.0% of the Economically Active Population, 0.2% lower than the previous REM. The Tasa Mayorista de Argentina (TAMAR) for February is projected to be 30.6% TNA (equivalent to a monthly effective rate of 2.5%). For December 2025, the survey projects a TAMAR of 24.0% nominal annual (equivalent to a monthly effective rate of 2.0%). A recent survey by FocusEconomics also projects a lower inflation rate for 2025, with a consensus of $1.348 for December 2025, 55 pesos less than the previous projection. The BCRA has lowered the interest rate to put the yields in pesos in line with the rest of the variables. The price of the dollar for December is expected to be $1.347.7, a decrease of 55 pesos from the previous projection. The type of exchange rate is expected to increase by 30.6% from now until December. 'The pressures of prices should continue to decrease in the future on a basis of high comparison, fiscal austerity, the recent elimination of a key import tax and a deceleration of the depreciation allowed under the floating exchange rate,' said FocusEconomics.

**Argentina analysts more upbeat on 2025 inflation, economic growth**
Argentine analysts have revised their forecasts, predicting a lower annual inflation rate of 23.2% for this year, down from 2.7 percentage points from last month's survey. They also expect economic growth to reach 4.6% by the end of 2025, a 0.1 percentage point increase. The survey, taken between January 29 and 31, polled 39 participants, including consultancies, research centers, and financial entities. Analysts attribute the downward trend in inflation to the hard austerity push launched by President Javier Milei, who took office in December 2023. However, poverty rates have surged past 50% in the first half of last year.
