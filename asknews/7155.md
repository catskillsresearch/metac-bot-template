**European Climate Change Advisory Council Recommends 90-95% Emissions Reduction by 2040**
The European Climate Change Advisory Council recommends that the European Union set a new, ambitious intermediate goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 90-95% by 2040. This is the only value that keeps the EU on a 'solid', 'viable', and 'credible' path to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, as required by the Climate Law. 'We must reduce emissions significantly and quickly. It's the only way to stop and reduce global warming,' said Ottmar Edenhofer, president of the European Climate Change Advisory Council. The council's report, released on Monday, reiterates that the legally binding goal of zero emissions by 2050 can only be realistically achieved with a 90-95% reduction in internal CO2 emissions relative to 1990 levels. This conclusion was reached after analyzing 1,000 possible scenarios of climate impacts and risks caused by increasing greenhouse gas levels. Only five scenarios survived the exhaustive evaluation of compliance with European climate goals and the Paris Agreement targets by 2040, precisely those that predicted a cut above 90% in emissions. According to Edenhofer, the models 'highlight the urgent need for a deep and sustained reduction in emissions and a significant increase in CO2 removal.' The council recommends that the European Commission send a signal to member states to intensify their efforts and establish the 'national emissions reduction target of 90-95% by 2040.' 'The uneven progress between sectors and member states requires a renewed political commitment. What's at stake is the credibility of climate neutrality,' emphasized Edenhofer, when asked about the pressure from European Parliament lawmakers to lower the cut to 85% to avoid compromising the continent's reindustrialization strategy. The scientists consider that defining a more ambitious goal provides greater security and predictability for economic agents, to reduce fossil fuel use and accelerate investment in clean technologies, modernization, and expansion of infrastructure, and electrification. 'The good news is that the EU has made progress in reducing emissions over the past five years, driven by the energy sector transition and the rapid deployment of renewable energies, such as wind and solar. This means that the goal of reducing emissions by at least 55% by 2030 is within reach, and that the EU is largely aligned with the scenarios that support the recommended interval for 2040,' points out Edenhofer. The Advisory Council also opposes the suggestion from MEPs to include international carbon credits in the calculation of the EU's effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 'We discourage the use of international carbon credits to meet the 2040 target, as they risk diverting resources from national investments and may compromise environmental integrity,' says the report published on Monday. In addition to the new 2040 intermediate goal, the panel of experts recommends establishing three separate objectives for the reduction of raw emissions and for temporary and permanent CO2 removals. Two additional recommendations aim at the bet on cooperation and partnerships for promoting climate action beyond EU borders - not to replace but to complement national efforts -; and the reinforcement of the EU's adaptation policy to climate change, namely through the approval of new legal instruments and measurable objectives. 'The coordination and political action at the EU level are not commensurate with the growing scale of climate threats. Therefore, we recommend strengthening the EU's adaptation framework, not only through the Climate Law but also through future legislation aligned with global objectives for preparation, adaptation, and mitigation,' referred Ottmar Edenhofer, recalling that Europe is the continent that records the fastest warming on the planet. 'Climate change is already affecting Europe. Rising temperatures threaten public health and cause avoidable losses of life and economic damage. And all scientific literature consistently shows that limiting global warming produces global social and economic benefits far superior to the costs of mitigation,' observed.

**EU Experts Call for Ambitious Climate Goal of 90-95% Emissions Reduction by 2040**
The European Climate Advisory Council recommends reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 90-95% by 2040, which would also benefit the economy and energy security, according to the experts. The council has reiterated its call for an ambitious climate goal for 2040, which would keep the EU on a credible path to achieving climate neutrality by 2050. If the goal is set too low, it would undermine the EU's long-term competitiveness and energy security, especially in a time of geopolitical uncertainty, the experts warn. The EU currently aims to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990, and the Commission has concluded that this goal is achievable. The EU also aims to become climate-neutral by 2050, but a binding intermediate goal for 2040 is still missing. The Commission had recommended reducing net emissions by at least 90% by 2040 compared to 1990 in 2024, and a draft law is expected in early July. The EU member states and the European Parliament will then negotiate the proposal, which is expected to be contentious. Some in the European Parliament and among the EU member states consider 90% to be too ambitious, and the Commission is expected to introduce more flexibility to achieve the goal, such as recognizing carbon credits from non-EU countries. The Climate Advisory Council advises against international emissions credits, instead recommending that the reduction be achieved through domestic EU measures.

**EU Advisors Warn Against Weakening Climate Goal for 2040**
The European Union's independent advisors have warned against weakening the EU's new climate goal for 2040, as EU authorities consider easing the target to avoid a political backlash against ambitious environmental policies. The European Commission plans to propose a legally binding target in July to reduce the EU's greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. However, Brussels is studying different options, including setting a lower target for national industries or using international carbon credits to compensate for the difference. The European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (Esabcc) warned that using international carbon credits to meet the target could divert funds from investments in European industries and infrastructure. 'Using international carbon credits to partially meet this target could undermine the creation of national value by diverting resources from the necessary transformation of the EU's economy,' the Esabcc said in an analysis of the 2040 target published on Monday. A Commission spokesperson did not directly respond to the advisors' warning about carbon credits. 'The Council, faithful to its task of providing independent scientific advice, reminds us today in its report of the urgent need for ambitious climate action and the importance of setting a target for reducing emissions by 2040,' the spokesperson said.

**EU Climate Target at Risk of Weakening, Warns Independent Consultants**
The European Union's independent consultants have warned against weakening the bloc's new climate target of reducing emissions by 90% by 2040. The European Commission plans to propose a legally binding target in July, but is considering options to soften the goal, including setting a lower target for national industries and using international carbon credits to compensate for the difference. The EU's climate science advisors, the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC), have warned against this approach, saying it risks diverting funds from investments in European industries and infrastructure. 'The use of international carbon credits to meet this target, even partially, could harm domestic value creation, diverting resources from the necessary transformation of the EU economy,' the ESABCC said in an analysis of the 2040 target, published on Monday. The ESABCC recommends that the EU agree to a reduction of between 90% to 95% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, which it says is feasible and in line with global goals to avoid worse climate change. This would require a nearly emissions-free energy sector by 2040 and a shift to electrify polluting industries. The consultants say this would bring benefits, including fewer health problems related to pollution, driving investments to modernize sectors, and improving security by reducing Europe's dependence on imported fossil fuels.'

**Are Countries' New Climate Plans Ambitious Enough? What We Know So Far**
The World Resources Institute analyzed the initial submissions of countries' new climate commitments, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), for 2025. The results show that while some countries, such as the U.S., U.K., and Brazil, have made ambitious commitments, many others, including major emitters like the EU and China, have yet to submit their NDCs. The analysis found that the new NDCs submitted so far have made a noticeable but modest dent in the 2035 'emissions gap', with a projected reduction of 1.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) by 2035 compared to 2030. However, this is far from what's needed to keep global warming within safe limits, and many countries, including developed and wealthy economies, have not strengthened their 2030 targets. The analysis also found that some countries, such as the U.K. and Brazil, have set ambitious targets, while others, such as Canada, have made only marginal increases to their targets. The report concludes that much greater ambition and action are needed to narrow the emissions gap and keep global temperature goals within reach.

**Why Climate Is Missing from the Fight to Save America's Biggest Green Law - One Green Planet**
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, was hailed as the most significant climate legislation in U.S. history. However, defenders of the law are now focusing on job creation, energy prices, and national competitiveness, rather than the environment. According to Brad Plumer and Lisa Friedman of The New York Times, clean energy companies and lawmakers are emphasizing economic benefits, citing the potential loss of 292,000 jobs and $220 billion in investment if the IRA is repealed. Environmental groups like the League of Conservation Voters are also framing their defense of the IRA as a way to lower utility bills and strengthen American manufacturing. Despite this shift in rhetoric, analysis from the Rhodium Group warns that repealing the IRA's tax credits could unleash hundreds of millions of tons of additional emissions annually by 2035. The article concludes that the fight for green energy may now be couched in economics, but the stakes for the planet remain unchanged.

**EU on Track to Meet 55% Emissions Reduction Goal by 2030**
The European Union is close to achieving its ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. According to the European Commission, the current reduction is at 54%, which is a promising result. This is a significant achievement, especially considering that the EU is one of the regions that is warming the fastest. The consequences of climate change are already being felt, with extreme heatwaves, frequent floods, and wildfires becoming a regular occurrence. However, there is a sense of hope, as many EU member states have taken concrete steps to accelerate the energy transition. The EU has already reduced emissions by 37% since 1990, and in 2023, there was an additional 8% reduction. Some countries, such as Belgium, Estonia, and Poland, are still lagging behind in defining their plans, while others are pushing for a slower pace on environmental regulations due to geopolitical tensions, energy price increases, and protectionism. The European Commission, however, remains committed to its goal and is now aiming for a 90% reduction in emissions by 2040, with some flexibility in the tools used, such as carbon credits.

**Farmers hit by disasters to get financial counselling**
The federal government will commit an extra $2 million to the Rural Financial Counselling Service to provide free financial counselling to disaster-stricken farmers. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese acknowledged that farmers are 'doing it tough' due to extreme weather events such as historic droughts and 'one-in-500 year' floods. Albanese stated, 'People put their heart and soul into their farms,' and emphasized the need to adjust to more frequent and intense weather events. The government has already promised $36 million to help farmers prepare for and respond to drought conditions, but Nationals Leader David Littleproud has called for the reintroduction of interest-free loans from the Regional Investment Corporation. Albanese maintained that the science is clear about the increased frequency and ferocity of natural disasters, and that climate change is real and needs to be addressed. Australia remains on-track to meet its legislated 43 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030, but has faced criticism from environmental groups for approving the North West Shelf project, which could release 4.3 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over 50 years.

**Denmark's Historic Agreement to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Agriculture**
Denmark has made a historic agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, a sector that accounts for nearly half of the country's emissions. The 'Green Three-Party' agreement, signed by seven parties, including the government and opposition, aims to reduce emissions by 1.8 million tons of CO2 equivalent by 2030. The agreement includes measures such as reducing the number of cows and pigs, increasing the use of organic farming, and planting 250,000 hectares of new forest by 2045. A CO2 tax will be introduced on livestock production from 2030, with a rate of 300 DKK per ton of CO2 equivalent, rising to 750 DKK in 2035. The tax will be phased in over time to give farmers time to adapt. The agreement also includes measures to improve water quality, reduce pollution, and promote biodiversity. Louise Korsgaard Frederiksen, a young farmer from Jutland, is skeptical about the agreement, citing concerns about the cost of implementing the measures and the impact on her farm. However, she is optimistic that the agreement will set an example for other countries and inspire them to take action on climate change. 'We're not doing this to save the planet, but to show the world that we can do it,' she said. 'And if the EU follows our lead, it will make more sense for us.' The agreement has been hailed as a breakthrough in Denmark's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable agriculture. 'This is a historic agreement that will make a significant difference in the fight against climate change,' said Jeppe Bruus, the Minister for the Green Three-Party agreement. 'We're not just talking about reducing emissions, we're talking about creating a more sustainable and resilient food system.'

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**Denmark on Track to Meet Ambitious Climate Goal**
According to the Danish Ministry of Climate, Denmark is on track to meet its ambitious climate goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 72% by 2030 compared to 1990. This is the first time the ministry has concluded that Denmark will meet the 70% reduction target set in 2020. The country has already halved its greenhouse gas emissions. The ministry attributes this positive prognosis to the high demand for electric vehicles and the prospect of a more climate-friendly agriculture. Electric cars now make up more than half of all new car registrations in Denmark, resulting in a noticeably quieter traffic in the capital, Copenhagen. The government and several parliamentary parties have agreed on a comprehensive implementation of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture by at least 1.8 million tons of CO2 equivalent by 2030. This includes the introduction of a global first CO2 tax for agriculture by 2030.

**Gov't under fire for plans to halve nitrogen emissions by 2035 instead of 2030**
The Dutch government is facing criticism for its plan to halve nitrogen emissions by 2035 instead of the court-ordered 2030 deadline. Friends of the Earth Netherlands (MilieuDefensie) and Greenpeace believe that the government is 'creating their own reality' and 'postponing the fate of nature and farmers.' The court had ruled in Greenpeace's favor, stating that nitrogen deposition on sensitive natural areas must be halved by 2030 to avoid a fine of 10 million euros. Greenpeace director Andy Palmen described the plan as 'the latest vague plan which is presented with a lot of pomp and circumstance.' Johan Vollenbroek of MOB called the plan 'utter stupidity,' emphasizing that the European rules will continue to apply. MOB will continue to initiate proceedings, according to Vollenbroek.

**Dutch Government Aims to Halve Nitrogen Emissions by 2035**
The Dutch government plans to reduce the amount of nitrogen emissions by half by 2035, according to a ministerial commission led by Prime Minister Schoof. This is a change from the previous approach, which focused on the amount of nitrogen that settles in nature. The new plan will set targets based on the emissions at the source, i.e. at companies themselves. However, it is unclear how this will be measured or calculated. The government has been ordered by a court to reduce nitrogen emissions in sensitive natural areas by 2030, and if they fail to do so, they will face a fine of 10 million euros. It is unclear whether the new approach will affect this ruling. The government has not yet provided further details on the plan, and it is unclear what it will mean for companies and farmers who are currently waiting for permits.

**US Environmental Agency Plans to Roll Back Climate and Environmental Regulations**
The new head of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Lee Zeldin, plans to roll back numerous environmental and climate regulations. This includes allowing higher greenhouse gas emissions for power plants, more emissions from cars and trucks, and larger subsidies for oil and gas companies. Zeldin stated, 'We are driving a dagger through the heart of the climate change religion and ringing in America's golden age.' The 31 proposed changes include repealing the requirement for coal-fired power plants to be nearly climate-neutral by 2032. The Trump administration had previously announced plans to repeal the regulations to reduce sulfur and greenhouse gas emissions from US coal-fired power plants to keep some of the country's dirtiest power plants in operation. Additionally, the EPA plans to reverse the regulations for vehicle emissions set by the Biden administration, which would have reduced emissions from cars by nearly 50% by 2032 compared to the projected values for 2027. Zeldin promised that the proposed changes would save huge sums of money that are currently spent on complying with regulations and as 'hidden taxes' from companies and consumers. Environmentalists argue that the EPA's plans cannot be simply ignored and that the proposed changes could be overturned by courts. This applies to some of the other announced changes as well. The year 2024 was the warmest ever recorded and the first to average over 1.5 degrees warmer than the pre-industrial average.

**US States Commit to Transitioning to Heat Pumps for Climate Control**
Nine US states, including California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Rhode Island, have committed to making 65% of new climate control systems 'heat pumps' by 2030, and 90% by 2040. This decision aims to reduce energy consumption and emissions. The states will prioritize investments in vulnerable communities, with 40% of the funding going to those most affected by climate change. The transition to cleaner energy sources is being driven by a lack of federal consensus, leading states to take the initiative in reducing emissions. The replacement of traditional heating and cooling systems will reduce pollution and create new jobs in the sustainable energy sector. Heat pumps work by transferring thermal energy from one space to another using electricity, and are more efficient than traditional air conditioning systems. They can be used for both heating and cooling, and can reduce energy consumption in homes and buildings. Geothermal heat pumps use the stable temperature of the earth's subsurface, which is around 9 meters deep, to improve energy efficiency. This technology has the potential to change the global energy landscape. The use of heat pumps is better for the environment because it reduces the need for fossil fuels, which are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Although electricity is still primarily generated from conventional sources, the integration of renewable energy sources is increasing. The development of clean technologies is advancing rapidly, and the US is adopting renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. The demand for clean energy equipment is expected to increase by 600% in the next few decades, according to the Biden administration.

**Climate recommendations? No stress. It's easy to achieve them at home**
The UK has halved its emissions since 1990, and the Climate Change Commission's new recommendations aim to reduce emissions by an additional three quarters by 2040. The Commission suggests that with an upfront investment of 0.2 per cent of GDP per year, emissions could drop significantly. The key recommendations include: around half of homes in the UK will be heated using a heat pump by 2040, three-quarters of cars on the road will be electric, and people should eat less beef. These changes are not radical, but rather a natural progression of existing trends and technological improvements. As Baroness Bryony Worthington argued, the Commission's recommendations are 'designed to give the government options, not restrict choice.' The article concludes that the transition will be cheaper, cleaner, and more convenient, and that people will likely adapt to these changes without even noticing.

**Meltdown metrics**
Scientists are warning that the Earth is approaching a critical threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming, with record temperatures in 2024 potentially marking the beginning of a prolonged period near or above this threshold. The main driver of this warming is human activity, including continued reliance on fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial practices resulting in greater greenhouse gas emissions. The effects of surpassing 1.5°C are already observable, including more frequent and severe heatwaves, floods, and wildfires. To mitigate this trajectory, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change outlines feasible pathways to limit warming, including peaking emissions by 2025 and halving them by 2030. However, progress remains uneven, with global emissions continuing to climb and climate finance trickling to vulnerable countries at a slow pace. The climate crisis is a test of global coordination, requiring systemic shifts, including phasing out fossil fuels, overhauling energy infrastructure, and delivering climate finance without delay. Technologies exist to reduce emissions, but current policies and investments remain misaligned with scientific recommendations.

**Japan targets 60% greenhouse gas emission reduction by 2035**
Japan has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2035 from 2013 levels, but climate campaigners say this target falls short of what is needed to limit global warming. According to Masayoshi Iyoda from 350.org, scientists say an emissions cut of 81% by 2035 is needed for Japan to honour its commitments to the 1.5 degree objective. Kazue Suzuki of Greenpeace Japan also called the new target 'far too low', saying a 78% reduction is needed. The Japanese government has also approved its latest Strategic Energy Plan, which includes an intention to make renewables the country's top power source by 2040. However, the plan also sees a major role for nuclear power to help meet growing energy demand. 'This is a major failure in Japan's attempt to transition to a future of renewable energy that is fair and just,' Iyoda said. 'We've made certain tweaks' following the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, an industry ministry official said, but 'it doesn't mean Japan's broader efforts towards a 'green transformation' will be changed significantly.'

**Critical Delay in Climate Action: FT: 'Big Polluters' Will Miss 2035 Climate Targets**
The United Nations is expecting countries to submit new climate plans by the end of the week, but many major economies may miss this deadline. The plans, which are critical to fighting climate change, should include countries' commitments to reduce carbon emissions and specific targets with numbers. Scientists say that global emissions must be nearly halved within a decade from 2019 levels to limit global warming. However, many countries are still far from achieving their 2030 targets. According to sources speaking to the Financial Times, while some countries like the UK have managed to announce upgraded climate targets, most of the world's largest economies may not meet the deadline. The upcoming US presidential election and Donald Trump's stance on climate policies are also seen as obstacles to achieving the Paris Agreement's targets. Nick Mabey, co-founder of the think tank E3G, said that only a quarter to a third of G20 countries are expected to meet the deadline. He added, 'Leaders have not shown much interest in this issue due to the shock caused by the US presidency and other problems.' The UN and environmental organizations are urging countries to update their climate commitments quickly to increase their efforts to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius below pre-industrial levels. However, economic difficulties and political uncertainties are making it increasingly difficult to achieve these targets.
