**American Patriotism Was at an All-Time Low -- But Gen Z Can Change That**
Patriotism among young Americans has been declining in recent years, but a new trend suggests that Gen Z is shifting towards conservatism and more religious values. According to a 2023 Gallup survey, only 39% of U.S. adults felt 'extremely proud' to be American, the lowest level on record. However, data from the Tufts Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) shows that 46% of young people voted for Donald Trump in 2024, up from 36% in 2020. Republicans are more likely to express high levels of patriotism and national pride, with 60% of Republicans reporting being extremely proud to be American. Organizations like PragerU are working to restore American values through free educational content, aiming to counteract the decline in patriotic sentiment and foster a renewed appreciation for the nation's principles.

**Enem 2025 Registration Begins: Key Changes and Dates**
The Enem 2025 registration process begins on May 26th. This year, in addition to competing for undergraduate vacancies in public Brazilian universities, institutions abroad, and scholarships in private colleges, candidates over 18 years old will be able to use the test results to obtain their high school diploma, if they have not already done so. According to the Ministry of Education (MEC), the changes aim to 'contribute to the valorization of Enem as an instrument of educational policy, reinforcing its character as an evaluation of the conclusion of basic education and its ability to serve different profiles of participants.' The registration process will run until June 6th on the Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira (Inep) website. The exams are scheduled for November 9th and 16th. Another change is the automatic pre-registration of students in the 3rd year of public high school. 'For the first time, graduating students from public schools will have their registration pre-filled in the system, a way to simplify the process and encourage participation,' said Minister of Education Camilo Santana.

**Enem 2025 Registration Begins: Changes and New Features**
The Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC) has announced that the Enem 2025 registration process begins on Monday, 26. This year, in addition to competing for undergraduate vacancies in public universities, institutions abroad, and scholarships in private colleges, candidates over 18 years old will be able to use the test results to obtain a high school diploma, if they have not already done so. 'The norm alters the MEC nº 458/2020, with the intention of contributing to the valorization of Enem as an instrument of educational policy, reinforcing its character as an evaluation of the conclusion of basic education and its ability to serve different profiles of participants,' says the MEC about the 2025 edition guidelines, published on Friday, 25. The validity of the test as a certification of completion of secondary education and partial declaration of proficiency in the stage of education had been discontinued in 2017. Now, Brazilians over 18 years old without a high school diploma can resort to both the Encceja and the Enem to obtain certification. The Enem 2025 registration will be open until June 6 on the website of the National Institute of Educational Studies and Research Anísio Teixeira (Inep). The tests are scheduled for November 9 and 16. Another change is the automatic pre-registration of students in the 3rd year of secondary education in the public network. According to the edict, students regularly enrolled in the 3rd year of secondary education in public schools will be automatically pre-registered. However, they will need to access the participant's page to confirm the information and choose the language option of the test. 'For the first time, graduating students from public schools will have their inscription pre-filled in the system, a way to simplify the process and stimulate participation,' said the Minister of State for Education, Camilo Santana.

**Trump is frittering away US' soft power in Asia with its Harvard ban**
The Trump administration's decision to bar Harvard University from enrolling international students will harm the US' soft power in Asia, where America and China are already locked in a battle for influence. The move will resonate badly across the region, where many young Asians aspire to study, work, and build their futures in the US. According to the Institute of International Education, India sends the most number of students to study in the US, with 331,602 in the 2023-2024 school year, while China sends the second highest, with 277,398 students. Many of these students are likely to be future leaders in government and industry, potentially instrumental in nurturing later relations. The US has strained trade relations with allies and partners alike, and has canceled 83% of American foreign aid contracts, leaving a vacuum China was only too happy to fill. The reaction to the recent 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar is a case in point, where Chinese and Russian teams were among the first to provide emergency response personnel and key supplies, while aid cuts significantly limited the US response. 'This is a feature of the intensifying competition,' notes Ja Ian Chong, associate professor in political science at the National University of Singapore. 'The Americans feel pressured to respond to the narrative China is pushing. As the world grows more contested, we'll see more of this.'

**Undergraduates make up majority of those wishing to study abroad**
According to the 2025 Report on Chinese Students' Overseas Study, undergraduates now make up 59% of those aspiring to study abroad, a 4% increase from the previous year. This rise is attributed to improvements in global public health situations, adjustments in overseas universities' admission policies, and the resumption of international academic exchanges. The report highlights that engineering students represent the largest group at 22% of those intending to study abroad, followed by management (16%) and economics (11%). The United Kingdom and the United States have been the top choices for Chinese students studying abroad from 2015 to 2025, with the UK taking the lead over the US since 2019. Over half of the parents of students planning to study abroad have a bachelor's degree or higher, and the percentage of parents with overseas education background has risen for 11 straight years, reaching 25% in 2025. 'In addition to young people aged 15 to 25, working professionals aged 25 to 40 are also seeking opportunities to expand their horizons and enhance their skills through overseas study in the form of distance learning,' said Sun Tao, vice-president of New Oriental Education & Technology Group.

**Forecasted foreign student drop catastrophic for US colleges: Study**
A new study by the National Foundation for American Policy suggests that if international and immigrant students are not factored into the equation, enrollment numbers at American colleges and universities will drop by 5 million by 2037. This would have a 'catastrophic' effect on many universities, according to Madeline Zavodny, a professor of economics at the University of North Florida. The study found that the number of undergraduates would be about two-thirds of its current size, and the number of graduate students would plummet by 1.1 million. Zavodny attributes this decline to the Trump administration's targeting of U.S. universities for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and other practices that do not align with its mission. The administration has announced cuts of federal grant funding from institutions like Harvard and Columbia, and international students at several universities have had their student visas revoked and have been taken into custody by federal immigration agents. Zavodny predicts that both enrollment and the financial outlook of U.S. colleges could take significant hits, and that schools may need to adjust their enrollment practices to admit students they may not have even a decade ago.

**Food aid cuts and other changes: What the U.S. House spending bill could mean for Texans**
The U.S. House spending bill, which includes major spending cuts, has been passed and now heads to the Senate. The bill includes significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which could mean that 3.2 million fewer people in the United States would receive SNAP food assistance in an average month through 2034. The bill also requires most able-bodied adults under 65 years of age without children younger than seven to work, train or volunteer to receive SNAP benefits. Additionally, the bill would require states to start paying for 5% to 25% of SNAP benefits in 2028 and 75% of the program's administrative costs. Texas is expected to have a 7% decrease in enrollment in Medicaid by 2034 due to the bill, which could lead to about 8 million more people being uninsured by 2034. Rep. Julie Johnson said, 'They rely on Medicaid. I don't understand why these Republicans keep voting for their constituents' healthcare to go away.'

This Sunday's episode of 'Meet the Press' will focus on the growing issue of loneliness among Gen Z'ers in America. Moderator Kristen Welker will discuss the topic with several guests, including Dr. Vivek Murthy, former Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, and author Arthur Brooks. According to the CDC, the suicide rate among young people ages 10-24 increased 62% from 2007 to 2021. A recent poll found that 30% of Americans aged 18-34 say they are lonely every day or several times a week, triple the average for all Americans. The special episode comes after a recent surge in youth suicides and follows a previous episode on mental health in 2023.

According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), there are 923,000 16-24-year-olds not in education, employment, or training (Neet) in the first three months of 2025, which is roughly one in eight people in this age group. Libby, a 20-year-old mum, is one of them, having sent hundreds of job applications with no success. She says, 'Day to day it is depressing, because you don't hear anything back, you're constantly trying to find a job, trying to fight for a job, and you hear nothing.' Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall notes that 'there are still nearly a million young people locked out of the system and being written off.' Libby is now pursuing a first aid course to help her achieve her dream of running her own dog grooming business.

**Undergrad Enrollment Up 4% This Spring**
According to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, undergraduate enrollment has increased by 4% this spring, with 18.4 million students enrolled in higher education. This is a 3.2% year-over-year increase. Despite remaining below 2020 levels, the data shows a steady recovery in college enrollment, driven by growth in certificate programs and at two-year public institutions. Non-traditional programs, such as certificate programs and vocational programs, continue to see gains. Young adults are also enrolling in higher education at greater rates, with a 3.2% uptick among 21- to 24-year-olds and a 5.9% increase among 25- to 29-year-olds. Doug Shapiro, executive director of the NSCRC, said, 'We are not yet seeing declines that have been projected for the number of high school graduates in the coming years.' He also noted that year-to-year retention rates have remained high, which could bode positively for total numbers at institutions.

**Data Reveals Growing Interest from Younger Students in Online Higher Education**
A 2025 survey by Champlain College Online found that younger students (ages 18-24) are increasingly interested in online higher education, with 90% considering an online program. Flexibility and affordability are key factors in their decision. The survey also found that 87% of respondents believe an online degree can prepare them for a successful career and that employers are more accepting of online degrees. Chris Montagnino, Executive Vice President of Champlain College Online, said, 'The unspoken truth in higher education is that our country is experiencing a seismic shift in what students want, and online colleges and universities have adapted to the realities of modern education by offering practical, accessible solutions to millions of learners.' Champlain's enrollment trends reflect this shift, with one in seven new students being between 18 and 24 years old, and popular programs among this age group including Game Development and Marketing, Technology, and Cybersecurity.

**Millions of Americans in their 20s are jobless  --  what's behind the catastrophic rise of NEETs in the US (Yahoo**
According to a report by Measure of America, over 4.3 million Gen Zers in the US are NEET (not in education, employment, or training), which is roughly 10.9% of young U.S. adults. The study suggests that this can have lasting consequences on a young person's life, including lower earnings, less education, and worse health. Some are calling for a redesign of the education system to address the issue. Peter Hitchens argues that college is no longer the path to a bright future, and that vocational training, such as apprenticeships in plumbing or electrical work, could be a better option. Indeed, nearly 52% of job postings in January 2024 did not require a formal college degree. Efforts are underway to shift perceptions of blue-collar work and create clearer pathways into trades and vocational careers, including scholarships and grants from organizations such as Mike Rowe and DEWALT. As of late 2024, 923,000 students had enrolled in a skilled trades school, up 13.6% from the previous year.

**Young Americans Struggle to Make Ends Meet**
According to a CNBC study, two out of five young Americans are barely making ends meet. Sociologists analyzed the responses of over 2,000 respondents and found that women, Latin Americans, and those without a college education are the most financially vulnerable. On the other hand, college graduates are in the best position. The study's findings are consistent with other research that has highlighted the increased financial burden on Generation Z, typically defined as adults aged 18-28. A Credit One Bank survey in January 2025 found that 39% of Generation Z adults experience financial stress, the highest rate among all generations. As one sociologist might say, 'It's a tough time for young people to be starting their adult lives.'

**America’s Birth Crisis Is Shutting Down Schools and Colleges at a Shocking Rate**
The decline in birth rates in the US is causing a significant impact on education, with public schools and colleges closing at an alarming rate. According to Education Week, there has been a net loss of 1.2 million students since the pandemic, and experts project that enrollment will fall by another 2.7 million by 2032. This is due to a combination of factors, including parents opting for homeschooling or private schools, and a migration from urban to suburban school districts. The main cause, however, is the consequence of decades of low birth rates. As one research professor at Georgetown University noted, 'If we don't keep our edge in innovation and college-level education, we'll have a decline in the economy and ultimately a decline in the living standard.' The decline in birth rates is expected to continue, with the number of 18-year-olds graduating from American high schools expected to tumble 13% by 2041. As John Stonestreet, President of the Colson Center for Christian Worldview, said, 'Children really are our future.' The solution, according to Stonestreet, is to 'Get Married,' as the decline of marriage is the main cause of the decline in childbearing.

**The decline of the college-educated American man**
The number of young men pursuing U.S. college degrees has fallen in recent years, with 1 million fewer American men ages 18-24 enrolled in college in 2022 compared to 2011. According to Osirus Polachart, a college counselor, many young men are prioritizing vocational schools over college because they can get blue-collar jobs that pay well. A 2021 Brookings Institution report noted that women complete four-year degrees in greater numbers and do so more quickly, exacerbating the gender gap. The result is lopsided, with over 1.1 million women earning a bachelor's degree in 2018-19 compared to fewer than 860,000 men. Analysts and educators are struggling to understand what young men want when it comes to higher education, with many citing financial concerns and a desire for immediate job prospects as reasons for not choosing college.

**First-year college enrollment spiked 5.5% in fall 2024**
The National Student Clearinghouse Research Center reported a 5.5% increase in first-year college enrollment in fall 2024, representing an increase of about 130,000 students. This is a reversal from the clearinghouse's preliminary findings in October, which incorrectly reported a decline in first-year students. The final data shows that college enrollment overall grew 4.5% in fall 2024, rebounding to levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic. Doug Shapiro, the research center's executive director, said, 'It is encouraging to see the total number of postsecondary students rising above the pre-pandemic level for the first time this fall.' The growth in first-year students was driven by older students, with enrollment of first-year students from ages 21 to 24 surging 16.7% and headcounts of students 25 and older spiking by 19.7%.
