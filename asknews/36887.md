**Council of Europe: Israel's actions in Gaza 'heading towards ethnic cleansing and genocide'**
Saskia Kluit, a Dutch parliamentarian for the Council of Europe, has stated that Israel's actions in Gaza are 'heading in the direction of ethnic cleansing and genocide.' Kluit emphasized the 'absolute and urgent need to end the humanitarian crisis for women, children, and hostages in Gaza.' She noted that the situation has worsened since the total blockade of essential humanitarian supplies on March 2, 2025, and the resumption of large-scale attacks on the territory by Israeli authorities. Kluit pointed out that 'children are the first victims of this systematic violence,' as they lack food, clean water, medical care, and safe shelter. She also stated that the Israeli government is not respecting international humanitarian law, which requires unconditional and unobstructed delivery of humanitarian aid. Kluit urged Israel to immediately stop the killing of the Gaza population and called on the international community to fulfill its duty to speak the truth and follow the legal obligations outlined in the Geneva Conventions, including the Convention on Genocide.

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has criticized the leaders of the UK, France, and Canada, saying they are 'encouraging the killers' by supporting a Palestinian state. Netanyahu stated, 'I don't understand how the leaders of France, the UK, Canada, and other countries can ignore this simple fact. Now they are proposing to establish a Palestinian state and reward these killers with the greatest prize. For 18 years, we had a de facto Palestinian state in Gaza. What did we achieve? Peace? No.' He also targeted French President Macron, UK Prime Minister Starmer, and Canadian Prime Minister Carney, saying, 'You will be on the wrong side of justice, on the wrong side of humanity, and on the wrong side of history when the mass murderers, rapists, baby killers, and kidnappers thank you.' Netanyahu is demanding that Israel accept Hamas's conditions, including withdrawal and the survival of the mass killer army, reconstruction, and the repetition of the October 7 massacre.

**Egypt's Sisi and UK's Sunak Discuss Gaza Situation and Ceasefire Efforts**
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi discussed the situation in Gaza with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, according to a statement from the Egyptian presidency. The two leaders discussed the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza since October 7, 2023, and efforts to stop the violence. Sisi emphasized that Egypt rejects the 'complete settlement of the Palestinian issue or the displacement of Palestinians from their land.' He also highlighted the importance of implementing the Arab-Islamic plan for the reconstruction of Gaza, which has been supported by the international community. Sunak expressed a positive stance towards the developments in the Palestinian issue and the situation in Gaza. The two leaders agreed to continue coordinating between their countries in light of regional and international developments. Egypt, Qatar, and the United States have been mediating efforts to stop the violence in Gaza since October 7, 2023, and have successfully brokered two ceasefires, one in December 2023 and another in January 2025. However, Israel has continued to commit war crimes in Gaza, killing over 175,000 Palestinians, including many children and women, and displacing over 11,000 people, in addition to hundreds of thousands of refugees. The British government has recently suspended trade talks with Israel and imposed sanctions on Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank.

**Who Was Mohammed Sinwar, Hamas Leader "Probably" Killed By Israel**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that Mohammed Sinwar, the de facto leader of Hamas in Gaza, has 'probably' been killed in an Israeli air strike. Sinwar's death would be the latest in a series of assassinations targeting Hamas' top leadership, including Yahya Sinwar, Muhammad Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh. Netanyahu also announced that Israel is open to a 'temporary ceasefire' to facilitate the return of hostages, but only if Hamas agrees to his conditions, including the demilitarisation of Gaza and the implementation of the US plan for voluntary emigration of Palestinians. Netanyahu said, 'We have eliminated tens of thousands of terrorists...We eliminated the leaders of the murderers Deif, Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar and probably Mohammad Sinwar,' adding that Gaza will be 'completely demilitarised' and that Israel will implement the Trump plan, which allows residents of Gaza to leave if they wish. If confirmed, Sinwar's death would be a significant blow to Hamas' leadership.

**Netanyahu Accuses Starmer, Macron, Carney of Being on 'Wrong Side of History'**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of being on the 'wrong side of history' for demanding that Israel end its war in Gaza immediately. Netanyahu claimed that this demand would embolden Hamas to continue fighting and that the leaders are 'effectively saying they want Hamas to remain in power.' He also accused Hamas of stealing aid sent by Israel and selling it at exorbitant prices to Gazans. Netanyahu stated that Israel has sent 92,000 aid trucks into Gaza since October 2023, containing 1.8 million tons of aid, and that American companies will distribute food directly to Palestinian families in safe zones secured by the Israeli military. He also appeared to rule out a two-state solution, saying that such a state would never be free of Hamas.

**We Must Not Tolerate This**
The ongoing conflict in Gaza has lasted for 594 days, with no end in sight. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies are causing significant harm to the country. Many of Israel's traditional supporters are now considering imposing limited sanctions. The UK has halted trade talks with Israel and is planning to impose sanctions on Israeli settlers in the West Bank. The EU is reviewing its political and economic cooperation agreement with Israel. Norway should follow the EU's lead. The effect would be greater if Europe stood together. The US has significant influence over the Israeli government, and President Donald Trump should use his leverage to stop the war. A recent poll shows that 67% of Israelis want a ceasefire. The same poll indicates that Netanyahu's coalition would have lost its majority in the Knesset if elections were held today. The Norwegian government should not take the Israeli government's actions as representative of the views of most Israelis. The Israeli government has blocked aid to Gaza, but has partially opened up for supplies to the civilian population. However, the deliveries have been insufficient to meet the enormous needs. To avoid a large-scale famine, humanitarian organizations need to quickly get the necessary aid. Israel's military actions have weakened Hamas' military capabilities. Continuing the war will only lead to further suffering and death in the Gaza Strip. Hamas is playing a cynical game to secure its own power position when the war is over. However, after the massive and brutal terror attacks against Israel on October 7, 2023, the time has come for Hamas' Islamist and authoritarian regime to end. There will be neither peace nor freedom if Hamas remains in power. The situation in Gaza is not only a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions, but it also challenges the humanistic values that society is based on. We cannot silently witness the atrocities, even if they do not affect us directly. Israel and Hamas should immediately agree to a ceasefire and Hamas should release the remaining hostages. There are still 58 Israeli hostages in Gaza, 35 of whom are believed to be dead. This is the only way out of this nightmare.

**France, UK, and Canada Accused of 'Encouraging Hamas Assassins'**
French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney released a joint statement on Monday, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as 'encouraging assassins of Hamas to continue fighting'. Netanyahu stated that the statement 'gives hope to the establishment of a Palestinian state, from which Hamas will seek to destroy the Jewish state'. Despite acknowledging Israel's right to 'defend itself' against 'terrorism' and demanding that Hamas 'immediately release the last hostages it has been holding cruelly since October 7, 2023', Macron, Starmer, and Carney warned that they 'will not stand idly by' in the face of Israel's 'scandalous actions' in the Gaza Strip. They 'firmly oppose the extension of Israeli military operations in Gaza', considering the 'level of human suffering' in the Gaza Strip 'intolerable'. If Israel does not end its new military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, they threatened to take 'concrete measures in response', without specifying what these measures would be.

**Top Hamas Leaders, Including Brother Of Yahya Sinwar, Killed In Israeli Airstrike: Report**
According to a report, Israeli airstrikes have killed top Hamas leaders, including Mohammed Sinwar, the brother of Yahya Sinwar, who had become the de facto leader of Hamas after his brother's death in October last year. Sinwar's body was found a day after the strike and buried in a temporary grave in a tunnel. The group has not publicly confirmed his death, likely due to its efforts to announce a successor. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the Israeli Defense Forces will only stop their offensive if Hamas agrees to release all hostages, give up its arms, and exile its leaders. This comes as Israel has renewed operations in the Gaza enclave, aiming to seize its territory and displace its residents to a 'humanitarian zone'.

**Netanyahu: 'There are 21 hostages alive, doubts about the other three'**
According to five sources familiar with the dossier, other countries will be 'invited' to participate in the interim government in the Gaza Strip after the end of the war. The duration of the American temporary administration in Gaza has not been established, and will depend on the situation on the ground. The proposal has been compared to the Coalition Provisional Authority established in Iraq in 2003, after the fall of Saddam Hussein. The sources stated that the provisional administration will rely on Palestinian technocrats, but neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority will be part of it. However, it is still unclear whether an agreement will be reached. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, 'There are 21 hostages alive, doubts about the other three.'

**US, Israel reportedly discuss American-led interim administration in Gaza**
The US and Israel are reportedly discussing an American-led interim administration in Gaza, which would involve a transitional governing authority headed by a US official. The proposed administration would oversee Gaza's recovery and demilitarization following the war, serving as an interim solution until a viable and stable Palestinian governing body could be established. This plan reflects broader concerns over the power vacuum that could emerge in Gaza once the current military campaign concludes. Israeli officials have consistently opposed returning control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority, citing its failure to prevent Hamas from taking over the coastal enclave in 2007. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority should govern Gaza in the future, instead suggesting an international trusteeship involving moderate Arab nations. Israeli military operations in Gaza continue, with a focus on targeting Hamas' infrastructure and securing the release of hostages taken on October 7.

**Völkermordfall Gaza: Verhandlung vor dem IGH betreffend UNRWA in der nächsten Woche**
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) will hold oral hearings on Monday, April 18, 2025, regarding the obligations of Israel as an occupying power in the Palestinian territory, particularly in relation to the presence and activities of the United Nations, other international organizations, and third states, especially in connection with the 'provision and support for the smooth provision of essential goods and services necessary for the survival of the Palestinian civilian population.' This is not a contentious case, but rather a request by the UN General Assembly for an advisory opinion. The hearings will take place daily from April 18 to April 22, and will be broadcast live on the UN TV website and possibly on the English-language channel Aljazeera. The focus will be on the 'closure' of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) from Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, which has been condemned by almost all UN member states as a breach of the UN Charter. The total blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has been universally condemned, has added new urgency to the issue, as the World Food Programme announced last Friday that it had exhausted its food supplies. The ICJ has previously found that Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has been partially lifted, plausibly constitutes the crime of genocide. The current 'total blockade' of essential goods, combined with the resumption of bombings and destruction in the Gaza Strip, in violation of the January 2025 ceasefire agreement with Hamas and Israel's obligations as an occupying power, could provide the ICJ with grounds for further urgent action regarding the 'plausible' genocide by Israel. As Israel has now broken a legally binding agreement with the de facto government 'Hamas' in Gaza, which was confirmed by the mediators USA, Egypt, and Qatar, an order against Israel should no longer be hindered by the fact that it concerns the enforcement of a - now already detailed, concluded, and unilaterally broken - ceasefire agreement.

**Syria, Gaza, and Spain: Key Developments**
Syria: A new interim government has been formed with 23 ministers, led by President Ahmed El-Charaa, who aims to 'build a strong and stable state'. This team will remain in power for five years to allow for the adoption of a permanent constitution and elections. The formation of this government was seen as a test for the rebels who overthrew Bashar El-Assad to create a representative government for all Syrians. However, Ahmed Al-Charaa has also 'partially given in to pressure from Syrian society and minority groups', notes the New York Times. His government includes a Christian woman, Hind Kabawat, as Minister of Social Affairs and Labor, as well as ministers from the Druze, Kurdish, and Alawite communities. Gaza: The Hamas has accepted a new Egyptian proposal for a truce, which includes the release of five hostages, including American-Israeli Edan Alexander, in exchange for a new ceasefire. Israel has responded with a counter-proposal 'in coordination with the United States', according to Israeli authorities. Thousands of people have protested in Valencia, Spain, against the regional government's handling of the October 2024 floods, which killed 235 people.

**Dozens of British MPs ink motion in parliament condemning Trump’s Gaza proposal**
More than 30 British MPs from various parties have signed a motion in parliament condemning US President Donald Trump's proposal for Gaza. The motion, tabled by Labour MP Richard Burgon, urges the Labour government to 'unequivocally reject' Trump's proposals and 'take action to oppose efforts to forcibly displace and ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza'. Foreign Secretary David Lammy has drawn criticism for not condemning Trump's remarks, which he described as 'correct' that Gaza is 'lying in rubble'. However, Lammy insisted that Palestinians must be able to 'live and prosper' in Gaza. Green Party MP Ellie Chowns and independent MP Shockat Adam have condemned Trump's remarks as 'absolutely appalling' and 'reckless', warning that they confirm fears of 'ethnic cleansing' in Gaza. Trump stated at a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Gaza is a 'demolition site' and that Palestinians would be better off in a new, built environment. As of August 2024, Israel had destroyed 80 percent of buildings in Gaza, a deliberate policy to make the area uninhabitable for Palestinians.

**Dozens of MPs sign motion in parliament condemning Trump's Gaza proposal**
More than 30 MPs from various parties have signed a motion in the UK parliament condemning US President Donald Trump's proposal to 'own Gaza' and force Palestinians to leave without the prospect of returning. The motion, tabled by Labour MP Richard Burgon, urges the Labour government to 'unequivocally reject' the proposals and take action to oppose efforts to forcibly displace and ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza. Foreign Secretary David Lammy has been criticized for not explicitly condemning Trump's remarks, which were made during a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Green Party MP Ellie Chowns described Trump's comments as 'ethnic cleansing', while independent MP Shockat Adam called them 'absolutely appalling'. Trump said Gaza is a 'demolition site' and that Palestinians would be better off leaving, despite Israel having destroyed 80% of buildings in Gaza as of August 2024. 'I don't know how [Palestinians in Gaza] could want to stay. It's a demolition site. It's a pure demolition site,' Trump said. 'If we can find the right piece of land or numerous pieces of land and build them some really nice places, with plenty of money in the area, that's for sure, I think that would be a lot better than going back to Gaza, which has had just decades and decades of death,' he added.
