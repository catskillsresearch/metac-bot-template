**India and Pakistan just came back from the brink of war. Here's a timeline of how it unfolded**
India and Pakistan came close to war in May 2025, but a ceasefire was brokered by US President Donald Trump after a week of escalating tensions. The conflict began on April 22 when 26 tourists were killed in a terrorist attack in Indian-held Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan. Pakistan denied any involvement and called for an international investigation. India responded with drone strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties, and both sides exchanged missiles. The US intervened, and a ceasefire was announced on May 11. Pakistan's military spokesperson, DG ISPR Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, confirmed that Pakistan hit 26 Indian targets, including air force and aviation bases, and destroyed Brahmos facilities that had fired missiles in Pakistan. The conflict resulted in the deaths of 33 people and 76 injuries in Pakistan, and 13 civilians were killed in India. The issue of Kashmir remains central to the dispute between Pakistan and India.

**India-Pakistan Diplomatic Crisis: A Military Escalation in May 2025**
In May 2025, India and Pakistan experienced a significant military escalation, marking one of the most severe confrontations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours in recent decades. The immediate trigger was a terrorist attack on April 22 in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, which resulted in the deaths of 26 civilians. India attributed the attack to Pakistan-backed militants, a claim that Pakistan denied. India launched 'Operation Sindoor' on May 7, targeting alleged terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, reportedly killing over 100 militants. Pakistan initiated 'Operation Bunyān Mārsūs' on May 10, launching missiles at Indian military installations. A ceasefire was brokered on May 10, with both nations agreeing to halt hostilities, with Pakistan acknowledging the role of U.S. mediation, particularly by former President Donald Trump.

**India-Pakistan Tension: A Timeline of Events**
On April 22, 2025, a terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, killed 26 innocent people. The attack was carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba's affiliate, Resistance Front. The incident sparked tension between India and Pakistan. India responded by suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, closing the Attari-Wagah border, and conducting a massive search operation. Pakistan denied any involvement in the attack and threatened to consider any Indian military response as an 'Act of War'. The situation escalated with Pakistan violating the ceasefire agreement, and India responded with airstrikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan and PoK. The conflict continued for several days, with both countries exchanging fire and accusations. On May 7, India launched Operation Sundar, a targeted military operation against terrorist camps in Pakistan and PoK. The operation resulted in the deaths of over 100 terrorists. On May 10, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire, with both countries agreeing to stop hostilities. However, the ceasefire was short-lived, and Pakistan again violated the agreement, prompting India to respond with force. The situation remains tense, with both countries maintaining a strong military presence along the border.

**Live Fire, Silent Applause**
In May 2025, India and Pakistan engaged in a five-day war that was 'meant to be watched, recorded, and monetized.' The conflict, which resulted in the deaths of 26 civilians, was marked by a rapid escalation of airstrikes and drone activity, but ultimately ended without a formal ceasefire. Observers noted that the war seemed to be 'a game, meticulously played across skies and bandwidth,' with both sides carefully measuring their moves for 'visibility' rather than destruction. India's use of Russian S-400 'Sudarshan Chakra' systems and Pakistan's deployment of Chinese hardware were notable aspects of the conflict.

**India and Pakistan Agree to Ceasefire, but Tensions Remain High**
A fragile ceasefire between India and Pakistan remains in place on Sunday, May 11, 2025, after a four-day intense conflict that saw both sides exchange artillery fire and airstrikes, resulting in the deaths of dozens. The ceasefire was brokered by diplomatic efforts and pressure from the United States, but was breached hours later by artillery fire in the Indian-administered Kashmir region. Indian authorities and witnesses reported that explosions from anti-aircraft systems rocked nearby cities in the dead of night, similar to the previous two nights. In response, Pakistan denied breaching the ceasefire and blamed India for the violations. 'We are committed to the ceasefire and condemn the Indian aggression,' a Pakistani spokesperson said. Indian President Donald Trump expressed his support for the ceasefire agreement, saying, 'I will work with both countries to find a solution to the Kashmir issue.' The conflict began on Wednesday, two weeks after a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people. The region is disputed between India and Pakistan, with both countries claiming sovereignty over it.

**India and Pakistan Engage in Drone War, Conflict Escalates**
A long-standing feud between India and Pakistan has escalated into a fierce military conflict, with both sides using a large number of drones. According to reports, Pakistan launched a massive attack on India in the early hours of May 10, after India initiated the conflict. Indian Air Force Commander Viomika Singh said that Pakistan had deployed around 300-400 military drones against India on the night of May 9 and the early hours of May 10, targeting Indian military infrastructure. Pakistan's military has been accused of repeatedly violating Indian airspace. The drone attack has drawn global attention, with reports suggesting that Pakistan launched up to 400 drones against 36 targets in northern and western India, forcing India to close 27 airports and affecting 228 flights. India has responded by using drones, missiles, and S-400 air defense systems, as well as 'Barak-8' and 'Akash' anti-drone technologies. Singh revealed that India also launched a large number of drones against Pakistan's 4 air defense facilities, destroying one radar. However, Pakistani media reported that their military had shot down 77 Indian drones in two days. Pakistani military spokesperson Sherif Jodhri said that their air defense forces had shot down 25 Indian drones on May 8 alone, targeting Karachi, Lahore, and Rawalpindi. The conflict began on May 7, with both sides increasing the use of combat drones. The BBC reported that this conflict is the first 'drone war' between nuclear-armed states. Experts believe that while drones can reduce direct human casualties, they increase the risk of civilian deaths. According to statistics, the conflict has resulted in around 48 deaths and over 100 injuries since May 7. India has declared a national emergency and mobilized 50,000 reserve troops, including retired military officers and air defense experts, to support operations along the Line of Control and the western border. This shows India's strong stance, but also reflects the country's difficulties in the current situation.

**India-Pakistan Conflict: Latest Developments**
The ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan has resulted in the deaths of at least 50 people. On May 9, 2025, Pakistan accused the Indian government of seeking to draw two nuclear-armed neighbors into conflict, after over 72 hours of cross-border fire. In response, the Pakistani military mobilized tanks and troops to its border with India, near Lahore. Meanwhile, the Indian military continues to launch an offensive with armed drones, targeting Pakistani military infrastructure. Mediation efforts between the two countries continue, but military attacks persist. Pakistani security forces accused India of trying to provoke two of its nuclear-armed neighbors, without explaining the reasons behind this move. In response, the Pakistani military mobilized forces to its border with India, with the intention of increasing military presence in the area. As a result, tanks were seen on the road to Muridke, leading to the city closest to India, Lahore. Following the Pakistani military's troop mobilization, the Indian government authorized the military to activate its reserve forces. This decision will add over a dozen battalions to the Indian military, preparing for the conflict. Additionally, security forces stationed near the Pakistani border continue to launch drone attacks, while artillery fire has been exchanged between the two sides, resulting in at least 50 deaths.

**India-Pakistan Conflict Escalates: Modi Speaks Out, Tensions Reach Boiling Point**
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken out for the first time on the escalating India-Pakistan conflict, which has reached its highest point. The conflict began after a shooting incident in the Indian-administered Kashmir region, where 25 Indian men were killed, except for one Nepali national. The incident sparked widespread outrage in India, with the red sindoor powder, traditionally worn by Indian women after marriage, becoming a symbol of India's anger towards Pakistan. Despite Pakistan's government denying any involvement in the incident, India has continued to direct its anger towards its neighbor. On April 23, 2025, India's Cabinet Committee on Security announced the closure of the only land border crossing between India and Pakistan, suspension of visa services, and expulsion of Pakistani nationals. The move was seen as a significant escalation of tensions between the two countries. On May 7, 2025, India launched a military operation codenamed 'Sindoor' against Pakistan and the Pakistan-administered Kashmir region, resulting in a fierce air battle between the two nuclear-armed nations. According to Pakistani military spokesperson, Major General Babar Iftikhar, Indian forces launched 24 attacks on six locations in Pakistan, resulting in at least 8 civilian deaths and 35 injuries. Pakistan's Defense Minister also stated that Pakistani air defense systems had shot down 5 Indian warplanes and captured several Indian soldiers.

**Expert: Nuclear War Between India and Pakistan Unlikely**
Gleb Makarevich, a researcher at the Center for the Indo-Pacific Region of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) RAS, believes that a nuclear war between India and Pakistan is unlikely. 'There will be no nuclear war, no full-scale war,' he said in a comment to Lenta.Ru. Makarevich thinks that the conflict between the two countries has been ongoing for a long time, and both sides are aware of each other's 'red lines.' They will try to avoid escalating tensions, he added. He also suggested that the conflict could be resolved within the next 24 hours. India launched a military operation called 'Sindur' on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and parts of the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan responded with counterattacks, according to RT. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of 26 civilians and 46 wounded in Pakistan, while India claims 10 deaths and 48 wounded. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry accused India of 'reckless actions' and warned that the two nuclear-armed states are approaching a major conflict.

**India and Pakistan Clash in Kashmir Amidst Tensions Over Region's Sovereignty**
India and Pakistan clashed in the disputed region of Kashmir on May 7, 2025, amidst tensions over the region's sovereignty. While both countries claim to want to avoid a full-scale conflict, the situation remains volatile, with the risk of escalating violence. The recent attack was sparked by a terrorist incident on April 22 in the Indian-administered region of Jammu and Kashmir, where 26 people were killed in a shooting at a popular tourist destination, Pahalgam, known as 'India's Switzerland'. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has prioritized restoring stability in Kashmir since taking office in 2014, and has emphasized the need to prevent cross-border terrorism from Pakistan. This is not the first time the two countries have clashed over Kashmir, with a similar incident in 2016 resulting in the deaths of 18 Indian soldiers, prompting India to launch a retaliatory attack on Pakistani territory. In 2019, a suicide bombing killed 40 Indian security personnel, leading to Indian airstrikes on Pakistani territory. The recent attack has sparked a backlash in India, with many calling for retaliation. However, Indian military officials have emphasized that they are taking a cautious approach, targeting military installations and avoiding escalation. Pakistan has denied any involvement in the terrorist attack and has blamed India for the violence, vowing to seek international support for its position.

**India-Pakistan Conflict Escalates: 8 Killed, 35 Injured in Indian Airstrikes**
The Indian Ministry of Defense announced on May 7 that it had attacked 9 terrorist infrastructure facilities in Pakistan's control area and within Pakistan, including areas disputed by India, resulting in at least 8 deaths and 35 injuries. Pakistan's military has responded by shooting down two Indian fighter jets. The international community is concerned about the conflict between two nuclear-armed countries. According to the Indian Ministry of Defense, 'Our actions are focused, careful, and non-escalatory in nature.' The targets were only terrorist facilities, and not Pakistani military facilities. However, Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif stated, 'We have the right to respond to this war action, and we are actually taking strong action.' This conflict began after a terrorist attack on April 22 in the disputed Kashmir region, which resulted in the deaths of 26 tourists. The Indian government had hinted at military retaliation, but Pakistan denied involvement and called for a neutral investigation. The United Nations Secretary-General Guterres expressed strong concern on May 6, stating that the conflict between India and Pakistan is 'not a solution.'

**The Blogs: A nuclear war between India and Pakistan in May 2025 was 'predicted' in 2019!**
A study published in 2019 by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists predicted a nuclear war between India and Pakistan in May 2025, citing the growth of their nuclear arsenals. The study projected that a limited nuclear exchange could result in the immediate deaths of over 100 million people and trigger profound climatic disruption on a global scale. The authors warned that a nuclear conflict would have far-reaching climatic consequences, including a 'nuclear winter' that could lead to decreased precipitation, widespread agricultural failure, and severe food insecurity affecting potentially billions of people. The current escalation of military tensions between India and Pakistan bears an uncanny resemblance to the hypothetical scenario outlined by the authors, and the international community is urged to take action to prevent a catastrophic conflict. 'It is the moral and strategic duty of all States -- particularly those possessing nuclear capabilities -- to act with responsibility, restraint, and full awareness of the irreversible consequences that any hasty decision would entail.'

**Zhirinovsky's Prophecy Begins to Unfold: '200 Million People Will Die'**
A terrorist attack in Kashmir has resulted in 26 deaths. The region is disputed between several countries, with parts controlled by India, Pakistan, and China. The terrorist group 'Front of Resistance' has claimed responsibility, which is linked to the radical group 'Lashkar-e-Taiba'. India has closed a key border post with Pakistan, suspended visa-free entry, and given two days for people in the SAARC system to leave the country. The Times of India reports that a cross-party meeting will be held under the chairmanship of the Minister of Defense. Pakistan has denied allegations of supporting violence by militants. India has suspended the agreement with Pakistan on navigation in the Indus waters, canceled all visas for Pakistani citizens, and ordered them to leave within 48 hours. Pakistani military officials in India must leave by May 1. India has recalled its entire diplomatic staff from the High Commission in Islamabad. Some media outlets report that Pakistan is preparing for war with India, with its military on high alert to counter any Indian actions. Both countries possess nuclear weapons. A video from 2004, in which Vladimir Zhirinovsky predicted the current events, has resurfaced. He predicted a massive migration of people due to climate change, leading to conflicts, and a nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, resulting in the deaths of 200 million people.
