**I worked at 23andMe during its collapse. Here's what the next consumer-genomics giant needs to understand**
The author, a board-certified genetic counselor, reflects on the collapse of 23andMe and what the next consumer-genomics giant needs to understand. The company's lack of HIPAA compliance was not the main reason for its downfall, but rather its failure to integrate with the healthcare system and its reliance on a one-and-done business model. The author highlights three key takeaways: the importance of clinician buy-in, the need for a better recurring revenue strategy, and the importance of transparency and public oversight of health data. The author also warns that the collapse of 23andMe should not mean the abandonment of consumer genomics, but rather a chance to rebuild it better. 'HIPAA sets a privacy floor, not a ceiling,' the author notes, and 'data within HIPAA-covered entities can also be hacked.' The author concludes that 'we need a better framework for the future of health data -- one that extends beyond HIPAA, centers informed consent, and enforces public accountability even when platforms collapse.'

**The Intrinsic Relationship Between Energy and AI: A Growing Challenge**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) concludes that 'without energy, there is no AI' in its report on Energy and AI. The agency highlights the intrinsic relationship between energy and AI, as both are general-purpose technologies that impact all economic, political, and social structures of contemporary societies. The IEA notes that the energy sector is at the heart of one of the most important technological revolutions in human history, and that there is still much to be understood about the challenges of connecting energy and AI. To illustrate this interrelation, the IEA compares the electricity consumption of a standard AI data center to that of 100,000 homes or a high-energy aluminum smelter. The agency projects that by 2030, data centers will consume 945 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, equivalent to nearly the current electricity consumption of Japan. The US is expected to be the largest consumer of data center electricity, accounting for 45% of global consumption in 2024, and is projected to be the primary driver of demand in the future. China and Europe follow with 25% and 15% of global data center electricity consumption, respectively. The IEA emphasizes the need to reinvigorate the growth of the electricity sector and redefine energy security, as AI is already being used to address and resolve energy security challenges and mitigate supply chain risks in the energy sector.

**Scientists Call for EU to Allow New Genomic Technologies for Organic Agriculture**
Scientists are calling on the EU to allow new genomic technologies for the development of organic agriculture. The European organic farming sector needs new genomic technologies to achieve sustainable development goals and increase efficiency. 'This is a great opportunity to modernize European agriculture,' says researcher Alexandra Molitorisova. She emphasizes that excluding these technologies from organic production threatens biodiversity loss and inefficient land use. Currently, only 10% of EU agricultural land is organic, and achieving the goal of 25% by 2030 may be challenging without technological support. 'The goal is unlikely to ensure sustainable food production in the EU if these technologies are not involved,' Molitorisova notes. Her team explains that genome editing can significantly reduce the need for pesticides and fertilizers, while preserving the natural authenticity of the product. However, the process of creating such cultures is possible without genetic engineering, but it would take decades. The legal status of these technologies is still unregulated, as current EU legislation on GMOs does not take into account these new technologies. 'European consumers do not distinguish between these technologies and GMOs, although they are different things,' says Professor Kai Purnhagen. He emphasizes that consumers may accept these technologies if they receive a clear explanation of their benefits, especially when it comes to environmental protection, ecological safety, and crop preservation in new climate conditions. According to scientists, the most common form of these technologies, targeted mutagenesis, does not differ from methods already used in organic production. 'If mutagenesis were not excluded from GMO regulation, 80-90% of cereals in the EU would fall under these norms,' Purnhagen explains. Meanwhile, identifying these technologies in products is technically complex, making a ban on them in organics impractical and potentially ineffective. The final decision, researchers believe, should be made not only by lawmakers but also by farmers and consumers. 'For organic farmers, this is a way to respond to consumer expectations that care about nature,' Purnhagen adds. Public debates and participation of food councils can become instruments for taking a balanced and democratic decision.

**Historiadores de la naturaleza: Reconstruyendo el pasado para proteger la biodiversidad**
Historians of nature, such as Miguel Clavero, are working to reconstruct the past by using historical documents, such as the 'Relaciones topogrÃ¡ficas de los pueblos de EspaÃ±a' from the 16th century and the 'Diccionario geogrÃ¡fico' by Pascual Madoz from the 19th century. These documents provide valuable information on the distribution of species, such as the Iberian wolf, in the past. According to Laetitia Navarro, a researcher at the EstaciÃ³n BiolÃ³gica de DoÃ±ana, 'the data we have is very limited in time, representing a small window of what happened, a view of only 40 years ago'. The new European legislation requires Spain to restore 30% of degraded habitats by 2030. However, Navarro emphasizes that 'we can't recover the past, but we can use these historical references to value the current state of nature and know how to recover the lost nature.'
