**Pope Leo XIV Blesses Giro d'Italia Peloton in Historic Vatican Event**
Pope Leo XIV made history by blessing the peloton of the Giro d'Italia 2025, receiving the iconic maglia rosa and blessing the riders from the heart of the Vatican. The pontiff, known for his closeness to sports, offered words of encouragement to the cyclists before the symbolic start of the final stage, calling them 'models for all young people around the world'. Alongside Sister Raffaella Petrini, the Pope welcomed the riders warmly. During his speech, Leo XIV emphasized the importance of cycling as a discipline that strengthens not only the body, but also the spirit. 'I thank you for everything you do. You are true models, and I hope that just as you have learned to take care of your bodies, you will also do so with your spirits,' he expressed, urging the athletes to cultivate their bodies, minds, hearts, and souls in balance. After these words, he imparted the apostolic blessing, symbolically marking the start of the final stage. The 3-kilometer route within the Vatican took the cyclists through some of the most iconic places in the pontifical state, including the Basilica of St. Peter, the Vatican Gardens, and the Lourdes Grotto. The event is a result of the growing bond between the Holy See and sports. Since Athletica Vaticana was recognized by the International Cycling Union in 2021, the presence of cycling in Vatican life has gained strength. The day was also a prelude to the Jubilee of Sport, which will take place in Rome on June 14-15, within the framework of the Holy Year. The Church's tradition with cycling dates back decades, with precedents such as Pius XII's reception of the peloton in 1946 and John Paul II's audience in the Jubilee of 2000, solidifying a relationship of deep admiration and mutual respect.

**A Glimpse into a Climate-Changed Future: '2050 Store' and 'Wiers - the Voice of the Earth'**
As the temperature in Seoul reached 29 degrees Celsius on the first day of June, a mock '2050 Store' was set up at the Seoul Madang to showcase the potential effects of climate change on our daily lives. The store featured items that may be extinct by 2050, such as Korean apples, domestic squid, wine, abalone, chocolate, and iced Americanos. According to Greenpeace, the domestic squid catch has decreased by 16/20 over the past 20 years due to rising sea temperatures, and 44% of abalone and shellfish species are at risk of extinction due to ocean acidification. The event, 'Wiers - the Voice of the Earth,' was held to raise awareness about climate change and to encourage citizens to take action. Participants were asked to write down the small, everyday things they want to preserve in a '2050 Diary' wall, and to record their thoughts on a 'Voice of the Earth' audio booth. The event also featured a coffee truck serving fair-trade coffee and vegan milk tea. Greenpeace's climate and energy campaigner, Jeong Sang-hoon, said, 'We set up this event to hear the voices of citizens who are concerned about climate change and to amplify the voice of the Earth.' He added that the organization plans to use the feedback from the event to campaign for change in the government and parliament after the presidential election. Participants expressed their hopes for the next government to prioritize climate change, with one citizen saying, 'I hope the next government will reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy.' Another participant said, 'I hope the next president will actively communicate with international organizations like the UN to address climate change.'

**Basque Government's 250,000 Euro World Cup Purchase Sparks Controversy**
Lorea Bilbao, a former Basque regional deputy, quintupled the cost of the 2030 Basque Pelota World Cup, which was designed to favor the Basque team over the Spanish one. The event was purchased by the Basque government, led by the PNV and PSOE parties, for 250,000 euros, five times the usual price. Bilbao, who was involved in the purchase, is now the vice-president of the International Federation of Pelota (FIPV). The FIPV's president, Xavier Cazaubon, had previously removed most of the organization's members and appointed Bilbao as vice-president in September 2023. The purchase of the World Cup was seen as a step towards the integration of the Basque Pelota Federation into the FIPV. The article suggests that the purchase was a result of the PSOE's offer to the PNV to support Pedro Sánchez's government in exchange for the organization of the World Cup.

**When Will Self-Driving Cars Be Common?**
Despite the withdrawal of several companies, including Apple and General Motors, from the development of fully autonomous vehicles, Google's Waymo division continues to offer robotaxi services in several cities. Tesla's CEO Elon Musk claims that his Autopilot Full Self Driving (FSD) technology is close to achieving full automation, but admits that it won't be in operation before 'late 2026'. Experts predict that self-driving technology won't be widely available until around 2030 at the earliest. The major hurdles holding back automated driving include the vast array of driving situations, changing weather conditions, and complex regulations. Currently, no self-driving cars are available for consumer purchase, but some vehicles, such as Mercedes-Benz's S-Class and EQS sedans, offer limited Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities.
