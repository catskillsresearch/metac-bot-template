**Home listings soared to nearly $700 billion in April, report shows**
According to a Redfin report, home listings in the U.S. reached a record $698 billion in April, with almost 500,000 more home sellers than buyers. The report notes that 44% of home listings were on the market for about 60 days without going under contract, referred to as 'stale inventory.' The total number of homes on the market increased by 16.7% year over year, with new listings spiking 8.6% to a 3-year high. The median home sale price rose 1.6% year over year to $431,931, but monthly home payments still jumped to a record high due to high mortgage rates and prices. Redfin predicts that the median U.S. home-sale price will drop to 1% year over year by the end of 2025, and housing prices might fall even more in certain locations.

**Vancouver Real Estate Market: Sales Continue to Lag, Inventory Reaches 10-Year High**
The Greater Vancouver REALTORS (GVR) reported that the total number of residential sales in May 2025 was 2,228, down 18.5% from the same period last year and 30.5% lower than the 10-year seasonal average. Andrew Lis, GVR's economic and data analysis director, said that while there are signs that sales activity may be changing, the May sales were still below the 10-year seasonal average, indicating that many buyers are still cautious or waiting. The current sales trend is similar to 2019 and 2020, with a slow pace of sales. However, it's worth noting that sales rebounded significantly in the second half of 2020, and it's unclear whether a similar trend will occur in 2025. In May, the total number of new listings in the GVR area was 6,620, up 3.9% from the same period last year and 9.3% higher than the 10-year seasonal average. The current inventory of MLS-listed properties in the GVR area is 17,094, up 25.7% from the same period last year and 45.9% higher than the 10-year seasonal average. The sales-to-active-listings ratio in May was 13.4%, with a breakdown by property type: 10.2% for detached homes, 17.4% for townhouses, and 14.7% for condominiums. Lis noted that the current inventory level is one of the healthiest in recent years, with many sellers adjusting their price expectations, providing buyers with more negotiating room and effectively suppressing price increases. From a seasonal perspective, summer sales are typically slower than spring sales, but due to the unusually cold spring, we may see an unusually active summer, as many people have delayed their purchasing decisions. Regardless, the market remains biased towards buyers, making it a favorable time for those planning to purchase a home this summer.

**Bryan Yu: B.C. retail sales see slight rebound as provincial inflation eases**
B.C. retail sales saw a 0.3-per-cent increase in seasonally adjusted sales in March, after a 0.7-per-cent dip in February, driven by higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers. Unadjusted retail sales in the province were up 3.5 per cent compared to the same month in 2024. Preliminary national data for April suggests another gain. Year-over-year figures showed higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers, up by 12.4 per cent, and health and personal care retailers' sales increased by 2.9 per cent. However, furniture, home furnishings, electronics and appliances retailers' sales decreased by 6.8 per cent. B.C.'s inflation rate slipped to a year-over-year rate of two per cent in April, down from 2.6 per cent in the prior month, but still higher than the national rate of 1.7 per cent. Lower gasoline prices contributed to the deceleration, with a 20.4-per-cent, year-over-year decline. Bryan Yu, chief economist at Central 1, noted that inflation excluding energy sat at 3.1 per cent, higher than it was in the previous month. He also mentioned that B.C. shelter prices rose 3.3 per cent year over year in April, easing from 3.7 per cent in the previous month, and food prices rose 4.3 per cent on a year-over-year basis, with meat prices climbing 6.7 per cent and dairy products and egg prices increasing by 3.3 per cent.

**Thin Steel Plate Inventory Increases 1.6% in April**
The inventory of thin steel plates, a key material for the manufacturing industry, increased by 1.6% in April, reaching 397,000 tons. This is the first increase in three months, following a decrease in inventory in March due to manufacturers and distributors selling off their stock in anticipation of the end of the fiscal year. The manufacturing industry, particularly the automotive sector, has been experiencing weak demand, leading to low production levels and a decrease in demand for steel plates. As a result, the inventory of thin steel plates has been decreasing, but the recent increase in April is seen as a rebound from the previous month's decline.

**Better for Buyers? New Data Shows Housing Inventory Favoring Buyers Over Sellers**
The US housing market is shifting in favor of buyers as the number of listings soars. According to a Redfin study, the 1.9 million estimated sellers outnumber buyers by nearly half a million, a quick reversal from two years ago when buyers outnumbered sellers. The total value of home listings hit its highest levels ever, reaching $698 billion in April, with a significant portion of that value being 'stale inventory' that has been for sale longer than 60 days. Economists expect home prices to drop 1% by the end of the year due to the glut of housing inventory, which should improve affordability for buyers. The 'lock-in effect' from high mortgage rates may be easing as life events prompt more homeowners to give up lower interest rates in an effort to sell their homes. As Redfin Senior Economist Asad Khan said, 'The balance of power in the U.S. housing market has shifted toward buyers, but a lot of sellers have yet to see or accept the writing on the wall.'

**Sales at home furnishings and furniture stores ticked up in April - Furniture Today**
Total retail sales, excluding automobiles and gasoline, increased by 0.72% seasonally adjusted month over month and 6.76% unadjusted year over year in April, according to the Retail Monitor. Home furnishings stores saw a significant growth, with sales up 0.72% month over month and 6.76% year over year. The Retail Monitor uses actual, anonymized credit and debit card purchase data, which provides a more accurate picture of sales trends. The growth in sales can be attributed to strong tariff-driven spending and the fact that Easter fell in April this year, after falling in March last year. For the first four months of the year, total sales were up 5.08% year over year and core sales were up 5.5%.

**U.S. Home Furniture and Bedding Market to Reach $183.5 Billion by 2027, Growing at 3.07% CAGR**
The U.S. home furniture and bedding market is expected to reach $183.5 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 3.07% from 2021 to 2027. The market is driven by the trend of refurbishing and renovating homes, increase in expenditure on home improvement and décor, and the growing demand for customized cupboards. The online sales channel is expected to expand in the future, driven by the rapid adoption of e-commerce platforms and technical improvements in online selling platforms. However, the increase in cost of raw materials due to stringent laws and conditions imposed by the U.S. government is likely to hinder the market growth. The key players in the industry have adopted product launch and business expansion as their key developmental strategies to expand their market share and remain competitive. The market is segmented into product type and sales channel, with the cupboards segment expected to reach $18.8 billion by 2027, and the online sales channel expected to reach $88.7 billion by 2027.
