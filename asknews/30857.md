**House Republicans unveil Medicaid cuts; Missouri Senator Hawley issues a warning**
House Republicans have unveiled a plan to cut at least $880 billion from Medicaid, largely to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. The proposal, which would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade, has been met with criticism from Democrats, who say it would be 'shameful' and amount to another attempt to repeal Obamacare. Republicans argue that the cuts would root out 'waste, fraud and abuse' and ensure that the program is administered to those who qualify for it. However, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri has warned that cutting health care to pay for tax breaks would be 'morally wrong and politically suicidal.' The bill also includes changes to the Affordable Care Act, such as new community engagement requirements and more rigorous income verification for those who enroll in the program.

**Millions face losing health insurance under Republican proposal**
A Republican-led proposal to scale back Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies could result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance, according to new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO estimates that at least 5.7 million people would lose coverage entirely by 2034 under the proposed changes, with the number rising to 13.7 million when considering possible changes to Medicaid. Representatives Pallone and Neal and Senator Wyden said, 'Trump and Republicans are opening the floodgates for the biggest theft of health coverage we have ever seen.' The proposal would significantly reduce federal spending on ACA marketplace subsidies starting in 2026, leading to increased out-of-pocket costs for all privately insured Americans, including those with employment-based coverage. Critics argue that the cuts disproportionately affect low- and middle-income Americans who rely on ACA subsidies to maintain health coverage.

**World News | House Republicans Unveil Medicaid Cuts That Democrats Warn Will Leave Millions Without Care | LatestLY**
House Republicans have unveiled a plan to cut at least USD 880 billion from Medicaid to help cover the cost of USD 4.5 trillion in tax breaks. Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose their health care coverage, with a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office suggesting that 8.6 million people will lose coverage over the decade. Republicans claim that the cuts are necessary to root out 'waste, fraud and abuse' and generate savings, but Democrats say the cuts are 'shameful' and amount to another attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. 'In no uncertain terms, millions of Americans will lose their health care coverage,' said Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey. The legislation would also roll back Biden-era green energy programs and impose new 'community engagement requirements' on Medicaid recipients. 'Savings like these allow us to use this bill to renew the Trump tax cuts and keep Republicans' promise to hardworking middle-class families,' said Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky.

House Republicans have unveiled a plan to cut at least $880 billion from Medicaid, which would lead to 8.6 million fewer people having health care over the decade, according to a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. Democrats warn that the cuts are 'shameful' and would essentially amount to another attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say the cuts are necessary to generate savings and allow them to renew the Trump tax cuts. However, many House Republicans have expressed concerns about cutting health care safety net programs, and President Trump has vowed not to cut Medicaid. The legislation would also roll back Biden-era green energy programs and prohibit federal funding for immigrants who have not shown proof of citizenship. 'In no uncertain terms, millions of Americans will lose their health care coverage,' said Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey. 'Hospitals will close, seniors will not be able to access the care they need, and premiums will rise for millions of people if this bill passes.'

**Health coverage for more than 13M could be in jeopardy if subsidies cut**
According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), 5.7 million Americans could lose their Affordable Care Act (ACA) coverage by 2034 if Republican-led proposals to scale back subsidies are successful. Additionally, proposed changes to Medicaid could lead to 8 million losing coverage over the next decade. The CBO report highlights two proposals that would negatively impact ACA enrollment: allowing expanded premium tax credits to expire and finalizing the 2025 Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Rule. The proposed changes to Medicaid include making millions of dollars in Medicaid spending reductions, stricter eligibility verification, citizenship checks, and federal Medicaid funding cuts to states that offer coverage to residents living in the U.S. illegally. The CBO predicted that as many as 8 million people could lose Medicaid coverage as a result.

**President-Electâ€™s Plan For Health Insurance Light On Details - The Cerbat Gem**
President-elect Donald J. Trump has announced that he is nearing completion on a plan to replace President Obama's Affordable Care Act. He stated that his plan would be unveiled soon after the confirmation of Representative Tom Price as the secretary of health and human services. Trump said that his plan would be 'great health care' that would cover more people and cost less money, but did not provide any details on the cost or funding. He emphasized that his plan would include 'insurance for everybody,' a goal of health care policy experts for decades. Trump also stated that he would force drug manufacturers to negotiate better prices with Medicaid and Medicare, saying they would no longer be 'politically protected.' Republicans have been vowing to repeal Obamacare for nearly seven years and have begun the process of repealing the law, with committees working out the details of repealing and replacing it.

**'Real stable genius?' Meandering Trump ridiculed after off-script hour-long diatribe**
President Donald Trump gave an off-script, hour-long speech on Monday morning, discussing trade negotiations with China, pharmaceutical costs, and other topics. However, his claims were met with ridicule and fact-checks from various individuals and groups. Trump took credit for saving the Affordable Care Act, but a professor pointed out that Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) actually gave the deciding vote to stop its repeal in 2017. Trump also claimed that a 'businessman' friend told him that the US pays higher prices for drugs than other countries, but his description of the friend raised suspicions. Experts and fact-checkers pointed out that Trump's executive order on drug prices is actually designed to raise prices in other countries and boost pharma profits. Trump's comments were met with criticism and ridicule, with some calling him a 'real stable genius' and others questioning his mental acuity.

**House Republicans Propose Cuts to Medicaid, Democrats Warn of Millions Losing Coverage**
House Republicans have proposed a budget plan that includes cuts of at least $880 billion to the national program for the poor, primarily to offset the massive tax cuts. The plan, which was revealed late Sunday, is sparking the biggest healthcare battle since Republicans tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) during Donald Trump's first term in 2017. While Republicans claim they are simply eliminating 'waste, fraud, and abuse' to generate savings with new work requirements and eligibility, Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage. A preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office indicated that the proposals would reduce the number of people with healthcare coverage by 8.6 million over the decade. 'Savings in this way allow us to use this bill to renew Trump's tax cuts and fulfill the Republicans' promise to working-class middle-class families,' said Representative Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which handles healthcare spending. However, Democrats denounced the cuts as 'shameful' and essentially equivalent to another attempt to repeal Obamacare. 'Without a doubt, millions of Americans will lose their healthcare coverage,' said Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the panel. He noted that 'hospitals will close, the elderly will not be able to access the care they need, and premiums will increase for millions of people if this bill passes.' The Republicans are trying to get the bill passed before the end of May, with plans to promote their efforts with public hearings this week on various sections of the proposal, before combining them into a massive package. The chances of the package, however, are uncertain. More than a dozen Republicans in the House have told Johnson and party leaders that they will not support cuts to the healthcare safety net programs that their constituents rely on. Trump himself has distanced himself from the idea, promising that there will be no cuts to the national program for the poor known as Medicaid. In total, 11 committees in the House have been compiling their sections of the package while Republicans seek at least $1.5 trillion in savings to help cover the cost of preserving the $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that were approved during Trump's first term and expire at the end of the year. But the Energy and Commerce Committee has been one of the most watched. It was instructed to achieve $880 billion in savings and achieved that goal, primarily with the cuts in healthcare, but also by reversing green energy programs from the Biden era. The preliminary analysis of the CBO noted that the committee's proposals would reduce the deficit by $912 billion over the decade, with at least $715 billion coming from the healthcare provisions. At the center of the savings are changes to Medicaid, which provides almost free healthcare to over 70 million Americans, and the Affordable Care Act, which has expanded in the 15 years since it was first passed to cover millions more. To be eligible for Medicaid, there would be new 'community commitment requirements' of at least 80 hours a month of work, education, or service for adults without dependents who are able to work. People would also have to verify their eligibility for the program twice a year, instead of just once. This would likely lead to more churn in the program and present obstacles for people to maintain their coverage, especially if they have to drive far to a local office of benefits to verify their income in person. But Republicans say it will ensure that the program is administered to those who qualify for it. Many states have expanded their Medicaid lists thanks to federal incentives, but the legislation would cut a 5% increase that was implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. It would prohibit federal funding for states to immigrants who have not demonstrated proof of citizenship. There would be a freeze on the so-called provider tax that some states use to help pay for large portions of their Medicaid programs. The additional tax often leads to higher government payments, which critics say creates a loophole that allows abuse in the system. The energy parts of the legislation occupy many fewer pages, but include reversions of climate change strategies that President Joe Biden signed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act. It proposes rescinding funds for a range of energy loans and investment programs while providing accelerated permits for the development of natural gas and pipelines.

**Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' Banks On Huge Medicaid Cuts As Its 'Cost-Saving Centerpiece'  --  See Who Risks Losing Coverage Under The GOP Proposal**
House Republicans have proposed a health-care overhaul that would cut $880 billion from Medicaid to finance $4.5 trillion in new and extended tax cuts. The legislation, described as the 'cost-saving centerpiece' of Trump's 'big, beautiful bill,' would require able-bodied adults to log 80 hours a month of work, education, or service and verify eligibility twice a year. According to a Congressional Budget Office score, the changes would leave roughly 8.6 million fewer people insured within a decade. Democrats call the package a fresh attempt to gut the Affordable Care Act, with Rep. Frank Pallone saying, 'In no uncertain terms, millions of Americans will lose their health-care coverage.' Republicans argue that stricter screening will curb 'waste, fraud and abuse' and free up cash to extend the expiring 2017 tax cuts, with Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie saying, 'Savings like these allow us to renew the Trump tax cuts and keep our promise to hardworking middle-class families.'

**Proposed ACA Marketplace Rule Would Raise Health Care Costs for Millions of Families | Center on Budget and Policy Priorities**
The proposed Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace rule would increase health care costs for millions of families. Many marketplace enrollees would be unable to afford needed medical care or would accumulate additional medical bills that they canâ€™t afford to pay. The proposed rule would increase the share of income that people pay for premiums (after tax credits) and the maximum out-of-pocket limit. This would result in higher premium costs for enrollees, with a family of four making $85,000 facing an additional $313 in premiums for coverage in 2026. The Administration acknowledges that this rule may cause enrollment among healthier enrollees to decline, worsening the marketplace risk pool and causing sticker-price premiums (premiums before tax credits) to increase. People with low incomes who enroll in plans with cost-sharing reductions on the ACA marketplace would also face higher out-of-pocket maximums, with a family of four making $66,000 a year potentially facing an additional $700 in medical bills if a family member is seriously ill or injured in 2026. The proposed rule would allow individual-market insurers to offer plans with higher deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs than they can now, reducing the value of premium tax credits (PTCs) and resulting in higher premium costs for enrollees. The changes to payment formulas and plan value requirements would substantially raise premiums and other out-of-pocket medical costs for millions of enrollees, coinciding with dramatic premium hikes already set to occur if Congress fails to extend the enhanced premium credits that are scheduled to expire in late 2025.

**PA House Passes Bills To Protect Affordable Care Act Coverage**
The Pennsylvania House of Representatives has passed four bills to protect the Affordable Care Act (ACA) coverage, which would make health insurance coverage mandatory under state law if the federal version is repealed. The bills, which received broad bipartisan support, would require health insurance companies to allow young adults to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26, pay for preventative care, and ban lifetime coverage limits and exclusions for pre-existing conditions. House Insurance Committee Chairperson Perry Warren said, 'We can't wait for D.C. politicians or appointees to take away our health care rights for millions of Pennsylvanians.' Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman responded by calling the House actions 'premature' and 'fearmongering.' The bills now head to the Senate, where they face an uncertain fate. Signed by President Barack Obama in 2010, the ACA has made affordable health insurance available to more people, and Pennsylvania has expanded Medicaid under the law. Despite Republican efforts to repeal the ACA, the law remains in place, and Democrats are pushing to protect it.

**Itâ€™s up to us to stop GOP attacks on healthcare access and affordability â€¢ NC Newsline**
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) turns 15 this week, despite Republican opposition and 'Repeal and Replace' attacks. The law has persisted and is more popular than ever, with 24 million people getting coverage from the ACA exchanges. Enhanced tax credits passed during the Biden era have made coverage more affordable for millions, especially in southern states where Republicans refused to expand Medicaid. In North Carolina, 1,027,930 people received health coverage in 2024 through the ACA. However, the law's Medicaid expansion provisions have also helped millions of people get coverage. After North Carolina expanded Medicaid in December 2023, 640,000 more people have received health insurance coverage. The current administration and Republican-controlled Congress are at risk of cutting both Medicaid and the ACA, which would roll back progress made in the past 15 years. Republicans in the House have passed a budget resolution that would drastically cut both Medicaid and the ACA, and end the enhanced premium tax credits that have helped more people get affordable coverage since 2022. This would result in millions of people losing coverage, including 1.3 million Black enrollees and 2.4 million Latino enrollees. The cost of coverage under the ACA without the enhanced tax credits will also rise for those who are able to keep coverage. The Republican plan is to use the money saved from cutting healthcare to extend tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations. It's up to us to stop them.

**March 23, 2025**
Fifteen years ago, President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, into law. The law has increased the number of Americans covered by health insurance and slowed the rise of healthcare costs. Republicans have vowed to repeal the ACA, citing government regulation and redistribution of wealth as socialism. However, this stance is a departure from their predecessors, including Republican presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower, who proposed and attempted to implement universal healthcare. Former president Obama explained the Democrats' efforts to provide healthcare coverage, saying, 'We're supposed to do this because it's making a difference in the lives of the people who sent us here.' He emphasized the importance of persistence and working through obstacles to improve the lives of Americans. In 2024, about 24 million people signed up for Obamacare coverage for 2025, while another 21 million adults were covered by the law's expansion of Medicaid.

**Six charts show the impact of Obamacare**
The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) has had a significant impact on American health care. The law has reduced the rate of uninsured Americans from 16% in 2010 to 8% in 2023. However, the law's rollout has been challenging, and some parts are still being challenged in the Supreme Court. The law expanded Medicaid to cover more people, but its expansion stalled due to opposition in Republican-led states. Recently, some of these states have started to give in, and seven states have extended coverage through ballot measures. The subsidies for private insurance have increased enrollments by 78% and reduced premiums by an average of 44% between 2020 and 2024. However, these subsidies are set to expire in December 2025, and their removal could affect 4m people's ability to afford their coverage. Studies have shown improved health outcomes in states that expanded access to Medicaid under the ACA, with one study finding that the expansion saved 27,400 lives by 2022. Despite the setbacks, most Americans now have a favourable view of Obamacare, with polling showing that favourability increased after Republicans tried to repeal it during Mr Trump's first term.

**Affordable Care Act | KFF**
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is facing potential changes, including the expiration of enhanced subsidies in 2026. This could lead to increased premium payments for ACA Marketplace plan enrollees, with some congressional districts experiencing larger increases than others. According to an analysis, nearly one out of every five claims (19%) submitted for in-network services were denied by HealthCare.gov insurers in 2023. However, limited information is available on the reasons for denials, and few consumers appeal claims denials. 'The ACA's future is uncertain, and the expiration of enhanced subsidies could have significant consequences for many Americans,' said Jared Ortaliza. 'It's essential to understand the potential impact on premium payments and access to care,' added Cynthia Cox.

**Idaho lawmakers have a new option to kill Medicaid expansion**
Idaho lawmakers are considering a new bill, House Bill 138, which could repeal the state's Medicaid expansion program if certain restrictions aren't met. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Jordan Redman (R-Coeur d'Alene), claims it will provide 'safeguards to Idaho's Medicaid program ensuring its sustainability, prioritizing resources for needy populations and promoting fairness and accountability.' However, House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel (D-Boise) argues that the requirements will essentially spell the end of Medicaid expansion in Idaho, as they are not possible to grant in compliance with the Affordable Care Act. The bill requires the state to keep improper payments below 5% and the federal government's share of costs below 90%. If signed into law, the state would have until July 1, 2026 to meet these requirements, or the program would be eliminated by Oct. 1, 2026. Rep. Megan Egbert (D-Boise) has joined Republicans in voting to introduce the bill, but has expressed a desire to ask further questions about the proposal.

**Republicans could block 530,000 people from health care plan**
Republican funding cuts could block 530,000 people with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) status from enrolling in Affordable Care Act (ACA) health coverage. This expansion, implemented by former President Joe Biden in May 2024, allowed DACA recipients to purchase health coverage with premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions. However, a court ruling in December blocked the implementation of new regulations in 19 states, and now Republicans are considering cutting funding to repeal the expansion. Repealing the expansion would save $6 billion over 10 years, according to a draft of proposed cuts. Nicholas EspÃ­ritu, deputy legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, said, 'Judge Traynor's ruling is both disappointing and wrong on the law.' Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach argued that DACA recipients should not be considered 'lawfully present' and therefore not eligible for health insurance through the ACA. Congressman Joaquin Castro said, 'Today's announcement is an important step to right that wrong.'

**ACA record-breaking enrollment as Trump administration may repeal key provisions to coverage**
The Biden-Harris Administration has achieved a record-breaking milestone with nearly 24 million Americans signing up for Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace coverage for 2025, nearly doubling enrollment since President Joe Biden took office. Over 45 million Americans are covered through the ACA's Marketplace and Medicaid expansion, marking an all-time high in health insurance coverage in U.S. history. President Biden attributed the achievement to his administration's efforts to make health care more affordable and accessible. However, the ACA faces an uncertain future as President-elect Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed intentions to overhaul the law, which could result in significant premium increases and coverage losses. Officials warned that enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire without Congressional action, and if that happens, premiums could skyrocket, with a single parent earning $50,000 annually facing a $1,600 increase and a retired couple earning $85,000 facing an $18,000 increase. Experts estimate that between three and five million Americans could lose health insurance entirely.
