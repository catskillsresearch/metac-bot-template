**Mission: Impossible 8's Losing Hope of Reaching a Major Franchise Record at Box Office**
Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is no longer on track to break the domestic box-office record for the franchise, according to Screen Rant. The film's earnings fell significantly in its second week, putting it behind 2018's Mission: Impossible - Fallout. To dethrone Fallout's domestic gross record, The Final Reckoning needs to earn more than $220 million over its total run. Despite a strong lead in its first week, the film has only amassed $122 million in its second weekend, roughly $2.3 million behind Fallout's second weekend performance. The odds of The Final Reckoning claiming the top spot appear much slimmer now, but it's still a tight race. Tom Cruise recently thanked the crew, theater workers, and fans of the franchise for the record-breaking opening weekend, saying, 'This weekend was one for the history books!'

**Mission: Impossible 8 Box Office Passes Huge Domestic Milestone In Less Than Three Weeks**
Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning has reached a significant box office milestone, earning over $125 million domestically in less than three weeks. According to Box Office Mojo, the movie's worldwide total is $356.3 million, with $125.1 million coming from domestic markets and $231.2 million from international markets. Despite being edged out by Lilo & Stitch's record-breaking opening weekend, The Final Reckoning's success solidifies Mission: Impossible as one of the last remaining consistently bankable action franchises. Cruise's commitment to death-defying stunts has translated into strong word-of-mouth, drawing audiences into theaters. The film still needs to surpass $400 million worldwide to break even, but its current trajectory suggests it may achieve profitability.

**The Final Reckoning's Box Office Is No Longer On Pace To Break A Mission: Impossible Record**
Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning had a strong opening weekend, setting a new franchise record with a $64 million gross over three days and $79 million including Memorial Day. However, the film has since fallen behind the franchise's highest-grossing movie, Mission: Impossible - Fallout, which earned $220 million domestically. The Final Reckoning's lead over Fallout was lost after the 10th day of release, and it now trails by $2.3 million. The film's longer runtime and stiffer competition at the box office have contributed to its decline. While The Final Reckoning is performing well internationally, its chances of breaking the franchise's domestic record are now at risk. 'The odds aren't in its favor,' according to ScreenRant, as the movie will likely have to settle for one of the top two or three totals in franchise history instead.

The Memorial Day weekend box office has broken records, with Walt Disney Co.'s 'Lilo & Stitch' earning $183 million in its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada, and Paramount Pictures and Skydance Media's 'Mission: Impossible -- The Final Reckoning' bringing in $77 million domestically for second place.

The success of 'Lilo & Stitch' and 'Mission: Impossible' also highlights the importance of having a diverse lineup of films in theaters, as they catered to different audiences and lowered the risk of competition. According to Eric Handler, media and entertainment analyst at Roth Capital, the 2025 domestic box office could gross an estimated $9.2 billion to $9.5 billion, which would be an improvement on last year's $8.7 billion and a sign of continued growth and a 'true recovery'.
