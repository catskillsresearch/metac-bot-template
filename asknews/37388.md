**Trump Announces New Step in EU Trade Negotiations**
US President Donald Trump has announced a new step in trade negotiations with the EU, stating that the EU has called to schedule a meeting. Trump expressed hope that European countries will open up to trade with the US, just as he has asked China to do. The EU Commission has not commented on the matter, but sources suggest that a meeting may be possible at the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris on June 3-4. The Commission is considering sending Valdis Dombrovskis or Maros Sefcovic to represent the EU. A meeting between Trump and EU leaders could be a preparatory step for a meeting in June, when the EU and US leaders may meet. The EU has asked companies to provide details on their investment plans in the US, in order to present these numbers to the White House and outline potential losses to the US economy in case of a trade war.

**Trump offers rare praise to European Union after latest threat**
President Donald Trump praised the European Union for setting dates to meet with the administration about a potential trade deal, just days after threatening 50% tariffs on the bloc's goods. Trump had threatened to impose the tariffs on June 1, but delayed them after speaking with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen reportedly wants to 'get down to serious negotiations' and Trump agreed to an extension of the deadline to July 9, 2025. Trump wrote on Truth Social, 'I have just been informed that the E.U. has called to quickly establish meeting dates. This is a positive event, and I hope that they will, FINALLY, like my same demand to China, open up the European Nations for Trade with the United States of America.'

**Trump's approval ratings, down in April, bounced back in May**
President Trump's approval ratings have been improving after a low point in April. According to recent polls from the Daily Mail, Rasmussen, and Morning Consult, Trump's approval rating is currently at 48-50%, with 49-50% disapproving. This is a significant improvement from the end of April, when his approval rating was at a net negative 7 points. The improvement is attributed to Trump's recent foreign trip and progress in trade talks with China, as well as the passing of the 'big, beautiful bill' with associated tax cuts. However, Trump remains deeply underwater on issues such as inflation, with 66% of Americans disapproving of his handling of the issue. Despite this, Trump's approval on the economy has improved to a net negative 11 points, with 42% approving and 53% disapproving. As Douglas E. Schoen and Carly Cooperman note, Trump's approval is largely due to his own efforts, particularly when he is seen as an effective dealmaker.

**US Dollar Under Pressure as Investors Worry About Trump's Tax Bill**
The US dollar is experiencing turmoil as investors remain concerned about President Trump's massive tax and spending bill and its implications on the US debt. According to Reuters, the dollar struggled to regain its balance on Tuesday, May 27, as investors' sentiment towards US assets weakened. The global stock markets and the euro rose on Monday, while the US was on a holiday, after Trump postponed imposing tariffs on Europe. The focus is now on the US Senate's discussion of Trump's tax bill, which is expected to increase the debt burden on the world's largest economy. Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said, 'In some way, all paths led to a weakening of the US dollar, and the rise in the US budget deficit has raised concerns about future Treasury bond issuances, leading to a higher yield and causing people to flee the US dollar.' The US Congress approved a version of Trump's tax bill last week, which is expected to add around $3.8 trillion to the federal government's debt of $36.2 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Trump said on Sunday that the bill is likely to undergo 'big changes' during its discussion in the Senate. The investors' confidence in US assets has been eroded in recent months due to Trump's unpredictable trade policies. In the latest example, Trump backed down from his threat to impose a 50% tariff on EU shipments starting June 1, causing the euro to rise to its highest level in a month. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Monday that the euro could become a viable alternative to the dollar if governments can strengthen the eurozone's financial and security framework.

**Dollar rises as Trump delays EU tariffs, Brazil's Haddad seeks compensation for IOF reversal**
The dollar closed in the positive on Monday (26/5), opening the last week of business in the month, marked by the release of inflation and employment data in Brazil, as well as indicators in the United States. The markets welcomed the news that US President Donald Trump delayed the imposition of 50% tariffs on products purchased from the European Union (EU) until July 9. The measure was taken after Trump spoke with Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he received a call from von der Leyen, requesting an extension of the deadline from June 1 to July 9. Trump agreed to the extension, saying it was a 'privilege' to do so. Von der Leyen stated on social media X that she had a 'good conversation' with Trump, but needed more time to 'reach a good agreement.' The EU and US share the closest and most consequential commercial relationship in the world, and the EU is ready to advance negotiations quickly and decisively. However, Trump has been adopting protectionist measures to protect the US economy, which has been met with opposition from affected countries. In the domestic scenario, investors' attention turned to Brasília, where a meeting took place between President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Minister of Finance Fernando Haddad. The meeting was the first between the two since the government's announcement of new fiscal measures last week. Haddad stated that the government still needs to decide on measures to compensate for the receding of the IOF increase, which was initially announced but later withdrawn. 'We have until the end of this week to decide how to compensate,' Haddad said. The last week of May will be marked by the release of economic data in Brazil and the US.

**Trump Postpones Decision on 50% Tariff on European Imports Until July 9**
US President Donald Trump has postponed his decision on imposing a 50% tariff on European imports until July 9, as requested by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. This decision comes after Trump threatened to impose the tariff on June 1. The new deadline coincides with the end of the 90-day truce between Brussels and Washington, during which the US has suspended a 20% tariff on EU imports, but continues to apply a 25% tariff on cars, steel, and aluminum, as well as a 10% universal tariff. The EU has also frozen tariffs on $21 billion worth of US products in response to Trump's metal tariffs. Judith Arnal, a researcher at the Real Instituto Elcano, believes that Trump's decision is motivated by a desire to 'demonstrate politically that he sets agendas for other leaders and forces diplomatic movements by other leaders.' She also notes that the EU's firm stance has hindered negotiations, and that Trump may be trying to 'call attention to the EU to accelerate negotiations.' Bloomberg Economics estimates that a 50% tariff would reduce the US GDP by 0.06% and inflation by 0.03%, and would cut European exports to the US by half. Analysts agree that neither side wants to break off negotiations, and that a deal, although not ideal, is better than no deal. Germany has urged calm ahead of the deadline, while José Manuel Marín Cebrián, an economist and founder of Fortuna SFP, describes the situation as a 'tragicomedy of finance.'

**Trump Recommends 50% Tariff on EU Starting June 1, 2025**
US President Donald Trump has recommended imposing a 50% tariff on the EU starting from June 1, 2025, citing 'unproductive' trade negotiations. Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, 'The European Union, created to take advantage of the US in trade, has been very difficult to manage. (...) Our conversations with them are not yielding results! Therefore, I recommend a 50% tariff for the European Union starting from June 1, 2025. No tariff will be applied if the product is manufactured in the United States.' Trump also mentioned the 'powerful trade barriers' of the EU, including VAT, corporate sanctions, non-monetary trade barriers, monetary manipulations, and unjustified demands against US companies, which have generated an 'unacceptable' trade deficit. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that 'with the exception of the EU', most countries are 'negotiating in good faith' and hopes that Trump's warning will motivate the EU to act in favor of a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Polls: Trump Job Approval Stabilizing, But Still Underwater**
Donald Trump's job-approval ratings have stabilized in May after a decline in April, but he remains more unpopular than popular. According to the Silver Bulletin polling averages, Trump's net job approval improved from minus 9 percent on April 30 to minus 6.2 percent on May 15. However, some of the improvement is attributed to Trump-friendly polls, while other polls, such as Economist-YouGov and Reuters-Ipsos, show little change in their trend lines. Silver Bulletin's averages on the intensity of approval and disapproval are also stable, with 27-28% strongly approving and 41-42% strongly disapproving. Trump's job-approval ratings on handling particular issues, such as the economy and trade, have also shown little change. The generic congressional ballot also shows recent stability, with Democrats leading by a two-point margin (45.5% to 43.5%). As the 2026 midterm elections approach, this metric will become increasingly important.

**At 100 Days, Trump Approval Rating Is As Low As First Term**
Donald Trump's approval rating has dropped to its lowest point in his second term, mirroring his first term's performance at the 100-day mark. According to the Silver Bulletin, Trump's net approval rating has fallen to -9.1%, with 53.2% of Americans disapproving of him. The trend lines are concerning, with Trump's approval rating dropping into the 30s in the latest AP-NORC poll. Trump has been attacking pollsters, claiming they are 'Negative Criminals' suffering from 'Trump Derangement Syndrome.' However, the reality is that polling outlets like Times-Siena and Fox News accurately predicted the 2024 results. Trump's approval rating is deteriorating across issue areas, including immigration, the economy, and tariffs. Independents are souring on Trump, with 56% disapproving of his job performance on immigration and 70% on tariffs. Trump's unraveling of his party's coalition could be a significant challenge for his second term.

**Voters 'soured quickly' on Trump as his 'poor start only gets worse': analysis**
MSNBC Opinion Editor James Downie has observed a 'vibe shift' in Americans' feelings toward Donald Trump's policies, with a decline in his approval ratings on issues such as immigration and deportations. According to Downie, Trump's net approval on immigration issues is minus 5%, and on deportations specifically, it's minus 10%. Downie notes that Trump's second-term approval ratings are 'eerily similar to his first: a poor start that only gets worse.' He attributes the decline to Trump's handling of the economy, writing, 'voters soured quickly on Trump's economic policies.' Downie also criticizes politicians and some members of the media for caving to Trump's demands or portraying his agenda as popular, saying it does a disservice to their readers.

**Donald Trump's approval rating is dropping**
Donald Trump's approval rating has dropped by 14 points since he entered office, more steeply than the five-point drop he had suffered by this time in his first term. His handling of the economy has a net rating of minus-seven percentage points, with nearly one in five of his own voters disapproving of his handling of inflation and prices. The administration's policies, including the tariff rollercoaster, have directly affected some of his voters and caused a 19% drop in the S&P 500. While his base remains enthusiastic, swing voters and infrequent voters who were disillusioned with the economy under Joe Biden are turning against him. According to The Economist's analysis of YouGov data, Mr. Trump has a net negative approval rating in all six swing states he flipped away from Joe Biden in November's presidential election. The biggest test will be the midterm elections in 2026, which will determine control of Congress and the fate of Mr. Trump's agenda.

**Donald Trump's Approval Ratings Plummet Amid Economic Concerns**
According to a recent Economist/YouGov poll, 51% of Americans disapprove of Donald Trump's work, while 43% approve. This represents a 14-point drop from the same poll on January 20, the day of Trump's inauguration, when 49% approved and 43% disapproved. The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Report also shows a 30-point drop from December, with concerns about personal finances, income, inflation, the job market, and business environment worsening. The main concern among Americans is inflation, followed by the job market and the economy. Trump's agenda, which prioritizes issues like migration and security, ranks lower in the polls. Experts believe Trump is misinterpreting the economic situation and that his policies will not bring more employment or reactivate the economy. The risk of a recession in 2025 has increased to over 60%, and the stock market has experienced extreme volatility due to the uncertainty caused by Trump's words and actions.

**Opinion | Voters are not happy with Trump's trade war**
Donald Trump's trade war has opened cracks in the Republican coalition and could transform economic issues from Republicans' strength to their weakness. Trump's economic approval ratings have taken a hit, with disapproval among independents and even among Republicans. The recent chaos in the markets has further accelerated the decline. A CBS News/YouGov poll found that most voters consider Trump more responsible for the current state of the economy than Joe Biden, despite Biden's unpopular record on inflation. This presents an opportunity for Democrats, who had previously been seen as the weaker party on this issue, to ride a wave of negative economic sentiment in the 2026 midterms and potentially even the 2028 presidential election. 'The public's favorable view toward Trump's handling of the economy continued into his presidency,' but now 'the same consumer confidence metric crashed to its lowest point since June 2022.' As Leon Sit and Max McCall, partners at Split Ticket, an election data analysis firm, noted, 'This is the first major political issue where Trump's once fully unified base has begun to show cracks.'

**Trump's Approval Rating Keeps Getting Worse**
Donald Trump's job approval ratings have continued to decline since his inauguration, with a net negative rating of minus-4.3 percent as of April 9, according to Silver Bulletin polling averages. This represents a 15.9 percent drop from his net positive rating of 11.6 percent on Inauguration Day. Trump's approval ratings have been particularly low among Latino voters, with 58 percent disapproving of his job performance in a late-March CBS poll, and among under-30 Americans, with a net favorability rating of minus-29 percent in an Economist-YouGov poll. Trump's handling of the economy has also been a point of contention, with a 45 percent to 48 percent approval ratio on his job-approval ratings for managing the economy in an April 1 Economist-YouGov survey. Additionally, a March 31 CBS News survey showed 64 percent of Americans thought Trump's focus on lowering prices was 'not enough.' The negative reaction to Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariff program and market chaos it is causing may be the most immediate problem for Trump going forward, with a recent Navigator Research poll showing 44 percent of registered voters approving of Trump and 53 percent disapproving.

**Massive polling shift: Trump is tanking on the issue voters care about most**
President Donald Trump has hit a record-low approval rating for his handling of the economy, with a net approval rating of minus 14 points in March, according to CNN data guru Harry Enten. This is a sharp drop from the plus 6 points Trump had on the economy in January. Enten noted that the economy and inflation remain the top issues for Trump, but only 36% of Americans believe he is prioritizing the economy and 29% believe he is prioritizing inflation. Enten stated, 'They, simply put, do not believe his mind is in the right place. He is not prioritizing the problem that they think is greatest right now to the American people.' Trump's economic policies have upended global trade and the U.S. markets, with costly tariffs targeting Mexico, China, Canada, and the European Union, which experts warn will drive up prices for consumers in the U.S.

**Donald Trump's Popularity in a Mixed State as He Begins Second Term**
Donald Trump's popularity is in a mixed state as he begins his second term as President of the United States. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on March 4, 2025, only one-third of Americans approve of his handling of the cost of living, a central issue for many citizens. On the other hand, 54% of respondents disapprove of his economic policy, illustrating a growing sense of concern about inflation and rising prices. Despite these criticisms, Trump maintains a global approval rating of 44%, a relatively stable figure and higher than that of his predecessor Joe Biden at the end of his term. This situation highlights the persistence of a solid electoral base, despite growing challenges to his management of economic and social affairs. Trump began his second term with the lowest net approval rating ever recorded for a newly elected president since 1953, according to The Times. The Gallup institute indicates that his net approval rating is -1%, compared to 0% during his first term in 2017. 47% of Americans currently support his presidency, while 48% disapprove, reflecting a persistent polarization between his supporters and detractors. The economy appears to be one of the main challenges facing the president. While Trump relies on economic growth through massive tax reforms and increased tariffs, analysts remain skeptical about the real impact of these measures. Previous tariff increases have already weighed on household purchasing power and fueled inflation, a problem that his administration must urgently address to regain the confidence of voters. As the mid-term elections approach, Trump's popularity will be a key issue for Republicans, who must convince Americans of the effectiveness of ongoing reforms. If economic results do not meet expectations, his approval rating could continue to erode, opening the way for a new political battle within his own party.

**Trump's First Month: Victory at Home, Danger Abroad**
One month into his second term, Donald Trump has made significant progress on his coalition's priorities, including changing Washington, tackling inflation, and sealing the border. His job approval rating remains above water, and Congress's approval rating has spiked as Republicans confirm Trump's cabinet and pursue his agenda. However, Trump's success could be threatened by his tendency to overreach in foreign policy, which could lead to trade wars, military conflict, and wasted political capital. Trump's domestic agenda, including his support for a 'big, beautiful' House bill, is crucial to his legacy and the fate of the Trump majority. The 2024 electorate's top issues were the economy and jobs, immigration, and stopping Washington's slide into stagnation and decline. Trump has delivered on these issues, but his success depends on stable prices and enacting his domestic agenda in 2025 and holding the GOP House in 2026.
