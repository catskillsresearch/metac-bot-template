**The High Demand for Top Scientists and Researchers in the AI Industry**
The profession of the future is in high demand, but few people dominate it. According to Fortune, companies are being forced to pay more to recruit top scientists and researchers. For example, Google paid $2 billion to acquire Character AI, a company founded by Noam Shazeer, and its team. Other companies, such as Meta and OpenAI, are also offering high salaries and stock options to attract top talent. As Tim Tully, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said, 'That was unimaginable when I hired scientists four years ago.' The salary for AI researchers has also increased, with some startups offering base salaries of $350,000. As Garett Gentry, a talent recruiter, said, 'We've seen many offers from startups in AGI and robotics, where the base salary was $250,000, but now it's more competitive.' The economic value of these scientists is high, and companies are willing to pay top dollar to recruit them.

**China's Rise in AI: A Warning for the US**
China's technology is rapidly gaining ground worldwide, with applications like DeepSeek, Temu, and TikTok becoming increasingly popular. The country's free and open-source AI models are also gaining traction globally. In contrast, the US economy's digital growth, which reached $2.6 trillion in 2022, is largely due to Western dominance in the market. To benefit from the next AI revolution, the world needs to choose the US's computing stack - algorithms, applications, and hardware - over China's. China has made significant strides in 12 years, from being an imitator to a leader in producing world-class products, often surpassing those of the West. The country is now racing to implement robots on a large scale, with plans to mass-produce humanoid robots. To stay ahead, the US needs to learn from China's successes, share its AI technologies and research openly, innovate faster, and invest more in AI diffusion across the economy.

**Anthropic CEO Predicts Technological Singularity in Six Months**
According to the CEO of Anthropic, the human race is only six months away from reaching technological singularity, a concept where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. This prediction contrasts with the most conservative scientific estimates, but reflects the unprecedented acceleration in the development of artificial intelligence since the emergence of models like ChatGPT. The study by AIMultiple, which examines 8,590 predictions from scientists, business leaders, and the tech community, reveals that expectations about the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and singularity have changed dramatically in recent years. While scientists predict AGI around 2040, business leaders are more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The study documents how predictions vary over a nearly 50-year spectrum, from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to estimates that extend several decades. However, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, with industry leaders consistently more optimistic in their predictions than the scientific community in general. The study examines different thresholds of AI, including AGI and superintelligence, providing a comprehensive view of expectations in the field. The research tracks changes in these predictions over time, especially after the emergence of large language models that have transformed the landscape. The analysis offers several perspectives on why many experts consider the arrival of AGI inevitable, including the lack of apparent limits to machine intelligence, the Law of Moore, and the potential of quantum computing to compensate for engineering barriers. Not all experts consider AGI a certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is more multifaceted than the current definition of AGI. Yann LeCun, a pioneer of deep learning, suggests that AGI should be rebranded as 'advanced machine intelligence' and argues that human intelligence is too specialized to be replicable. The report also notes that, although AI can be a valuable tool for making new discoveries, it cannot make these discoveries on its own. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, allowing for more discoveries per experiment,' the analysis details. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer,' the document obtained by AIMultiple states. While individual predictions from experts and scientists about AGI vary over a period of approximately half a century, the message is clear: human society will inevitably face incredible changes as a result of these algorithms. Whether these changes will be good or bad, according to the research, depends on us.

**Trump's Policies May Help China Dominate AI Competition**
The Trump administration's policies may inadvertently help China dominate the AI competition. The US has retreated from its commitment to openness, which has been the foundation of its technological leadership. Measures aimed at bringing innovation back to the US may ultimately pave the way for China's dominance. The evolution of the digital economy can provide insight into the current AI competition. In the 1990s, the US led the internet revolution, dominating the key phase 'from zero to one', quickly transferring innovations from the lab to the market. This fueled what many called the 'new economy', characterized by rapid growth, increased productivity, and low inflation. China, initially a follower, later injected dynamism into the digital economy by scaling its own innovative technologies. China's digital development has gone through three stages. This dynamic is already evident in fields like renewable energy and electric vehicles (EV), and AI is no exception. After the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, which may have marked the transition of AI to the era of mass adoption, China quickly demonstrated its ability to copy Western models. The release of DeepSeek in January signaled China's entry into the localization and refinement stage, as the R1 model from the company was 30-50 times cheaper to use than the OpenAI model. By February, the gap in performance between the best Chinese and American models had narrowed to 1.7%, compared to 9.3% in 2024. ChatGPT reached 100 million active users in two months, while DeepSeek achieved this milestone in just seven days. One of China's key advantages is its large reserve of engineering talent. The country annually graduates four times more STEM students than the US. Besides its massive size, this 'engineering dividend' reflects a strong work ethic and a pragmatic mindset focused on complex, practical optimization, as demonstrated by the system architecture of DeepSeek. With over 1 billion internet users and a diverse industrial base, China also offers unprecedented conditions for the deployment, testing, and refinement of AI programs. China accounts for nearly 30% of global production, generating enormous amounts of data. Only in 2019, its production sector produced 1,812 petabytes of data, which we estimate to have reached 2,435 petabytes in 2024. Energy is another critical factor. In 2023, China produced approximately 9,456 terawatt-hours of electricity - 32% of the world's total. China doubles the production of the US, giving it a significant advantage in powering large data centers necessary for the widespread adoption of AI. The positions of the US in the AI competition are further eroded due to Trump's cuts in research funding and immigration restrictions. For example, in February, the Trump administration fired 170 employees of the National Science Foundation, including AI experts, and proposed cutting the agency's budget by more than 50%. These cuts, along with the delay in funding the National Institutes of Health and the freezing of approximately $2.2 billion in federal grants to Harvard University, risk halting fundamental research and hindering innovation in AI. Meanwhile, the restrictive immigration policy is likely to complicate the US's ability to attract and retain talent from around the world. This may potentially trigger a brain drain, as qualified Chinese technical workers return home to take well-paying jobs in the developing sector. Although the Trump administration supported large infrastructure initiatives, such as the Stargate - a proposed $500 billion AI data center that OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank are supposed to build - such projects risk exacerbating the dominance of large tech companies and stifling the innovations needed to achieve transformative technological breakthroughs. However, a deeper problem lies in the US's retreat from economic openness. As American companies like OpenAI become increasingly closed, Chinese firms are transitioning to open-source strategies. While Trump's trade and immigration policies scare off global talent and international partners, China actively promotes its cheap AI models to trading partners. China undoubtedly faces its own internal challenges, which are exacerbated by US trade restrictions limiting its access to advanced semiconductors. In the internal sphere, Chinese policymakers must find a delicate balance between encouraging innovation and ensuring strict control over data. Although neither side has an easy path to dominance in AI, Trump's MAGA agenda may inadvertently help China regain its former greatness.

**Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei Warns AI Could Eliminate 50% of Entry-Level Office Jobs**
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warns that AI could eliminate 50% of entry-level office jobs and cause a 10-20% spike in unemployment in the next one to five years. Amodei says that AI companies and the government need to be honest about the impact of AI on the workforce, which he believes will lead to a mass erasure of jobs in various fields. He suggests that the public, business leaders, and lawmakers need to be more aware of the threat of AI and its potential to replace human workers. Amodei believes that there are ways to prevent the worst scenarios from unfolding, including warning the public, encouraging people to become familiar with AI, and implementing policies to help American workers if the U.S. economy becomes dominated by AI. As Amodei said, 'We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming.' He added, 'I don’t think this is on people’s radar.' Amodei also stated that AI will go from merely assisting people to actually doing their jobs in 'as little as a couple of years or less.'

**Anthropic CEO says AI will kill half of white collar entry-level jobs for Gen Z**
Bill Gates predicts that AI will replace humans in most white-collar jobs, including biology, energy, and software development fields, within the next 20 years. According to Anthropic's CEO, there is a 99.999999% probability that AI could end humanity. Gates emphasizes the importance of being honest about the impact of AI technology, stating, 'We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming.' AI is already affecting entry-level jobs, with some experts warning that it could lead to a significant disruption in the job market. OpenAI, however, does not believe that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is a significant threat. Gates notes that it is not just personal security and privacy that are concerns, but also job security, saying, 'Now it is our office workers who are staring down the same kind of technological and economic disruption. Breaking first is the bottom rung of the career ladder.'

**Your Biggest Questions About AGI - Answered**
Google's I/O developer conference revealed that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is likely to arrive around 2030, according to co-founder Sergey Brin and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis. AGI will impact various industries, including data centers, raw materials, metals, energy, software, semiconductor chips, robotics, and healthcare. The U.S. healthcare industry is expected to grow faster than any other sector in the U.S. economy due to AI's influence. AI could revolutionize the biotech sector by boosting the success rates of new therapies and reducing the average expense and timeline of advancing these candidates through clinical trials. The pharmaceutical industry is actively integrating AI into their drug-development processes, with many companies paying tens of billions of dollars to snap up promising biotech companies. AGI will also boost demand for metals like platinum and copper, with platinum demand expected to grow by double digits for several years in a row. 'Stealth' AGI refers to non-tech companies adopting and applying AI to reap huge gains in efficiency, productivity, and profits. 'I believe that the pharmaceutical industry, in aggregate, will reap handsome rewards from the expansion of AI in healthcare, especially as AGI continues to advance,' said the author. 'The future that lies ahead is not simply a continuation of what has been... it is a complete departure from anything we have ever known.'

**The Beginner’s Roadmap to Investing in AGI**
Futurist Eric Fry believes that the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within the next 12 to 24 months will revolutionize the business world. He suggests that investors should focus on companies that are adapting to this seismic shift by investing in AI technologies. Fry proposes a three-step approach: investing 'in' AI, investing 'alongside' AI, and investing in 'stealth' AI. Companies that provide key infrastructure for AI, such as Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, are good investments. Additionally, companies that will benefit from the rise of AGI, such as data centers and companies that provide raw land for data centers, are also good investments. Furthermore, non-tech companies that will adopt and apply AI to increase efficiency and profits, such as companies in the biotech sector, are also good investment opportunities. Fry emphasizes that only companies that adapt quickly to this change will survive, and he has 41 investment recommendations that have reached over 1,000% gains on his track record.

**Widespread Adoption of General Artificial Intelligence Predicted for 2026**
According to a report by Foresight Investment, the widespread adoption of general artificial intelligence (AGI) is expected to occur within the next 2 years, with a predicted time frame of 2026. The report also forecasts that the global economy will experience a significant growth rate of over 7% in the next 7 years, up from an average of 3% over the past 125 years. Goldman Sachs predicts that AI will contribute to an average annual increase in US labor productivity of 1.5% to 2.9% over the next 10 years. The report highlights four key characteristics of AI: 1) pervasiveness, which enables the development of related industries; 2) collaboration, which optimizes the allocation of labor, capital, and technology; 3) substitution, which reduces the impact of aging and low fertility on labor; and 4) creativity, which leads to more concentrated knowledge and technology production. The report also discusses the potential impact of AI on various industries, including manufacturing, transportation, and supply chains, as well as its potential to create new opportunities for traditional industries. 'AI+ will bring creative changes to traditional industries, with endless possibilities for individual users, business users, and governments,' said the report.

**AI to Surpass Human Capabilities in Five to Ten Years, Predicts Demis Hassabis**
Demis Hassabis, CEO do Google DeepMind and Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry in 2024, predicts that artificial intelligence (AI) will surpass human capabilities in the next five to ten years. 'Current AI systems are very passive, and there are many things they cannot do,' Hassabis said during a meeting at the DeepMind headquarters in London. 'But, in the next five to ten years, many of these resources will start to emerge and we will begin to move towards what we call general artificial intelligence (AGI).' Hassabis also stated that 'we still have a lot of work to do in research' and that 'we have not yet reached that point.' Other leaders, such as Robin Li, CEO of Baidu, also predict that AGI will become as competent as humans, but in a more distant future. 'AGI is still a few years away,' Li said during the VivaTech conference in Paris last year. 'Today, many people talk about AGI, and they say that it will probably be here in two years, or in five years. I think we are more than 10 years away.' The workforce is already feeling the impact of AI, with 41% of CEOs believing they will need to reduce their workforce in the next five years, according to a report by the World Economic Forum. The skills of these employees, including reading, writing, math, and manual dexterity, will be eliminated with the advent of AI; chatbots, machines, and large language models (LLM) are moving faster than humans and do not require benefits or salary.

**AI and Jobs: What Happens Next?**
The rapid development of AI is causing a disconnect between the pace of innovation and our collective readiness for its implications. Big tech companies are making record profits while cutting thousands of jobs, with many citing AI investment as a factor. AI leaders predict that we could reach Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) before 2030, potentially less than five years away. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, stated that 'AI will be writing 90% of the code in three to six months, and essentially all of the code in twelve months.' This displacement is already happening at an unprecedented pace, with research showing a 30% decrease in writing jobs, 21% decrease in software development roles, and 10.4% decrease in engineering positions after ChatGPT's introduction. The World Economic Forum projects that 39% of current skill sets will become outdated between 2025-2030. Amodei suggests that universal displacement might be less socially destructive than selective displacement. We need to rethink our social structures and start asking fundamental questions about the usefulness and uselessness of human life in a world where AI can learn new skills faster than humans can retrain. Perhaps part of the answer lies in stronger communities, where people find meaning in their connections with each other rather than just their work. 'We need to think about usefulness and uselessness in a different way than we have before,' Amodei said. 'We can build a world where human life is meaningful, and humans, perhaps with the help of AIs, build really great things.'

**Nadella Warns Against AGI Hype, Calls for Real Economic Transformation**
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has warned against the hype surrounding Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and called for real changes in the economy. He criticized the current focus on 'AGI milestones' as 'meaningless hacking' and urged a more grounded approach to measuring AI progress. Nadella pointed to current economic indicators as evidence that AI has not yet transformed the economy. While developed countries see growth of around 2%, the real growth rate after inflation is around 0%. He claims that true progress based on AI should generate growth rates of 5-10%, similar to what was seen during the Industrial Revolution. Nadella believes that technology companies will not be the main winners in the potential AI transformation, but rather core industries that integrate AI as a 'product' to boost their productivity. 'When that happens, we'll be in order as an industry,' Nadella said. His views align with Microsoft's interests, as the growth of Azure cloud depends heavily on the widespread adoption of AI in industries. Nadella expects a global computing power AI arms race to create a surplus of supply in the coming years, as companies and countries rapidly scale up their capabilities. While Microsoft continues to expand its data centers, Nadella says they are doing so within constraints. He warns against simply scaling up computing power and hoping demand will follow. Technology must provide real value to clients, he asserts, and demand and supply must eventually find a balance. Looking ahead to 2027-2028, Nadella seems to be looking to rent tons of cheap H100s, anticipating a price drop due to the expected surplus of supply. 'I'm excited to be renting a lot of capacity in 27, 28 years, because I look at the builds and say: 'This is fantastic.' The only thing that will happen with all the computing builds is that prices will drop,' Nadella said. Nadella rejects concerns that AI will completely eliminate cognitive work. Instead, he sees a transformation: while AI can automate existing cognitive tasks, it also creates opportunities for more complex work. He cites email as an example - instead of sorting messages, people could focus on analyzing the most important ones. Nadella believes that people and advanced AI systems can coexist without diminishing human cognitive abilities. However, our understanding of cognitive work will continue to evolve.

**'10-Year Timeline for AGI: Sam Altman's Predictions and Concerns'**
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, predicts that a general-purpose artificial intelligence (AGI) that matches human levels will emerge within 10 years. Altman stated that 'the development of AI is continuing to make rapid progress, and the pace of AI advancement is much faster than Moore's Law.' He also emphasized that 'our goal is to make AGI beneficial to humanity as a whole,' and that 'AGI systems are beginning to emerge.' Additionally, he noted that 'within 10 years, every person on the planet will be able to achieve more than the most influential person today due to AGI.' Altman also presented three perspectives on the economic feasibility of AI: 'AI model intelligence grows with the resources used to train and execute it,' 'the more resources spent, the more consistent and predictable performance improvement is achieved,' and 'the scaling law is accurately applied.' He also stated that 'the cost of using AI decreases by 10 times every 12 months, and as costs decrease, usage increases exponentially.' Finally, he emphasized that 'even slight improvements in AI performance have significant social and economic ripple effects, and we must not stop investing in AI.' However, he also mentioned potential drawbacks of AGI, such as its use by authoritarian governments for mass surveillance and control, and social inequality. He stressed that 'it is essential to distribute the benefits of AGI widely' and 'to provide a kind of 'compute budget' and reduce costs to make AI accessible to everyone.'

**The AI infrastructure boom—fueling the next economic revolution?**
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reiterated the company's commitment to ensuring that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. Altman highlighted the AI scaling law, which states that bigger datasets create bigger models, necessitating greater investment in AI infrastructure. This has led to massive investments in AI capabilities, with four major companies - Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft - planning to spend a combined $315 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025. This investment is expected to drive rapid economic growth, with historical parallels suggesting that the AI revolution could lead to incredibly rapid economic growth. According to philosopher Nick Bostrom, a successful AI revolution could lead to the world economy doubling in size about every two weeks. Altman emphasized the importance of ensuring that the benefits of AGI are broadly distributed, and that increasing equality may require new ideas. The scale of investment signals that major players are betting on AI as the next fundamental driver of economic revolution.
