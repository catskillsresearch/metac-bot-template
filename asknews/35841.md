**Jonas Vingegaard Sets Sights on Tour de France and La Vuelta**
Jonas Vingegaard, the double winner of the Tour de France, has announced his goals for the 2025 season. He will target the Tour de France, where he aims to regain the title currently held by Tadej Pogačar, and La Vuelta, a competition he has been eager to win. Vingegaard has chosen to postpone his debut in the Giro d'Italia for another year. He will start the season in Paris-Niza and then participate in the Volta a Catalunya, where he will face Primoz Roglic, Mikel Landa, and Enric Mas. 'The Tour de France will be my main goal,' Vingegaard said. 'It's the biggest race of the year. Anyone can feel through television why it's so special. I want to win it again and arrive in the best physical condition possible.' Visma's sports director, Grischa Niermann, added, 'We have work to do if we want to win the Tour de France. In the two times we succeeded, we were very well tactically. Last year, we weren't bad, but Tadej Pogačar was undoubtedly the best. We have to find a way to beat him. Jonas is our main hope, but we also have other great cyclists on the team.'
