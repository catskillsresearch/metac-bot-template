**Sen. Graham gets a 2026 challenge from Democrat Annie Andrews, ran against Nancy Mace**
Dr. Annie Andrews, a pediatrician from Charleston, announced her candidacy for the 2026 U.S. Senate seat in South Carolina, challenging four-term incumbent Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Andrews criticized Graham for his 'waffling positions' and 'lack of conviction,' citing his past criticisms of President Donald Trump and his current alliance with him. She also criticized Graham's votes to confirm Trump's Cabinet picks and his relationship with Elon Musk. Andrews joins at least one other Democrat in the primary field and faces an uphill battle in a state where Republicans typically hold a double-digit margin in statewide elections. Graham has held the seat since 2003 and has a significant fundraising advantage, but Andrews is confident that voters are 'strained under the effects of the Trump administration's chaotic policies' and are looking for change.

**Lindsey Graham draws Democratic Senate challenger who previously lost congressional race**
Dr. Annie Andrews, a South Carolina pediatrician and former Democratic House candidate, announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Andrews, who lost to Rep. Nancy Mace in the 2022 election by about 14 percentage points, criticized Graham in a campaign ad, saying he is 'full of s---' and has been a senator for half of her lifetime. She also criticized several Trump allies and Cabinet secretaries, including Elon Musk, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Pete Hegseth. Andrews said she wants to prioritize making the child tax credit permanent if elected to the Senate. Graham was initially critical of Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, but later became one of his most vocal supporters. Andrews said Graham has changed his position on nearly every issue throughout his 22 years in the Senate and doesn't 'stand for anything other than himself.'

**Rep. Bill Huizenga considering launching U.S. Senate campaign this summer**
U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga, a Republican from Holland, is considering running for the U.S. Senate in 2026 and could announce his campaign as soon as this summer. Huizenga said, 'I want to make sure we win,' and believes he has a good chance of winning the Senate seat. He is currently in a potential GOP primary race with former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who has received the backing of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. However, Huizenga is confident that he can win the primary and the general election, saying, 'Are we going to run the same play and expect a different result?' The U.S. Senate seat is open in 2026 after U.S. Sen. Gary Peters decided not to seek another term. Democrats are also vying for the seat, with U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens being one of four candidates seeking their party's nomination.

**Poll:Lindsey Graham Vulnerable in Home State of South Carolina Primary**
A recent poll commissioned by Lynch for Senate found that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is vulnerable in his home state of South Carolina's Republican primary. The poll found that 57% of Republican primary voters in South Carolina would not vote for Graham if the election were held today, and that they are dissatisfied with his performance. When compared to Mark Lynch, a businessman running against Graham, the senator still failed to garner majority support, with 43% of voters supporting him and 29% supporting Lynch. The poll also found that 60% of likely primary voters in South Carolina believe a successful businessman would do a better job as a political leader than a career politician. Mark Lynch said, 'Now is the time President Donald Trump needs politicians around him he can trust to enact his MAGA agenda for the American people.' Graham's campaign spokesperson responded by calling the poll 'fake news.'

**Trump mega-bill clears hurdle after rebels drop opposition | News**
A key hurdle has been cleared for the 'One Big, Beautiful Bill', a mega-bill central to US President Donald Trump's domestic agenda, after several lawmakers dropped their opposition. The bill, which pairs an extension of Trump's first-term tax cuts with savings that will see millions of the poorest Americans lose their health coverage, is expected to add more than $4.8 trillion to the federal deficit over the coming decade. Republicans plan significant cuts in spending, including new restrictions on the Medicaid program that would result in more than 10 million people losing coverage. Moderate Republicans fear the cuts could upset the party's prospects in the midterm elections, while deficit hawks on the far right insist the cuts don't go far enough. 'We don't like smoke and mirrors,' said Ralph Norman of South Carolina. 'We want real cuts.' The bill will face challenges in the Senate, where Republicans are demanding major changes. 'This is the largest spending reduction in at least three decades, probably longer,' Norman said. 'It's historic.'

**Trump's big bill advances in rare weekend vote as House conservatives negotiate changes**
The House Budget Committee advanced the 'One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act' in a rare weekend vote, despite concerns from conservative Republicans and Democrats. The bill, which includes new spending and tax cuts, was met with criticism from Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who said, 'We are writing checks we cannot cash, and our children are going to pay the price.' The start date for work requirements for able-bodied Medicaid participants was pushed back to 2029, with some Republicans arguing that it should be sooner. Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina said, 'We've got a lot more work to do,' and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called the bill 'one big, beautiful betrayal.' The bill now moves to the Senate, where Republican lawmakers are eyeing changes that could make final passage more difficult.

**SC Rep. Ralph Norman joins hardline Republicans stalling Trump's tax megabill**
U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman joined a group of hardline conservatives in delaying the GOP megabill, which would reshape U.S. domestic policy and stymie Republican efforts to pass the legislation desired by President Donald Trump. Norman stated, 'No bill is better than a bad bill,' and said that he would vote 'no' until substantial changes were made to address spending concerns. The bill includes a massive overhaul of the Medicaid program, shifting increased costs to states, adding new work requirements, and more frequent eligibility verifications. Norman said, 'We've made progress, but it just takes time,' and that lawmakers might have to work through the weekend to address concerns. Trump wrote on social media, 'Not only does it cut Taxes for ALL Americans, but it will kick millions of Illegal Aliens off of Medicaid to PROTECT it for those who are the ones in real need.' However, Norman and other conservatives remain opposed to the bill, with Norman stating, 'If we're going to continue to have just what I mentioned — able-bodied Americans getting checks, illegals getting checks, subsidies that go to corporations that shouldn't get them — I'm out.'

**SCOOP: Key House Freedom Caucus member 'seriously considering' run for governor in 2026**
Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., is 'seriously considering' a run for South Carolina governor in 2026, according to Norman himself. Norman, a conservative fiscal hawk and key member of the House Freedom Caucus, has been in office for eight years and believes he is doing a good job. However, he also stated that he may return to Congress, citing his support for term limits. Norman's comments appear to be a marked escalation in his flirtations with higher office, following previous reports that he was thinking about running for governor. Norman would be on a collision course with fellow House conservative Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., who is also 'seriously considering' a run for governor.

**South Carolina congressman heaps praise on Musk and DOGE at Spartanburg town hall forum**
Rep. Ralph Norman praised Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) at a town hall event in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Norman acknowledged that tariffs will affect prices but believes they will be used as leverage for better trade deals and immigration control. He also stated that there will be a 'shock' from DOGE recommendations and cuts, but reassured constituents that Social Security will not be cut. However, concerns were raised about the potential impact on education and special needs students, with Norman advocating for the elimination of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs in education. Norman said, 'There's not going to be cuts in Social Security,' but critics dispute DOGE's claims of finding massive amounts of fraud. Norman also stated that public education will be in DOGE's sights, and that he supports the eradication of DEI programs at all levels of education.

**Check them off: In just over 2 weeks, Trump has completed most of his campaign platform**
President Donald Trump has completed most of his campaign platform in just over two weeks, according to analysts. Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said, 'This is comparable to the full presidencies of other Presidents and those who’ve preceded him in the Oval Office.' Trump has delivered on several key promises, including: sealing the border and stopping the invasion of illegal aliens, conducting the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, making America the world's dominant energy producer, implementing large tax cuts for workers and no tax on tips, ending the weaponization of government against the American people, strengthening and modernizing the military, keeping men out of women's sports, and securing elections. South Carolina Republican Rep. Ralph Norman expressed optimism that the current Congress will pass legislation to make these changes permanent, saying, 'We want to fund that. And you know, it’s just a real relief that now we’re not just talking about it, but we’re doing it.'
