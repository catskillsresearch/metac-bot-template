**China Does Not Rule Out New Military Exercises Around Taiwan**
China has not ruled out launching a new wave of military exercises around Taiwan, according to a statement from the Chinese military. The Chinese Army declared, 'We are always prepared to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.' Zhang Xiaogang, the Chinese Defense Ministry's spokesperson, stated, 'As long as provocations continue, there will be no peace.' He warned that if Taiwan continues to 'provoke', it will 'shoot itself in the foot.' Zhang also emphasized that the solution to the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese people and that they will not accept any interference, a reference to the potential role of the United States in a conflict. The spokesperson added that in the event of war, 'people like William Lai (Taiwanese president) will be the first to flee.' Some analysts have suggested that China may use the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival to launch a new wave of military exercises around Taiwan. The Taiwanese military reported that China's oldest aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, was sailing in waters southeast of the island. This comes amid a surge in Chinese military activity around Taiwan, with over 50 Chinese warplanes crossing the median line of the Strait and entering Taiwan's self-proclaimed Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in recent days.

**China urges US to halt arms sales to Taiwan, stop escalating tensions**

According to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian, 'Taiwan question lies at the heart of China's core interests and is the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations.' China firmly opposes US arms sales to Taiwan, with Lin stating that China's 'resolve to safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity remains steadfast.' China's Defense Ministry spokesman Zhang Xiaogang also condemned the US for 'continuously expanding' its military build-up and 'provoking' an arms race in outer space, warning that US actions 'will once again open the Pandora's box.'

**Why Taiwan fears outside world will abandon it if China invades**
Taiwanese officials are concerned that their country will struggle to gain international support if China invades, as Taiwan's independence is recognized by only 12 countries worldwide. Liang Wen-Chieh, deputy minister of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, said, 'Ukraine is a [United Nations] member state, and Taiwan is not. Therefore, if there is war between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, we will undoubtedly receive much less aid from the international community than Ukraine.' China is expected to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, and Beijing regularly threatens any nations that attempt to recognize Taiwan's sovereignty. However, some experts believe that global skepticism of the China-Russia axis following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 could work in Taipei's favor. Ukrainian Armed Forces Cmdr. Oleh Shyriaiev said, 'Civilized capitalist countries will be protecting the world from the plague that is communism.'

China has intensified its diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan in recent years, and has forced the loss of several diplomatic allies for the island. Taiwan, on the other hand, has defended its autonomy and sovereignty, and has stated that its future can only be decided by its 23 million inhabitants.

**China could try to seize Taiwan's outer islands, claims intelligence report | Taiwan News | May. 28, 2025 16:59**
A US intelligence report claims that China may attempt to seize Taiwan's outer islands, including Kinmen and Matsu, to pressure Taipei and test Washington's resolve. The report, released by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), warns that China may increase its military presence around Taiwan's offshore territories, potentially advancing from maneuvers to seizure operations. According to the report, China has various military options to coerce Taiwan, including air and maritime blockades, seizure of outlying islands, and a full-scale amphibious invasion. However, the report notes that China is likely to defer seizing Taiwan by force as long as it calculates unification can be negotiated. The DIA warns that China will continue to use diplomatic, information, military, and economic pressure to coerce Taiwan and discourage it from taking steps toward independence. The report also notes that China will likely seek to test Washington's resolve to defend Taiwan, with Guam serving as the primary staging ground for military operations. The think tank warns that China may escalate its efforts to erode Taiwan's sovereignty over its outlying territory of Kinmen in a short-of-war coercion campaign. As The Independent pointed out, Kinmen and Matsu lie more than 160 km from Taiwan's main island but sit just off the coast of China, making them vulnerable to Chinese attack. According to The Independent, previous reports have already identified Kinmen and Matsu as the most vulnerable parts of Taiwan's territory.

**China Rejects Taiwan's Sovereignty Stance, Calls it a 'Separatist Provocation'**
China has rejected Taiwan's stance on sovereignty, calling it a 'separatist provocation'. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, stated that 'Taiwan has never been a country' and that the recent statements by Taiwan's Foreign Minister, Lin Chia-lung, are 'arrogant and ignorant'. Mao emphasized that 'there is only one China in the world' and that 'Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory'. The spokesperson reiterated that the Chinese government is the only legitimate representative of China and that the reunification of China will be achieved. This stance is a 'basic principle of international relations' and 'a widely recognized consensus by the international community'. China's position responds to Lin's statement that 'Taiwan is not part of the People's Republic of China' and that its sovereignty 'cannot be decided by Beijing'. The Taiwanese government, led by the Democratic Progressive Party, has defended that Taiwan is a de facto independent country and that its future can only be decided by its 23 million inhabitants.

**Taiwan Demands China Recognize Sovereignty and End Military Harassment**
Taiwan's government has asked the Chinese regime to 'face reality' and recognize the island's sovereignty, and to stop its military harassment. Chiu Chui-cheng, head of the Council of Mainland Affairs (MAC), said, 'The Republic of China is a sovereign and independent country.' He urged the Chinese Communist Party to 'listen sincerely to Taiwan's goodwill' and 'realistically recognize the firm defense of the Taiwanese people of their free and democratic way of life.' Taiwan's President William Lai has reaffirmed his willingness to engage in dialogue with China, but only on equal and dignified terms, without compromising the island's sovereignty. Lai said, 'We will continue to defend the democracy and freedom we have worked so hard to build.' China's response was immediate, with the Office of Taiwan Affairs of the State Council's spokesperson, Chen Binhua, saying that Taiwan's 'independence' is 'fundamentally incompatible' with peace in the strait. Chiu rejected this statement, calling it 'an old and rigid ideological stance.' Taiwan has long accused China of trying to undermine its democratic system through disinformation campaigns, military pressure, and infiltration operations. In response, Taiwan's government has announced new immigration restrictions for citizens of Hong Kong and Macao, aimed at strengthening national security. Chiu said, 'We have added a period of national security observation to ensure the overall security (...). This provides another option for Hong Kong residents and ensures greater security for our citizens.'

**Taiwan slams Vietnam's acceptance of Beijing's 'one China' claim | Taiwan News | Apr. 17, 2025 10:37**
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of Taiwan has strongly condemned a joint statement by China and Vietnam that referred to Taiwan as part of China. MOFA said that the statement is 'a serious distortion of the facts' and reiterated that Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country. The ministry stressed that Taiwan's position on defending national sovereignty remains firm and unchanged, and called on the international community to 'jointly counter China's false claims and not condone China's malicious attempts to mislead global public opinion and undermine Taiwan's national sovereignty.' MOFA also pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has never ruled Taiwan. 'Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country and is not subordinate to China,' MOFA emphasized. 'Any claim that distorts Taiwan's sovereignty cannot change the internationally recognized cross-strait status quo,' the ministry added. MOFA's statement came after Vietnam affirmed Beijing's claim that 'Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory' during a visit by Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan strongly condemned the statement made by the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, that 'Taiwan has never been a country and will never be one in the future.' The Taiwanese government emphasized that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign and independent nation, and any attempt to undermine its sovereignty is unacceptable. Mao Ning claimed that the 'One China' principle is a widely recognized international norm and a basis for China's relations with other countries. However, the Taiwanese government argued that this principle is a 'crazy and absurd statement' that violates the will of 23.5 million Taiwanese people. The Taiwanese government reiterated that it will not be swayed by China's attempts to undermine its sovereignty and will continue to exercise its rightful authority as a sovereign nation.

**Taiwan's Uncertain Future in the Shadow of China**
Taiwan, a small island nation, is waiting in the shadows for the status quo to remain unchanged. The island is threatened by China, which has been seeking to reunify with Taiwan since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. The United States has a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan, which was signed in 1955 and is set to expire in 2056. However, under the Trump administration, the US has taken a more isolationist approach, imposing tariffs on its allies and trading partners, and not prioritizing relations with other countries. This has left Taiwan in a precarious position, as China continues to exert pressure on the island. The article notes that Taiwan's status is still uncertain, and that the island is not recognized as a sovereign state by the international community. The US has historically been Taiwan's main supporter, but the current administration's approach has left Taiwan waiting to see if the US will continue to uphold its commitment to defend the island.

**Taiwan Rejects China's Claim of 'China Taiwan Province'**
China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated at a press conference that the United Nations and its specialized agencies refer to Taiwan as 'China Taiwan Province'. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly refuted this claim, calling it a distortion of facts and an attempt to mislead the international community. They urged the international society to recognize and counter China's efforts to distort the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, which they claim is an attempt to reinterpret the resolution as an internal issue. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized that the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are mutually exclusive, and that the Communist Party has never governed Taiwan. They also stated that any attempt to distort Taiwan's sovereignty status is futile and cannot change the internationally recognized status quo in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's future must be decided by its 23.5 million people, and China has no right to interfere. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned China to recognize the fact that Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country, and that it has never been part of the People's Republic of China. They also urged the international community to recognize China's attempts to distort the resolution and to support Taiwan, and to take concrete actions to counter China's efforts to reinterpret the resolution and change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.

**Taiwan Rejects China's Claim of Peaceful Reunification**
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China (Taiwan) has responded to the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) statement that they are willing to achieve peaceful reunification with Taiwan. The CCP's statement, made by spokesperson Mao Ning, claims that they will do their best to achieve peaceful reunification, but also reserves the right to take necessary measures to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity. However, the Taiwanese government has strongly rejected this statement, saying that Taiwan and China are mutually exclusive and that the CCP has never ruled Taiwan. The Taiwanese government also pointed out that the 2758th resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, which recognized there is only one China, does not imply that Taiwan is part of China. Taiwan's future must be decided by its 23.5 million people, not by the CCP. The Taiwanese government has urged the international community to recognize the fact that Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country, and that the current status of the Taiwan Strait is that of mutual non-subordination, which is an objective fact recognized by the international community for a long time.

**Taiwanese Foreign Ministry Rejects China's Claims of Peaceful Reunification**
The Chinese Foreign Ministry has stated that China is willing to pursue peaceful reunification with Taiwan with the greatest sincerity and effort. However, the Taiwanese Foreign Ministry has responded by saying that this is a blatant disregard for facts and a reversal of right and wrong. They have warned China to recognize the fact that Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country, and that the two sides are not subordinate to each other, which is the current status of the Taiwan Strait and a long-standing international fact. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated, 'We have always adhered to the one-China principle and the 1992 consensus, and are willing to pursue peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and effort. At the same time, we will take all necessary measures to defend our national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and resolutely oppose Taiwan independence and external interference.' The Taiwanese Foreign Ministry has reiterated that Taiwan and China are not subordinate to each other, and that the Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan. Any distorted statements about Taiwan's sovereignty status are unable to change the internationally recognized status of the Taiwan Strait. The future of Taiwan must be decided by the 23.5 million Taiwanese people, and China has no right to intervene. The Taiwanese Foreign Ministry has also urged the international community to recognize China's attempts to distort the meaning of the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, and to try to turn the Taiwan issue into an internal affair and prevent international support for Taiwan. They have also called for continued action to counter China's efforts, and to clearly oppose China's repeated misinterpretation of the resolution and its attempts to change the fact that the two sides are not subordinate to each other. They have also refuted China's claim that the 'one-China principle' is an international consensus, and have called for the joint maintenance of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region.

**US Congress Passes Bipartisan Resolution Criticizing China's Use of UN Resolution 2758**
A bipartisan resolution was passed in the US Congress on February 21, criticizing China for weaponizing the 1971 UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 to confuse the US's Taiwan policy. The resolution, signed by eight lawmakers, including Senators Jim Risch and Jeanne Shaheen, and Representatives John R. Moolenaar and Chris Coons, states that the US does not recognize China's claim of sovereignty over Taiwan. Risch said, 'We see China's malicious tactics and support Taiwan's friends.' Shaheen added, 'Beijing is trying to prevent Taiwan from meaningfully participating in the UN, further weakening international support for Taiwan. This bipartisan resolution clearly shows that the US will not stand idly by.' The resolution emphasizes that the US will ensure that China cannot distort history and that Taiwan's sovereignty is respected in the international community.
