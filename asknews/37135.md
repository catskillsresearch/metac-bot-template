**US Scientists Report 757 Documented UFO Sightings, Cartels Suspected of Using Drones for Espionage and Drug Trafficking**
US scientists have reported 757 documented cases of UFO sightings. According to Ron Vitello, a US Customs and Border Protection advisor, cartels have 'unlimited funding' that allows them to implement new technologies, including drones, to smuggle drugs into the US. In 2023, a US military F-16 Viper fighter jet was damaged by a UFO while flying over Arizona, forcing it to be temporarily taken out of service. The incident was confirmed by official documents from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA has confirmed that it is investigating all reports of UFO sightings, especially those that are confirmed by radar data. The US government has documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of them occurring in airspace. Only 49 cases have been officially closed. Many of the sightings occurred in areas where military exercises were taking place in Arizona and surrounding states. Some officials, including Vitello, believe that these objects may be drones used by cartels for espionage or drug trafficking. According to NewsNation, cartels have already used similar devices to transport up to 10 kg of cargo at a time. Vitello stated, 'They have unlimited funding, which allows them to implement new technologies that the US has not seen before.' This, he believes, is part of the business model of criminal organizations that continuously improve their methods of delivering prohibited substances into the US.

**US Government Reports 757 UFO Sightings, Including One That Damaged an F-16 Fighter Jet**
In 2023, a unidentified flying object (UFO) was reported in the US, colliding with an F-16 fighter jet during a training mission over Arizona, causing damage to the aircraft. According to The New York Post, these unidentified objects have been seen in groups of up to eight and have been classified as drones on occasion. 'Pentagon investigators and the Federal Aviation Administration have confirmed that these sightings have been documented every time a pilot has reported them to the corresponding air traffic control facility', says the medium. The incident is just one of a number of mysterious objects that have been spotted over the US Air Force's training fields in Arizona, according to multiple reports by The New York Post. Three more encounters with these objects were detected the following day. 'There has been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things from Arizona, particularly at the border' with Mexico, said former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo to the medium. The US government has presented 757 reports of this type between May 2023 and June 2024, of which 708 occurred in the air, and only 49 were marked as 'Case closed' in the latest report issued by the Office of Anomaly Resolution. The US government has dismissed, for now, the security threat posed by these sightings, but some officials, including Ron Vitiello, principal advisor to the US Customs and Border Protection Office, suggest that the mysterious objects could be drones used by foreign cartels to spy or smuggle drugs. Vitiello stated that the 'unlimited funding' of the cartels could explain the advanced technology never seen before. 'Perhaps they have technology that we are not used to seeing in the drone sector', said Vitiello.

**UFO crashes into US Air Force fighter jet over Arizona**
A US Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet was hit by an unidentified flying object, believed to be a drone, over Arizona on January 19, 2023. The collision cracked the canopy protecting the pilot, but no injuries were reported. The incident is one of 22 reported UFO sightings by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), there have been hundreds of UFO reports made in recent years, with Arizona becoming a hotspot for sightings. AARO, the Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, has received 757 UAP reports worldwide between May 2023 and June 2024, with at least 410 occurring over the US. Whistleblowers have revealed that many UFO sightings are taking place in Arizona, particularly on the border, and some believe that Mexican cartels may be involved in launching high-tech spy missions into the US. 'A lot of people reporting a lot of things out of Arizona, particularly on the border,' said Luis Elizondo, a former government intelligence officer. 'I've seen orbs that were off in the distance. I've seen crafts that were cigar-shaped, I've seen triangles,' said Bob Thompson, a former US Customs and Border Protection agent.

**UFOs Are Swarming U.S. Military Zones -- And One Just Crashed Into a Fighter Jet**
A U.S. F-16 fighter jet collided with an unidentified flying object (UFO) during a training mission over Arizona in January. The object, described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system,' or UAS, hit the plane's canopy mid-flight. This incident is one of dozens of reported midair encounters between military pilots and strange objects over restricted airspace in the Southwest. Since 2020, military pilots have reported encountering objects such as metallic spheres, drones, and objects moving at high speeds. Former Pentagon UAP investigator Luis Elizondo said, 'These reports are coming in constantly,' and former CBP official Ron Vitiello speculated that the technology behind these objects may be more advanced than what's publicly known. The U.S. government has logged 757 sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena from May 2023 to June 2024, with only 49 marked 'case closed.'

**Mysterious UFOs Swarm Over US Air Force Training Fields in Arizona**
A UFO that collided with a US Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet in January 2023 is just one of a swarm of mysterious objects buzzing around the Air Force's training fields in Arizona, according to multiple reports. The unidentified flying object struck the 'bubble canopy' of a $63 million F-16 Viper, damaging it and temporarily grounding the aircraft, according to FAA documents. The military aircraft was hit by an orange and white 'UAS' (unmanned aerial system) while in the air, according to the FAA documents. 'There's been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things from Arizona, particularly along the border with Mexico,' said former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo to NewsNation this month. The FAA told The Post in a statement that the agency 'documents unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) sightings whenever a pilot reports one to a air traffic control facility.' The government reported 757 such incidents between May 2023 and June 2024 (708 of which occurred in the air) and only 49 were marked as 'Case closed' in the latest report from the Office of Anomaly Resolution. The small unidentified objects seen in Arizona fly in groups of up to eight and are sometimes characterized as drones, according to War Zone, which noted that the incidents took place at high altitudes near military combat training sites since January 2020. 'They're clearly being transmitted through multiple military reporting channels,' added War Zone. Some US officials, including Ron Vitiello, chief advisor to US Customs and Border Protection, speculate that the mysterious flying objects could be drones used by foreign cartels to spy or smuggle drugs. 'Maybe they have technology we're not used to seeing in the drone space,' said Vitiello.

**Unidentified Flying Objects: A Mysterious Phenomenon in Arizona**
The US Air Force has reported multiple incidents of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in Arizona, with some incidents involving collisions with military aircraft. According to the New York Post, a report by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that a mysterious object collided with an F-16 fighter jet worth $63 million in January 2023, causing damage and temporarily grounding the aircraft. The FAA documents also mentioned three other encounters with drones in the same day. Former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo told NewsNation that there was a lot of activity and many reports of strange phenomena in Arizona, particularly along the US-Mexico border. The FAA stated that it investigates reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) whenever a pilot reports them to the Air Traffic Control Center. If the information is confirmed, the FAA shares the report with the US Department of Defense's Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, which is responsible for investigating UAPs that pose a threat to national security or safety. Between May 2023 and June 2024, the US government received 757 reports of UAPs, with 708 of them being investigated in the air and 49 cases being closed. The small, unidentified objects have been spotted in groups of up to eight and are sometimes classified as drones. Some US officials, including Ron Vitello, the US Customs and Border Protection's chief of operations, believe that the mysterious objects could be drones used by foreign cartels for espionage or drug trafficking.

**Mysterious pulsating 'UFO' hovers over California for 15 minutes**
A video taken by an unnamed resident in Twentynine Palms, California on April 27 captured a mysterious, pulsating 'UFO' flying over the desert for approximately 15 minutes. The witness described the object as a brightly-lit hexagonal craft that moved slowly and irregularly, with jerky movements and varying speeds. The object also appeared to change shape, morphing from a six-sided object into a circle. Officials at the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) investigated the sighting, but were unable to find an explanation, noting that a SpaceX rocket launch had taken place earlier that day, but it was in Florida and occurred three hours earlier. The witness reported that they had clear vision and had not taken any'mind altering substances' during the sighting.

**'Extraterrestrial' Video Sparks Debate: Jaime Maussan Shares Mysterious Footage**
Mexican journalist Jaime Maussan shared a video on social media that appears to show a strange being descending from the sky in California. According to Maussan, the video was recorded on April 4, 2025. However, the authenticity of the video is disputed. Maussan describes the being as 'an organic entity, very rare.' While some speculate that the being could be a drone, a bird, or a person with aerial equipment, others point out that the image is blurry and lacks context, raising doubts about the video's authenticity.

**Alleged KGB report detailing encounter between Soviet soldiers ans a UFO**
A report claiming that Soviet soldiers were 'petrified' by extraterrestrial beings in Ukraine has been refuted by experts as a fake. The report, presented as a declassified CIA file, describes a UFO encounter where 23 soldiers turned into stone after opening fire on aliens. However, former CIA agent Tracy Walder said, 'This is not a document that the CIA originated,' and explained that the report actually came from an open-source service called the Foreign Broadcast Information Service. Walder reassured the public that the report wasn't written by the CIA. The report has sparked interest in UFOs, now officially termed UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena), which surged in recent years. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense formed a UAP Task Force to track, analyze, and catalog unusual aerial sightings. According to The Economic Times, last year alone, the Pentagon received 757 UAP reports from the public between May 2023 and June 2024.

**A Quick Guide to Reporting UFO Sightings: Tips and Precautions**
According to a report by the Pentagon, there were 757 UFO sighting reports between May 2023 and June 2024. If you think you've seen something unusual in the sky, follow these five steps to ensure your report is taken seriously: remain calm, observe carefully, take note of details such as shape, color, and movement, record evidence like photos and videos, and report to experts. The credibility of a sighting increases when multiple people report similar observations. However, be cautious when sharing your experience on social media, as it can quickly turn into a conspiracy theory. As Psychic World suggests, 'it's essential to maintain a level head and gather as much information as possible to ensure a thorough investigation.'

**What did the Pentagon reveal about bizarre egg-shaped UFO case in new announcement?**
The Pentagon has launched an investigation into claims made by US government contractor Jake Barber, who alleges he was involved in secret missions to recover alien technology. Barber described piloting helicopters during classified operations and encountering an 'egg-shaped' craft with no visible engine or thermal signatures. The case has been added to the 21 ongoing UAP investigations being conducted by the Department of Defense, which recently disclosed receiving 757 UAP reports between May 2023 and June 2024. Despite increased government acknowledgment of UAP encounters, skepticism remains, with investigative journalist Ross Coulthart raising concerns about the extent of disclosure. Congress is also stepping in, with Representative Anna Paulina Luna leading a new task force aimed at declassifying government secrets, including information related to UFOs.

**Leaked recording: US Air Force pilot reports UFO over California in 2024**
A US Air Force pilot reported a UFO sighting in September 2024 while flying a Beechcraft 350 in California. The pilot, identified as 'Troy 21,' described a football-sized, dark, cylindrical object passing underneath his wing. The incident was reported to the National UFO Reporting Center. Radar systems on the plane detected an object 60 miles away, but it is unclear if it was the same object. The UFO's speed exceeded Mach 2 within two minutes, which is not possible for most drones. This incident is one of several recent UFO sightings, including a temporary suspension of operations at the Gaziantep Airport in Turkey due to a reported UFO sighting.

**Whistleblower Reveals Details of Secret UFO Retrieval Program**
NewsNation has obtained exclusive footage of a spherical UFO that was recovered during a UAP retrieval operation. The footage shows a white, egg-shaped object that is similar to the UAP encountered by US Navy fighter jets in 2015 off the East Coast of the USA. Whistleblower Jake Barber believes that he was involved in the retrieval of extraterrestrial technology while working for a secret UFO retrieval program. Barber described the object as 'a white egg' and stated that it was 'not human' and 'anomalous'. He also claimed that his team's reaction to the object made it clear that they were dealing with something extraordinary. NewsNation has also obtained an exclusive video of a UAP retrieval operation, which will be aired in a special report on Saturday at 20:00 (local time). This report follows a previous interview with whistleblower David Grusch, which was broadcast by NewsNation in June 2023 and led to several Congressional hearings.

**US Senator Marco Rubio Expresses Concerns about UFOs and National Security**
US Senator Marco Rubio has expressed concerns about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) detected over US military bases and operations. In a 2020 interview with CBS-Miami journalist Jim DeFede, Rubio stated, 'There are things flying over our military bases and operations that we simply don't know what they are, and they're not ours.' Rubio also mentioned that these objects possess technological properties and capabilities that the US does not have, which he believes poses a national security risk. Rubio was instrumental in transforming the US Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) into the US UFO Investigation Agency AARO in 2022. In a 2023 interview, Rubio stated that the government has information that is not yet available to the public, but 95-99% of the information discussed in a secret briefing could be made public without compromising national security. Rubio also expressed his desire to inform the public about UFO sightings and to continue investigating these phenomena. In June 2023, Rubio commented on the statements of UFO whistleblower David Grusch, who reported on a secret UFO recovery and investigation program run by the US government. Rubio stated that there are 'additional, high-ranking, and direct witnesses to UFO recovery programs of the US government'.
