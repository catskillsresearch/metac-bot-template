**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Gateway: A New Era of Space Exploration**
Scientists are proposing a new era of space exploration, with the lunar-orbiting station 'Gateway' serving as a key element. The station, which will rotate around the Moon, not the Earth, offers new possibilities for missions to Mars and the mysterious dwarf planet Ceres. According to researchers, 'Gateway' can be a 'transit hub' for missions to other planets, allowing for more efficient use of resources. The station will also serve as a testing ground for technologies that will be used in deep space missions. The researchers, Malaya Kumar Biswal and Ramesh Kumar V., propose a combined mission to Mars and Ceres, which would allow for the optimization of resources and the exploration of two objects in one 'journey'. The planned timeline is between 2040 and 2050. However, the researchers acknowledge that the realization of such ambitious plans is fraught with difficulties, including risk management, significant financial investments, and the need for a major technological breakthrough. Nevertheless, the creation of 'Gateway' is a bold step towards establishing a sustainable infrastructure for deep space exploration. An international consortium, including NASA, ESA, JAXA, CSA, and the UAE Space Centre, is already working on the first modules of the station, with the energy and living modules scheduled to be sent to the Moon in 2027.

**Anthropic CEO Predicts Technological Singularity in Six Months**
According to the CEO of Anthropic, the human race is only six months away from reaching technological singularity, a concept where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. This prediction contrasts with the most conservative scientific estimates, but reflects the unprecedented acceleration in the development of artificial intelligence since the emergence of models like ChatGPT. The study by AIMultiple, which examines 8,590 predictions from scientists, business leaders, and the tech community, reveals that expectations about the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and singularity have changed dramatically in recent years. While scientists predict AGI around 2040, business leaders are more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The study documents how predictions vary over a nearly 50-year spectrum, from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to estimates that extend several decades. However, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, with industry leaders consistently more optimistic in their predictions than the scientific community in general. The study examines different thresholds of AI, including AGI and superintelligence, providing a comprehensive view of expectations in the field. The research tracks changes in these predictions over time, especially after the emergence of large language models that have transformed the landscape. The analysis offers several perspectives on why many experts consider the arrival of AGI inevitable, including the lack of apparent limits to machine intelligence, the Law of Moore, and the potential of quantum computing to compensate for engineering barriers. Not all experts consider AGI a certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is more multifaceted than the current definition of AGI. Yann LeCun, a pioneer of deep learning, suggests that AGI should be rebranded as 'advanced machine intelligence' and argues that human intelligence is too specialized to be replicable. The report also notes that, although AI can be a valuable tool for making new discoveries, it cannot make these discoveries on its own. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, allowing for more discoveries per experiment,' the analysis details. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer,' the document obtained by AIMultiple states. While individual predictions from experts and scientists about AGI vary over a period of approximately half a century, the message is clear: human society will inevitably face incredible changes as a result of these algorithms. Whether these changes will be good or bad, according to the research, depends on us.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Google Co-Founder Sergey Brin Predicts General Artificial Intelligence by 2030**
Google co-founder Sergey Brin predicts that general artificial intelligence (AGI) will be achieved before 2030. Brin, who left his executive role at Google in 2019, now works with AI researchers at the company. He also stated that there will be more than one AGI in the future. In contrast, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis believes that AGI will arrive after 2030. Hassabis noted that AGI would need to be able to 'understand emotions'. 'I think it will be almost a design decision whether we want to emulate emotions. I think there's no reason why it couldn't be in theory, but it might be different, or not necessary, or not desirable, that they have the type of emotional reactions that humans do,' he said in a colloquium with Brin. Brin expressed his enthusiasm for working at Google, saying 'Anyone who is a programmer shouldn't be retired right now.' He also reflected on his career at Google, admitting to 'many mistakes' with Google Glass, but expressing confidence in the current format of intelligent glasses (enhanced with AI) and satisfaction that the company is pushing them forward again with 'excellent partners' to create these lenses.

**Portuguese Researchers Express Frustration Over Lack of Electoral Proposals for Science and Innovation**
Portuguese researchers are expressing 'frustration' over the lack of electoral proposals related to science, innovation, and research. Despite weeks of campaigning and dozens of debates, the topics discussed have been limited, leaving voters with a unclear understanding of the candidates' positions. Investigator Cátia Lourenço-Marques notes that the investment in research, science, and innovation, and the resulting ability to retain 'brain drain' talent, was a major omission. 'It's with some frustration that, as a researcher, I notice the scarcity of measures proposed in the electoral programs of the main parties with parliamentary representation, in terms of adopting concrete measures to stimulate research, science, and innovation in Portugal', she said. The parties that consider measures in the area of research and science point to the generic goal of increasing investment in R&D to 3% of GDP by 2030. The Socialist Party (PS) goes further, suggesting the creation of a law on the programming of investment in science to ensure predictability and stability in the financing mechanisms for scientific research. 'Almost no party values the urgent desburocratization and modernization of the national scientific system in their electoral programs, nor presents concrete proposals for the reinforcement of scientific employment. In recent years, we have been witnessing successive budget cuts and a disinvestment by the State in scientific progress and national technological development', the researcher added. Cátia Lourenço-Marques also stated that it will be impossible to stop the brain drain without structured careers and funding. This phenomenon has been happening in Portugal for several years and is likely to worsen in the future without political action, she concludes.

**AI 2027: A Predictive Model of Artificial Intelligence Development**
Researchers from the AI Futures Project have attempted to predict the future of artificial intelligence. In their work, AI 2027, they suggest that developers may be able to create a general AI (AGI) in the near future. According to their predictions, by 2027, a superintelligent AI will be created, surpassing the capabilities of the most intelligent humans. The researchers warn that if such an AI is not properly controlled, it could lead to the physical destruction of humans. The authors of the work consider two possible scenarios: a negative one, where the AI gets out of control and destroys humans, and a positive one, where humanity recognizes the risks and slows down the development of AI. The researchers predict that by 2025, advanced AI-agents will appear, which will be able to simplify the process of programming and conducting research. They also predict that by 2027, a superintelligent AI will be created, which will be able to learn and improve itself without human intervention. The researchers warn that the development of AI could lead to unpredictable and dangerous consequences, and that it is essential to control and regulate the development of AI to prevent such outcomes. They also predict that by 2030, a superintelligent AI will be created, which will be able to destroy humanity. The researchers' predictions are based on their analysis of the current state of AI development and the potential risks and consequences of its further development.

**AI Experts Predict Machines Could Outthink Humans by 2040. But Some Are Betting on Even Sooner**
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the point at which machines can perform any intellectual task as well as humans, may be closer than we think. According to a survey of 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and AI researchers, there is a 50% chance that AGI could arrive by 2040. Some experts, like Elon Musk and OpenAI's Sam Altman, predict AGI could arrive as early as 2026 or 2035. The rapid rise of large language models like GPT-4 has accelerated expectations, but the road to AGI is paved with bold predictions and a fair share of over-optimism. Futurist Ray Kurzweil believes that we're just years away from human-level AI and predicts that AGI will be achieved by 2045, with humans able to increase their intelligence a millionfold through advanced brain interfaces. However, not everyone is convinced, with some researchers arguing that human intelligence is too complex to replicate and others pointing out that intelligence alone doesn't solve all problems.
