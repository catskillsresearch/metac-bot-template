**US Dollar/TL Trades Flat at 39.2040 Amid Powell's Announcement**
The US dollar/TL is trading at 39.2040, maintaining a flat trend since the start of the week. The dollar/TL, which rose on Friday, is currently being watched by investors for the announcement of US Federal Reserve Chairman Powell. The dollar/TL has been trading at 39.2040 since the start of the week, after starting the week's first trading day flat. On Friday, the dollar/TL showed an upward trend, closing the day 0.3% above its previous close at 39.2100. As of 10:05 am today, the dollar/TL is trading flat at 39.2040. At the same time, the euro/TL is being sold at 44.7880 with a 0.7% increase, and the sterling/TL is being sold at 53.1610 with a 0.5% increase. The dollar index is also trading at 98.9 with a 0.4% decrease. The increasing risk perception due to the possible talks between the US and China, which have become more uncertain after the two countries' mutual accusations, is making it difficult for asset pricing. The uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's protectionist trade measures continues to be the main source of uncertainty for the global economy, while there are still questions about the inflationary effects of tariffs. In this context, the announcement of US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell today will be the focus of investors, who will be looking for clues about the Bank's future policies. Meanwhile, concerns about the US economy's financial situation continue, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying that the country will never default. Bessent's statements may have alleviated some of the growing concerns, but they are still causing investors to be cautious. Today, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data to be announced in the Eurozone and the US, as well as US Federal Reserve Chairman Powell's announcement, will be followed.

**Euro and Yuan Exchange Rate: Monday's Opening and Last Year's Variation**
The Euro and yuan opened at 8.2184 CNY on Monday, June 2, 2025, with a 0.27% variation from the previous day. In the last week, the Euro and yuan experienced a 0.31% change, and in the last year, a 3.86% variation. The yuan's positive trend suggests a strengthening of its value, indicating confidence in the Chinese economy, which could attract more investments in the future. However, it is essential to monitor if this trend continues in the coming days. The Euro and yuan's volatility in the last week (11.56%) is higher than its annual volatility (9.49%), indicating an unstable behavior with many variations. The Euro and yuan's exchange rate has fluctuated between 8.4 CNY (maximum) and 7.4 CNY (minimum) in the last 12 months.

**US-China Trade War Escalates, Impacting Global Markets**
The US stock market, NY Dow, has shown an upward trend since the 4/8 low, but there is a possibility that it will reach a ceiling on 5/19. The Japanese stock market, Nikkei 225, has exceeded the pre-Trump tariff high, but the 38,000 yen level is a high wall. The Trump administration's tariffs have had a negative impact, but the NY Dow has returned to its pre-tariff level. However, the tariffs are still in effect, and the US International Trade Court has ruled that the tariffs are illegal. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, and the final decision will be made by the US Supreme Court. The US-China trade war is escalating, with the US imposing a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports on 6/4. The Japanese stock market is expected to be affected by the trade war, and the Nikkei 225 is expected to face a high wall at 38,000 yen. The yen is expected to appreciate, and the Nikkei 225 is expected to fall. The trade war is also affecting the Chinese economy, with the Chinese yuan depreciating and the Chinese stock market falling. The Chinese government is expected to respond to the trade war, and the Chinese economy is expected to be affected. The US economy is also expected to be affected by the trade war, with the US stock market and the US dollar expected to fall.

**US Dollar Losing Dominance as World's Reserve Currency**
The US dollar is losing its dominance as the world's reserve currency, with a decline in its share of global currency reserves from 65% in 2014 to 58% in 2024. Analysts believe that this trend is driven by the increasing use of alternative currencies, such as the euro, yuan, and cryptocurrencies. Donald Trump's administration is seen as a key player in this shift, with some speculating that the decline of the dollar is a deliberate strategy to mask the true intentions of the US. The dollar's decline could be a result of the US's desire to create a new financial system, with the US dollar remaining at the center but with a greater emphasis on digital currencies and innovative financial instruments. The US is also developing its own digital currency, which could be a way to regain control over the financial system. The article suggests that the US is preparing for a multi-polar world, where several currencies will coexist and compete for influence. The dollar will likely remain the dominant currency, but the euro and yuan will gradually gain more importance, especially in regional trade blocs. Cryptocurrencies will also play a significant role in this new system, offering new possibilities for cross-border payments and investments. However, the article warns that this transformation must be done smoothly and without leading to financial crises and geopolitical conflicts.

**Will the New Taiwan Dollar Continue to Rise in June? Bankers Say to Watch Three Key Time Points**
The New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) has shown a strong upward trend in May, with a 6.98% increase, the largest single-month gain in over 36 years. Bankers say that the NTD's movement in June will depend on three key time points: the FOMC meeting on June 18, the US Supreme Court's decision on Trump's global trade policy, and the report on currency manipulation countries. According to the Central Bank, the NTD has risen by 2.088 NT dollars in May, with a 6.98% increase, the largest single-month gain in over 36 years. This year, the NTD has risen by 2.852 NT dollars, with a 9.53% increase, the highest among major Asian currencies. Bankers point out that there are only three key time points that will affect the NTD's movement in June. Firstly, the FOMC meeting on June 18 will be crucial, as the Fed will announce its monetary policy and economic forecast. Although the market expects the interest rate to remain unchanged, the recent slowdown in US inflation data and Trump's pressure on the Fed may lead to a change in the Fed's stance. Secondly, the outcome of the US-China trade talks and the US Supreme Court's decision on Trump's global trade policy will be important. The US Federal Reserve will also release its semi-annual currency report, which will list countries that have been accused of currency manipulation. This will also have an impact on the NTD's movement.

**US and China to Meet to Resolve Trade Dispute over Minerals**
The US Treasury Secretary, Bessent, believes that US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will speak to resolve trade issues, including a dispute over essential minerals. 'I think we'll see something very soon,' Bessent said, in the context of new attacks made by President Trump, accusing China of violating an agreement to reduce tariffs and trade restrictions on essential minerals. The two countries agreed to temporarily reduce 'reciprocal tariffs' between them for 90 days. US tariffs on Chinese imports will decrease from 145% to 30%, while Chinese tariffs on US products will fall from 125% to 10%. 'I'm confident that when President Trump and President Xi speak, this will be resolved,' Bessent continued. 'But the fact that they are holding onto some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement - perhaps it's a flaw in the Chinese system, perhaps it's intentional. We'll see after the President speaks with President Xi.' The interview was given to CBS. Last Friday, Trump said he was certain he would speak with President Xi Jinping. China said in April that the two leaders had not spoken recently. China is at the forefront of countries with a non-hegemonic foreign policy towards the US. Some statistical data also explains the fear of Americans. In 2024, for example, China was among the top 10 countries with the highest growth rate - 5%, according to official numbers. The first place was held by India (6.5%), followed by the Philippines (5.6%), Malaysia (5.1%), Indonesia (5.0%) and China (5.0%). In 2024, China's GDP totaled around 134.9 trillion yuan, equivalent to around $17 trillion to $19 trillion. In the first quarter of 2025, China's economy grew 5.4% compared to the same period last year. The market estimated a 5.1% increase in China's GDP (with Reuters). China was also one of the countries that most defended the expansion of the BRICS, hosted in the Asian country. One of the main debates within the bloc is the use of a common currency, which reduces dependence on the dollar for commercial transactions. Currently, the BRICS is formed by Russia, India, China, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Iran. The BRICS also includes partner countries - Belarus, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda and Uzbekistan.

**USD/CNY: Renminbi to Surge with Formation of Death Cross**
The USD/CNY exchange rate has declined from its annual high of 7.3500 on April 10 to a low of 7.20, with traders focusing on the trade relations between China and the US. The US and China have been in conflict since Donald Trump became president, with Trump imposing tariffs on Chinese products, which he believes will help reduce the trade deficit between the two countries. However, recent signs suggest that the crisis is escalating again, with the Trump administration taking unilateral decisions, including imposing export controls on key sectors, such as aviation, and Marco Rubio planning to expel thousands of Chinese students from the US. These issues are impacting both economies, with recent data showing that the PMI manufacturing sector rose from 49 in April to 49.5 in May, while the services sector index fell from 50.4 to 50.3. Despite this, there are signs that the Chinese economy will perform well in the long term, as it focuses on doing business with other countries and adapts well to technological restrictions. Key data points for the USD/CNY to watch this week include the Caixin PMI manufacturing data, S&P Global and ISM PMI manufacturing data, and the US labor market data, which is expected to show a significant increase in employment. The USD/CNY exchange rate is likely to continue falling, with the next key point to watch at 7.1200, as it has formed a death cross pattern, with the 50-day EMA crossing below the 200-day EMA.

**USD/CNY Forecast: Chinese Yuan to Rise Amid 'Death Cross' Formation**
The US dollar against the Chinese yuan (RMB) has seen a decline in recent weeks, from a high of 7.3500 on April 10 to 7.20, as traders focus on the trade relations between the US and China. The conflict between the two countries has been ongoing since Donald Trump's presidency, with the US imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliating with its own tariffs. However, the tensions eased in May after a meeting between US and Chinese representatives in Switzerland, where both sides agreed to lower tariffs and re-establish relations. Recently, there have been signs of the conflict escalating again, with the Trump administration taking unilateral decisions, including leaving control of exports in key sectors, such as aviation, and Marco Rubio planning to deport thousands of Chinese students from the US. The data published on Saturday showed that the PMI index for the manufacturing sector rose from 49 in April to 49.5 in May, while the services sector index fell from 50.4 to 50.3. However, there are signs that the Chinese economy will perform well in the long term, focusing on cooperation with other countries and doing well with technological restrictions. Key macroeconomic data to watch this week includes the Caixin PMI index for the Chinese manufacturing sector, the S&P Global and ISM PMI index for the US manufacturing sector, and the US employment data, which is expected to show a significant increase in job creation. The daily charts show that the USD/CNY pair has been under pressure in recent weeks, forming a double top pattern at 7.3318 and then falling below the neckline at 7.2185. The pair has also formed a 'death cross' pattern, with the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMA) crossing over, indicating a likely further decline, with the next key level to watch being 7.1200.

**China's April 2025 Economic Data Shows Continuing Deflationary Trend - Vision Times**
China's April 2025 economic data shows a continuing deflationary trend, according to analysts. The People's Bank of China (PBoC) reported a slight decrease in broad (M2) money supply, but an 8% rise compared to April 2024. Meanwhile, narrow (M1) money supply rose 1.5% year-on-year, but fell by 4.35 trillion yuan in April compared to March. Various types of loans decreased, while deposits fell. SinoInsider, a risk consultancy, notes that the data indicates a trend of 'deflation, weak credit demand, and an economy heavily reliant on government debt to mask underlying vulnerabilities.' The analysts observed that M2 money supply growth was not matched by a similar growth in M1 supply, indicating poor liquidity. They also noted that plummeting RMB loans and deposits reflect subdued credit demand and contracting financing activity, underscoring China's anemic domestic demand. 'Rising domestic skepticism, the U.S.'s imposition of steep tariffs on Chinese exports in early April 2025 disrupted the export sector, likely dampening economic sentiment and consumer spending,' the newsletter reads.

**China's Economic Shift: A New Order in the Making**
China is withdrawing from the US-led economic concert, reducing its exposure to US Treasury bonds and increasing its gold reserves. The country is also expanding its diplomatic influence in Asia, Africa, and Latin America through the Belt and Road Initiative. The yuan is being used in bilateral transactions with Russia, Iran, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia, eroding the US dollar's hegemony. The BRICS group, which includes China, Russia, India, Brazil, and South Africa, is discussing the creation of a common currency and a payment system alternative to SWIFT. The group's new members, including Argentina, Egypt, and the UAE, represent 36% of global GDP and 46% of the world's population. China's investments in Brazil are expected to reach $27 billion, with a focus on energy, infrastructure, and technology. The country is also promoting its currency, the yuan, as a global reserve currency. The US dollar's dominance is declining, with its share of global reserves falling from 71% in 1999 to 58% in 2023. The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts a multipolar world economy, with the BRICS group consolidating as a systemic alternative. China's digital currency, the e-CNY, is being tested in international transactions, and countries like Thailand and the UAE are launching pilot projects. The movement towards desdollarization is both practical and symbolic, reflecting a shift towards a more multipolar world.

**The Dollar's Grip on Global Trade is Slipping**
The dollar is losing its grip globally, particularly in Asia, as companies and financial institutions seek alternative currencies to hedge against the US currency. The Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) assessment test results showed an improvement in literacy levels across the board, with 49.9% of kindergarten students, 58.0% of first-graders, and 60.4% of second-grade students meeting or exceeding benchmark literacy goals. The Chinese yuan is gaining traction as a potential alternative to the dollar, with the People's Bank of China encouraging its use in international trade and investment. The yuan's share of global payments has risen to 4.1% in March, according to data from SWIFT, while the dollar's share has declined to 49%. However, the yuan's growth is still limited by its lack of international acceptance and the dominance of the dollar in global trade. The article also mentions that the yuan is being used in a significant portion of China's international trade, with the value of payments made through the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) reaching 175 trillion yuan (24 trillion dollars) in 2024, with a growth rate of over 40%. The article concludes that the dollar's dominance is being challenged, but it will take significant changes in the global economic environment for the dollar to be replaced.

**China ramps up yuan push, seizing on retreating dollar**
China is pushing for greater usage of the yuan as a global currency, taking advantage of the US dollar's decline in value due to aggressive tariffs. The People's Bank of China (PBoC) has strengthened its payment network in Vietnam and Cambodia, and announced steps to promote cross-border yuan settlement and other financial services. Analysts say that the yuan's appeal has increased as faith in the US currency and other US assets has been shaken. E Yongjian, vice general manager of Bank of Communications' research department, stated, 'The United States weaponising tariffs has cast doubt over US asset safety, undercut trust in the dollar, and shaken the greenback's global status.' China's central bank has also pledged to strengthen its homegrown cross-border yuan payment system CIPS and push forward with the application of blockchain. Chinese companies are demanding better financial systems as 'unilateralism, protectionalism... and higher tariffs impact the global supply chain,' PBoC vice-governor Lu Lei said. China has long harboured ambitions for the yuan to be a global currency, similar to the euro or dollar and reflective of the importance of the world's second-biggest economy.

**[Blog] End of dollar era? China's digital yuan is reshaping global trade & causing financial power shift**
China's digital yuan is reshaping global trade and causing a financial power shift, potentially ending the era of uncontested dollar dominance. The digital RMB, powered by blockchain technology, has reduced settlement times to seven seconds and transaction costs by 98%. This has led to a significant increase in cross-border transactions, with the total volume surpassing $1.2 trillion. The digital yuan's impact extends beyond efficiency, allowing countries under Western financial pressure to conduct transactions without US oversight. China's digital payment network is strengthening, and the US dollar's role as the world's reserve currency faces an existential challenge. The digital yuan is a foundational pillar of China's broader economic expansion strategy, integrating with the Belt and Road Initiative and creating a seamless trade infrastructure. The West, particularly the US and Europe, remains unprepared for this revolution, with regulatory debates and hesitancy on digital currency frameworks. As China executes its digital currency strategy, the world must prepare for a future where digital currencies, led by China's digital yuan, reshape global finance.

**China Takes First Losses in Trade War with US**
China has taken its first losses in the trade war with the US, as the Chinese government has been forced to devalue its national currency, the yuan. This move comes in response to the new trade restrictions imposed by the US, which include tariffs of up to 104% on Chinese imports. The US market is a key market for China's economy, with exports to the US reaching nearly $3.6 trillion in 2024 and imports totaling $2.69 trillion, resulting in a trade surplus of around $1 trillion. The application of retaliatory measures in the form of tariffs is unlikely to provide significant support to the Chinese economy, as redirecting to alternative markets takes time. In the current circumstances, devaluation of the yuan appears to be the most effective tool. On April 8, 2025, the People's Bank of China set the yuan's exchange rate at 7.2038 per dollar, the lowest level since September 2023. Beijing is attempting to mitigate the impact of tariffs and increase the competitiveness of Chinese products on the global market by reducing the prices of Chinese goods in dollar terms, making them more attractive to consumers. China has resorted to this practice before, as noted by Becky Lu, a macroeconomic strategy specialist at Standard Chartered Bank, who stated that China uses the flexibility of the currency exchange rate to alleviate pressure on the economy in the face of increased tariffs. For ordinary Chinese citizens, this means a decrease in the purchasing power of the yuan and a need to increase production volumes. As a result, the well-being of the average Chinese citizen may decrease slightly. However, this trade war will not be without consequences for the US economy either. Economists predict an increase in inflation, leading to higher prices for American consumers. The outcome of this conflict is still unclear, and we can only wait and see how events unfold. Previously, experts evaluated China's response to the trade war initiated by Trump.

**Chinese Yuan Hits Historic Low Amid Escalating Trade War**
The Chinese currency, the yuan, hit a historic low of 7.3815 units per dollar in international markets. The Chinese government has relaxed its strict control over the yuan by allowing its daily reference rate to fall below 7.20 per dollar for the first time in 18 months, amidst the escalating trade war with the US. This move is seen as a possible way to boost Chinese exports, which are being heavily taxed by US President Donald Trump. However, the decision to allow the yuan to depreciate is a delicate one, as it may increase bearish bets on the Chinese economy, worsen capital outflows, further antagonize the US, and cloud the prospects of any trade negotiations. According to the People's Bank of China, the fixing rate, the central point of the exchange rate band, was set at 7.2038 per dollar, the highest since September 2023. This is the first time since Trump's election in November that the fixing rate has surpassed 7.20, a level seen by investors as a 'red line' of the government's intentions regarding the managed currency.

**Chinese Yuan Falls to Lowest Level Since 2023 Amid Escalating Global Trade War**
The Chinese yuan fell to its lowest level since 2023 on Tuesday, after the central bank eased its grip on the currency, in an attempt to counter the blow to exports due to the escalating global trade war. The yuan has weakened by 1% against the dollar this month, making it one of the weakest currencies in the world. According to Joe Wang, head of currency strategy at China's largest state-owned bank, 'after China's strong retaliatory move on Friday, market expectations that China will eventually devalue its currency have increased, and the pressure will not ease easily.' Some analysts and economists believe that a weak yuan will make exports cheaper and alleviate some of the pressure on China's trade and economy, but a sharp decline could fuel unwanted capital flows and threaten financial stability. 'The People's Bank of China will not want a sharp decline, or seek it as a feature of financial stability,' said Vishnu Varathan, head of Asia economics research at Mizuho Bank. The central bank set the midpoint, which allows the yuan to trade within a 2% band, at 7.2038 to the dollar, its weakest level since September 11, 2023, but higher than Reuters' forecast of 7.3321. The market is waiting to see when the central bank will allow the official midpoint to fall below 7.2 to the dollar, which could open the way for a decline to 7.35, a level not seen since 2023, and the weakest level for the yuan since the global financial crisis in 2008. Based on Tuesday's fixing, the yuan's onshore spot rate can fall to 7.3479. Market participants and analysts noted that the official midpoint has weakened significantly, but remains stronger than market expectations, indicating that the authorities are still keen to maintain stability in the currency and prefer to devalue it gradually. 'The widening gap between the guidance and market expectations still confirms the strong desire to control,' said analysts at Maybank in a note. They added: 'We expect a measured devaluation of the yuan with China's focus on potential trade talks/tariff escalation that could have a negative impact on the yuan.' The yuan's weakness led to a decline in its value in the domestic market to its lowest level at 7.34 to the dollar in early trading, its weakest level since September 11, 2023. The yuan had last traded at 7.3290 as of 03:40 GMT. The yuan fell to its weakest level in two months in the offshore market at 7.3677 before recovering all its daily losses to trade 0.05% higher at 7.3430 as of 03:40 GMT. The yuan has fallen about 1% against the dollar this month, making it weak during the year, under pressure from concerns about the economic impact of Trump's tariffs. Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie, said: 'In the face of Trump's tariffs, China will respond with a mix of tariff and non-tariff measures, but it is unlikely to see a sharp decline in the yuan (more than 10%).' He added: 'In addition to its declared preference for currency stability, China may also want to be considered a global stability force in such turbulent times.' In the stock markets, Chinese and Hong Kong stocks rose on Tuesday, stable after the regional market's strength and government support.

**Chinese Yuan's International Payment Share Rises to 4.33% in February**
According to the latest statistics from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the international payment share of the Chinese yuan (RMB) rose to 4.33% in February 2025, maintaining its position as the fourth most actively traded currency globally for the fourth consecutive month. The US dollar, euro, and British pound still hold the top three spots, with the US dollar's global payment share decreasing from 50.17% in January to 48.95%, the euro increasing from 21.98% to 22.25%, and the British pound decreasing from 6.91% to 6.89%. The Japanese yen, in fifth place, decreased from 3.7% to 3.68%.

**US Dollar Remains Unchallenged as Global Payments Leader**
The US dollar remains the global leader in payments, with its share in global foreign exchange payments exceeding 50% in January, according to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). This is the highest level since SWIFT revised its data collection methods in mid-2023. Despite warnings from former US President Trump to BRICS countries not to replace the US dollar as a reserve currency, the dollar remains the most widely used currency in international trade. Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said, 'If a currency is going to replace the dollar, it has to be better than the dollar.' The rise of alternative currencies, such as the Chinese yuan, which has increased its share in SWIFT's global payments ranking to 3.8%, is a challenge to the dollar's dominance.

**Petroyuan: A Seismic Shift Threatening Dollar Dominance**
Saudi Arabia's decision to explore the petroyuan, a strategic move articulated by Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources Bandar Al-Khrife, signals a historic shift with far-reaching implications. The shift towards alternative currencies is driven by the intensifying geopolitical rivalry among global powers, each vying to diminish the US dollar's hegemony. China's economic ascent, coupled with its development of the petroyuan as a viable alternative to the US dollar, poses a significant challenge to the dollar's dominance. Saudi Arabia's strategic decision to join the mBridge platform has further strengthened this challenge. By offering a more efficient alternative to the SWIFT system, China aims to undermine the very foundations of the dollar-centric financial system. Data from the Wall Street Journal shows that 20% of the world's oil was purchased with non-dollar currencies in 2023, signaling a tangible decline in the dollar's dominance within the international trading system. The adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) has also become a pivotal force in the ongoing paradigm shift away from US dollar dominance, particularly within the oil sector. Saudi Arabia's strategic pursuit of economic diversification aligns seamlessly with the ambitious objectives outlined in 'Vision 2030'. By strengthening ties with China and joining the BRICS group, the Kingdom aims to establish a more balanced economic relationship and reduce its dependence on a single power. China's engagement with Saudi Arabia extends beyond economic cooperation, with the agreement to teach the Chinese language in Saudi schools and vice versa underscoring China's strategic intent to enhance its cultural and economic influence in the region. As the world grapples with the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties, the petroyuan offers a potential path towards a more equitable and multipolar financial order. The implications of this shift are profound, potentially leading to a decline in the US dollar's global influence and fostering greater economic cooperation between emerging powers. 'The era of unchallenged US dollar hegemony is drawing to a close,' according to the article.
