**Elon Musk Steps Back from Politics to Focus on Tesla and SpaceX**
Elon Musk has decided to step back from active political involvement and support for US President Donald Trump to focus on developing Tesla and SpaceX after a series of setbacks, according to the Washington Post. Musk had been actively supporting Republicans for a year, spending at least $288 million on the 2024 elections and launching major reforms in US government structures. However, after massive protests against Musk and Tesla, as well as sharp criticism from the public and a significant decline in the company's profits, the businessman decided to end his political activities and focus on his key businesses. Musk admitted that he did not expect such a sharp reaction and is concerned about the safety of his family. His America PAC has ceased active work, and the billionaire has stated that he will spend significantly less on politics than before. 'His last obsession has given way to disappointment due to personal costs and difficulties in achieving results,' said two people familiar with his views in recent months, according to the article. Musk is deeply concerned about his personal safety and that of his family. He also did not expect such a level of negative reaction against him and his companies. This year, Tesla is preparing to launch a fully autonomous car, while SpaceX is planning another launch of the Starship rocket. Musk also plans to accelerate the preparation for sending a fleet of unmanned ships to Mars in 2026. Meanwhile, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has requested clarification from Tesla regarding the testing of new autonomous technology on public roads. According to employees and observers, Musk's declining popularity and scandalous statements are negatively affecting Tesla's sales. In SpaceX, Musk also wants to personally oversee the Starship project to accelerate the preparation for the NASA lunar mission and achieve his main goal - landing on Mars, according to the Washington Post.

**Musk Criticized for Alleged Decline as Trump Advisor**
Elon Musk has been criticized by The Atlantic for his alleged decline as an advisor to President Donald Trump's administration. The article 'Elon Musk's Downfall' describes how Musk was reportedly met with resistance as an advisor, and how his decision to step back from politics was met with relief by many. Musk has since responded with a series of tweets, calling The Atlantic 'dead' and a 'zombie-media' outlet. Musk's criticism is likely due to the fact that Laurene Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs, owns a majority of The Atlantic. Musk has also been criticized for his inability to deliver on his promises of reducing bureaucracy, with Tesla's stock price falling significantly during his time in politics. Musk's decision to step back from politics was seen as a positive development by many, with one anonymous source telling The Atlantic, 'I think everyone is ready to move on from that part of the administration.'

**Elon Musk Faces Massive Violence and Criticism for His Savings Plan in the DOGE**
Elon Musk, advisor to US President Donald Trump and CEO of Tesla, has spoken out about the violence against his companies, particularly Tesla, and has warned that 'several of them will go to jail and deserve it.' Despite celebrating the 'incredible' progress made with his savings plan in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the political cost is taking a toll on him and his companies. Musk notes that the DOGE has 'cut $170 billion in expenses since its creation in January, according to its website and as reported by La Nación. However, he believes that his goal of saving $2 trillion by July 4, 2026 may not be achievable without legislative support. 'Maybe they don't want that and, to some extent, oppose that level of savings,' he says. Musk emphasizes that 'the magnitude of the savings depends on the support we receive from Congress and, in general, the executive power.' He also notes that 'we are not the dictators of the government, we are the advisors,' and that 'the president can follow or ignore our recommendations, the final decisions depend on the political power.' Musk has been a victim of 'massive violence' due to his closeness to Trump and his work in the DOGE, including campaigns against his companies and acts of vandalism such as car fires.

**Musk vs. Navarro: A Conflict Over Trade and Tariffs**
A public conflict erupted between Elon Musk and Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to US President Donald Trump, in early April 2025. The cause of the conflict was Navarro's harsh comments about Tesla, which Musk considered unfounded and insulting. In an interview, Navarro criticized Tesla, saying, 'Musk is not a car manufacturer. In many cases, he is just an assembler of cars.' Musk, who also heads the Department of Efficiency of Government Administration (DOGE), strongly reacted to these words. On his social media platform X, he called Navarro 'an idiot' and 'dumber than a sack of bricks,' emphasizing that Navarro's comments about Tesla were 'clearly false.' The White House attempted to smooth over the conflict, describing the situation as disagreements between two people with 'very different views on trade and tariffs.' Navarro argued that the new tariff policy would help America 'make things again,' leading to an increase in 'real wages and profits.' In response, Musk published a link to a 2023 study by Kelley Blue Book, which found that Tesla's cars contain the largest number of US-made parts compared to other American automakers.

**Elon Musk to Step Down from Politics, Citing Safety Concerns and Disillusionment**
Billionaire Elon Musk has decided to step down from his political career, according to The Washington Post, citing sources. Musk, who has been overseeing the Department of Efficiency in Government (DOGE) in the US under the Trump administration, has expressed concerns about his safety and difficulties in achieving real results. He stated, 'I think I've done enough.' Musk's political activity has been a significant part of his life for most of the past year, but his interest has waned in recent times. He has expressed disappointment with the real impact his financial contributions can have on the American political system. Sources claim that Musk's decision to reduce his political activity was influenced by financial costs, a sense of disillusionment with the complexity of achieving tangible results, and concerns about his safety and the safety of his family. He also did not expect the level of personal criticism and negative reaction, directed not only at him but also at his companies, including acts of vandalism against Tesla objects. Musk, whose assets are estimated to be $374 billion, was a key supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2024, investing over $250 million. His close ties with the president and actions as DOGE curator, including significant reductions in government staff, have sparked widespread criticism. The public's disapproval of Musk's policies has negatively affected Tesla's stock price, which has dropped by over 55% since the beginning of 2025, after a 60% increase in 2024.

**‘Moron’: Elon Musk slaps US President Donald Trump’s tariff czar Peter Navarro as Tesla stock hits skids | Sound Telegraph**
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has publicly clashed with President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro, calling him a 'moron' and 'dumber than a sack of bricks'. The feud began when Navarro referred to Tesla as a 'car assembler' rather than a manufacturer. Musk's attacks are tied to business conditions, as Tesla's stock has plummeted 22% in the past four trading sessions and 45% for the year, resulting in a $585 billion loss in value. Musk's brother, Kimbal, has also joined in on the criticism, calling the tariffs a 'permanent tax on the American consumer'. The tariffs, which Trump announced on over 180 countries and territories, have been met with opposition from some in the administration, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying 'Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue.'

**Elon Musk Withdraws from Politics, Focuses on Business**
Elon Musk has significantly reduced his political involvement, after being a major supporter of former US President Donald Trump's campaign. Musk has stated that he will spend 'much less' on politics in the future, indicating his intention to distance himself from the political scene. Musk had previously allocated over $300 million to support Trump's re-election in the 2024 elections and played an active role in managing government cuts during the Republican administration. However, his recent decision to withdraw funding has left the Republican Party uncertain about the future of their campaigns, especially in light of the internal and external crises they are facing. Despite his withdrawal, Musk has not ruled out the possibility of returning to politics, stating that he may reconsider if he finds a compelling reason to do so. Musk's father shares details of rescuing his daughter from a deadly encounter. Musk's influence extended beyond politics, affecting Tesla's performance, which saw a 13% decline in sales in the first quarter of 2025 due to factors such as increased competition in the electric vehicle market, criticism from progressive groups, and vandalism incidents targeting the company's facilities in some US states. Musk's decisions as head of the DOGE agency sparked controversy, including the closure of prominent institutions like the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and wide-scale cuts to social programs, creating divisions within the government itself. Musk returns to business with a sarcastic tone, stating that he will continue to lead Tesla, 'yes, well, I might die.' This statement reflects Musk's intention to reduce his political presence, after a period marked by contentious decisions and sharp divisions that have affected his public image.

**'(Expletive) you!': Details emerge on Trump official unleashing raw fury on Elon Musk**
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had a heated argument with Elon Musk in the White House's West Wing, shouting 'Expletive you!' at him. The fight was over who should choose the next leader of the IRS, with Bessent supporting Michael Faulkender and Musk supporting Gary Shapley. The argument began outside the Oval Office and ended at the National Security Adviser's office, with Musk accusing Bessent of running failed hedge funds. The incident is not the first time Musk has clashed with Trump administration officials, including a heated exchange with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Musk has also criticized Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro, calling him a 'moron' and 'dumber than a sack of bricks' after Navarro made comments about Tesla's manufacturing process. Musk has announced that he plans to pull back from his political spending, saying 'I do not currently see a reason' to continue.

**Elon Musk to Significantly Reduce Political Donations**
Elon Musk has announced that he will significantly reduce his political donations in the future, stating, 'I will be doing (political donations) much less in the future.' This move may be a blow to US President Donald Trump and Republicans, particularly ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Musk, the world's richest person, has made approximately $250 million in donations to various political groups in the 2024 election cycle, more than any other donor in US elections. Most of these funds went to support Trump, who rewarded Musk by appointing him to lead an ambitious program to reduce the size and scope of the federal government. Republicans in Congress likely relied on Musk's generosity in 2026 to maintain their current control over both houses of the US parliament. 'Historically, presidents have almost always lost seats in the House of Representatives in midterm elections, and forecasts give Trump's party a one-in-five chance of retaining a majority in Congress after 2026,' the publication noted. Trump announced on April 1 that the Department of Efficiency in Government Administration (DOGE) led by Musk would cease to exist 'at some point.' Trump explained that Musk would work in the government as a special government employee for only 130 days. 'He's a very talented guy, I love very smart people, and he's really smart, he did a great job. And, probably, Elon wants to go back to his company,' Trump said. Later, Politico and ABC reported that Trump allegedly told his closest associates, including members of the US government, that Musk would soon stop performing his role as his partner in management and 'the person who did the dirty work.' On April 3, US Vice President Kamala Harris announced that Elon Musk had agreed to a six-month collaboration and would continue to serve as an advisor to the President of the United States. On April 4, President Trump stated that Elon Musk would leave the post of head of DOGE in a few months, but clarified that he wanted Musk to 'stay as long as possible.' On April 23, billionaire Elon Musk announced that he would significantly reduce the time devoted to the administration of Donald Trump from May and focus more on managing his company Tesla.

**Trump thanks Musk as Tesla CEO prepares to scale back govt role**
President Donald Trump has thanked Elon Musk for his contributions to the administration's cost-reduction agenda, as Musk prepares to reduce his involvement in Washington and shift focus back to Tesla. During a White House cabinet meeting, Trump told Musk, 'You're invited to stay as long as you want,' but acknowledged that Musk may be eager to return to running his company full-time. Musk has served as a close adviser to Trump on budget and public sector reform initiatives, but his involvement has coincided with negative publicity for Tesla. Musk's ally, David Sacks, said that Musk will transition to a reduced role, comparing it to his previous approach during his 2022 takeover of Twitter. Musk joked about the criticism, saying, 'They did like to burn my cars, which is not great.' Trump added, 'You really have sacrificed a lot. They treated you very unfairly.'

**Elon Musk Becomes Burdensome Ally for Donald Trump**
US President Donald Trump's ally, Elon Musk, is becoming increasingly burdensome for the president. According to Politico, Trump has told close friends that Musk will end his role as a government advisor in the coming weeks, aiming to cut public spending. However, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed the information, saying, 'This information is worthless.' Trump has publicly stated that Musk will leave his role as a government employee when his work on the DOGE (government efficiency commission) is complete. Musk's work has been criticized for its drastic budget cuts and firings of government officials. The contract between Musk and the federal government is set to expire in 130 days, on May 30. Musk has been a generous supporter of Trump's campaign and has been a frequent guest at the White House. However, his involvement in politics has not had a positive impact on Tesla's sales, which continue to decline. Musk's latest political venture, an election in Wisconsin, ended in failure with the election of a progressive judge. Trump has not commented on the result, but it has been seen as a warning for Republicans ahead of the 2026 legislative elections.

**Elon Musk to Step Down as Doge Advisor Amid Criticism**
Elon Musk is reportedly on the verge of stepping down as the head of the Doge advisory board, according to a media report. Trump is said to be satisfied with Musk, but many in Trump's inner circle have deemed the Tesla CEO too unpredictable. Critics have been shocked by Musk's drastic actions, including mass layoffs and the elimination of international aid, but he has also gained fans in Europe. Trump has reportedly informed his inner circle, including cabinet members, that Musk will step down within the coming weeks. However, insiders suggest that the situation is not as harmonious as Trump describes, with both the Trump administration and external allies criticizing Musk's unpredictability. Musk is said to be returning to focusing on his companies, particularly Tesla, where his public departure has caused investor discontent and a decline in sales. The Tesla stock price has halved. Despite this, the stock price surged by over 10% after the announcement of Musk's impending departure. Some observers believe that Musk's departure may be a diversionary tactic, as he had previously stated that he would stay. Many Trump employees will likely be relieved, as Musk's behavior has been a major source of criticism for the current administration.

**Elon Musk Steps Down as Trump Advisor Amid Controversies**
Elon Musk is reportedly stepping down as a senior advisor to US President Donald Trump. According to Politico, Trump has informed his inner circle about Musk's decision to leave. Musk will reportedly leave his position by the end of May or early June, when the 130-day period after his appointment as a 'special government employee' expires. Trump has publicly praised Musk as a 'patriot' and 'friend', despite internal criticism of Musk's solo actions. Musk has been a close ally of Trump, donating over $250 million to his presidential campaign and being appointed to reduce government spending. However, Musk has been criticized for his ruthless cuts and for spreading conspiracy theories without evidence. The Tesla CEO has also been accused of being racist and has made controversial statements, including a Hitler-like gesture at a Trump inauguration event. Musk's influence has been waning due to controversies and doubts about Tesla's business prospects, with the company's stock price dropping to pre-2024 levels. The US government has been supporting Musk, with US Justice Minister Pam Bondi threatening to label vandalism against Tesla as domestic terrorism and US Trade Minister Howard Lutnick encouraging people to buy Tesla stocks. Trump has also publicly endorsed Tesla, saying 'I love Tesla!' and even buying a red Model S from the company.

**Elon Musk to Leave US Government Position, Return to Managing Companies**
Elon Musk, the head of SpaceX, is expected to leave his position in the US government and return to managing his companies. According to US President Donald Trump, Musk's temporary role in the Department of Effective Government (DOGE) will likely end in late May. Trump stated, 'I think he's great, but I also think he needs to run a big company, so at some point he'll have to go back. He wants to. I'll keep him as long as I can.' Musk, appointed as a special advisor to the Trump administration, led efforts to reduce the US federal budget deficit. His initiatives to cut spending, including reducing the number of government employees, have received both praise and criticism.
