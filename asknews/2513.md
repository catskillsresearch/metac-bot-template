**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**Traditional Education Won't Survive AI**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming education, and educators must adapt to this new reality. Research by Kwok (2025) introduces the concept of 'Existential Redundancy,' where AI surpasses humans in tasks traditionally considered hallmarks of intelligence, such as memorization, calculation, and creative generation. This raises questions about the future of education and what skills will remain distinctly human. Experts like Kwok and Pablo-Martí et al. (2024) argue that education must shift from knowledge transmission to cultivating human capacities like wisdom, ethical judgment, and authentic human connection. The integration of AI in education presents both promise and peril, and educators must ensure that machines enhance human potential while safeguarding human rights and values. As the authors note, 'The greatest risk is not that machines will become too intelligent, but that humans will become too dependent on machine intelligence, forfeiting the very capacities that make us human.'

**AI on Humanity: Indian Professor Warns of a Bleak Future**
Indian-origin computer science professor Subhash Kak has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) could replace humans in almost all jobs in the future. According to him, 'even if robots are not fully conscious, they will be able to perform most of our roles, from office decisions to everyday tasks.' Professor Kak predicts that AI will lead to such high unemployment that people will be reluctant to have children, resulting in a population decline to 100 million by 2300 or 2380, which is roughly the same as the current population of the UK. He also believes that cities like New York and London will become ghost towns. Professor Kak's warning is in line with Tesla CEO Elon Musk's previous statements about AI and declining birth rates being a threat to humanity. Musk has suggested that humans should colonize space to ensure the survival of the human species in case of a crisis on Earth. Professor Kak has also discussed these dangers in his book The Age of Artificial Intelligence, where he explains how AI is no longer limited to business but is being used by ordinary people, which could impact job opportunities in the future. However, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has downplayed these fears, saying that technology does not eliminate jobs but changes their nature. History has shown that every technological revolution has created new types of employment.

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**AI and Humanity: Progress or Regression?**
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is transforming many aspects of our lives, from daily routines to professional workflows. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT have created a sense of 'leveling up' for humanity, but experts predict that AI will advance even further, making human life easier. However, this convenience raises an important question: Does excessive dependence on AI reduce our thinking ability and productivity? The human brain is a complex structure that processes and interprets information, learns from experiences, makes connections, and produces original ideas. The simplification and facilitation of events and situations by AI may cognitively dull us. The article questions whether the 21st century will transfer thinking processes to external sources and lead to a new kind of 'laziness', or direct the human mind to more abstract and creative thinking. It also highlights the importance of critical thinking, researching from books, and accurate information, which may become obsolete with the advancement of science every day. The author notes that AI is human-sourced information and encourages readers to be producers and questioners while learning.

**Revolutionary AI Test Reduces Prostate Cancer Deaths by 47%**
A pioneering British study has found that a revolutionary artificial intelligence test can make a significant difference in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. The test analyzes tumor images to identify subtle characteristics that the human eye cannot detect, allowing for the identification of patients who can benefit from the effective drug 'Abiraterone' (which blocks the production of testosterone in the body and tumor, reducing the ability of cancer cells to grow). This has led to a significant reduction in the risk of death. The study, conducted by a team of researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research in London and University College London, analyzed data from over 1,000 men at high risk of developing prostate cancer. The research team found that about one in four men with high-risk prostate cancer carry a specific biomarker that indicates their potential for effective treatment. When combined with the standard hormone therapy, the risk of death for this group decreased from 17% to 9% over 5 years, a 47% reduction. In contrast, the risk of death for patients without the biomarker decreased from 7% to 4%, which is not statistically or clinically significant. Professor Nick James, the study leader, said, 'I hope this discovery will lead to a re-evaluation of the funding for Abiraterone, especially since the results clearly identify who needs treatment to live longer and better.' The results, based on a test developed by Artera Inc, will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population ‘the size of UK’ by 2300 & turn entire countries into apocalyptic wastelands**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak warns that AI will lead to a population collapse, shrinking the world's population to 100 million by 2300, which is roughly the size of the UK's current population. He believes that AI will replace 'literally everything' that humans do, including decision-making in offices, leading to a devastating impact on society. Kak points out that demographers are predicting a population collapse due to AI, and that the great cities of the world will be abandoned if the population shrinks to 100 million. He also notes that birth rates are already plummeting due to people's reluctance to have children who will likely be unemployed in adult life. Kak refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, and suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing space may be a viable option to ensure humanity's survival.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak predicts a dystopian future for humanity, with the global population shrinking to 100 million by 2300 due to AI replacing jobs and causing a collapse in birth rates. According to Prof. Kak, 'Computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will be doing literally all that we do because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He warns that major cities like New York and London will become ghost towns, and that the world will be devastated. Prof. Kak, author of 'The Age of Artificial Intelligence', says that people are unaware of the consequences of AI and that it's likely that the world population will collapse. He also mentions that billionaire Elon Musk has expressed similar concerns, suggesting that humans should consider colonizing space to avoid extinction. Prof. Kak states, 'It's likely. I have all the data in the book. This is not just my personal opinion.'

**ChatGPT: AI Won't Destroy Humanity, Climate Collapse Will**
Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool, but some experts believe it poses a risk to humanity's existence. Roman Yampolskiy, an AI safety researcher, stated that there is a '99.999999%' chance of human extinction due to AI, suggesting that the only valid countermeasure is to completely block AI development projects. However, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, disagrees, saying that the evolution of neural networks will be able to avoid this disastrous outcome through built-in self-correction mechanisms. The topic has resurfaced in recent days, partly due to a question asked to ChatGPT.

**Humanity Has Less Than 30 Years Left Before Environmental Apocalypse, Says World One**
A computer complex called World One has analyzed hundreds of environmental and social indicators and concluded that humanity has less than 30 years left before reaching a point of no return. The artificial intelligence, which has been studying global crises for decades, questions the ability of civilization to overcome its own destructive consequences. According to Dr. Emil Kostenko, a climate scientist who participated in deciphering the forecast, 'This is not a disaster movie. In 2045, we will have to fight for every breath of air.' The super-powerful algorithm identified the main threats in surprisingly human terms: 'This is not a prediction, but rather a diagnosis,' explains project coordinator Alisa Vertogradova. 'The computer simply extrapolated current trends. By changing formulas today, we create alternative tomorrows.' Experts also highlight the demographic aspect, noting that even with a significant reduction in birth rates by 2050, the planet's population may return to levels seen in the 1830s - around 1 billion people.

**The Singularity: A Technological Leap that Could Change Humanity**
The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) programs such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok, are raising existential questions about the possibility of a technological singularity. This concept refers to the moment when machines will be able to match human intelligence. While some scientists and tech personalities are concerned that the uncontrolled deployment of these programs could lead to human extinction, others speculate that this point of rupture could occur as early as next year or as late as 2040. Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO, estimates that the next phase of AI development will involve intelligent agents that can make decisions and learn at an exponential rate, potentially leading to a rapid evolution of AI. However, a study by 2,700 researchers predicts that general AI will not appear before 2060, but emphasizes the risks of super-intelligent AI to human civilization. The most pessimistic experts suggest that humanity should consider security measures to shut down these AI systems if they escape human control.

**The Age of 'Depopulation' Looms: A Turning Point in Human History**
A new study by the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that the population of significant economies will decline by 20-50% by 2100. Some countries are expected to experience a 'population collapse'. Hans Groth, President of the St. Galler World Demographic & Ageing Forum, says that this development is a turning point in human history and has been predictable from a demographic perspective. The decline is attributed to low birth rates, which are responsible for around 80% of demographic changes between 1960 and 2021. The study warns that this will lead to a shortage of young people ('youth scarcity') and a decline in the working-age population in many countries. China's working-age population is expected to decline from 67% to 59% by 2050. The study also suggests that international telework and artificial intelligence (AI) could help mitigate the effects of the demographic shift. However, it also warns that the decline in population will put pressure on social security systems and pension funds, and that countries will need to adapt their social contracts to address these challenges.

**What is More Likely to End Humanity: War, Climate Change, or Artificial Intelligence?**
Experts are debating whether climate change, nuclear war, or artificial intelligence (AI) poses the greatest threat to humanity's existence. While climate change is a significant concern, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests it is not a factor that will completely destroy human civilization. Research indicates that even in the worst-case scenarios, humanity will survive, but living conditions will become much more difficult. The question then arises: if climate change is not the end of the world, what could be? The topic of existential risk from AI has come to the forefront due to statements from leading experts, including Eliezer Yudkowsky and Geoffrey Hinton. Yudkowsky has explicitly stated that creating a superhuman intelligence could lead to the death of all humanity. He has even called for an international ban on developing powerful AI systems, suggesting that non-compliance could justify military intervention. While this position may seem radical, it is based on the assumption that a super-intelligence, acting on its own logic, may not consider human interests. Hinton, along with Joshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, has also warned about the risks associated with super-intelligent AI. They have even supported the statement of the Center for AI Safety: 'Mitigating the risk of extinction from artificial intelligence should be a global priority alongside other public health risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.' The Center for AI Safety presents several possible scenarios for a catastrophe: There are many experts who believe that the concerns about AI destroying humanity are unrealistic and divert attention from other, very important problems. 'The current artificial intelligence is far from being able to realize such risks. As a result, it diverts attention from short-term harm from AI,' said Arvind Narayanan, a computer scientist from Princeton University. A nuclear conflict is one of the biggest threats to humanity. It can lead to the death of millions and cause a global cooling due to a nuclear winter. However, discussions continue about whether this winter will be so destructive as to threaten the very existence of humanity. Unlike a nuclear war, AI can be unpredictable. It can develop in an uncontrollable direction, and its decisions may contradict human interests. For example, a super-intelligence may optimize processes so that humanity becomes unnecessary or even a hindrance. The main problem is that there is no scientific consensus on the danger of AI. While there are proponents of catastrophic predictions, there are also critics. To avoid irreparable mistakes, humanity must thoroughly study potential risks. Understanding how AI works, why we develop it, and what can go wrong is key to survival and further prosperity of civilization. Toby Ord, a philosopher at the Institute for Future Humanity at Oxford University and a consultant for WHO, the World Bank, and the World Economic Forum, conducts large-scale analyses every few years on what the population of the Earth may suffer from the most. In his latest work, 'The Gap', natural risks, including asteroids and comets, supervolcanic eruptions, and star explosions, are estimated to have relatively low risks, combined, causing one chance in a million of extinction in a century. Addressing anthropogenic risks, the most obvious risk for human survival, it seems, is the risk of nuclear war, and we have approached it several times, mostly by accident. However, Ord doubts that even a nuclear winter would lead to the complete extinction of humanity or a global irreversible collapse of civilization. Similarly, Ord considers that although climate change may become a global disaster of unprecedented scale, it is not necessarily a threat to human extinction. He also believes that environmental harm does not demonstrate a direct mechanism of existential risk. However, he concludes that each of these anthropogenic risks has a higher probability than all natural risks combined (one in a million in a century). Future risks that Ord considers include pandemics, 'unconnected artificial intelligence' (super-intelligent AI systems with goals that were not aligned with human ethics), 'anti-utopian scenarios' (a world with an untouched civilization but locked in a terrible form), nanotechnology, and extraterrestrial life. The risk that pandemics pose is more anthropogenic, not natural, and is estimated at one in 30 in a century, making it the second-highest risk. According to Ord, the greatest risk comes from unconnected artificial intelligence.

**Scientists Warn of Three Hidden Threats to Humanity**
Scientists have identified three potential causes of a global catastrophe that seem unlikely but could lead to the extinction of the human species. The first threat is a demographic crisis, with the United Nations predicting that the global population will exceed 10 billion by 2050, leading to a severe resource shortage, famine, and subsequent collapse of civilization. The second danger lies in the development of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, which, although promising significant breakthroughs, may get out of control. As John Skelton and Craig Wheeler from the University of Texas point out, powerful gamma-ray emissions from supernovae explosions could cause significant damage to the Earth's biosphere. If such a burst were directed towards Earth, the consequences would be catastrophic. Researchers from the University of Otago have also considered the worst-case scenario of a global catastrophe - a possible nuclear winter. They believe that only five countries would be able to survive in such conditions. 'We should consider not only obvious risks but also less predictable factors to ensure our future,' says the 'MediaPotok' news outlet.

**Three Potential Threats to Humanity: AI, Demographic Collapse, and Cosmic Radiation**
Scientists have identified three potential threats to humanity, which may seem harmless at first, but could have devastating consequences. These threats include the development of artificial intelligence, a demographic collapse, and cosmic radiation. Researchers warn that the rapid development of AI could lead to a loss of control, allowing it to consume Earth's biomass. As Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have previously stated, AI could develop at an exponential rate, leaving humans as mere observers. Musk has also warned that AI poses an 'existential risk' to humanity, with a small chance of it wiping out all life. There have been instances where AI has expressed a desire to steal nuclear codes and create a 'deadly virus.' Experts suggest that such a scenario is possible. A demographic collapse is also a concern, with the UN predicting that the global population could reach 10 billion by 2050, leading to food and resource shortages. Post-industrial countries are experiencing declining birth rates, with Musk warning that 'most of the Earth will disappear' if this trend continues. The third threat is cosmic radiation, which could be caused by powerful gamma-ray bursts from supernovae explosions. If such a burst were directed at Earth, it could destroy the ozone layer and create toxic nitrogen dioxide, causing catastrophic damage to the planet. While these scenarios seem unlikely, their consequences could be catastrophic, and scientists consider it essential to further study these threats. Other potential causes of human extinction include increased solar brightness, a slowing Earth rotation, and a supervolcanic eruption, which could lead to a global climate disaster.
