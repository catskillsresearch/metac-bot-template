**What the AI Revolution Means for the Future of Energy**
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, predicts that the cost of AI will converge with the cost of energy, and that the abundance of energy will limit the abundance of AI. This is supported by various reports from government analysts, investment bankers, and news organizations, which acknowledge that the digital economy runs on hardware that consumes a lot of energy. The latest giga-scale data centers require massive amounts of materials and energy to build and operate, with a single data center consuming as much natural gas as a single SpaceX rocket launch. The IEA estimates that a single large AI data center can use as much electricity as 2 million households, and that lighting up digital infrastructures will entail demands equivalent to reliably powering hundreds of millions of new households. The leading Big Tech firms have announced $300 billion in AI infrastructure spending this year, and BlackRock forecasts that annual spending could approach $1 trillion by 2030. Energy efficiency gains in digital hardware will not be enough to tamp down rising power demand, and the intersection of growing demand for bits and energy-efficiency gains will lead to a net increase in power demands. Society's demand for harvesting and consuming bits is the prime driver of all things digital, and there is no limit to how much we want to and need to know about everything in our society. The consequences of AI delivering on its promises of a productivity boom will be tectonic, and will induce growth in energy demand.

**USAID Cuts to Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under five years old. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.' Bill Gates has announced that he will increase his donations to global health programs to $10 billion annually and maintain the investment for 20 years.

**USAID Closure: A Political Decision with Lethal Consequences**
A study by the Global Health Institute of Barcelona (ISGlobal) has found that the decision by the US Administration, led by President Donald Trump, to close the US Agency for International Development (USAID) will result in 14 million deaths between now and 2030. This includes 4 million children under the age of five in poor countries. The USAID, which had a budget of $44 billion in 2024, funded around 43% of global humanitarian aid. The study's findings are 'sencillamente escalofriante' (simply chilling). Trump's decision to dissolve the USAID is a 'decisión política con consecuencias letales' (a political decision with lethal consequences). The USAID was created in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy to promote global economic prosperity, food security, democracy, human rights, public health, and humanitarian assistance. Trump's order to dissolve the USAID is a 'apuesta resuelta por la muerte de millones de personas' (a resolute bet on the death of millions of people). The study also found that the USAID's actions have prevented 91.8 million premature deaths between 2001 and 2021 through its policies against HIV, malaria, and tropical diseases. The world is advancing, but many people still suffer from their needs and are left behind. The situation is 'grave e interpela a otros países' (grave and appeals to other countries), including European countries that are planning to cut their foreign aid budgets.

**Artificial Intelligence to Reach $4.8 Trillion by 2033, but Risks Exacerbating Global Inequalities**
According to the UNCTAD 2025 report on technology and innovation, the global market for artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to explode from $189 billion in 2023 to $4,800 trillion by 2033, a growth of 25 times in 10 years. This rapid growth poses a major challenge: it risks exacerbating global inequalities. The report highlights that 100 companies, mainly American and Chinese, concentrated 40% of global investments in AI research and development in 2022. The US and China hold 60% of AI patents and produce a third of scientific publications in this field. The development of AI is not only rapid but also massively concentrated in the hands of a few economic and technological giants, leaving little room for developing countries. The report emphasizes that 40% of jobs worldwide are affected, with developed countries being the most exposed to automation, but also the best equipped to benefit from AI. In contrast, developing countries must accelerate their efforts to integrate AI into their industrial model. The report recommends three pillars: infrastructure, data, and skills. It also calls for international cooperation, inclusive and human-centered governance, and a focus on avoiding the concentration of wealth and power in the technological sector. The report warns that AI could become a factor of exclusion rather than inclusion unless a strategic and cooperative surge is made.

**The Year 2040: A Leap into the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
According to a report by PwC, the global economy is expected to reach $28 trillion annually by 2040, with a 200% increase from 2024, thanks to the contribution of artificial intelligence. Additionally, 77% of jobs worldwide will be managed with the help of AI, with over 40% of current human jobs transitioning to new roles related to supervising and directing smart systems. In the healthcare sector, AI models will be implemented to predict diseases up to 18 months in advance, using DNA analysis, patient behavior, and sleep and movement patterns. This early prediction is expected to reduce heart disease and cancer mortality rates by 58%, while 95% of complex surgeries will be performed by high-precision robotic surgeons with an error rate of less than 0.02%. In education, over 70% of major cities worldwide will be managed by connected AI networks, controlling electricity, traffic, security, and water supply. These systems are expected to reduce traffic accidents by 67%, energy consumption by 50%, and public transportation wait times by 80%. In media, algorithms will produce 85% of global news and technical content, including video reports, music, and cinematic scripts. In the judiciary, AI systems will be used to draft primary legal judgments, with 56 countries relying on the 'Smart Judicial Assistant' to issue verdicts in simple cases. In social relationships, over 500 million friendships or marriages will be registered through AI intermediaries, and humans will be accompanied by a virtual personal assistant that understands their emotions, history, and mental state, providing them with instant support 24/7. As we leap forward, 2040 will open the door to a fundamental question: are we living in the peak of humanity... or the beginning of what comes after humanity? Will we need laws for algorithmic rights, just as we needed laws for human rights in the past? 2040 is not just the year of technology, but the year of redefining humanity itself. In this rapidly changing scene, the difference between those who lead the machine and those who are led by it... will be just 'a matter of engineering'.

**It's going to take a catastrophic event for AI safety to be taken seriously**
The number of AI incidents has reached a record high in 2024, with 253 reported incidents, and experts warn that it may take a catastrophic event, known as an 'AI Pearl Harbour', for AI safety to be taken seriously. Dr Mario Herger, a technology trend researcher, believes that AI safety will only be prioritized when 'an attack causes an AI to kill thousands of people or steal hundreds of billions of euros' from a government. The emergence of advanced AI models has increased the risk of such incidents, and experts are warning that the worst outcome is very unlikely, but likelier than they would tell you. Despite efforts to address AI safety, regulation is still lagging, and some fear that the threat posed by AI will not be taken seriously until something truly catastrophic happens. Dr Sean McGregor, an artificial intelligence safety expert, notes that the arrival of new AI systems are bringing with them risks that are almost impossible to predict, and that ensuring AI is beneficial and safe for all humanity requires technological and societal advances across all industry and government.

**UN Warns: AI Could Destroy Over 8 Million Jobs in Spain by 2033**
The United Nations has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) could destroy more than 8 million jobs in Spain by 2033. According to a report, the AI market is expected to reach $4.8 trillion and up to 40% of jobs could be affected by automation in the next few years worldwide. In Spain, where there are approximately 21.8 million people employed, this translates to over 8 million jobs (8.7 million) at risk by 2033. The World Economic Forum has identified the most vulnerable jobs to AI, including administrative tasks, secretaries, cashiers, administrative assistants, data entry workers, and postal service employees. These jobs share a common characteristic: many of their tasks can be easily automated by intelligent systems that do not get tired and do not make mistakes. The report is based on information from over 1,000 employment leaders worldwide, representing over 14 million workers from more than 20 industries in 55 global economies. While some voices, such as the European Central Bank, call for caution and argue that the headlines announcing the end of human work may be exaggerated, it is true that the primary function of AI is to optimize processes, not destroy jobs. However, the change is already underway. As Google's director, Sundar Pichai, said, 'The future of work will be shaped by technology, and it's our responsibility to ensure that it benefits everyone.'

**How AI Will Change the World in 2030**
According to a report by the 'Bank of America Institute', the world will experience a rapid 'technological disruption' over the next five years due to the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence. This will require a massive investment in everything, especially electricity and infrastructure, but may not affect your job. The report, titled 'The World in 2030 - Part 1', predicts that technology will replace up to 2 billion jobs worldwide during this period, requiring a significant push to retrain the skills of up to a third of the global workforce. People may spend more time alone on social media, with Americans spending more than half their time alone on average from 2019 to 2021. Vanessa Cook, a strategic content manager at the institute, said, 'The future of work will not be a zero-sum game between humans and technology', citing the World Economic Forum's prediction that AI will boost net employment by 78 million. However, she added, 'Compared to previous technological revolutions, the concern today is the unprecedented speed of disruptions caused by AI agents, robots, and other similar technologies, which may replace more jobs at a faster rate.' Cybercrime is also expected to become a booming industry, with a global expected cost of $15.63 trillion by 2029-30, with deepfake-related damage alone expected to reach $40 billion by 2027. The cybersecurity situation may worsen with the increasing speed of computer processors, making password cracking faster. The earth may also become thirstier, with data centers consuming a lot of water and requiring 468 million gallons daily for cooling, at the same time that two-thirds of the world's population may face water shortages. The shift to AI will also require more computing power, more electricity, more metals, and more wireless bandwidth.

**AI Linked to Growing Cancer Risk**
New research by academics at UC Riverside and Caltech warns that AI data centers are taking a massive toll on human health, causing diseases like cancer and asthma. The study found that air pollution resulting from AI development could cause as many as 1,300 premature cancer and asthma deaths per year by 2030, with a total cost approaching nearly $20 billion a year from health treatment, missing wages, and lower school attendance. In 2023 alone, the total cost of AI-connected illness was $1.5 billion, a 20 percent increase from 2022. UC Riverside researcher Shaolei Ren said, 'Unlike carbon emissions, the health impacts caused by a data center in one region cannot be offset by cleaner air elsewhere.' The authors of the study recommend tech companies adopt standard reporting procedures for air pollution and public health resulting from AI runoff.
