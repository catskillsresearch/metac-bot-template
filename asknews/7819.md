**Uzbekistan's Pragmatic Approach to Afghanistan: A Call for International Dialogue**
Uzbekistan is taking a pragmatic and principled approach to interacting with the current authorities in Afghanistan and supports the idea of international dialogue with the 'Taliban' movement. This was stated by Abdujalilov, the deputy secretary of the Security Council under the President and the special representative of the head of state on foreign policy issues, in an interview with the website Ishonch.uz. 'We will definitely recognize [the Afghan authorities] when the time comes, but we want to take these steps together with the international community, including the United Nations,' he emphasized. Abdujalilov reminded that the Afghan and Uzbek peoples have lived in a single cultural and civilizational space for centuries, and historical ties cannot be ignored. He cited the examples of famous Uzbek scholars and poets who were connected to Afghanistan, such as Abu Rayhan Beruni, Ali-Shir Nava'i, and Babur. The diplomat also mentioned the recent gesture of goodwill from the Taliban, who sent 16 trucks with white marble from Herat to Khairaton as a gift for the restoration of the Imam al-Bukhari memorial complex. 'What other state can take such an initiative? This is a proof of our spiritual closeness,' he said. Abdujalilov emphasized that the Afghan people are heroic and suffering, having experienced the interventions of the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and NATO, and now they need support, not pressure. He recalled that the current president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, has proposed to the Afghan authorities to establish a dialogue with the opposition, but they did not listen, and Uzbekistan began to prepare for other scenarios. 'We acted correctly by starting a dialogue with the Taliban, inviting them here. Now the Taliban are in power, and we all know them. When we invited their delegations, many countries said: why are you communicating with terrorists? Now many of them themselves come to us for help in establishing contacts with them, because we have good relations with them,' he said. Abdujalilov called for a full-fledged dialogue with the 'Taliban' movement and their participation in international platforms: 'Today's dialogue is one-sided. To have a real dialogue, we need to hear the Taliban. They also need to be given a voice, a platform, and invited to international organizations to hear their pain and problems. Then you can say 'this we like, and this we don't.' Then there will be a dialogue,' he said. As an example, he recalled the situation with Yasser Arafat: '[In the 1980s] he was called the number one terrorist, but over time - and he spoke at the UN General Assembly, established a dialogue with Israel. Then Yasser Arafat, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Israel received the Nobel Peace Prize... War breaks any person, his mentality, consciousness. Therefore, the Afghan people, first of all, need to be supported,' he emphasized. 'When one person gets into an accident, a psychologist is invited, but here we are talking about a whole nation. A nation that has not known peace for over 40 years. Therefore, it needs to be worked with, helped, supported,' he said.

**Russia Agrees to Nominate Taliban as Ambassador to Moscow**
Russia has officially agreed to nominate the Taliban as its ambassador to Moscow, as the economic and political relations between the two countries, both affected by sanctions, continue to develop. This move comes after Russia lifted its ban on the Taliban in April, which had been in place for over two decades, classifying them as a terrorist organization. No country has officially recognized the Taliban government, which took control of Afghanistan in 2021 after the US withdrawal. Amir Khan Muttaqi, the acting foreign minister of the Taliban government, said, 'We hope that this new phase will allow the two countries to expand cooperation in various fields.' China became the first country to accept diplomatic representation at the level of ambassador from the Taliban in 2023, and several other countries, including Pakistan, have since followed suit. Diplomats say that presenting the ambassador's official credentials to a foreign head of state represents a step towards recognition. Meanwhile, Afghanistan welcomed the decision to raise diplomatic relations with Pakistan, which is expected to be visited by the Taliban's foreign minister in the coming days, according to his office. This move indicates a easing of tensions between the two neighbors, which have been strained in recent months due to security concerns and Islamabad's campaign to expel tens of thousands of Afghans. Pakistan's foreign minister announced on Friday that the chargé d'affaires in Kabul will be upgraded to ambassador, and Kabul later announced the upgrade of its representative in Islamabad. The Afghan foreign ministry said on X that 'raising diplomatic representation between Afghanistan and Pakistan paves the way for enhancing bilateral cooperation in multiple areas.' The ministry's spokesperson, Dzia Ahmad Tkal, told AFP that the Afghan foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, is expected to visit Pakistan 'in the coming days.' Muttaqi had previously met with Pakistan's foreign minister, Ismail Dar, in Beijing in May, as part of a trilateral meeting with their Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi. Wang later announced the intention of Kabul and Islamabad to exchange ambassadors, and expressed Beijing's readiness to continue helping to improve Afghan-Pakistani relations. Dar praised the 'positive trajectory' of Afghan-Pakistani relations on Friday, saying that raising the level of representation 'will enhance exchanges between the two brotherly countries.'

**Islamabad, Kabul bonhomie surges**
Pakistan and Afghanistan have strengthened their ties, with officials stating that a new push to reset their long-troubled relations is making significant strides. The latest development came after Pakistan agreed to upgrade diplomatic ties with Kabul, with the Afghan Interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi welcoming the move. Muttaqi said, 'It is a very positive development in bilateral relations.' The two countries have also agreed to work closely on the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project for regional connectivity. Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Afghan Interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi spoke by phone on Sunday, reviewing the implementation of decisions taken during Dar's visit to Kabul in April 2025. Muttaqi is expected to visit Islamabad soon, marking his first visit to Pakistan in two years. The improved ties come after the Afghan government took steps to address Pakistan's concerns over cross-border terrorist attacks, including arresting scores of Afghan nationals who joined or were planning to join the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

**The Taliban is back in the International Spotlight**
The Taliban is regaining international attention, with major stakeholders such as Bharat, Pakistan, Iran, Russia, China, and the US showing renewed interest in Afghanistan. China is poised to play a major role in the country's reconstruction, despite ongoing security threats from ISIS-K. However, the Taliban's return to the international spotlight may also lead to a new era of cooperation and competition between these stakeholders. The key variable is whether the Afghan-Pakistani security dilemma is alleviated, and on what terms, which will determine the trajectory of these dynamics. As Russia and China are already mediating, it remains to be seen whether American coercion or Eurasian mediation will prevail.

**Russia Approves 'Taliban' Ambassador Candidacy Amid Strengthening Ties**
Russia has officially approved the candidacy of the 'Taliban' ambassador to work in Moscow, according to Reuters, citing the statement of the Afghan Minister of Foreign Affairs. The agency noted that economic and political ties between the two countries are strengthening in the face of imposed sanctions. The Supreme Court suspended the ban on the 'Taliban' movement in Russia in mid-April, and the decision came into effect on May 20. The 'Taliban' has been on the list of terrorist organizations in Russia since 2003, and the Supreme Court's decision stated that the movement maintains connections with illegal armed formations in Chechnya and uses terrorist methods. The State Duma passed a law allowing the exclusion of the Taliban from the list of terrorists in December last year, which provides for the possibility of suspending the ban on the activity of an organization recognized as terrorist if it 'has ceased to engage in activities aimed at promoting, justifying, and supporting terrorism.' As the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in 2021 after the withdrawal of US troops, former President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.

**Russia Agrees to Recognize Taliban Government as Ambassador in Moscow**
The Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Sunday that Russia has officially agreed to recognize the Taliban government as its ambassador in Moscow. This move comes as relations between the two countries, both affected by sanctions, are improving. Russia lifted its ban on the Taliban in April, which was a step towards normalizing relations with Afghan leaders. No country has officially recognized the Taliban government, which took control of the country in 2021 after the US-led withdrawal. The Russian parliament approved a law on Tuesday that allows for the suspension of bans on organizations classified as terrorist by Moscow, paving the way for normalization of relations with the Taliban in Afghanistan and possibly with the new leaders in Syria. According to Amir Khan Mutqi, the acting foreign minister of the Taliban government, 'We hope that this new phase will allow the two countries to expand cooperation in various fields.' China was the first country to accept a Taliban diplomat at the level of ambassador in 2023, and several other countries have followed suit, including Pakistan, which announced the upgrade of its diplomatic representation last week. Diplomats say that the formal presentation of the ambassador's credentials to a foreign head of state represents a step towards recognition.

**The Taliban Is Back In The International Spotlight**
The Taliban is regaining international attention as major stakeholders, including India, Pakistan, Iran, Russia, China, and the US, are re-engaging with the group. India's External Affairs Minister, Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, held a historic call with his Afghan counterpart, discussing expanding bilateral ties and condemning the Pahalgam terrorist attack. Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of harboring terrorist groups, but improving ties could lead to a Central Eurasian Corridor from Pakistan to Russia. China and Russia are also wooing the Taliban, with China poised to play a major role in Afghanistan's reconstruction and Russia removing the Taliban's terrorist designation. The US is placing pressure on the Taliban, demanding control over Bagram Airbase and threatening to redesignate the group as a 'Foreign Terrorist Organization.' The outcome will depend on whether the Afghan-Pakistani security dilemma is alleviated and on what terms, with Eurasian-mediated or American-coerced dynamics possible.

**Can the Baloch Liberation Army Capture Pakistan like the Taliban did in Afghanistan?**
The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has been making headlines in Pakistan with its recent actions, including the capture of the city of Surab and the takeover of banks and government institutions. The BLA has been demanding independence for Balochistan and has been receiving support from the local population. However, the question remains whether the BLA can replicate the Taliban's success in Afghanistan and capture Islamabad. The Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 was a swift and decisive victory, with the group capturing the capital city of Kabul in just 10 days. However, the BLA's situation is different, as it is fighting for independence from Pakistan, not a complete takeover of the country. Additionally, the BLA lacks the military might and strategic support of the Taliban, and its focus is limited to Balochistan and the city of Quetta. As such, it is unlikely that the BLA can capture the entire country of Pakistan, but it may be able to maintain control over Balochistan. BLA spokesperson said, 'We are fighting for the freedom of Balochistan, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal.'

**Reset with Kabul**
Pakistan's relationship with the Taliban government in Afghanistan appears to be improving after hitting its lowest point a few months ago. The Taliban has made efforts to ensure that its soil was not used against Pakistan during recent tensions with India and has also taken steps to downplay differences with Pakistan. The Afghan Taliban have told their 'guests' that their self-proclaimed jihad against Pakistan is illegitimate, and the Taliban government has made sincere efforts to capture and detain anti-Pakistan terrorists. These moves are part of a broader trend of countries reopening diplomatic ties with the Afghan government, including through the appointment of ambassadors and the reopening of embassies. As one official noted, 'the biggest beneficiaries of improved ties with Pakistan and other countries are the long-suffering Afghan people.'

**Russia warns against NATO's Return to Afghanistan's Geopolitical Game - Khaama Press**
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned against NATO's potential return to Afghanistan, calling it a 'time bomb.' Lavrov expressed concerns over geopolitical interference and the potential destabilization of the region. He criticized the 'questionable engagement' of Western countries with the Taliban, particularly condemning any potential return of NATO military facilities to Afghanistan. Lavrov stated, 'We are seeing the West actively trying to re-enter the Afghanistan game, a game they left after the Taliban's return.' He emphasized that removing the Taliban from Russia's list of terrorist organizations is essential for facilitating cooperation, and that practical policies should be based on the reality of the Taliban's control of Kabul, rather than ideological positions.

**Taliban's Control of 10 Million Weapons Raises Concerns of Terrorist Organizations**
The Taliban has taken control of nearly 10 million weapons and military equipment in Afghanistan since 2021, including those provided by the US and NATO to the Afghan army. However, it is reported that around half of these weapons, approximately 5 million, have gone missing. According to the UN and other sources, these weapons have either been stolen or sold to terrorist organizations. A senior Afghan official told BBC that the Taliban received 10 million weapons and equipment, while the Taliban government's deputy spokesperson Hamdullah Fitarat claimed that all the weapons are safe. However, a UN report in February 2025 revealed that the weapons are now reaching terrorist organizations linked to al-Qaeda, including the TTP, IMU, ETIM, and Ansarullah Movement in Yemen. When asked about these allegations, Hamdullah Fitarat said that the Taliban government is taking the security and storage of weapons very seriously and that all the weapons are safe, denying the reports of their disappearance.

**Taliban's Long Road to Global Recognition**
The Russian Supreme Court has temporarily lifted the ban on the Taliban, on April 17, 2025, based on a 2024 decree by President Vladimir Putin that allowed them to be removed from the list of terrorist organizations. The Taliban took power in Afghanistan in August 2021. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid celebrated the decision, stating to DW, 'Russia is an important country in the region, with which Afghanistan maintains solid diplomatic relations. Trade relations with Russia are developing positively.' Russia has been in unofficial contact with the Taliban since 2016, with representatives of the movement being invited to Moscow for periodic conversations. In 2024, Putin publicly described the Taliban as 'allies in the fight against terrorism' for the first time. However, Russia's stance towards the Taliban is ambivalent, according to Afghan expert Sadiq Amini, who notes that Russia has financially and militarily supported the Taliban, especially in the fight against US and NATO forces, while maintaining their official designation as a terrorist organization. Amini believes that the new decision does not change this, and that Russia will continue to consider the Taliban a terrorist organization, even if they are removed from the list. Other countries, such as Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, have also removed the Taliban from their national lists of terrorist organizations, while China has accepted a Taliban ambassador and signed an agreement on oil production in Afghanistan. Iran and Pakistan maintain close relations with the Taliban government and meet regularly, while countries like the UAE and Qatar have intensified their diplomatic contacts with the Taliban without yet expressing official recognition. India is taking a cautious approach to prevent Pakistan's regional influence. The gradual approach is also due to Afghanistan's strategic location between South and Central Asia, through which important energy and trade routes pass between the Middle East and China. The security situation in Afghanistan affects the entire region, with Ghaus Janbaz, a former Afghan diplomat in Moscow, stating, 'Small Asian countries, as well as great powers like the US, Russia, and China, will continue to compete for dominance in Afghanistan.' However, Janbaz believes that it is still too early to talk about international recognition, and that it will take time for countries to take the first step. He suggests that several countries may eventually recognize the Taliban together, but it is unclear when and under what conditions.

**TTP, BLA's armament: Pakistan urges UNSC to prevent weapons' access to terrorists in Afghanistan**
Pakistan has urged the United Nations to recover and prevent weapons' access to terrorist groups such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), and Majeed Brigade operating in Afghanistan. Counsellor at the Pakistan Mission Syed Atif Raza said, 'Terrorist armed groups are in possession of billions worth of illicit arms abandoned in Afghanistan, which are being used in violence against civilians and armed forces of Pakistan.' The diplomat highlighted the ongoing arms trafficking in the region, revealing that both Soviet-era and NATO-pattern weapons remain accessible in informal markets. According to the Global Terrorism Index 2025 report, Pakistan is the world's second-most terrorism-affected country in 2024 with a 45% surge in terrorism-related deaths. The TTP remains the deadliest terrorist group in the country, accounting for 52% of all terrorism-related deaths. Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in terror attacks in January 2025, surging by 42% compared to the previous month. Counsellor Raza called upon international partners to recover the vast stockpile of abandoned weapons, prevent their access to armed terrorist groups, and take measures to close the thriving black market of illicit arms.

**Pakistan calls for prevention of weapons' access by terrorists in Afghanistan**
Pakistan has urged the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to take steps against the arming of terrorist groups operating from Afghanistan, such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), and Majeed Brigade.

**US Strategy on Afghanistan may shift amid growing terrorist threats: Report**
The Hudson Institute reports that the US approach to Afghanistan may be shifting due to growing terrorist threats. According to Luke Coffey, author of the article, a new strategy for Central Asia is expected to be released in the coming months. The report highlights the need for a unified international approach to address the challenges posed by the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan, including the presence of over 20 terrorist groups, including ISIS-Khorasan and Al-Qaeda. Coffey expressed concern over the global community's lack of a serious and cohesive response to these growing threats, warning that it could lead to further regional and global instability. The potential military use of Bagram Airfield by China could also motivate efforts to regain control of the base. Coffey noted that the signs of a potential shift in US policy toward Afghanistan could provide an opportunity for a more unified international response to the threats emanating from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.

**Taliban Express Concerns Over Afghanistan's Potential NATO Membership**
The Taliban has expressed concerns that Afghanistan may become a NATO member and adopt Western values, according to a statement from the group. The Taliban has been in power for 20 years, since they took control of Kabul in August 2021, after the withdrawal of US forces. They claim that Afghanistan has been following Islamic law for 40 years, but they are concerned that if the country becomes a NATO member, it will be forced to adopt Western values and abandon its Islamic identity. The Taliban is also concerned that the US is trying to undermine their authority and impose its own values on Afghanistan. The group believes that if the US is allowed to maintain a presence in Afghanistan, it will lead to the country's economic dependence on the US and the erosion of its Islamic values. Russia and China, which are allies of the US, have also been accused by the Taliban of trying to undermine their authority and impose their own values on Afghanistan. The Taliban believes that if the US is allowed to maintain a presence in Afghanistan, it will lead to the country's economic dependence on the US and the erosion of its Islamic values. Puntland Post reports that the Taliban is concerned that the US is trying to undermine their authority and impose its own values on Afghanistan, and that they are seeking to maintain their independence and Islamic identity.

**Washington's weapons, Pakistan's problems**
The withdrawal of US and Nato forces from Afghanistan in 2021 has left behind a significant amount of military-grade weaponry, which has fallen into the hands of non-state actors and militant groups. This has emboldened insurgents in Afghanistan and poses a direct threat to Pakistan's sovereignty. The armaments, including advanced rifles, night-vision equipment, and sophisticated drones, are being used to destabilise border regions and target Pakistani security forces and civilians. According to the Global Terrorism Index 2025, Pakistan ranks second worldwide in terms of the impact of militant violence, and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is among the four deadliest terrorist groups globally. The index also reveals that KP and Balochistan are the regions most severely affected, experiencing 96% of these attacks. Pakistan has consistently voiced concerns regarding the unchecked proliferation of these advanced armaments and has urged the international community to address the security vacuum resulting from the US/Nato withdrawal. Islamabad must leverage its cooperative relationship with Washington to advocate for intelligence sharing, counterterrorism assistance, and stringent measures to prevent the flow of advanced weaponry into the hands of militants.

**Ex-Afghan Military Personnel Respond to Trump's Demand for Return of US Arsenal**
Former Afghan military personnel and ex-members of the previous Taliban administration gathered to protest against US President Donald Trump's statements that he wants the US military arsenal left in Afghanistan to be returned. The ex-military members stated that the equipment belongs to Afghanistan and that the US should pay compensation for the destruction of the armament during their withdrawal in 2021: 'The general opinion is that these arms, equipment, and military technology belong to the nation [of Afghanistan] and its people,' said former Deputy Minister of Defense Afzal Aman. Trump has criticized the Biden administration for its role in the 2021 withdrawal and claimed that the previous Democratic government had 'given billions of dollars to the Taliban,' which he labeled as the 'enemy.' Trump stated, 'We want it back.' The US military left behind an estimated $7 billion worth of arsenal, including aircraft, munitions, communication equipment, and military vehicles. One of the ex-military members, Kamran Aman, criticized the US for its actions in Afghanistan, saying, 'America did not come to Afghanistan for its people. The same President Biden said they did not come here to build a nation. They came to steal and plunder, sell drugs, kill Muslims, and divide Afghanistan.' The US base in Bagram, which was critical for US and NATO operations, has been a focus of attention in Trump's statements. Trump initially negotiated the withdrawal with the Taliban in 2020, but it was not until 2021 that the withdrawal was completed under Biden. Trump stated that he would have maintained the base with fewer than 5,000 troops, but only to counter China, not the Taliban. 'We would have kept Bagram not for Afghanistan, but for China, since it is exactly an hour away from where China manufactures its nuclear missiles. And do you know who is occupying it now? China,' Trump justified. The Taliban's spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, responded that the US should 'abstain from making comments based on unsubstantial information,' as the control of the base is in the hands of the Islamic Emirate: 'Chinese troops are not present here, nor do we have that kind of agreement with any country,' Mujahid stated.

**Taliban tell Trump they want to reset relationship with US - but don't expect to get Humvees back**
The Taliban have expressed their willingness to establish a new diplomatic relationship with the US administration of Donald Trump, but have claimed ownership of the military equipment left behind by US and Nato forces. According to Abdul Qahar Balkhi, the Taliban's spokesperson for the foreign ministry, 'We would like to close the chapter of warfare and open a new chapter.' However, when asked about the return of military hardware, Balkhi stated, 'These are the assets of the state of Afghanistan. They will continue to be in the possession of the state of Afghanistan.' The Taliban have been seen using Humvees and other military vehicles in public events, including a grand parade at Bagram airbase in August. The US had handed over military equipment worth over $7.2bn to the Afghan forces before the Nato-led government evacuated in August 2021. Donald Trump has criticized the way his successor Joe Biden handled the pullout and has called for the return of the military equipment, saying, 'If we're going to pay billions of dollars a year, tell them we're not going to give them the money unless they give back our military equipment.'
