**A preventable terrorist attack**
A recent terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado, committed by an Egyptian illegal alien named Mohamed Soliman, has raised concerns about the effectiveness of visa tracking systems. The attack bears a striking resemblance to the 9/11 attacks, in which another Egyptian, Mohammed Atta, used a tourist visa to enter the US and commit the attacks. Atta was pulled over twice for traffic violations while in the country illegally, but was not arrested. The National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) was designed to address this issue, but was canceled by the Obama administration. The author argues that had NSEERS not been canceled, Soliman may have been prevented from carrying out the attack. The Biden administration has also been criticized for giving Soliman a work permit after learning that he overstayed his visa. The author concludes that it's time to put NSEERS back into effect to prevent similar attacks in the future.

**Opinion | Abandoning Somalia again will empower terrorists**
The United States is considering abandoning Somalia, a move that could empower terrorist groups and threaten regional stability. The Trump administration is slashing foreign aid and scaling back military training for local forces fighting al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. 'We are leaning into empowerment over dependency,' said Marine Corps Gen. Michael Langley. However, this move comes at a critical time, as al-Shabab, al-Qaeda's most lethal affiliate, is on the offensive, having seized several key towns in the past three months. The group has also hit American targets, including a 2020 attack on a U.S. airfield in Kenya that killed three Americans. The U.S. withdrawal from Somalia could have far-reaching consequences, including the potential for a failed state that becomes a haven for terrorists, as seen in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks. History has shown that the United States has struggled to get Somalia right, with cycles of intervention followed by neglect. The current move could be a repeat of this pattern, with devastating consequences.

**Recycling contaminated soil from Fukushima: Japan's dilemma | Macau Business**
After the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, authorities removed a layer of contaminated soil from the affected area, which is now being stored in interim facilities near the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The government has promised to find permanent storage for the soil by 2045. Currently, the soil is being kept inside guarded grounds, protected by layers of clean soil and a manmade sheet to prevent runoff. The government plans to use the soil for building road and railway embankments, but so far, few takers have been found in other parts of Japan. Some local officials suggest that a portion of the soil may need to stay in Fukushima. According to the environment ministry, around 75% of the stored soil has a radioactivity level equivalent to or less than one X-ray per year. Akira Asakawa, a ministry official, said that asphalt, farm soil, or layers of other materials should be used to seal in the radioactivity. In a test, the government constructed roads and fields in Fukushima using the contaminated soil as filling material, and the locations did not show elevated levels of radioactivity. However, local communities have reacted angrily to plans to bring the Fukushima soil to a popular park in Tokyo and other areas near the capital. The environment ministry says it will step up efforts to explain the safety of its plan to the public from this year. As Takuya Haraguchi, a 25-year-old kiwi farmer, said, 'I want people to become interested in and learn about what Fukushima is really like these days.'

**CIA Report Warns of Global Catastrophe by 2030: A Countdown to Disaster**
A 2003 report by the CIA, 'The 2030 Spike: Countdown to Global Catastrophe', written by Colin Mason, describes six factors that will converge in the next decade, leading to a global catastrophe. These factors include energy scarcity, demographic disparities, global poverty, climate change, food shortages, water scarcity, and international anarchy. The report proposes over 100 measures to mitigate the consequences of this crisis. According to the report, 'estimates place available petroleum resources at less than one billion barrels, and global consumption at 28 billion barrels per year, indicating depletion in as little as 34 years.' The report also cites studies by the International Water Management Institute, predicting that one billion people will face absolute water scarcity by 2025. To avoid this, the report suggests using science, particularly genetics and climatology, to address climate change, water and food scarcity. However, some measures proposed in the report are more controversial, including: diverting scientific effort from arms, space research, and 'doubtful' technologies to practical goals for humanity; establishing a global authority to define priorities and advise on implementation; forming a 'censor' body to examine new technologies and identify potential harm; creating a specialized international penal law body to prevent the application of harmful technologies; and establishing research institutes with secure funding. The report concludes that these objectives may not be achievable, but can be approached.

**Fukushima's toxic soil: Japan grapples with recycling challenge**
Following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, authorities removed contaminated soil from large areas of land in northern Japan. The removed soil, enough to fill over 10 baseball stadiums, is now being stored at interim facilities near the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The government has promised to find permanent storage for the soil elsewhere in the country by 2045. However, few takers have been found, and some officials suggest that a portion of the soil may need to stay in Fukushima. The government plans to use the soil for building road and railway embankments, but has vowed to do so outside Fukushima to avoid further burdening the region. According to the environment ministry, around 75% of the stored soil has a radioactivity level equivalent to or less than one X-ray per year for people who directly stand on or work with it. Akira Asakawa, a ministry official, said that asphalt, farm soil, or layers of other materials should be used to seal in the radioactivity. In a test, the government constructed roads and fields in Fukushima using the contaminated soil as filling material, and found no elevated levels of radioactivity.

**Fukushima's Contaminated Soil: A Challenge for Reuse and Storage**
After the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, the government removed the top layer of contaminated soil from a large area to reduce radiation levels. Now, with young farmers working to revitalize the area, which was once famous for its delicious fruits, the government is struggling to find a way to handle the massive amount of soil, equivalent to filling over 10 baseball stadiums. According to AFP, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that hit the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant caused a catastrophic meltdown of the reactor core. The collection of topsoil is part of a large-scale decontamination effort that also includes using high-pressure water jets to wash buildings and roads. Although Fukushima has been largely declared safe, many residents who left due to radiation concerns are hesitant to return, and some have settled elsewhere. However, new residents like 25-year-old Takuya Haraguchi, a farmer who grows kiwis, hope to raise awareness and interest in today's Fukushima. The soil, totaling around 140 million cubic meters, is stored in a temporary facility near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The Japanese government has promised to find a permanent storage site outside of Fukushima by 2045. Currently, the soil is stored in a secured area with guards, covered with clean soil and artificial waterproofing to prevent radioactive materials from seeping into the environment. The government aims to reuse the soil for construction projects such as road and railway embankments. To avoid burdening Fukushima, the government plans to conduct such activities in other areas. However, other regions have shown little interest in accepting the soil, with some officials suggesting that some of it may need to remain in Fukushima. The Japanese government has announced plans to symbolically collect some of the soil to demonstrate its safety, with reports suggesting it will be used for flower bed construction. According to the Japanese Environment Ministry, about 75% of the stored soil has a radiation level equivalent to or lower than the annual dose of a single X-ray exposure. The soil has been used as fill material to build roads and fields, with test results showing no increase in radiation levels and no radioactive material leakage into the surrounding area. In 2022, the government proposed transporting the soil to a popular park in Tokyo and other areas in the capital region, but the plan was met with strong opposition from local communities. The plan has yet to be implemented, and other storage locations have not been determined. The Environment Ministry has stated that it will strengthen public explanations on the safety of the reuse plan from this year onwards.

**Trump's Cuts to USAID Will Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under the age of five. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.'

**Putin Allegedly Tells Trump of 'Terrorist Attacks' Prevention on May 9**
According to Russian propaganda outlet TASS, citing an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Yuri Ushakov, Putin told US President Donald Trump in a phone call that Russia had allegedly prevented 'terrorist attacks' near the Kremlin and Red Square on May 9. Putin claimed that the threat was neutralized on the night of May 7, and also stated that Ukraine allegedly launched 524 drones and Storm Shadow missiles at Russia on the same night. Additionally, Putin allegedly told Trump that there were attempts to 'intimidate leaders' who arrived in Moscow for May 9 celebrations.

**USAID Termination Could Lead to 14 Million Preventable Deaths by 2030**
The termination of the US International Development Agency (USAID) could lead to 14 million deaths by 2030, according to a recent ISGlobal study. Researchers from Brazil, Mozambique, the US, and Spain found that these deaths would be caused by preventable diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections, or malnutrition. The study's lead author, Davide Rasella, said, 'These cuts, especially their sudden nature, will cause lasting harm to vulnerable populations' health. The system can adapt to funding shortfalls, but it cannot withstand such a severe and sudden loss of funding without causing irreparable harm to those who are already vulnerable.' The study found that the US's funding cuts have had a significant impact on global health, including a 25% reduction in tuberculosis control programs in 31 countries, the closure of the World Food Programme's Johannesburg office, and a risk of 15 million additional cases and 107,000 new deaths due to the suspension of malaria control programs. The cuts also risk reversing decades of progress in health and socio-economic development in low- and middle-income countries. In January, former President Donald Trump froze development aid for 90 days, resulting in an 83% cancellation of programs coordinated by USAID, although the decision is currently being challenged in court.

**Nurmohamed: 'NDP has punished the people until 2035'**
According to Minister of OW Riad Nurmohamed, the Surinamese people have not been punished by him, but by the NDP. This punishment is a result of the consequences of the billions of loans taken out during the Bouterse government, which were never repaid. Nurmohamed stated that this has been confirmed by the Bureau for State Debt. 'Today, the truth has been confirmed by the Bureau for State Debt. Confirmed that the NDP has put this country in trouble until 2035... the people, the voters, have been punished. Because the NDP thought they would get more seats, but they didn't, so they punished the people. And today, they cry to Minister OW, because Minister OW punishes the people. You shouldn't tell me that. The NDP has punished you,' said Nurmohamed on Sunday evening at the opening of an Orange Point in Kampong Baroe, Saramacca. According to the VHP leader, it must be prevented that the country will ever again find itself in a situation where it was left by the purple party earlier. The VHP has ensured that things are on track and the country has been saved. 'No one can deny... development has taken place and the country has been economically saved. So no one needs to do it anymore, because the VHP has already done it. No one needs to come and tell the story that they will save the country again. We have already saved it... everything is economically arranged,' said Nurmohamed. According to the minister, the current government has managed to achieve a number of things with just a few hundred million. Something that the previous government could not do, despite borrowing 4 billion US dollars. 'We have started to implement various projects. What was not possible with 4 billion before, has been done by this government with a few hundred million alone. I think of schools, polyclinics and infrastructure. It's working. We have reduced the 7% construction loan and student fees for students. Today, the bank is filled with money again, so that students can borrow. In two years' time, half of the housing seekers have been solved. Half of the 70,000 people have had a plot. So if we have five more years, we will probably have solved all the problems,' said Nurmohamed, who asked for applause for the government, ministers and parliament.

**Malaria Remains a Deadly Threat to Children in Africa**
Despite progress in combating malaria, the disease remains a significant threat to children in Africa. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were nearly 600,000 deaths from malaria in 83 countries in 2023. In Africa south of the Sahara, 94% of all malaria cases and 95% of fatal cases were reported. Children under five years old accounted for 76% of deaths in Africa. To prevent malaria, it is essential to avoid mosquito bites, especially in tropical regions where mosquitoes thrive. The WHO recommends using insecticide-treated nets, insect repellents, and long-sleeved clothing to prevent bites. Two new vaccines against malaria have been approved for children and have shown promising results in initial studies. However, experts emphasize that these vaccines should be used in combination with other preventive measures, such as insecticide-treated nets. The WHO aims to reduce malaria incidence and mortality by 90% by 2030. However, the US government's decision to freeze USAID funding has created significant gaps in malaria control programs. Additionally, climate change is expected to impact malaria transmission, with some models predicting a 90% reduction in suitable areas for malaria transmission, while others suggest an increase in areas where malaria can be transmitted year-round. 'We cannot allow funding setbacks to jeopardize the global malaria agenda,' said Jérôme Salomon, WHO deputy director-general.

**UN Warns of Risks from 'Repeated Incidents of Radioactive Contamination'**
According to the United Nations (UN), there were 'less than 150 incidents of illegal or unauthorized activities related to nuclear and radioactive materials' in 2024. This indicates a challenge for some countries to prevent the unauthorized disposal of radioactive sources and confirms the effectiveness of the detection infrastructure, said Elena Buglova, director of the Nuclear Security Division of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Of the incidents, three were directly related to trafficking or malicious intent, while in 21 cases, authorities were unable to determine if there was any criminal activity involved. Although organized crime was not identified as responsible for most of the incidents, experts warned of the global risk posed by a single case where nuclear material falls 'into the wrong hands'. Additionally, in 2024, there was a reported increase in contaminated industrial materials, such as metal parts and tubes, that entered the supply chain involuntarily. The UN stated that 'the transportation of radioactive materials continues to be one of the most vulnerable areas of nuclear security'. In fact, over the past decade, 65% of all reported thefts occurred while the materials were in transit. In 2024, 32 of the 145 countries participating in the IAEA's database had submitted reports, reflecting the global effort to strengthen nuclear security. 'The incident reports submitted by participating countries to the IAEA's ITDB database over the past 30 years have strengthened global efforts to combat illicit trafficking and other unauthorized activities involving nuclear and radioactive materials outside regulatory control,' concluded Buglova. The UN urged all states 'to strengthen their security measures, especially in transportation, industrial use, and disposal of radioactive materials.' In mid-February, IAEA leader Rafael Grossi visited the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant to monitor the soil decontamination process, while the site is being dismantled. Almost 13 million cubic meters of soil, equivalent to about 4,300 Olympic-sized swimming pools, and 300,000 cubic meters of incinerated organic matter residues were removed as part of the decontamination activities in Fukushima Province. Japanese authorities plan to recycle about 75% of the contaminated soil --- those with low levels of radioactivity --- for use in civil engineering structures, such as road embankments and railway tracks, if confirmed as safe.

**Japan to pick final disposal sites for crippled nuclear plant soil by 2030**
Japan plans to decide by 2030 where to dispose of radioactive Fukushima soil removed during the decontamination process following the 2011 nuclear disaster. The Environment Ministry aims to dispose of all irradiated soil in Fukushima prefecture by March 2045. By the end of 2024, approximately 14 million cubic meters of soil had been transferred to a storage facility, with three-quarters having radiation levels of 8,000 becquerels per kilogram or lower and the remaining soil to be disposed of permanently. Final disposal sites are expected to need up to 50 hectares if the soil volume remains unchanged, or 2 to 3 hectares if the volume is reduced, with higher radiation levels in the reduced soil.

**Putin Instructs to Prevent Teacher Shortage in Schools**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed that a teacher shortage in schools should be prevented, taking into account the demographic situation in the country. Putin noted, 'We have a corresponding forecast, according to which after 2025, the decline in the number of students in schools will primarily affect primary school. However, in 8-11 grades, in 2032, an increase in students is expected.' Putin made this statement in advance to encourage leaders of relevant government agencies to carefully consider the near future and responsibly regulate the number of teachers in educational institutions. He emphasized, 'In no case should a shortage of positions for corresponding categories of teachers occur.' Putin also believes that outdated and archaic courses should be removed from university programs, as they are a major reason why many students lose interest in their future profession.

**Mexico and US Agree to Tariff Pause, Israel Accused of Gaza Massacres, and More**
Mexico and the US have agreed to a one-month pause on the 25% tariffs on Mexican exports. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and US President Donald Trump made the agreement, which also includes Mexico strengthening its northern border with 10,000 National Guard members to prevent drug trafficking to the US. The US has committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico, which often end up in the hands of organized crime. Additionally, the two countries have started working on two key areas: security and trade. Meanwhile, Israel has been accused of committing 9,268 massacres in Gaza over 471 days of constant siege, resulting in the deaths of 61,000 Palestinians. The indiscriminate use of over 85,000 tons of bombs has surpassed the amount used in World War II, causing economic losses of over $50 billion. In Argentina, over 1,000 people have been evacuated due to forest fires that have devastated over 2,700 hectares near the town of El Bolsón. The governor of Río Negro, Alberto Weretilneck, has stated that the fires were 'intentional' and that those responsible will not be left unpunished. Finally, an asteroid, 2024 yr4, is expected to pass close to Earth on December 22, 2032, with a 1 in 83 chance of collision. The asteroid is estimated to be between 40 and 100 meters in diameter.

**US Warns Israel: 'Don't Repeat Our Mistakes'**
The US has expressed concerns about Israel's clarity on its goals for a potential operation in the Gaza Strip. The Biden administration is worried that Israel lacks achievable military objectives for operations in Gaza, leading American officials to believe that the Israeli military is not yet ready for a ground invasion. According to sources, US President Joe Biden has privately told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the US should avoid a repeat of its mistakes in Afghanistan, where a retaliatory strike for the 9/11 attacks led to a decades-long involvement in the region. The article, published in The Times of Israel, an Israeli newspaper funded by American money, is seen as a clear signal from Washington to the Israeli government and public to avoid repeating the US's mistakes. The article notes that Israel has nowhere to withdraw its soldiers if the situation in Gaza deteriorates, and that even the presence of nuclear weapons may not be enough to prevent a loss of Israeli statehood. The article also quotes Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's plan for a three-stage operation: first, a ground invasion to destroy Hamas and its infrastructure; second, the elimination of all resistance hotspots; and third, the establishment of a new security regime in Gaza, which would isolate Israeli residents from the rest of the population. The article argues that this plan is unrealistic and would result in the creation of a concentration camp for nearly three million people. Meanwhile, the Israeli military is concerned that the government may not give the green light for the operation, and that further releases of hostages by Hamas may delay or cancel the invasion.
