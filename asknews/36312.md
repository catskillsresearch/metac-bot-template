**Reconciliation text includes $500 million for modernization and AI at Commerce**
The House Energy and Commerce Committee included $500 million for federal IT modernization and artificial intelligence in the 2025 budget reconciliation bill text. This will allow the Commerce Department to replace or update legacy business systems and deploy AI through 2035. Additionally, a moratorium on state-level enforcement of AI laws and regulations has been included, which will last for the next decade. According to Adam Thierer, a senior research fellow at the R Street Institute, 'A moratorium on new AI regulations will give this market time to grow and ensure American AI innovators can invest and compete against China and the rest of the world.' This move is seen as a way to promote AI development and deployment, following the administration's efforts to remove barriers to AI growth.

**CBO: House Energy Panel Tops $880B Savings Target**
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed that the House Energy and Commerce Committee has exceeded its target of finding $880 billion in savings for the reconciliation budget bill. According to CBO Director Phillip Swagel, the committee's recommendations would reduce deficits by more than $880 billion over the 2025-2034 period and would not increase on-budget deficits after 2034. However, Democrats have expressed concerns that the bill would lead to millions of Americans losing Medicaid coverage, citing a previous CBO report. A committee spokesperson disputed this claim, stating that the report was based on speculation and that official scores would be released in the coming days. Committee Chair Rep. Brett Guthrie defended the bill, saying it 'preserves and strengthens Medicaid for children, mothers, people with disabilities and the elderly -- for whom the program was designed.'

**CBO: House GOP plan exceeds $880 billion savings target**
The Energy and Commerce Committee has exceeded its target of finding $880 billion in savings to help pay for legislation to extend President Trump's tax cuts and other priorities, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO letter stated that the committee's reconciliation recommendations would reduce deficits by more than $880 billion by 2034 and 'would not increase on-budget deficits in any year after 2034.' However, a partial CBO analysis circulated by Democrats found that the proposal would reduce federal spending by an estimated $912 billion over the decade, but also cause 8.6 million people to become uninsured. GOP committee staff are hoping to have a full CBO score of the bill in time for Tuesday's session to amend and advance the bill.

**Trump's Fiscal Policies to Increase US Deficit to 9% of GDP by 2035**
The US is facing a significant problem with its public accounts, with a fiscal deficit of $1.7 trillion in 2023, equivalent to 6.3% of GDP. Experts estimate that if Donald Trump's fiscal policies are maintained, the deficit will increase to a range of 7% to 9% of GDP over the next 10 years, unless there are cuts in public spending. Trump's proposals for the 2026 fiscal year, presented in May 2025, focus on reducing spending, with significant cuts in social programs and science, and substantial increases in defense and national security. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) notes that the extension of the 2017 tax cuts through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and new tax deductions will increase the country's debt by $7.7 trillion between 2026 and 2035. The CRFB estimates that Trump's fiscal proposals will reduce federal revenues by approximately $10.4 trillion between 2026 and 2035. Without compensatory spending cuts, these measures will increase the deficit by approximately $1 billion per year, especially in the 2026 fiscal year. This increase in the primary deficit represents approximately 1.5% additional GDP per year during that period. Taking into account the projected GDP of $35 trillion in 2035, this increase will add to the existing structural deficit, potentially raising the total public debt to around 5% of GDP in the next decade. The CRFB also estimates that, under Trump's fiscal plan, the country's spending will reach around 21% of GDP in 2035, unless modified. Despite some cost-effective proposals, Trump's fiscal and defense policies, without income or structural adjustments, will lead to higher deficits and sustained increases in federal debt.

**Airef: 'The increase in defense spending will have a direct impact on deficit and debt'**
The president of the Independent Authority for Fiscal Responsibility (Airef), Cristina Herrero, has explained that increasing defense spending by 10,500 million euros in 2025, to reach 2% of GDP, 'can be done through a reassignment of budget items' within the prorogued budget. However, this would not avoid the decision having 'a complete impact on spending, deficit, and debt'. Herrero has stated that if the 10,500 million euros found in the budget for expanding defense spending without breaking the authorized ceiling is not used for that purpose, the 2025 exercise could end with less spending, less deficit, and less debt. She has also explained that the government has increased its forecast for growth in spending from 3.7% to 4.1% for this year to accommodate the increased defense spending. Herrero has clarified that while the increase in defense spending can be done through a reassignment of budget items, it will have a complete impact on spending, deficit, and debt, and that this will not trigger any type of sanction in Brussels. However, she has warned that the increase in spending in 2024 exceeded the national spending rule, which is different and defined in the 2012 Stability Law, and that this obliges the state to present a plan of reequilibrium for the exercises 2025 and following. Herrero has also stated that the obligation to present a plan of reequilibrium for the incumplimiento of the national spending rule has been systematically eluded by all governments (PP and PSOE) since its introduction in 2012.

**Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie: Budget Reconciliation Bill Defunds Planned Parenthood**
The House Committee on Energy and Commerce, led by Chairman Brett Guthrie, has included a provision in the proposed budget reconciliation bill to defund Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers through Medicaid. This move comes after a campaign from conservatives and pro-life organizations to end taxpayer dollars to abortion organizations. Rep. Mary Miller and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America praised the decision, but noted that there is still a long road ahead. The bill classifies Planned Parenthood as a 'prohibited entity' that provides abortions, and prohibits federal funds from being used to make payments to such entities. According to Planned Parenthood's 2023 annual report, taxpayer funding made up 34% of their overall revenue, totaling $699.3 million. The organization performed 392,716 abortions in 2021-2022, a five percent increase from the previous year.

**A conversation to avoid a potential catastrophe**
The Reconciliation Act, a bill proposed by the Republican Party in Congress, is expected to cut $1.4 trillion in funding over the next 10 years for programs such as Head Start ($880 billion), SNAP ($230 billion), and Medicaid ($300-plus billion). Congressman Hank Johnson is hosting a roundtable discussion on May 9, 2025, to discuss the impact of these cuts on the nonprofit sector and the children and families they serve. According to Johnson, the cuts would be a 'catastrophe' for the state of Georgia, and it is essential to raise awareness about the potential consequences of these funding reductions.

**Trump wants to slash discretionary spending, but reconciliation bill on tap first**
The White House has released its 2026 'skinny budget' proposal, which aims to increase defense spending by 13% and cut non-defense discretionary spending by 23%. However, Congress is currently working on the reconciliation package, which includes tax cuts, debt ceiling increase, and mandatory spending cuts. Cato Institute budget expert Romina Boccia said it's 'curious timing' for the White House to release the budget proposal now, as Congress is already discussing the reconciliation bill. Boccia also criticized the reconciliation package for not offsetting deficit increases with enough spending cuts, which could lead to a $5 trillion or more deficit increase over the next 10 years. The fiscal 2026 budget will be harder to pass, requiring some Democratic support to clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Boccia applauded the Trump administration for the cuts proposed in the 2026 skinny budget, saying they are 'long overdue' and would reduce spending on federal programs that should not be within the purview of the federal government.

**White House unveils reconciliation-augmented fiscal 2026 budget - Roll Call**
President Donald Trump's proposed fiscal 2026 budget includes steep cuts to domestic and foreign aid spending, while increasing defense and border security spending. Senate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker expressed concerns that the flat discretionary defense budget would be a cut when factoring in inflation. Wicker stated, 'The Big, Beautiful Reconciliation Bill was always meant to change fundamentally the direction of the Pentagon on programs like Golden Dome, border support, and unmanned capabilities — not to paper over [the Office of Management and Budget]’s intent to shred to the bone our military capabilities and our support to service members.' Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins shared similar criticism, stating she had 'serious objections' to both the flat discretionary defense spending and proposed cuts to biomedical research, low-income heating subsidies and Education Department services for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. The $119 billion boost to defense is entirely offset by equal cuts to nondefense programs in fiscal 2026, amounting to a nearly 17 percent reduction on average. Senate Appropriations ranking member Patty Murray said Trump's budget would 'eviscerate programs that matter most to working families.' The Transportation and Veterans Affairs departments are poised for increases under the proposal, while the State Department's actual funding level would dip to $31.2 billion, from the $59.6 billion current level. Cuts to other Cabinet departments range from 8 percent for the Justice Department to 35 percent for Labor, and the proposal would also decimate some smaller agencies like the EPA, which is facing a nearly 55 percent cut.

**IMF forecasts U.S. fiscal deficit will dip in 2025 thanks to higher tariff revenue**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that the U.S. fiscal deficit will decrease to 6.5% of GDP in 2025, down from 7.3% in 2024, due to higher tariff revenue. However, the report notes that this projection is 'contingent on higher tariff revenues' and that the 'magnitude of the tariff revenue increase is highly uncertain.' The IMF also warns that tariffs could lead to a wider slowdown in economic activity, which could offset higher revenues from tariffs. Additionally, the report notes that the total size of U.S. government debt continues to surge, which could push up longer-term interest rates and the cost of financing the debt. According to the IMF, an increase of 10 percentage points of GDP in U.S. public debt between 2024 and 2029 could lead to a 60-basis-point rise in the 5-year forward to 10-year rate. 'These projections are highly uncertain and do not account for measures under discussion in Congress, under budget reconciliation' negotiations,' the fund said.

**How concerned are Americans about the budget deficit? What a new poll found**
A new poll by the Economist/YouGov found that 71% of Americans are very (36%) or somewhat concerned (35%) about the U.S. budget deficit, with widespread agreement across the political spectrum. When asked how to reduce the deficit, 74% of respondents said government spending should be cut, while just 22% said taxes should be raised. The Senate's proposed budget reconciliation package for fiscal year 2025 is expected to increase the budget deficit by up to $5.7 trillion, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated, 'The U.S. federal debt is on an unsustainable path... This is a situation that we very much need to address.' The national debt now stands at a record high of $36.21 trillion, with a deficit of $1.83 trillion in fiscal year 2024.

**Trump's**
US President Donald Trump's proposed 'big, beautiful bill' may worsen the nation's debt and deficit, experts have warned. The bill, which includes expanded military spending, major tax cuts, and new energy policies, could add to already record-high deficits and the ballooning national debt. According to Dean Baker, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, 'It clearly will make the debt/deficit worse than the baseline.' Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a non-resident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that the deficit will grow and the debt/GDP ratio will continue to rise. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, stated that the budget's reconciliation instructions would allow for legislation to add 5.8 trillion dollars to deficits through Fiscal Year 2034. The US budget deficit for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 reached a record 1.3 trillion dollars, the second-highest six-month level on record.

**House moves toward trillions in new deficits**
The House has passed a budget resolution that would allow for up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years and $2 trillion in spending reductions. The plan now moves to the Senate, which wants even steeper tax cuts. According to experts, this legislation will likely add trillions in new deficit spending. Republicans aim to use reconciliation to pass their tax-and-spending package, which has been criticized for facilitating fiscal excess. The current Republican majority is on a path to increase total debt held by the public from $30 trillion this year to $52 trillion, or nearly 120% of GDP, by 2035. Financial markets may eventually say 'enough is enough' due to the budget trajectory and other concerns, shifting the fiscal outlook from bad to irretrievable.

**US House Approves Budget Resolution with $4.5 Trillion in Tax Cuts**
The US House of Representatives has approved a budget resolution that calls for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in spending reductions, as well as increased funding for military and border security over the next decade. The resolution, which is a significant victory for President Donald Trump, was approved by 217 votes to 215. Republican leaders said, 'Today, House Republicans brought the Congress closer to fulfilling the complete agenda of President Trump's America First, not just parts of it.' The budget resolution is a non-binding document that outlines fiscal goals and directs committees to increase or reduce spending, but does not establish specific programs. Once the Senate approves the budget, Republicans in Congress can initiate a process called 'reconciliation' to ultimately pass legislation without Democratic support to extend the tax cuts implemented during Trump's first term in 2017. Critics, including Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, say the new measures will add at least $2.8 trillion to the deficit by 2034. However, Joshua Bolten, executive director of the Business Roundtable, praised the House for advancing a budget resolution for the 2025 fiscal year, saying it marks a crucial moment in Congress's work to protect and promote the economic benefits of the tax reform.

**House committee passes budget blueprint, targeting $2 trillion in cuts**
The House Budget Committee has approved a budget plan that aims to cut federal spending by $2 trillion over the next decade and reduce tax revenue by $4.5 trillion. The plan would also increase the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. House Republicans see this as a 'blueprint' to tackle President Trump's spending goals, but the plan still projects a $2 trillion annual deficit through 2034. The budget resolution tasks various House committees to find spending cuts, but also gives some committees, such as Homeland Security, the Judiciary, and Armed Services, leeway to add to the deficit. Republicans can pass the bill without Democratic support using reconciliation, but they'll need near universal support from their own party and at least 50 Republican senators to agree on a final proposal.

**Graham unveils blueprint for $150B defense increase**
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has released a resolution that would increase the U.S. defense budget by $150 billion over the next several years. The funds would be allocated to cover integrated air and missile defense, Navy shipbuilding, and military readiness. Graham's proposal instructs the Senate Armed Services Committee to add $150 billion to the U.S. deficit for the defense portion of an upcoming budget reconciliation bill between fiscal years 2025 and 2034.

**How low can you go? Budget baseline games and tax policy**
President Trump and the Republican-led Congress plan to use the reconciliation process to pass major tax legislation next year. This process allows legislation to pass with only 50 votes in the Senate, but it comes with several caveats. The major question is, 'How low will the deficit target be?' The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has analyzed a range of plausible options for a deficit target, from egregiously low to aspirationally strict. The CBO's baseline projects that federal debt will grow from 99% in 2024 to 122% in 2034. However, this is a baseline that few members of Congress would like to adopt because it follows assumptions about future spending and tax policies on which politicians disagree. The challenge is that any plausible concoction of current law and current policy budget baselines produces a horrific deficit outlook. To illustrate the range of more plausible deficit paths, we've constructed some alternative scenarios, shown in Figure 1. We benchmark all scenarios against a common definition of budget sustainability -- a deficit that holds the amount of debt held by the public constant as a share of GDP, shown in orange. Although the federal government would still run arguably large annual deficits under this scenario, this would at least ensure that our ability to service the national debt out of national income is held fixed after 2024. Another useful benchmark is the current law CBO projections for annual federal deficits, shown in dark blue. As previously described, baseline assumes that all spending and revenue provisions scheduled to expire will do so, including the TCJA, and appropriated spending will grow with inflation. 'If permitted, evaluating tax legislation against a current policy baseline may make it easier for a reconciliation bill to propose a seemingly low-cost tax bill,' said the report. 'For example, using the conventional current law baseline, a full extension of the TCJA is estimated to reduce federal revenues by nearly $5 trillion over ten years -- a hefty price tag in the face of an already bleak fiscal outlook.'
