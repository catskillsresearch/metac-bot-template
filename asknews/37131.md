**Marcus Semien Trying to Kick-Start His 2025 MLB Season**
Marcus Semien, a three-time All-Star and Cal alum, is struggling in the 2025 MLB season. Despite the Texas Rangers' recent success, Semien is unhappy with his performance, saying, 'I'm not getting on base, I'm not scoring runs, I'm not doing anything in most offensive categories. It hasn't been fun.' Semien is batting .174 with three home runs and 17 RBIs, a significant decline from his .276 average and 122 runs scored in 2023. Rangers manager Bruce Bochy has expressed confidence in Semien, saying, 'I know how important he is to this club. We need Marcus.' New hitting coach Bret Boone believes Semien's slow start is due to a 'fundamental battle' and is encouraging him to stick with it, saying, 'I see a more fundamental battle. Guys go through that even when their body is perfect.' Semien is working to fix his issues, saying, 'It's more about tinkering with different things and making sure I can see the ball better and swing better.'

**What To Do About A Problem Named Aaron...**
The A's are facing a challenge with Aaron Judge, who is having a remarkable season with a .400 batting average, 12 home runs, and 11.2 WAR. The author suggests that the A's should not pitch to Judge intentionally, especially with runners on base, as he is the best hitter in the Yankees' lineup. Instead, they should focus on pitching to the hitter who bats after Judge, who is not as threatening. The author believes that this approach is the best way to avoid letting Judge beat the A's, as he is human and can slump at any time. According to the author, the Yankees' lineup is 'tepid' and only Paul Goldschmidt is having a good start, but even he is not as dominant as Judge. The author concludes that the A's should not give in to Judge and should instead focus on pitching to the weaker hitters in the Yankees' lineup.

The first Rookie of the Year poll of 2025 has been released by MLB.com, with Jacob Wilson of the Athletics as the runaway favorite in the American League. Wilson has led all qualified AL rookies with an .847 OPS and has been one of the brightest spots for the A's team. In the National League, the race is far more open, with AJ Smith-Shawver of the Braves leading the pack with a 2.33 ERA in seven starts. Other notable rookies in the NL include Drake Baldwin, Agustín Ramírez, Luisangel Acuña, and Dylan Crews. 'Wilson has been one of the brightest bright spots for an A's team that has outperformed expectations for much of the season,' said MLB.com. 'He led all qualified AL rookies with an .847 OPS through Sunday and ranked second with a .337 batting average.'

**Reds OF is the only player since 1900 with this impressive feat**
Reds outfielder Hinds has made history with 13 extra-base hits in his first 15 career hits, the only player since 1900 to achieve this feat. Despite a low 2025 batting average of .176, Hinds has already made an impact this season with two home runs and three RBI in just six games. The Reds' pitching has also been a bright spot, with a 3.58 Earned Run Average, tied for ninth in the league. Hinds' power at the plate has been valuable to the team, and if he can continue to take advantage of his opportunity, he could be a key contributor to the Reds' success. The team will look to sustain their momentum from a weekend sweep of the Guardians and get back above .500 for the first time since May 4.

**CJ Abrams and the Nats have a blast in Baltimore to finish a series sweep**
CJ Abrams had a blast in Baltimore, hitting two home runs, including a no-doubter on the game's first pitch, as the Nationals racked up five homers in a 10-4 victory over the Orioles, securing a series sweep. Abrams's second at-bat saw the Nationals homer four times, with Luis García Jr. and Dylan Crews also hitting home runs. Josh Bell added a 433-foot home run in the eighth, putting the Nationals at 1,946 feet of home run distance. The Nationals' first series sweep since July 19-21, 2024, against Cincinnati, improved their record to 21-27. Manager Dave Martinez noted that the team's improvement in hitting the ball out of the park is a key area of growth, with several players on pace for 20-25 home runs. Abrams's performance, including a double in the ninth, brought his batting average to .312 and his OPS to .942.

**Red Sox Could Make 'Panic Trade' For Rays' Former Batting Champion**
The Boston Red Sox are struggling to find a reliable solution at the first base position, with Abraham Toro and Nick Sogard currently carrying the load. According to Bleacher Report's Kerry Miller, the Red Sox could be considering a 'panic trade' to acquire Tampa Bay Rays first baseman Yandy Díaz. Díaz, who won the American League batting title in 2023 with a .330 average, has a .272/.330/.410 record in 187 games since the start of 2024. Miller suggests that Díaz could be a sound strategy for the Red Sox, but would require significant prospect capital from the Rays. 'Even before Casas' season-ending knee injury, it's not like things were going great at that position. Now, however, they've gone from a near-everyday first baseman with a .580 OPS to just a huge unknown from one day to the next,' Miller wrote.

**4 Fantasy Baseball Regression Candidates (2025)**
The first seven weeks of the MLB season have seen many players experience positive and negative regression. Juan Soto's batting slump continues, with a .217 average and .321 on-base percentage, despite three home runs last week. His low batting average on balls in play (BABIP) is a major contributor to his struggles. Brice Turang, on the other hand, is due for a turnaround after a disappointing eight-day stretch with a .125 average and zero home runs. His walk rate and strikeout rate remain elite, and his career-best barrel rate and exit velocity suggest a return to form soon. Sean Murphy's recent hot streak, with a .333 average and .455 on-base percentage, may be smoke and mirrors, accompanied by a 31.8% strikeout rate and a .545 BABIP. Byron Buxton's production, including nine home runs and eight steals, may start to shift downward due to a 40% strikeout rate and a fortunate .400 BABIP.

**MLB DFS: Top DraftKings, FanDuel daily Fantasy baseball picks, lineups, advice for Friday, May 9, 2025 - CBSSports.com**
The Detroit Tigers have the best record in the American League with a 25-13 record this season. They have achieved this with a combination of young talent and veterans. Javier Baez has an .835 OPS and Gleyber Torres has an .808 OPS. The Tigers begin a series with the Rangers on Friday, with Texas starting Patrick Corbin, who has allowed two runs or fewer in each of his last four starts. Mike McClure, a daily Fantasy expert, recommends building Tigers stacks in MLB DFS lineups. McClure's top picks for Friday include Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge, who is off to an incredible start with a .400 batting average and 12 home runs, and Orioles shortstop Gunnar Henderson, who has at least one hit in 11 of his last 12 games. McClure also recommends an undervalued player who is set to explode for huge numbers on Friday.

**QUEST TO .400**
Aaron Judge is leading the major leagues in hitting with a .423 batting average, but it's highly unlikely he'll repeat Ted Williams' famous feat of hitting .400. Judge has already struck out 31 times this season, compared to Williams' 27 in 1941. To hit .400, a player needs to make contact, have a high walk total, and ride a BABIP (batting average on balls in play) heater. Judge's strengths and weaknesses can help us understand the challenges of hitting .400. For example, he needs to hit .500 on non-strikeout plate appearances, which is an extraordinary mark that's unlikely to last. One player who could have made a run at .400 but never really did was Wade Boggs, whose highest average was .368. Boggs had a BABIP of .396 in 1985 and struck out in only 4.7% of his plate appearances. If we combine his rates into one hypothetical season, we end up with a .401 average.

**What it takes to hit .400 today: Aaron Judge's case offers some clues**
Achieving a .400 batting average today is a rare feat, and there are several factors that contribute to a player's batting average on balls in play (BABIP). While there is some luck involved, players can improve their BABIP by hitting more ground balls and using their speed to turn ground balls into hits within the infield. George Sisler achieved a BABIP of .422 in 1922, which helped him hit .420 that season. However, such high BABIP numbers are rare, especially in modern baseball. The current BABIP in the major leagues is .288, which is lower than the .300 mark seen in 1930, the last year a player hit .400. One way to achieve a high BABIP is to hit many home runs, as seen in Rod Carew's .388 season in 1977, which was driven by a BABIP of .408 and 14 home runs.

**Look: Gavin Lux Among Major League Baseball's Elite Since Middle of Last Season**
Gavin Lux, a utility player for the Cincinnati Reds, has been performing exceptionally well since July 2024, with a batting average of .323, on-base percentage of .410, and slugging percentage of .502 in 87 games. He joins a select group of players, including Aaron Judge, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Kyle Tucker, Bobby Witt Jr, and Marcell Ozuna, who have achieved a .300/.400/.500 slash line during the same period. The Reds acquired Lux from the Los Angeles Dodgers in the offseason, and he has been a significant addition to the team's lineup this season.

**Yamada Ryota's Walk-Off Home Run Leads Giants to 5-Point Comeback Victory**
Yamada Ryota, a key player for the Yomiuri Giants, hit a walk-off home run in the 10th inning of an extra-inning game, securing a 5-point comeback victory. The 25-year-old was inserted into the starting lineup in place of the injured mainstay Maru Kahei. 'I felt a sense of 'majika' (a Japanese idiom meaning 'it's going to be a tough game'), but I was prepared,' Yamada said. He hit a compact single to left field on a 1-1 count against Yakult's Kiyomizu Noboru, securing the win. 'I'm still feeling a sense of disbelief,' Yamada said, smiling. Yamada, who joined the team in June 2024 via a trade from Seibu, has been a key contributor with his speed and power. He hit a walk-off home run in July 2024 and has been working to improve his batting form, which has been affected by a natural gas chest injury. He maintained a batting average of .400 in the preseason and was ready to start the season. Yamada had a great game, hitting four singles, including the game-winning hit, and said, 'I want to continue this momentum not just today, but throughout the season. I won't waste any chances.'

**Dominican Players Among Favorites for 2025 MLB MVP Award**
Several Dominican players are among the favorites to win the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in Major League Baseball (MLB) this season. In the American League, Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani had impressive seasons in 2024, but this year, several Dominican players are expected to make a strong case for the award. In the National League, Juan Soto is projected to have another season with a batting average over .400, which would be his eighth consecutive season to start his career, and another season with at least 25 home runs and 125 walks. He has already registered four seasons with that combination of home runs and walks, the fourth most in history. Soto's seasons are always worthy of MVP consideration, and this could be the year he finally wins the award. In the American League, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. had a spectacular season in 2021, leading MLB with 48 home runs and the American League with an OPS of 1.002, but this year, he is expected to have an even better season, with an OPS of .940 and a bWAR of 6.2. Guerrero is entering his free agency season at 26 years old, which could be the key to a spectacular 2025 season and finally winning the MVP award. Another player to watch is José Ramírez, who has finished in the top five in MVP voting five times and had a season in 2024 that was just one double and one home run shy of becoming the second player in MLB history with a season of 40 doubles, 40 home runs, and 40 stolen bases. He has been one of the most consistent and durable players in the game, and this could be the year he finally wins the MVP award.

**2025 Fantasy Baseball: Jasson Dominguez Profile, Preview, Predictions**
Jasson Dominguez, the New York Yankees outfielder, has the potential to be a 20/40 player. His minor league stats show a promising approach, with a high walk rate (13.0) and a contact batting average (.384). In 2024, he had 206 at-bats of experience at AAA, with a .325 batting average, 39 runs, 7 home runs, 35 RBIs, and 18 stolen bases. The Yankees will give him every opportunity to win the starting centerfield position, and he is expected to move to the top two slots in their batting order when his bat is ready. His price point in the early draft season requires him to earn a full-time starting job in 2025.

**2025 Fantasy Baseball: Brenton Doyle Profile, Preview, Predictions**
Brenton Doyle, an outfielder for the Colorado Rockies, showed improvement in his hitting profile in 2024, particularly in his strikeout rate and batting average. He hit .260 with a 25.4% strikeout rate and 7.6% walk rate, ranking 27th in FPG score. Doyle's power surge came in July, and he was a better hitter at home, with a .313 batting average and 16 stolen bases. His swing path was balanced, and he ranked 103rd in exit velocity and 95th in hard-hit rate. The Rockies plan to bat Doyle in the leadoff position this year, creating more opportunities for him to score runs and increase his at-bats. Doyle is projected to have a 90/25/80/40 season, with his batting average being influenced by his strikeout rate.
