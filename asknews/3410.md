**The Oceans in Peril: Rising Temperatures, Ocean Acidification, and Decreased Oxygen Levels**
The world's oceans are facing numerous challenges due to human activities, including rising temperatures, ocean acidification, and decreased oxygen levels. According to a study, the oceans have absorbed 90% of the excess heat in the atmosphere, leading to a rapid increase in ocean temperatures, with a rate of increase twice as fast as in the 1960s. The study also found that the average temperature of the ocean surface in 2024 broke the previous record set in 2023. The oceans cover 70.8% of the Earth's surface and play a crucial role in regulating the climate. However, they are facing numerous threats, including rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and decreased oxygen levels, which are affecting marine life and coastal communities. The study suggests that if global warming continues, the rate of sea level rise will accelerate to 1 meter per century by 2100, affecting 230 million people living in coastal areas. The study also highlights the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the effects of climate change.

**More acid, less oxygen: Scientists say Earth’s ‘blue ally’ buckling hard and fast under climate strain**
The world's oceans are experiencing alarming symptoms of stress due to climate change, including heatwaves, loss of marine life, rising sea levels, falling oxygen levels, and acidification caused by excess carbon dioxide. According to Angelique Melet, an oceanographer at the European Mercator Ocean monitor, 'oceans are warming faster and faster', with the rate of ocean warming more than doubling since 1993. Average sea surface temperatures reached new records in 2023 and 2024, and despite a respite in 2025, temperatures remain at historic highs. Marine heatwaves have doubled in frequency, become longer lasting and more intense, and affect a wider area. Scientists expect that the world will breach the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming threshold, which could lead to the loss of 70-90% of corals this century. The oceans' thermal expansion and the melting of ice caps and glaciers are causing sea levels to rise at an alarming rate, with the pace of global oceans rising doubling in three decades and expected to double again by 2100. Melet said, 'Ocean warming, like sea-level rise, has become an inescapable process on the scale of our lives, but also over several centuries.' However, reducing greenhouse gas emissions can reduce the rate and magnitude of the damage and give time for adaptation.

**UN: The World Approaches a New Climate Threshold**
The United Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has released a report warning of a high probability of the global average temperature exceeding the critical threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2025 and 2029, with a 70% chance. This report highlights the world's approach to breaching the climate limit set by the Paris Agreement in 2015, which aims to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, with a goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible. The report notes that the past two years have seen record-breaking temperatures, with 2023 and 2024 being among the hottest years on record. According to the latest data, the average temperature in 2024 exceeded pre-industrial levels by 1.45 degrees Celsius, with a 80% scientific probability that one of the next five years will be warmer than 2024. The report predicts that temperatures will rise between 1.2 and 1.9 degrees Celsius between 2025 and 2029 compared to the mid-19th century, with a 1% chance of exceeding a 2-degree Celsius threshold during the same period, a scenario that was considered unlikely a decade ago but is now a looming reality. These numbers are not just statistics, but reflect an escalating reality of climate change impacts, where temperatures have risen by 40 to 50 degrees Celsius in regions such as China and the UAE, while Pakistan has suffered from drought and strong winds, and Europe and Canada have experienced devastating floods and fires. Rising temperatures also contribute to the melting of permanent ice and the reduction of sea ice coverage, as well as exacerbating droughts and increasing the risk of heavy rainfall. Climate scientists warn that continued increases in greenhouse gas emissions make achieving the ambitious goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius less likely over time. According to the Copernicus program of the European Union, the current warming has reached 1.39 degrees Celsius, and it is likely to exceed the 1.5-degree threshold before the end of the 2020s. The Arctic remains the fastest-warming region compared to the rest of the world, with a clear reduction in sea ice coverage in the Barents, Bering, and Okhotsk seas. Studies predict an increase in rainfall rates in coastal areas, Alaska, Siberia, and northern Europe, while the Amazon basin is expected to experience drier conditions in the near future.

**The Oceans' Losing Battle Against Climate Change**
The world's oceans are losing their battle against climate change, absorbing 90% of excess heat in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel emissions. As a result, they are experiencing rapid warming, with temperatures rising at a rate twice as fast as in the 1960s, according to Angelic Milie, an ocean expert at 'Miracatour Ocean'. The surface temperature of the oceans in 2024 has broken the record set in 2023, and despite some stability in early 2025, the data from the European Copernicus Observatory shows that the temperatures remain at unprecedented levels. Since 1982, the area of the oceans that have experienced heat waves has increased from 50% to 80%, and their frequency has doubled, according to Tibou Ginaldo, a researcher at the Center for Meteorological Studies in Lannion, France. The Mediterranean Sea, in particular, has broken the record for highest temperature every year for the past three years, making it one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts, along with the North Atlantic and the Arctic. This has led to more frequent and intense heat waves, which are devastating marine life, especially coral reefs and shallow water ecosystems that cannot adapt. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 70-90% of coral reefs are expected to be lost if global warming reaches 1.5 degrees Celsius. This is the most likely scenario, according to the IPCC. As the oceans warm, they expand, but their ice cover does not, leading to a 20-25 cm rise in sea levels since the early 20th century, with half of this increase occurring since 1993. The current rate of warming is expected to double by 2100, leading to a 1 cm per year rise in sea levels, according to a recent study. With over 230 million people living within 1 meter of sea level, the consequences of ocean warming and sea level rise are becoming increasingly inevitable. However, if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we can slow down the rate of damage and give ourselves more time to adapt to the changes. The oceans not only store heat but also absorb about a quarter of human-related CO2 emissions, leading to a 30% increase in ocean acidity over the past 40 years. This has weakened coral reefs and made it harder for shellfish and other marine organisms to form their skeletons. The oxygen concentration in the oceans has also decreased by 0.8-2.4% in the past 50-100 years, making it harder for marine life to thrive. In February, the Arctic ice reached its lowest level on record, creating a vicious cycle. As the ice melts, more sunlight reaches the ocean, warming it, and as the ice melts, it becomes darker and absorbs more heat, contributing to the 'polar amplification' phenomenon, which makes climate change more severe and rapid in the polar regions.

**WMO Warns: Earth on Track to Break Temperature Records**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warns that the Earth is on track to break temperature records in the coming years, with a 80% chance that one of the years between 2025-2029 will be warmer than 2024. The report also states that it is almost certain that one of the next years will reach a temperature of 2.7°F (1.5°C) above the pre-industrial level. This means not just heatwaves, but also catastrophic events that will cost people their lives, health, and safety. 'It's quite gloomy', says Mike Flannigan from the University of Thompson Rivers, who believes that the real consequences will be even more severe than expected. The western regions of the US are already suffering from wildfires, droughts, and heatwaves. As climate scientist Pak Williams notes, 'The western US has warmed, but without increased precipitation to compensate for the effect'. The Arctic, Amazon, Africa, and Europe are becoming the poles of a new climate reality, with melting ice, excessive rainfall, and severe droughts. The warming atmosphere holds more moisture, increasing the risk of storms and floods. 'Episodes of climate 'tipping points' are becoming more intense', the report states. Seasonal fluctuations from wet to dry have become a precursor to wildfires in California. Flannigan warns: 'People think it won't affect them. But soon it will be on every backyard'. The data shows that 2024 has already become the hottest year since 1880, and this trend is only intensifying. 11 consecutive years of temperature records have been set, and there is no end in sight. The situation in the US is complicated by the political inconsistency in addressing climate change. The withdrawal from the Paris Agreement initiated by the Trump administration, along with the imposed bans on terms such as 'climate science', demonstrate a deliberate rollback of scientific efforts. The administration has fired over 400 experts who worked on the National Climate Assessment. As Ko Barrett from the WMO notes, 'The negative impact on our economy, lives, ecosystems, and planet will grow'. The NOAA budget plans to cut 25%, which will undermine the ability to predict and prevent disasters. This is a refusal to take responsibility in the face of an ecological crisis. The WMO estimates a 70% probability that the average warming in 2025-2029 will exceed 1.5°C, indicating a real risk of irreversible changes. High temperatures accelerate ecosystem degradation, reduce yields, and trigger new catastrophes. The world is entering a phase where inaction threatens the very existence of civilization. The impact of warming has already engulfed not only climate, but also politics, economy, security, and even basic living conditions. Societies must act quickly to reduce damage - or agree to a future where anomalies become the norm.

**Unprecedented Arctic Warming: Implications for Global Climate Patterns**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned of continued global warming in the next five years, with temperatures expected to remain at record-breaking or near-record levels. This will exacerbate climate-related risks to global communities and economies, and threaten sustainable development pathways. The report highlights several key messages, including: There is an 80% chance that one of the next five years (2025-2029) will be the 'hottest year on record', surpassing the record set in 2024. There is an 86% chance that one of the next five years will see a temperature increase of 1.5°C compared to the pre-industrial average (1850-1900). The report shows that there is a 70% chance that global warming will exceed 1.5°C during the period (2025-2029). Despite these alarming forecasts, the report notes that long-term warming, measured over decades, has not yet reached the 1.5°C threshold agreed upon in the Paris Agreement. However, the continued upward trend in temperatures suggests that it may be exceeded in the near future if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. There is an 80% chance that at least one of the next five years (2025-2029) will break the record for the hottest year on record since temperature records began (set in 2024). There is an 86% chance that temperatures will rise by at least 1.5°C in one of the next five years compared to the pre-industrial average. The report does not provide global predictions for each year individually. Breaking any additional degree of warming will lead to more severe heatwaves, extreme weather events, and glacier melting, as well as rising sea levels and ocean temperatures. The Arctic region is expected to continue to experience higher rates of warming than the global average, which may lead to significant environmental changes, including sea ice melting and rising sea levels. The region is expected to experience temperatures 2.4°C above the global average during the next five winters (November to March), which is more than three and a half times the global average. The predictions for sea ice show a decrease in sea ice concentrations in the Barents, Bering, and Okhotsk seas from March 2025 to March 2029. The report notes that precipitation patterns will show a clear variation between geographical regions, with some areas expected to become wetter, while others may experience more severe droughts, directly affecting agriculture, water, and food security. South Asia has experienced above-average rainfall in recent years, except for 2023, and forecasts suggest that this trend will continue during the period 2025-2029. However, this may not apply to all seasons in each year of these five years.

**WMO Warns of 70% Probability of Exceeding 1.5°C Global Temperature Increase by 2029**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned that there is a 70% probability that the average global temperature between 2025-2029 will exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The WMO's report states that high temperatures will increase climate risks and impacts on societies, economies, and sustainable development. The report predicts that the average annual global temperature near the surface for each year between 2025 and 2029 will be 'between 1.2°C and 1.9°C', surpassing the average temperature recorded between 1850 and 1900. The WMO also notes that there is an 80% chance that at least one year between 2025 and 2029 will be hotter than the current record holder, 2024. Additionally, there is an 86% probability that at least one year will be more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The WMO explains that each additional degree of warming leads to more severe heatwaves, extreme precipitation events, intense droughts, melting of glaciers, warming of oceans, and sea-level rise. The organization highlights that the warming of the Arctic in the next five years is expected to be more than three and a half times the global average, and that regions such as the Sahel, northern Europe, Alaska, and northern Siberia will be wetter, while the Amazon will be drier (from May to September 2025-2029). The scientific community has warned that a warming above 1.5°C could trigger more severe climate change impacts and extreme weather conditions, emphasizing that each fraction of a degree of warming is crucial. The COP30 conference in Brazil will analyze the updated national climate action plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are essential to achieving the Paris Agreement's goals.

**Global Temperature Expected to Reach Record High Over Next Five Years**
According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the global temperature is expected to reach a record high or near-record high over the next five years. This will lead to increased climate risks and negative consequences for society, economy, and development. The WMO report states that the global annual average surface temperature for each year from 2025 to 2029 is expected to be 1.2-1.9 degrees Celsius higher than the pre-industrial era (1850-1900). There is an 80% chance that at least one of these years will be the hottest year on record, surpassing 2024. The five-year average temperature is expected to exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold set by the Paris Agreement with a 70% probability, up from 47% in the previous report. Each additional degree of warming will lead to more severe heatwaves, extreme rainfall, droughts, melting of glaciers, warming of oceans, and rising sea levels. The WMO also predicts that the next five winters (November to March) will see a 3.5 times faster warming in the Arctic than the global average. The report warns that there will be no slowdown in the warming trend in the coming years, which will have negative impacts on the economy, daily life, ecosystems, and the planet. 'We have already experienced the hottest ten years on record. Unfortunately, the WMO report suggests that there will be no slowdown in this process, and this will lead to more negative impacts on our economy, daily life, ecosystems, and the planet,' said Ko Barrett, the WMO's Deputy Secretary-General. 'Monitoring and forecasting the climate is essential for decision-makers to adapt to the changing climate, and we need to provide them with science-based tools and data,' he added.

**WMO Warns of Sooner-than-Expected 1.5°C Global Warming Target**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has sounded the alarm, warning that the 1.5°C global warming target may be reached sooner than previously thought. The accelerated timeline is due to higher temperatures than expected in recent years, decreasing air pollution that cooled the Earth, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide despite the growth of renewable energy. This means that irreversible tipping points in the climate system, such as the melting of Arctic ice shelves or the widespread collapse of coral reefs, are closer than scientists previously thought. According to the WMO's new analysis, the next five years will likely average over 1.5°C, with temperatures expected to rise further after 2030. This suggests that 2027 will likely be the first year in which the long-term average temperature exceeds the limit, says Zeke Hausfather. The Paris Agreement aimed to limit global warming to 1.5°C, but some scientists and experts have privately doubted the feasibility of this goal due to the difficulty of transforming the energy system. Despite the growth of renewable energy, it still only accounts for about a third of the global energy mix. Even if wind, solar, and batteries grow in the power grid, the world consumes more electricity than ever before. The failure to meet the 1.5°C target will put politicians and negotiators in an uncomfortable position, as they try to win support for reducing climate-damaging emissions. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres claims that the 1.5°C goal 'hangs by artificial respiration' and 'will soon be dead.' Eventually, nations will acknowledge this failure and need to develop a new goal. 'You could imagine governments saying, 'Hey, 1.5 won't be achievable, but here's what we'll do, and here's where we'll increase our efforts,' says David Victor. 'That's an approach. Another approach would be to give up.' The nations could focus on the less ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to keep temperatures under 2°C warming. This goal is more achievable, but currently still unlikely. The planet is currently on track to about 2.5°C warming. 'The longer we wait, the harder it will be,' emphasizes Hausfather. 'After another decade of inaction, we'll be talking about the 2°C goal the way we're talking about the 1.5°C goal now.'

**Climate Predictions Show Temperatures Expected to Remain at or Near Record Levels in Coming 5 Years**
A recent report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) predicts that there is an 80% chance that at least one year between 2025 and 2029 will be warmer than the current warmest year on record (2024). Additionally, there is an 86% chance that at least one year will be more than 1.5°C above the pre-industrial level. The report also forecasts a 70% chance that the five-year average warming for 2025-2029 will be more than 1.5°C. WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett stated, 'Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet.' The report also warns that every additional fraction of a degree of warming drives more harmful heatwaves, extreme rainfall events, intense droughts, melting of ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, heating of the ocean, and rising sea levels.

**Even as emissions level off, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is growing faster than ever. Here's why**
Despite a stabilization in carbon dioxide emissions, the concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere is growing faster than ever. The Global Carbon Project estimates that human activities released a record high of 10.2 gigatonnes of carbon in 2024. Last year, atmospheric CO₂ increased by 3.5 parts per million, reaching 424 ppm, which is more than 50% higher than pre-industrial levels. The main reason for this rapid increase is the Earth's natural carbon sinks, such as oceans, forests, and soils, struggling to keep up with the massive amounts of CO₂ being released into the atmosphere. According to scientists, the only way to slow down the growth of CO₂ concentrations is to significantly cut emissions, which is crucial for stabilizing the climate on a time frame meaningful to humans.

**A grim signal: Atmospheric CO2 soared in 2024**
The global mean concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2024, increasing by 3.75 parts per million (ppm) according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Global Monitoring Laboratory. This brings the annual mean global concentration close to 430 ppm, about 40% more than the pre-industrial level, and enough to heat the planet by about 2.7° Fahrenheit (1.5° Celsius). Climate researchers have noted that the continuing increase of global CO2 emissions means the world will probably not be able to reach the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming to 2.7° Fahrenheit above the pre-industrial level. Zeke Hausfather, a climate researcher at Berkeley Earth, said, 'It's definitely worrying to see such a large jump in 2024.' He attributed the increase to a weakening of the land sink, which absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Even if the growth rate slows again in 2025, Hausfather said, 'the worry is that this year's jump might include [non-El Niño] factors like temperature responses from soils and vegetation that might persist or intensify as the Earth warms.'

**A Grim Signal: Atmospheric CO2 Soared in 2024 - Inside Climate News**
The concentration of atmospheric CO2 has seen a record annual jump, increasing by 3.75 parts per million, according to the Global Monitoring Laboratory. This brings the annual mean global concentration close to 430 ppm, about 40 percent more than the pre-industrial level, and enough to heat the planet by about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius). Climate researchers have noted that the continuing increase of global CO2 emissions means the world will probably not be able to reach the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above the pre-industrial level. Zeke Hausfather said, 'Because we know the magnitude of emissions and the ocean sink does not vary that much year to year, this has to reflect a weakening of the land sink.' James Hansen said, 'Similar increases have occurred with lesser emissions, but stronger El Niños.' He added, 'It’s not all gloom and doom. The airborne fraction of emissions has actually trended downward over the past several decades, so once we begin to reduce emissions, we should be able to get the growth rate of CO2 to decline.'

**WMO Reports Record Concentration of Carbon Dioxide in Atmosphere**
According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached 420.0 ± 0.1 ppm in 2023, the highest level in the past 800,000 years. This is 2.3 ppm higher than the 2022 level and 151% of the pre-industrial level in 1750. The report also notes that the concentration of methane and nitrous oxide, two other key greenhouse gases, also reached new highs in 2023. The authors of the report state that the data in real-time shows that the concentration of these greenhouse gases continued to rise in 2024. The increase in greenhouse gas concentrations led to temperature records around the world in 2023 and 2024. The WMO also reports that extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones, floods, droughts, and others, in 2024 led to the largest number of people displaced in the past 16 years, exacerbated the food crisis, and caused significant economic damage. The WMO previously reported that 2024 was the hottest year on record, with the average global temperature exceeding the pre-industrial level by 1.5 degrees Celsius. The new record for the average daily global temperature was set on July 22, 2024, at 17.16 degrees Celsius.

**2023年全球氣候報告：全球升溫再度突破紀錄**
According to the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) 2024 Global Climate Report, 2023 was the hottest year on record in the past 175 years, surpassing the previous record set in 2023. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere also reached its highest level in 80,000 years. The report, which compiled data from UN member states and partner organizations, found that the global average temperature in 2023 was 1.55°C higher than the pre-industrial era (1850-1900), exceeding the 1.5°C threshold set by the Paris Agreement. However, WMO scientists estimate that the long-term warming trend is around 1.34-1.41°C, which is close to but still below the threshold. The main culprit behind global warming is the record-high concentration of greenhouse gases. The report notes that the CO2 concentration in 2023 was 420 ppm, a 2.3 ppm increase from 2022. In contrast, the pre-industrial level was 280 ppm, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). UN Secretary-General Guterres said that it is still possible to keep global warming below 1.5°C, but 'leaders must take action.' Additionally, the global sea surface temperature has been setting new records for eight consecutive years, and the rate of ocean warming has accelerated by more than twice the rate of 1950-2005. The report states that warm ocean waters have caused severe bleaching of coral reefs over the past year and accelerated the melting of sea ice.

**WMO: 2023 and 2024 the two hottest years on record, CO2 concentration reaches 420 ppm**
According to the WMO report, 2023 and 2024 were the two hottest years on record since 1850, with a global average temperature of +1.55 °C in 2024, surpassing the exceptional record of 2023 (+1.45 °C). The 2023 year was characterized by a rapid transition from La Niña conditions to an intense El Niño event, which reached its peak between late 2023 and early 2024, with an anomaly of +2.0 °C. This rapid change contributed to the atmospheric heat. The report also highlights the reduction of marine atmospheric aerosols due to the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) regulations, which came into effect in January 2020, and the decade-long decrease in industrial aerosols due to stricter environmental policies. The report notes that volcanic and solar factors had a limited contribution to the warming, while the main driver of the recent decades' warming is the stable and increasing trend of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, primarily CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide. In 2023, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere reached 420 ppm, a record not seen in the last 800,000 years, further reinforcing the direct link between human activities and climate change. The report emphasizes that surpassing the +1.5 °C threshold in a single year, as occurred in 2024, is a strong warning signal, although it does not necessarily imply a definitive crossing of the Paris Agreement threshold. However, it highlights the urgent need to strengthen global measures to mitigate and adapt to the ongoing climate changes.

**CO2 Concentration in Atmosphere Reaches Record High in 800,000 Years**
According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere reached 420 parts per million (ppm) in 2023, a 2.3 ppm increase from 2022 and 151% above the pre-industrial era average. The WMO also reported that methane and nitrous oxide levels, other greenhouse gas contributors, reached their highest levels in the past 800,000 years in 2023. This information is based on the WMO's latest report.

**Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere at 800,000-year highs**
According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has reached its highest levels in the past 800,000 years. In 2024, the global average temperature was 1.55 degrees Celsius, making it the hottest year in the 175 years of recorded observation. The long-term warming remains below 1.5 degrees Celsius. WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo stated, 'Although a single year of warming above 1.5 degrees does not indicate that the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement are out of reach, it is a warning sign that we are increasing the risks to our lives, economies, and the planet.'

**CO2 Concentration Increases by 3.5 PPM in 2024, Largest Increase in 11 Years**
According to data from the GOSAT satellite, the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere increased by 3.5 parts per million (PPM) in 2024, the largest increase in the past 11 years. The average concentration of CO2 in the entire atmosphere was 421 PPM in 2024, up from 388 PPM in 2014. The increase is believed to be caused by factors such as droughts, forest fires, and the expansion of industrial activities. The GOSAT satellite, launched in 2009, is the world's first satellite capable of observing the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from space. Japan provides the data obtained from GOSAT to the world free of charge, which helps other countries to understand the current state of greenhouse gas emissions.
