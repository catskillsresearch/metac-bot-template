**US-Venezuela Relations: A Path of Confrontation?**
The recent regional and parliamentary elections in Venezuela have solidified the country's descent into dictatorship, and may have set the stage for a contentious relationship with the US government under Donald Trump in the coming years. The ruling socialist party, led by President Nicolás Maduro, won a landslide victory, securing 82.7% of the votes in the National Assembly and all 24 state governorships, except one. The opposition, still reeling from a fraudulent presidential election last year and ongoing repression, chose to boycott the vote. The US has revoked a license granted by the Biden administration that allowed Chevron to operate in Venezuela, forcing the company to adopt a holding standard that will deprive the country of valuable tax and royalty payments from oil extraction. The US has also imposed a 25% tariff on Venezuelan oil imports, pushing the country closer to China, its largest oil market. Trump has also invoked the Foreign Enemies Act to target the Aragua gang, based in Venezuela, and has revoked temporary visas for Venezuelans on a large scale, with apparent plans for mass deportations. The question remains: how will the US-Venezuela relationship develop in the coming months and years?

**Venezuela to Announce New Pricing Scheme for Essential Goods**
Venezuelan Deputy Ramón Lobo announced that a new pricing scheme for essential goods will be published in the Official Gazette. He stated that the scheme aims to prevent 'any significant speculative escalation' and to ensure that prices are 'reasonable' and 'adjusted to the official exchange rate published by the BCV'. Lobo also claimed that the extreme right is manipulating digital platforms to attack the Bolivar, the national currency. He linked these actions to a 'continuous economic war' against Venezuela, which includes 'sectors of extremist right-wing groups that have called for military intervention and the application of sanctions'. Lobo emphasized that the attack on the Bolivar is part of a 'non-conventional war' with five dimensions, including media, psychological, political, international, and economic. He also mentioned that the BCV has injected millions of dollars into the foreign exchange market, which should have stabilized the economy. Finally, he congratulated the Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace, Diosdado Cabello, for 'hitting a bullseye' against the group of 'scammers and terrorist financiers' who were distorting the value of the currency.

**¿Y ahora qué? (And Now What?)**
The recent event organized by the government to try to move past the events of July 28, 2024, and gain a semblance of democratic legitimacy, was met with skepticism by Venezuelans. The empty voting centers and the intelligent silence of the country reminded many of the pandemic days. The question now is what to do next. First, it's essential to demand that the leaders of the democratic opposition (not the ones masquerading as judicialized parties) focus their efforts on the real enemy: the one who still holds power. Second, and more importantly, it's crucial for everyone who demonstrated their majority by returning to their normal behavior and those who voted, to come together and continue building the two effective tools for political change in authoritarian regimes: organized civil society and collective action. Without these, voting or not voting is ineffective, as it's the people organized around their unions, guilds, popular associations, communes, sectoral movements, and other social groups that are the active subjects of political change. This is the task at hand.

**Venezuela Issues 'Maximum Travel Alert' for Citizens Traveling to the US**
The Venezuelan government has issued a 'maximum travel alert' for all its citizens living in or planning to travel to the United States, which Caracas considers a 'dangerous' country where 'human rights do not exist for migrants.' According to a video shared on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Telegram channel, the government warns that 'arbitrary detentions, racist killings, and institutional hypocrisy' make the US a 'real threat to the life, freedom, and dignity of Venezuelans and any Latin American.' The statement also notes that 'being Latino, Afro-descendant, or a Venezuelan migrant in the US is a risk of death.' This move comes after the US Department of State confirmed that it maintains a level 4 travel alert for Venezuela, citing 'grave risks, including unjust detention, torture, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary police practices, violent crimes, civil unrest, and inadequate medical care.'

**ACLU Sues Trump Administration Over Use of Alien Enemies Act to Deport Venezuelan Immigrants**
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants in the United States. The ACLU claims that the law is being used in an 'inadequate' manner to justify arbitrary deportations, and that it violates the human rights of hundreds of Venezuelan citizens who have been deported to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT). According to Lee Galerny, ACLU attorney, 'We're saying that the administration can't use the wartime law to enforce regular immigration. We believe it's clearly illegal. We hope the courts will agree so that no more Venezuelans are sent to El Salvador under this law.' The lawsuit will be heard in the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in late June 2025. The Alien Enemies Act, passed in 1798, gives the US President the power to deport citizens of enemy countries in times of war or invasion, but was not intended to be applied in peacetime or against individuals without concrete evidence of hostile activities.

**Venezuela's Human Crisis: A Window of Opportunity for Change**
Venezuela is facing a deep human crisis, with the population struggling to survive in a context of extreme poverty, collapsed services, and desperation. However, the resilience of the Venezuelan people and recent events that challenge the regime open a window of opportunity for change. The key lies in strategic planning that puts people at the center, rebuilds trust, and sets the stage for a more stable and equitable future. The country is at a critical juncture, where political and economic instability defines the daily life of its citizens. This analysis focuses on the human impact of the crisis, prioritizing the social dimension and the feelings of the population, without losing sight of the economic and political factors that sustain it. The integrated information, based on recent sources, reflects a country on the brink of institutional collapse, with a population exhausted but still resilient, facing an uncertain future. The Chavismo regime, perceived as a de facto government without legitimacy or legality, clings to power amidst internal divisions and growing loss of popular and military support. Recent events, such as the 'arrebatón' of the presidency after July 28, 2024, and the extraction of five opposition leaders and María Corina Machado's mother from the Argentine Embassy in May 2025, have intensified polarization. The repression has escalated, with over 1,000 political prisoners and instrumentalized justice that fosters impunity and mistrust. The repetition of elections without guarantees and opposition fragmentation feed apathy and disillusionment, leaving a generalized sense of powerlessness. The Venezuelan economy faces a devastating scenario. The devaluation of the bolivar has been extreme, with peaks exceeding 2000% by May 2025, and subsequent inflation that threatens to accompany it. The indexing of public spending aggravates exchange instability and hinders inflation control. Sanctions on oil, hardened by the non-renewal of Chevron's license, anticipate a drastic drop in oil production, possibly to 500,000 barrels per day or less. The scarcity of internal financing, recession, and informality of employment (which exceeds 80%) restrict economic activity. More than 88% of the population lives in multidimensional poverty, with 50% in extreme poverty, and 80% of households do not cover the basic basket. Transactional dollarization benefits a minority, while the majority subsists in precariousness. The daily life in Venezuela is a constant struggle for survival. The population faces basic shortages: Today, everyone in the household must contribute to cover expenses, reflecting the collective effort to survive, although 60% of entrepreneurship generates less than $300 per month. Elderly adults, families with children, and young people in rural areas or popular neighborhoods are the most affected. The socio-emotional component is alarming: desperation, anger, frustration, and sadness dominate, and social resilience is at its limit. Politics, although relevant, is relegated in the face of the urgency to eat, have light, or feel safe. The immediate panorama is somber. The intensification of sanctions and internal instability will exacerbate the economic crisis, increasing poverty and migration to neighboring countries. However, events like the extraction of opposition leaders suggest that the regime is not invulnerable, opening scenarios for change. The transition requires strategic planning, emphasizing the recovery of oil production (through privatization), the reduction of the state apparatus, the re-institutionalization, and the attraction of foreign investment. The first stage (1-2 years) will be critical, requiring agreements on governance that include the diminished Chavismo and a change of mindset to overcome the past and build a viable future. 'We should not be deceived by 'sirens' because, if we follow them, we will suffer. There is only one reality that must be shared by all and each Venezuelan in a critical moment in which, if entrepreneurs began to take distance and call things by their name, this government would have ended already... Clearly, with some personal costs, equivalent to those 'sucked' by the security bodies every day.' The author emphasizes the need to stop justifying the accompaniment of the regime for the 'general good, of shareholders or personnel,' as it no longer holds. The business leadership is criticized for not understanding that, for the Chavismo, they are only 'companions of the route' who can be left behind at any moment and picked up by the Dgcim or worse, Hezbolá. The author warns entrepreneurs to take care of themselves and their families, as they will be the next targets.

**The Venezuelan Farce: A People's Resistance and a Dictatorship's Fragility**
The Venezuelan election on May 25 was a farce, a simulation of democracy designed by Maduro to appear legitimate. However, the reality was evident in the massive rejection of the Venezuelan people, with an historic abstention rate of 85%. The citizens stayed home, not out of apathy, but as an active form of resistance. This silent but eloquent act sent a clear message: the people do not validate frauds, nor do they accept the imposition of a dictatorship that disregards their will. The majority of Venezuelans remain firm, not giving up, and continue to support the path led by María Corina Machado, Edmundo González, and the Democratic Unity. Despite fear, persecution, and the regime's maneuvers, the citizens were not deceived. The July 28 date has not been forgotten: it remains alive in the national consciousness, a stake in the heart of a power that is crumbling. Maduro's attempt to weaken and divide the opposition failed, as some traditional politicians, including Henrique Capriles, Manuel Rosales, and Tomás Guanipa, were co-opted by the regime, accepting to participate in the farce and receiving minimal support (5%). The people do not support those who adapt to power, but those who resist. In times of dictatorship, coherence is a political value. The Democratic Unity understood this and chose to remain firm, not to play along, and to focus on preserving the popular mandate expressed on July 28. The international community also did not fall for Maduro's plan, recognizing the leadership of María Corina Machado and Edmundo González and demanding that the will expressed in the urns on July 28 be respected. The regime, aware of its fragility, responded with repression, kidnapping my brother, Juan Pablo Guanipa, just days after the electoral fraud. The great challenge now is to reactivate the internal force. Political parties and civil society must reorganize, even in the face of persecution, to channel the deep social unrest that runs through the country. It is also essential to maintain the attention of the international community, as Venezuela cannot become a normalized tragedy. The Maduro dictatorship is not acting alone, but is intertwined with organized crime networks and allied with authoritarian powers like Russia, Iran, and Cuba. Their agenda threatens not only Venezuelans, but also the democratic stability of all Latin America. Despite everything, there are reasons for hope. The people have not given up, true unity remains firm, the international community continues to be attentive, and most importantly, the memory of July 28 has not been erased. That day, the people chose freely. That mandate remains valid.

**The Silence of the Venezuelan People: A Declaration of Resistance**
On July 28, 2024, millions of Venezuelans went to the polls hoping for change, but the regime responded with blatant fraud, manipulating results and unleashing a wave of repression that left over 2,000 citizens arbitrarily detained. The repression continued, including the recent kidnapping of Juan Pablo Guanipa, Catalina Ramos, and 70 activists, journalists, and human rights defenders, demonstrating the desperation of a regime trying to maintain control. Despite these actions, the Venezuelan people faced the new electoral farce on May 25, 2025, with deafening silence. More than 85% of the population refused to participate, leaving the streets empty and sending a clear message: 'We will not legitimize the lie.' This massive silence was not passivity, but a clear declaration of the illegitimacy of a dictatorship sustained only by repression and arms. As the regime jails opponents, threatens journalists, and invents charges to stifle dissent, the people demonstrated that their will is stronger than any electoral fraud. On May 25, the silence spoke louder than the regime's maneuvers, revealing its lack of popular support. María Corina Machado's leadership has shown that her people's will is stronger than any attempt to silence them, as she said, 'La desobediencia civil es el derecho sagrado de un ciudadano, no un delito' (Civil disobedience is the sacred right of a citizen, not a crime). The decision not to participate on May 25 was not an empty act of disobedience, but a reflection of the collective will of the Venezuelans to transform their silence into a hymn of resistance. As the people of Venezuela move forward, they are guided by the firm leadership of María Corina Machado and the unwavering determination to be free.

**Venezuela is charting its own path – Democracy and society | IPS Journal**
Venezuela's recent parliamentary and regional elections resulted in a decisive victory for the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), cementing the status quo. The opposition parties garnered just under 15% of the total vote, winning 29 of roughly 285 seats. Voter turnout was 42.63%, but reports suggest it may have been lower. The government's actions, including arrests and threats, have tightened its grip on power. President Nicolás Maduro's inner circle is seeking new allies, visiting Moscow, Qatar, and China to discuss economic cooperation. However, these diplomatic efforts may not genuinely help lift Venezuela out of isolation. The region must act before it's too late, exploring quiet diplomacy, cooperation in science and culture, support for civil society, and economic partnerships. Venezuela's neighbours have a vital interest in preserving peace and stability, and existing spaces for action must be identified and strengthened. As a new form of dictatorship takes shape in Venezuela, the region's inaction could lead to a failed state on the South American continent.

**Diosdado Cabello Warns of María Corina Machado's 'Psychological War' Against Venezuela**
Diosdado Cabello stated that María Corina Machado 'will deploy a great psychological war against the Venezuelans, to create an environment that the country is vulnerable'. He claimed that Machado has resources to launch a psychological war to confuse, demoralize, and divide the Venezuelan people, creating an environment that the government of Nicolás Maduro is weak and that it is time for a coup. Cabello added that 'no country in the region or in the world wants to buy the idea of María Corina to spark a civil war in Venezuela, so she can come to power'. He also mentioned that some financiers and 'crazy people' who still listen to Machado suggest that she should generate some type of violence or internal action in the country, but they will not 'throw themselves into the void' like they did with Guaidó, Gedeón, and other opposition proposals in the last 20 years.

**Venezuela on the Brink of a New Economic Crisis**
The threat of a new economic crisis in Venezuela is reviving the fears of 2019, one of the most difficult moments of the economic crisis in the country's modern history. The recovery was long and difficult, and the chavista regime took four years to stabilize its economy, end hyperinflation, and reverse one of the worst recessions in its modern history. However, with Trump's return to the presidency of the United States, the ghost of those days is emerging more than ever. The US has announced that it will act against the Venezuelan oil industry, which is the main source of funding for the dictatorship, and has revoked licenses for several international companies to operate in the country. This has interrupted the main source of income for Venezuela and has led to a shortage of dollars in the country. According to experts, the absence of these sums in the Venezuelan economy would lead to a shortage of the currency, which would result in a decline in the value of the bolivar and all that it implies in the daily lives of people. Additionally, the price of oil has fallen by 17% this year due to the escalation of the commercial war driven by the US, and it is expected that the Gross Domestic Product of Caracas will contract by 2.5% in 2025, compared to 1.5% estimated by the Venezuelan Observatory of Finance just a month ago. 'The scenario that we all started to see is a return to 2019', said Ángel Alvarado, economist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who warned that the signs, such as devaluation, price increases, consumption decline, and public spending cuts, will begin to be seen gradually. The regime will have a fundamental role in determining how much the effect of this scenario will be felt. 'The government is preparing for the cash flow crisis', warned Luis Vicente León, president of Datanálisis. However, the measures adopted so far seem not to satisfy the private sector, which while seeking an opening of the economy, is already preparing for the worst. According to various entrepreneurs, reactivating restrictions from the past will only lead to a new hyperinflation, even above 162%. 'Controls of exchange bring poverty, we have already lived it. There must be reforms so that the economy is more agile', warned Adán Celis, president of Fedecamaras.

**Venezuela's Padrino López Vows to Defend Esequibo in All Scenarios**
Venezuelan Defense Minister General Vladimir Padrino López stated that his government is prepared to defend the disputed territory of Guyana Esequiba 'in all scenarios'. He emphasized that 'Esequibo is Venezuela, and it's not up for discussion', adding that his country will fight 'with its nails in all scenarios' for its sovereignty and territorial waters. Padrino López made these comments in the 23 de Enero neighborhood in Caracas, near the presidential palace of Miraflores, during an event broadcast on state TV Vtv, attended by members of the Bolivarian Militia, a civilian armed group assimilated to the Armed Forces by the government of President Nicolás Maduro. The minister claimed that US sanctions aim to 'undermine the morale of the Venezuelan people, making us fight a fratricidal war, a civil war, to divide and argue, and the worst part is to sell, as war booty, Esequibo'.

**Venezuela's Maduro Calls for End to Trade War with US, Declares Economic Emergency**
Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has described the trade war with the US as a 'true nuclear war' and has called for an end to the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump. Maduro stated, 'This is a war of lose-lose, where no one will win.' He also announced that he will sign a decree of economic emergency in the coming hours. The Venezuelan leader argued that the trade war is 'immoral' and 'illegal' to inflict economic damage on countries to colonize them. Maduro also mentioned that China has said that 'there are no winners in trade wars and economic wars.' The Vice President of Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, proposed to Maduro to declare an economic emergency, which he found 'a wonderful idea.' Maduro plans to sign the decree tomorrow (April 8, 2025) to protect and defend the Venezuelan economy.

**Venezuela Denounces 'Economic War' Impelled by the US**
Venezuelan President condemned the economic blockade and attacks imposed by the Trump administration, calling them 'a war of economic illegitimacy' that violates international law and threatens the self-determination of peoples. Maduro mentioned that a US magnate compared this conflict to an 'economic nuclear war', highlighting how these actions harm even the US itself. Venezuela, along with countries like Cuba, Honduras, Russia, and China, is facing this offensive, which now extends to multiple countries worldwide. Maduro urged the strengthening of national production in all areas, from food and medicine to technology and fuels. According to Maduro, Venezuela's 11.71% growth in the pharmaceutical sector in the first quarter of 2025 demonstrates the country's ability to integrate into the new world order.

**The Urgency of a National Agreement to Reconquer the Salary and Social Security in Venezuela**
The recent study by the Observatorio Venezolano de Finanzas reveals that poverty in Venezuela has reached alarming levels, with 86% of the population living in poverty in 2024. The government has introduced a new concept of salary, 'Ingreso económico integral indexado', which is essentially a parody of remuneration, with the minimum wage for public sector workers being less than $2 per month and additional bonuses having no impact on benefits. The article argues that the Maduro regime has been waging a war against the labor system, undermining its constitutional, legal, and contractual precepts. The regime has ignored the recommendations and agreements established by the International Labor Organization (ILO) in the 4 Social Forums held since 2022. The article calls for unity among labor sectors to reconquer a dignified salary and social security, and urges academics, professionals, and civil society organizations to support workers in their aspiration to restore the full salary, collective contracts, labor freedom, and social security, which are currently being degraded to the most abject level in Latin America. According to the article, 'Es el momento de superar esta fase de desconcierto, ningún sector puede declararse inmaculado de haber cometido errores y autocalificarse de ser los únicos genuinos representantes de los trabajadores, si entendemos que todos sufrimos los efectos de un régimen dictatorial, es el paso necesario para conformar la unidad de todos los sectores laborales del país.' (It is time to overcome this phase of confusion, no sector can declare itself immaculate of having committed errors and self-qualify as the only genuine representatives of workers, if we understand that we all suffer the effects of a dictatorial regime, it is the necessary step to form the unity of all labor sectors of the country.)

**6.7 Million People Expected to be Displaced by 2026 Due to Wars and Conflicts**
The Danish Refugee Council (DRC) has warned that 6.7 million people will be forced to flee their homes in the next two years due to wars, conflicts, violence, and persecution. This is a 4.2 million increase from the current 122.6 million displaced people worldwide. The DRC attributes this increase to the 'devastating' cuts in international aid by major countries such as the US, UK, and Germany, leaving millions of vulnerable people without essential support for their survival. 'We live in an era of war and impunity, and it's the civilians who pay the price,' said Charlotte Slente, Secretary General of the DRC. The DRC estimates that 2.5 million people will be displaced in 2026, with the civil wars in Sudan and Myanmar accounting for nearly half of these displacements. The Sudanese crisis is described as the 'most urgent humanitarian crisis in the world,' with 12.6 million people already displaced within the country and neighboring countries. In Myanmar, the civil war has led to the displacement of 3.5 million people, with nearly 20 million people in need of humanitarian aid. The DRC predicts that an additional 1.4 million people will be displaced in Myanmar by the end of 2026. Other countries such as Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria, Yemen, and Venezuela are also expected to experience an increase in displacement due to armed conflicts, climate change, war aftermath, and socio-economic instability. 'The main donors are abandoning their duty, leaving millions of people in their suffering. This is not just a crisis, it's a moral failure,' said Charlotte Slente.

**IPYS Reports 383 Cases of Press Freedom Violations in Venezuela in 2024**
The IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad) reported 383 cases of press freedom violations in Venezuela in 2024, a 64.4% increase from the previous year. The months of July and August saw the highest number of attacks, with 143 and 74 cases respectively, coinciding with the electoral campaign and coverage of the presidential elections, where Nicolás Maduro was declared the winner. According to IPYS, the violations included 151 physical or verbal aggressions, 96 attacks for discriminatory speech, and 86 internet restrictions. Additionally, 42 censorship measures, 32 judicial harassment acts, and 14 arbitrary detentions were reported. A total of 262 media workers were affected, with reporters being the most impacted (169 cases). Other affected groups included media directors, cameramen, announcers, and foreign correspondents, some of whom were deported or temporarily detained. Furthermore, 110 media outlets, 13 civil society organizations, and nine websites faced restrictions. IPYS noted that many journalists chose to stop working to preserve their physical integrity and personal freedom. As reported by the Fiscalía, over 2,400 detentions took place after the elections, while the Colegio Nacional de Periodistas counted 12 detained journalists, eight of whom were arrested after the elections. The opposition denounced electoral fraud and claimed that their candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia, was the true winner. Maduro, however, was sworn in as president in January 2025, an act that the opposition described as a 'coup d'état'.

**Venezuela's War on Journalism: A Descent into Darkness**
The Venezuelan government's persecution of the press has reached new heights, with the extinction of traditional media and the blocking of digital media. The country's independent journalism is under attack, with many journalists facing constant pressure, including harassment, lawsuits, and threats to their physical integrity. The government has also passed new laws to restrict freedom of expression, including the 'Ley Simón Bolívar', which can be used to persecute anyone who promotes international sanctions against the regime. The situation is dire, with many journalists forced to flee the country or adopt measures to protect their identity, such as using AI-generated avatars. The Institute for Press and Society (Ipys) has documented the systematic hostility against the press in Venezuela, with 22 journalists forced to leave the country or go into hiding in 2024. The government has also blocked 39 websites and arrested at least 14 journalists. The situation is expected to worsen, with the government's control over the media and the internet tightening. 'Economically, it's very difficult to sustain a communication medium in Venezuela. It's very complicated and the future looks quite grey', says the director of a digital media outlet. 'In the future, we will have smaller media outlets with less capacity to address topics, to reach regions, and to cover all the topics that need to be covered in a country with a severe humanitarian crisis, with migration, with delinquency on the border', he adds.

**Maduro Warns González Urrutia: 'Stop Calling for Civil War in Venezuela'**
Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro warned opposition leader Edmundo González Urrutia to be careful with what he says from Spain about Venezuela, as there will be no war in the country. Maduro stated that González Urrutia is violating the agreement he signed before leaving the country on September 7. González Urrutia, an ultraright-wing opposition leader, has been calling for a civil war in Venezuela from Spain. Maduro emphasized, 'You are violating the right to asylum in Spain, stop calling for a civil war in Venezuela.' Maduro also warned González Urrutia to be cautious with what he says from Europe, as there will be peace and a mobilized people in the streets of Venezuela. 'There will be peace and a constitution; peace and national unity,' Maduro stressed. Maduro also sent a message to fascists, warning them not to make a mistake. 'You will regret it for 100 years, because it's easy to invite war from a Madrid tavern,' Maduro said. Venezuela is preparing for a significant step on December 15, when judges and justices of the peace will be elected to strengthen popular organization through communes.
