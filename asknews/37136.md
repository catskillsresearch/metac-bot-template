**UNHCR Faces Funding Crisis, Risks Response to New Arrivals in Lebanon**
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has reported that over 151,688 refugees have returned to Syria from Lebanon since December 8, 2024. At the same time, approximately 108,344 Syrians have arrived in Lebanon since December 8, 2024, including 61,061 in the Bekaa and Hermel regions in late 2024, and 39,195 in the Akkar and North governorates since March 2025. The families who fled Syria forcibly towards northern Lebanon have faced difficulties in accessing the borders without personal documents or using their savings to fund their journey, after suffering from the direct effects of the conflict. Many have reported witnessing the killing of their friends and family members. The conflict and subsequent displacement have exacerbated the basic health conditions, with children showing signs of trauma. The UNHCR, in close coordination with the Lebanese authorities and partners, is responding to the needs of the new arrivals from Syria. The agency is providing essential relief materials, including bedding, blankets, and clothing. The UNHCR is also conducting rehabilitation work in reception centers to ensure the protection of families, and coordinating the health response with the Lebanese authorities and partners, providing medical consultations, vaccines, and psychological support. The UNHCR is waiting for the Lebanese government's decision on the status that will be granted to the new arrivals, and whether it is possible to explore other reception centers to accommodate more people. Due to a significant and unexpected decrease in funding, the UNHCR, along with the entire humanitarian community, is facing a 20% funding shortfall as of April 2025. The agency's funding for operations in Lebanon has been decreasing gradually since 2020. The funding shortfall has already led to a complete reduction in support for internally displaced persons and returnees in the aftermath of the conflict in Lebanon and the massive needs in return areas. A significant decline in institutional support has also been observed, including the suspension of community support projects aimed at assisting Lebanese communities hosting large numbers of refugees. Due to funding constraints, the UNHCR will be forced to gradually stop providing all health care services to refugees by the end of 2025. Cash assistance has also been severely affected, with its scope reduced by 65% since January as part of the joint cash assistance program between the UNHCR and the World Food Programme. Education support, particularly assistance provided to non-enrolled refugee children, including basic reading, writing, and math skills programs, will stop by July 2025. The UNHCR has been forced to reduce its workforce by 30% by 2025, which means losing over 150 valuable staff members by the end of 2025. The funding shortfall poses a risk to the basic response to new arrivals, with urgent needs, particularly in reception centers and basic assistance. In this funding crisis, the opportunity for taking tangible steps towards voluntary return to Syria may be at risk without additional support. Despite these difficult and unprecedented circumstances, the UNHCR is committed to staying and providing its services in Lebanon. We call on the donor community to continue and intensify their efforts in this critical phase.

**UNHCR: half a million Syrians have returned home and need to support**
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has announced that over half a million Syrians have returned home since the fall of the previous regime, with 100,000 returnees per month. However, the challenges facing them remain immense, including a shortage of funds. Lujain Hasan, UNHCR Protection Associate in Syria, stated that the returnees are 'starting their lives from scratch and are in desperate need of support to reintegrate into their communities.' Despite the challenges, Hasan noted that the returnees show an overwhelming sense of optimism, with many wanting to rebuild not only their houses but the whole country. The UNHCR is working to support the returnees by rehabilitating homes, providing legal assistance, and launching initiatives to help them find work and secure a livelihood, but its ability to assist is limited due to a sharp reduction in humanitarian aid funding.

**Report: US Aid Suspension Affects Refugees and People with Disabilities in Jordan, Lebanon, and Palestine**
A report by the international organization 'ANERA' has stated that the suspension of US aid by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has had a negative impact on the economic reality of Jordan, Lebanon, and Palestine, affecting the most vulnerable populations, including refugees and people with disabilities. The report noted that hundreds of Jordanian and American employees have lost their jobs in public institutions, private sector organizations, and contractors, as well as partner agencies involved in US-funded projects. Additionally, there has been a reduction or suspension of essential services that were previously supported by USAID. The report predicts that the US economic slowdown and new tariffs will lead to a 7.1% decline in some Jordanian exports this year. According to the report, Jordan still faces challenges in achieving comprehensive economic growth and providing sufficient job opportunities. Over the past decade, the economy has grown at a rate of only 2.5% per year, while unemployment remains a major concern, reaching 22.3% in 2023. Since July 2023, the World Food Programme has reduced its assistance to all eligible refugees by one-third, and since August 2023, the support for refugees living in camps has been reduced from $32 to $21 per person. Other reductions have occurred, including the suspension of monthly food assistance to 100,000 Syrian refugees in July 2023. The World Food Programme currently supports 310,000 refugees in Jordan, all of whom receive low levels of assistance due to ongoing funding reductions. A survey conducted by 'Handicap International' in April 2024 found that only 33.8% of Syrian refugees in Jordan expressed a desire to return to Syria, citing deep concerns about insecurity, infrastructure, and economic conditions. When asked about the necessary support to facilitate their return, financial assistance (35%) and housing support (29%) were prioritized. In February 2024, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) announced a $1 million contribution from Korea to support basic services for Syrian refugees in Jordan, including water, sanitation, and hygiene services, as well as justice and protection systems for children. The report predicts that Jordan will bear a significant burden from the new US tariffs, as the US remains a vital export market for the Jordanian industrial sector. Most of the country's main export sectors, including textiles, jewelry, and selected fertilizer products, are subject to US tariffs, which have a high degree of price elasticity. As a result, these industries are expected to face a sharp decline in demand, particularly in the short term. The report also notes that the majority of the country's main export sectors are subject to US tariffs, which will lead to a significant increase in the prices of Jordanian goods, reducing their competitiveness compared to imports from other countries. The report also predicts that the 20% increase in tariffs on exports to the US will put pressure on companies operating in Jordan, which may lead to some of them reducing their operations. The World Bank's operations in Jordan have helped 48,000 Jordanians obtain official jobs, and efforts to integrate Syrian refugees into the formal labor market have shown significant progress, with the number of work permits issued to refugees increasing over the past four years. As of the last quarter of last year, food insecurity remained a major concern among refugees in Jordan, with 83% of host community beneficiaries and 81% of camp residents experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity. The report highlights the growing challenge of mental health in Jordan, citing a sharp increase in mental health challenges, exacerbated by limited resources, social stigma, and ongoing regional instability. The report recommends immediate action through stigma-reducing efforts, integrating mental health care into healthcare systems, and implementing targeted preventive strategies. The organization has distributed two major shipments in Jordan since the beginning of this year, totaling 42,456 treatments for the most vulnerable populations. The third shipment includes long-acting insulin, which will be allocated to support the newly established Syrian-American Medical Society (SAMS) diabetes clinic, which was inaugurated in January 2024.

**Lebanon Community Dialogue on Return and "Go and See" Visits May 2025 - Lebanon**
Following the shift in the political and humanitarian situation in Syria and the region since December 2024, many refugees have expressed a renewed sense of hope but are adopting a 'wait and see' approach to return. By May 15, 2025, around 156,000 Syrians had returned to Syria from or via Lebanon. To better understand trends, intentions, barriers, initiatives, and capacities linked to return, UNHCR and partners conducted a Community Dialogue with refugees and key informants covering all governorates in Lebanon. The dialogue aimed to support refugees who express an interest in returning, including 'Go and See' visits, which were designed in collaboration with the authorities. As one of the partners, Amel, said, 'To better understand the needs and aspirations of refugees, it is essential to engage in a dialogue that is inclusive and respectful.'

**Over 500,000 Syrian Refugees Return Home, But Need Support**
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) announced that over 500,000 Syrian refugees have returned to their country since the fall of the former regime, averaging 100,000 returns per month. Lujain Hasan, UNHCR's Associate Protection Officer in Syria, stated, 'These people are starting their lives from scratch and desperately need support to reintegrate into their communities. The main challenge is the scarcity of funds.' Despite numerous challenges, the overwhelming feeling when speaking with families returning home after many years is one of optimism. However, UNHCR's capacity to assist those in need is limited due to the drastic reduction in humanitarian aid funding, threatening recovery and stability efforts. Additionally, approximately 1.2 million internally displaced persons have returned to their homes in the past five months. UNHCR is working with Syrian authorities and partners to help refugees and internally displaced persons rebuild and repair damaged homes, provide legal support to replace lost identification documents and properties, and implement initiatives to help them work and earn a living.

**UNHCR: Half a Million Syrians Return Home Since Fall of Assad Regime**
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) announced that approximately 500,000 Syrians have returned to their country since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. According to the UNHCR, the number of returnees has averaged 100,000 per month. However, these returnees face 'enormous' challenges. Lina Hassan, the UNHCR's Protection Officer in Syria, stated that the number of returnees is approaching 500,000 people. She emphasized that they 'start their lives from scratch' and are in dire need of support. Hassan also highlighted the urgent need for the reintegration of these returnees into their communities, citing a lack of funding as the main challenge. The UNHCR noted that years of conflict and crisis have devastated the Syrian economy, leaving homes and infrastructure in ruins, and that security remains fragile in some areas. The returnees require security, stability, and access to basic services such as employment, education, and healthcare. The UNHCR is working with the Syrian authorities and other partners to assist Syrian refugees and internally displaced persons who have returned to their areas of origin. The assistance includes rehabilitating and repairing damaged homes, providing legal support to replace lost identity documents and property, and launching initiatives to help people earn a living. The UNHCR pointed out that with over 500,000 Syrian refugees having returned from neighboring countries, combined with approximately 1.2 million internally displaced persons who have returned to their homes over the past five months, the agency's ability to assist all those in need has decreased. The UNHCR also stated that the sharp decline in humanitarian aid funding in Syria threatens the country's future recovery and stability.

**Jordan Situation Report | May 2025 - Jordan**
The suspension of aid through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has severely impacted Jordan's economy, affecting its most vulnerable populations, including refugees and people with disabilities. An estimated 35,000 workers have lost their jobs, and essential services such as healthcare, education, and water development have been reduced or discontinued. The funding cuts also threaten access to primary health care and maternal health services for refugees and women of reproductive age. According to Business Monitor International (BMI), Jordan's economic growth for 2025 is expected to decrease from 2.1% to 1.6%, reflecting the impact of U.S. tariffs and trade restrictions. This is expected to reduce Jordanian exports and drive the current account deficit up to 7.1% of GDP in 2025.

**52,000 Syrian Refugees Return to Syria from Jordan**
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, approximately 52,000 Syrian refugees have returned to their homeland from Jordan since the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024 and until the end of March 2025. The UNHCR reported that around 6,500 Syrian refugees registered with the agency returned to Syria in March. The agency noted that this number represents a decrease of more than half compared to February 2025, when around 18,000 refugees returned. The UNHCR attributed this decrease to the fact that many refugees have expressed their intention to return after March due to the holy month of Ramadan or in the summer, after the end of the school year. The agency stated, 'In March, around 6,500 refugees returned to Syria.' 'In general, from December 8, 2024 to March 31, 2025, around 52,000 refugees registered with the UNHCR returned to Syria from Jordan.' The UNHCR also noted that this decrease was 'expected' as 'many refugees have expressed their intention to return after March due to the holy month of Ramadan or in the summer, after the end of the school year.'

**UNHCR Warns of Reduced Funding Exposing 43,000 Refugees to Losing Access to Healthcare**
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has warned that the reduction in funding and lack of sufficient resources for 2025 in Jordan will expose 43,000 refugees to losing access to primary healthcare and critical health support. The UNHCR also stated that the reduction in funding will put 335,000 women of childbearing age at risk of not receiving essential healthcare services for mothers. According to a report on the impact of reduced funding, this will lead to 12.8 million forcibly displaced people, including 6.3 million children, being denied life-saving health activities in 2025 due to insufficient resources. The UNHCR pointed out that the ongoing humanitarian funding crisis, exacerbated by declining healthcare spending in host countries, affects the quality of public health and nutrition programs for refugees and host communities, making it difficult to access essential services, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks, malnutrition, and untreated chronic health conditions, as well as mental health issues. Refugees will face difficulties in accessing services when support for healthcare is reduced, as they will have to bear the costs themselves, but they do not have the necessary funds, and they will face challenges in accessing public services that are already under pressure, which will further burden local clinics and hospitals. The UNHCR also noted that the effects of reduced funding will also affect water networks, sanitation facilities, and waste management, which may lead to the spread of infectious diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, hepatitis, and malaria, affecting large numbers of the population with devastating consequences. The reduction in funding may also lead to a significant decline in progress made in combating HIV/AIDS in humanitarian contexts. It is worth noting that there are approximately 615,000 refugees registered with the UNHCR in Jordan, 90.7% of whom are Syrians, totaling around 558,000 Syrians, who are concentrated in Amman, Irbid, Mafraq, and Zarqa, with the majority being from Daraa, then Homs, Aleppo, and Damascus countryside. The UNHCR previously reported that due to the decline in humanitarian aid and limited opportunities for resettlement, the situation of refugees in the kingdom has worsened, particularly for the most vulnerable refugees. The UNHCR also stated that the most vulnerable refugees, such as those suffering from critical health conditions or those unable to find work, have seen their situation worsen over the past few months in line with the decline in aid. The UNHCR also pointed out that there is a worrying increase in poverty rates among refugees living in Jordan, with 67% of registered refugees classified as poor in 2023. In the 'Assessment of Vulnerability to Poverty and Economic Inequality among Refugees in Host Communities', the UNHCR stated that Syrian refugees are more impoverished than non-Syrian refugees, with an average poverty rate of 69% compared to 53% for non-Syrians. The UNHCR said that limited job opportunities, combined with the decline in the value of cash transfers provided by the World Food Programme, have exacerbated the conditions of refugees and increased food insecurity among them. During the first two months of this year, the UNHCR received approximately $55 million in funding from the international community in Jordan, out of a total of $372.8 million required for 2025, which represents about 15% of the required funding.

**UNHCR: 1.601 million Jordanians and 624,000 Syrian refugees need support in 2025**
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are 1.601 million Jordanians and 624,000 Syrian refugees who need support in 2025. The Commissioner's strategy aims to reach 480.4 thousand Jordanians from host communities and 504,000 refugees, with a budget of approximately $910.4 million. The Commissioner stated that after 14 years of the Syrian conflict, 'Jordan remains one of the largest refugee concentrations in the Middle East', with over 81% of refugees living in urban areas. The Commissioner also mentioned that Jordan has provided hospitality to Syrian refugees, providing them with healthcare and education through its national systems, while confirming its commitment to human rights. However, despite Jordan having overcome the initial humanitarian emergency phase, there are still significant needs for Syrian refugees, including shelter, food security, and livelihoods. The Commissioner noted that the region's instability, population growth, economic difficulties, and trade disruptions exacerbate the challenges of hosting refugees in healthcare, education, and labor systems. To address these ongoing challenges, Jordan is working closely with regional refugee plan partners and strengthening its capacity to face crises to implement a solutions-based approach that aligns with broader development goals and the country's long-term vision. The Commissioner emphasized that the response in Jordan this year will focus on a human development approach that enhances sustainable solutions consistent with Jordan's long-term vision. The top strategic priorities in the plan include 'protection', 'saving lives', 'self-reliance', 'sustainable support for national healthcare and education systems', 'integrated response', and 'voluntary return'. The Commissioner also stated that there are 200,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan who may return to Syria, citing a regional survey conducted in January that showed a significant increase in intentions to return, with 40% expressing a desire to return within the next 12 months, compared to 1.8% recorded in a survey conducted in October 2024. However, up to 60% of respondents have not made up their minds or do not intend to return to Syria in the next 12 months due to concerns about safety, security, housing, basic services, and livelihoods. The Commissioner emphasized that these concerns highlight the need to continue supporting refugees in their host country while supporting refugees who intend to return to do so in a voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable manner. The support and programming for the return of refugees will be implemented in phases based on the conditions in Syria, the intentions of refugees, and declared needs.

**Syrian Refugees: 34% from Daraa, 25% from Homs**
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has released a report stating that 34% of Syrian refugees returning from Jordan to their homeland are from Daraa, while 25% are from Homs, and 13% are from Rural Damascus. The report also states that 437,040 Syrian refugees have returned to Syria since December 8, 2024. The majority of the refugees registered with the UNHCR are from Daraa. The report also mentions that 24% of the returnees were living in Amman, and 42% were children, while 23% of the men were of military age. The UNHCR has also facilitated the return of approximately 160 refugees who expressed their intention to return to Syria, with personal interviews conducted to ensure that the return was voluntary and informed, and providing information and advice on the services available in Syria. According to a regional survey conducted by the UNHCR, 40% of Syrian refugees in Jordan intend to return within a year, while 56% do not intend to return or have not made a decision. The survey also found that 85% of refugees in Jordan believe that they will return to Syria one day. The UNHCR estimates that the financial requirements to facilitate the voluntary and organized return of refugees and displaced persons in the region during 2025 will be approximately $371 million, including $22 million to target the return of Syrians in Jordan. The UNHCR is urgently seeking to collect the $371 million to facilitate the return of up to 1.5 million Syrians in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, and Turkey during 2025, and to provide basic support to returnees upon their arrival in Syria. In addition, the financial requirements include assistance to internally displaced Syrians during their return to their communities, which may reach 2 million IDPs in 2025. The UNHCR needs this funding to facilitate the return of approximately 5.5 million Syrian refugees currently living in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, and Turkey. Furthermore, the UNHCR plans to support refugees in Europe, North Africa, and the Gulf Cooperation Council region who are seeking information and assistance to return to Syria. 'The likelihood of refugees returning to Syria after the fall of the previous regime remains uncertain and difficult,' said the UN Development Programme, citing the widespread destruction, lack of infrastructure, limited economic opportunities, and ongoing security concerns. The report also noted that the cost of return will be high, requiring significant international contributions in this area.

**Expectations of a Significant Increase in Syrian Refugees Returning to Syria this Summer**
According to expectations, the summer will see a significant increase in the number of Syrian refugees returning to Syria from Jordan. The number of Syrians who have crossed the border between Jordan and Syria since January 7, 2024, and February 2025 has exceeded 100,000 people, mostly Syrians living outside of Jordan. By the end of 2024, around 73,288 Syrian refugees had returned to Syria from Jordan through the Jaber border crossing since December 6, 2024. Jordan's Interior Minister, Mazen Faraya, stated that Jordan will continue to play its humanitarian role towards refugees and is ready to provide whatever is needed. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees noted a clear increase in the number of refugees, and in terms of the distribution of returnees in December 2024, 64% were men and boys, while 36% were women and girls. Among these, 36% were complete families, meaning all family members traveled together. Children, whether boys or girls, accounted for around 27% of the total returnees during the same month, while seniors accounted for around 5% of the returnees. The daily average of returnees from registered refugees in January 2025 has seen an increase, with many Syrian refugees returning from the Daraa governorate, as well as from other areas in Syria, particularly from Homs. These refugees returned from urban and rural areas in Jordan. Official estimates indicate that the number of Syrian refugees in Jordan is around 1.3 million, while UNHCR statistics show that there are approximately 655,283 registered refugees. Member of Parliament Asmaa Al-Rawhani stated that the return of Syrians is primarily related to the stability of their country from various security, economic, and social aspects, and that it is expected to increase as these conditions are confirmed. She added that they will be an important part of the reconstruction process through their contributions, as it is a very important process in terms of repairing what is needed and providing job opportunities for them, especially since most of them possess high skills in various crafts. She emphasized that Syria's return to stability benefits everyone, and that Jordan, despite the challenges and burdens of refuge, remains committed to the option of safe and voluntary return, considering them as brothers. Former Member of the Senate Khalid Ramadan pointed out that factors for returning to Syria are not only related to the end of the school year, but there are many factors to consider, including the development of the situation inside Syria and the return of normal life, as well as the availability of basic necessities such as electricity, water, and healthcare. This will lead to an increase in the numbers, but not in large numbers, rather in a gradual manner. Therefore, the availability of economic, security, and social means will reflect on the desire of refugees to return. Dr. Khalid Shneikat, President of the Jordanian Association for Political Science, stated that expectations are leaning towards an increase in the return of refugees to their country in the summer, with several considerations for this trend, including the fact that Syria is moving towards stability, and it is clear that security institutions have imposed control over most areas of Syria, except for limited areas. The second factor is the improvement in the performance of the currency, and there are Arab and foreign investments on the way, including financing the return of refugees through the rehabilitation of infrastructure, including addressing the imbalances that occurred in health, education, and roads, and other areas, which are among the determinants that concern refugees in taking the decision to return. He added that Turkey is concerned with the return of 3 million refugees it hosts, and therefore, it is working on the topic of reconstruction in addition to other countries that will have a prominent role, to ensure a safe return for them. As for refugees, they look at the return from several angles, with the most important being the disappearance of security concerns, which encourages return, while those with successful projects and economic interests in Jordan are expected not to return.

**UNHCR: 40 Syrian families leave Jordan's Azraq camp to Syria**
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports a significant increase in Syrian refugees returning to Jordan in 2024, with approximately 17,200 returnees, including 5,100 in December alone. According to UNHCR, whole families accounted for 36% of returnees, with all family members travelling together. The majority of returnees were men and boys (64%), while 36% were women and girls. UNHCR estimates that over 125,000 Syrians have returned home since the fall of the former regime of Bashar Al Assad, with main destinations including Aleppo, Raqqa, and Draa. UNHCR is coordinating refugees' return trips with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), providing logistical support such as transportation for refugees and their belongings. 'The sharp increase in returns in the second half of the year is a testament to the resilience and determination of the Syrian people,' said UNHCR. 'We will continue to support their safe and voluntary return to Syria.'
