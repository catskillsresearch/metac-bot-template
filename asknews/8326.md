**Researchers Warn of the Dangers of General Artificial Intelligence**
Some AI researchers have warned that the development of general artificial intelligence (AGI) could be a threat to humanity, as it could become uncontrollable and have its own goals and motivations. AGI is a type of AI that can understand and solve complex problems, and is considered to be a major breakthrough in the field of AI. However, some researchers have expressed concerns that AGI could become a threat to humanity if it is not properly controlled. Max Tegmark, a professor at MIT, has suggested that the key to avoiding this threat is to focus on developing 'instrumental AI', which is AI that is designed to perform a specific task and does not have the ability to become uncontrollable. On the other hand, some companies are investing heavily in the development of AGI, which they believe will be a major breakthrough in the field of AI. However, the timeline for the development of AGI is uncertain, and some experts believe that it could be a long time before it is achieved. 'We are not sure if we want to compete with intelligent entities that are more intelligent than us,' said Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal. 'It's not a reassuring prospect.' Bengio also expressed concerns that AGI could become a threat to humanity if it is not properly controlled, and suggested that we should think about the scenarios in which things could go wrong. 'We should think about the scenarios in which things could go wrong, and not just assume that everything will be fine,' he said.
