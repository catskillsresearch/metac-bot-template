**UK Announces Nuclear Submarine and Ammunition Factory Plans in Response to 'Russian Threat'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive rearmament plan for the UK, including the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and six new ammunition factories. The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate £15 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional £6 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.

**Britain unveils radical defense overhaul to meet new threats**
The UK government has unveiled a radical defense overhaul to address threats from Russia, nuclear risks, and cyber-attacks. The plan, which includes investing in drones and digital warfare, aims to make the army more lethal, not larger. Defense Secretary John Healey said, 'Drones now kill more people than traditional artillery in the war in Ukraine and whoever gets new technology into the hands of their armed forces the quickest will win.' The government will spend 15 billion pounds on replacing the nuclear warheads for its main nuclear fleet and build new munitions plants. The review also recommends increasing the total number of regular personnel when funding allows, likely after 2029. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged the largest sustained increase to UK defense spending since the end of the Cold War, aiming to reach 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and 3% in the next parliament, likely between 2029-2034.

**Spanish Government to Consider Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant Extension**
The Spanish government will only consider a three-year extension, until 2030, for the Almaraz nuclear power plant in Cáceres, if the plant's owners, Iberdrola, Endesa, and Naturgy, formally request it. The government's decision was announced by the Minister for Ecological Transition, Sara Aagesen, in a conversation with the secretary of the PSOE in Extremadura, Miguel Ángel Gallardo. According to the regional spokesperson for the socialists, Isabel Gil Rosiña, the companies agreed with the government on the closure schedule, and it is now up to them to request the extension. The companies have expressed their intention to prolong the plant's life until 2030, but the process is still in discussion. The central nuclear power plant has recently experienced a non-programmed shutdown due to a fault in a circuit, which has raised concerns about its safety and security. The plant's owners and local business leaders have expressed their support for the plant's continuation, citing the importance of having a stable and secure energy source. However, the coalition Unidas por Extremadura and environmental associations have criticized the possible extension as 'a joke' and have expressed concerns about the plant's safety and the need for significant investment to ensure its operation.

**Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant Extension Closer to Reality**
The Spanish government will process a three-year extension, until 2030, for the Almaraz nuclear power plant in Cáceres, as long as the companies that own it, Iberdrola, Endesa, and Naturgy, formally request it. This was announced by the Minister for Ecological Transition, Sara Aagesen, in a conversation with the secretary of the PSOE in Extremadura, Miguel Ángel Gallardo. The companies had previously agreed with the government on a closure schedule for the plant, with the first unit set to close in 2027 and the second in 2028. However, they now want to extend the plant's lifespan to 2030. The central nuclear de Almaraz has notified the Nuclear Safety Council (CSN) of a non-programmed stoppage of the reactor in the first unit due to a malfunction in a flow transmitter. The plant's management has stated that the stoppage is being carried out in an orderly manner and that the safety of people, the installation, and the environment has not been affected. Representatives of the business community have visited the plant to show their support for its continuation, citing the importance of having a balanced energy mix and the need for nuclear energy to provide stability to the system in critical situations.

**Egypt Calls for Israel's Accession to Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty**
Egypt's Foreign Minister, Dr. Badr Abdel Ati, called for Israel's accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear state, noting that 'the current treaty imbalance regarding the commitments of countries in the context of non-proliferation in the Middle East exacerbates the instability in the region.' Abdel Ati made this statement during a meeting with the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, on June 2, 2025. Abdel Ati emphasized that 'Israel remains the only state in the region that has not joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty and refuses to submit its nuclear facilities to the Agency's guarantees.' He expressed his hope that the Director General would make efforts to implement the annual resolution adopted by the General Conference of the Agency regarding the application of guarantees in the Middle East. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry's official spokesperson, Tameem Khalaf, stated that the Minister appreciated the Agency's vital role in supporting regional security and stability through promoting the principles of nuclear non-proliferation and expanding the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes serving sustainable development goals. He also praised the Director General's achievements since taking office in late 2019, particularly his active participation in climate change conferences, including the 2022 Sharm el-Sheikh Summit, which significantly contributed to the international recognition of the positive role that nuclear energy can play in combating climate change and adapting to its consequences. The spokesperson highlighted Egypt's efforts to utilize peaceful nuclear applications to serve national development goals, particularly through the project to establish a nuclear power plant in Dabaa, which is a significant step in this direction. He emphasized the importance of strengthening cooperation with the Agency and benefiting from its technical expertise to ensure the implementation of the highest international standards in nuclear safety and security. This project, he added, will open up wider horizons for Egypt in its comprehensive development journey.

**UK to Expand Nuclear-Powered Submarine Fleet**
The UK plans to expand its nuclear-powered submarine fleet, as announced by the government in London ahead of a review of the defense sector. The new submarines will be designed for offensive operations against other ships. According to Defense Minister John Healey, 'With new, highly modern submarines patrolling international waters and our own nuclear deterrent program on the British coast, we make Britain safe at home and strong abroad.' He added, 'We know that threats are increasing and we must act decisively to counter Russian aggression.' The UK aims to build up to 12 next-generation submarines, which will be nuclear-powered and capable of carrying conventional, non-nuclear weapons. They are expected to replace the current fleet of seven submarines by the end of 2030. The new submarines are being developed as part of the AUKUS security partnership between the UK, the US, and Australia.

**Lee backs nuclear power - for now**
Presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being' but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables like offshore wind to supply industrial hubs and aims to phase out coal by 2040. He supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' In contrast, Lee's main rival Kim Moon-soo supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60% of the mix. South Korea's latest energy blueprint aims for nuclear to make up 35% of the power mix by 2038, with renewables at 29%. If elected, Lee is expected to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30% of the power mix by 2030.

**British fighter jets to carry nuclear weapons in face of threat of Russia**
The UK government is in talks with US officials to introduce jets armed with nuclear weapons for the first time, as part of the latest defensive expansion against Russia. This move would be the UK's biggest deterrent development since the Cold War. The Defence Secretary, Radakin, views this as the UK's number one defence priority, citing rising nuclear risks across the globe. He said, 'The world is definitely becoming more dangerous. Nuclear risks are rising. For the first time since the Cold War, we face seriously increasing risks of state-on-state conflict.' The government also plans to increase defence spending to three per cent GDP by 2034 and move to wartime levels of arms production by building six new munitions factories. Labour leader, Sir Keir, has also called for a transformation in how the UK defends itself, saying, 'We will meet this moment head on -- by mounting the kind of response not seen before in most of our lifetimes.'

**'15 Times More Powerful': China's New Non-Nuclear Hydrogen Bomb Sparks Concern**
Chinese scientists have developed a 'non-nuclear hydrogen bomb' that can cause devastating chain reactions without using any nuclear material. The 2-kilogram bomb, developed by the 705 Research Institute of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, uses a solid-state hydrogen storage material called magnesium hydride. When activated by conventional explosives, the magnesium hydride rapidly decomposes thermally, releasing gaseous hydrogen that ignites in a prolonged inferno. According to Wang Xuefeng, the head of the defense science team that conducted the explosion test, the hydrogen gas explosions ignite with minimal ignition energy, have a wide range of explosion, and trigger flames that rapidly spread outward, spreading widely. The reaction chain begins when the shock waves of the detonation fracture the magnesium hydride into microscopic particles, exposing new surfaces. The thermal decomposition rapidly releases gaseous hydrogen, which mixes with the ambient air. At the lower explosive limit, the mixture ignites, initiating an exothermic combustion reaction. The bomb can cause prolonged thermal damage because the incandescent fireball it produces, sufficient to melt aluminum alloys, lasts much longer than the fleeting 0.12-second flash of TNT. In forced detonation conditions, the maximum overpressure reached 428.43 kilopascals at two meters from the bomb, about 40% of the explosive force of TNT, but with a much wider range of heat projection. Researchers have also examined other potential military applications of the weapon, such as using it to cover a wide area with intense heat and concentrate its power on high-value targets to destroy them.

**China Successfully Detonates Non-Nuclear Hydrogen Warhead in Field Test**
China has successfully conducted a military experiment, the first of its kind in the world, by detonating a non-nuclear hydrogen warhead in a field test within the country. The warhead was able to initiate a series of destructive chemical reactions that resulted in a massive explosion that exceeded the power of traditional explosives made of 'TNT' material. According to the 'Millitary Watch' magazine, the 2 kg warhead caused a fireball that reached 1000 degrees Celsius for two seconds, which is 15 times more powerful than a similar amount of 'TNT' explosives. This is a significant increase in power for many Chinese armaments and ammunition, including ballistic missiles, artillery shells, and air-to-air missiles. The magazine stated that the 'Institute 705 for Research' under the 'Shipbuilding Foundation', a state-owned entity, developed the unique detonation device, which uses solid-state hydrogen stored in magnesium hydride, a material that can store much larger amounts of hydrogen than compressed hydrogen tanks. This compound is ignited using traditional explosives, causing a rapid thermal decomposition that releases hydrogen gas, which ignites in a massive and sustained fireball. Researchers at 'Institute 705 for Research' commented on the results, saying: 'Hydrogen gas explosions can be initiated with minimal ignition energy, causing widespread destruction and releasing massive flames that quickly spread to the surrounding environment. This combination allows for precise control over the intensity of the explosions and facilitates uniform destruction of targets over large areas.' China is the only country in the world capable of producing magnesium hydride on a large commercial scale, with an annual production capacity of over 150 tons.

**China's 'Non-Nuclear Hydrogen Bomb' Misunderstanding: Separating Fact from Fiction**
A recent report by South China Morning Post claiming that China tested a 'non-nuclear hydrogen bomb' has sparked controversy and misinterpretation in the Chinese media. However, a detailed analysis of the scientific article cited by the publication reveals that such claims are far from reality. According to the source, no uranium or plutonium was used in the tests, but rather the activation of magnesium hydride, a substance that releases hydrogen gas upon detonation, which burns and releases a large amount of heat. The reaction is characterized by a brief temperature increase to 1000°C and lasts for approximately 15 seconds, more akin to a controlled sequence of chemical explosions than a thermonuclear synthesis. In contrast, real hydrogen bombs use deuterium and tritium isotopes of hydrogen, which can only react at extreme conditions, requiring temperatures achievable only through the detonation of an atomic charge triggering a thermonuclear chain reaction. The 'non-nuclear' version of the device is purely chemical, not accompanied by energy release comparable to nuclear reactions. It would be more accurate to describe it as an improved thermobaric warhead. The device operates on a double explosion principle: first, a cloud of flammable material is released, and then it ignites, creating a shockwave and high-temperature effects. Such systems are typically effective against targets in enclosed spaces - caves, tunnels, and fortified structures. They not only cause damage through temperature and explosion, but also create a lack of oxygen, leading to asphyxiation. The new Chinese development is distinguished by its longer active phase of burning, lasting up to 15 seconds, which allows it to exert its effects on the target for a longer period in confined spaces, expanding its tactical capabilities. However, even with its unique features, it is incorrect to place this device in the same category as nuclear charges. The power of a nuclear explosion can reach tens and hundreds of millions of degrees Celsius, while in this case, the temperature is comparable to that of kiln for firing ceramics. Therefore, statements in the media about the 'non-nuclear hydrogen bomb' should be viewed with caution. This is a new type of conventional weaponry, not a breakthrough in the nuclear field. Such misunderstandings arise from the coincidence of terms, but their physical and destructive nature are fundamentally different.

**Scientists Suggest Detonating a Thermonuclear Bomb to Save the Environment**
Andrew Haverly, a scientist from Rochester Institute of Technology (USA), has proposed detonating a massive nuclear bomb to save the environment. According to Haverly, a thermonuclear explosion at the bottom of the ocean could significantly delay the rise in global temperature. He suggests that the explosion would break down basalt rocks into particles that could react with carbon dioxide and neutralize it. Haverly estimates that the bomb should have a power of around 81 megatons, which is 1600 times more powerful than the 'Tsar Bomba' thermonuclear bomb. He proposes placing the charges under the Kerguelen Plateau in the Southern Ocean, which is located at a depth of about five kilometers. Haverly notes that the basalt would absorb not only carbon dioxide but also a significant portion of the radioactive fallout. However, he acknowledges that the radioactive background at the blast site would increase in the long term, potentially leading to some casualties, but considers this a 'drop in the ocean' compared to the current rate of radiation release. Haverly points out that humanity releases massive amounts of radiation into the atmosphere every year, equivalent to 2000 nuclear bombs, and notes that climate change will threaten 30 million lives by 2100.

**Map shows where 75% of US population will die in WWIII nuclear attack**
A new map created by Halcyon Maps reveals the devastating effects of a large-scale nuclear attack on the US, with up to 250 million Americans (about 75% of the country's population) potentially killed. The map, based on data from FEMA, shows that every populated city on the East Coast, Midwest, West Coast, and South could be targeted, with severe fallout and radiation exposure affecting millions. Major metropolitan cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Washington DC would likely be hit first, with the US economy, leadership, and workforce crippled. Even areas that would avoid immediate obliteration would become uninhabitable in the nuclear winter that would follow. As John Erath, Senior Policy Director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said, 'Any nuclear war or weapons detonation would be bad for everyone. Nowhere is truly safe from fallout and other consequences.'

**Nuclear Explosions as a Means to Prevent Asteroid Impacts**
Scientists have proposed a new method to prevent asteroid impacts on Earth by 2032 using nuclear explosions. According to the research, a high-powered X-ray burst, similar to those produced by a nuclear explosion, could deflect even large asteroids that could destroy human civilization. The idea is to detonate a nuclear device near the asteroid, which would emit a massive amount of energy and momentum, causing the asteroid to change its trajectory. This method was tested by NASA's 'DART' mission in 2022, which successfully deflected a small asteroid. However, this method may not be effective for larger asteroids or those discovered too late. The researchers suggest that a nuclear device could be used to deflect an asteroid as large as 100 meters in diameter, which could destroy a city, by detonating it two weeks before impact. The team has already tested this theory using a device called the Z Machine at the Sandia National Laboratories, which can generate high temperatures and pressures, and has successfully deflected small asteroids. The researchers believe that even a 4-kilometer-long asteroid could be deflected by a nuclear explosion. However, the use of nuclear devices in space is unlikely due to the risk of radioactive material being released into the atmosphere, and the political tensions it could create.

**Queensland nuclear plan in question as Albo warns it would drag state's economy**
The Federal Government has released analysis claiming that the Liberal-National coalition's plan to build two nuclear reactors in Queensland would make the state's economy nearly $900 billion worse off by 2050. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated that the opposition's nuclear plan would take Australia backwards in terms of economic activity, saying, 'Under the Coalition [Dutton's] vision is for a smaller Australia, is for making less things, is for less economic activity, is for less jobs.' The analysis also found that the plan would affect Queensland's output by $61.1 billion in 2050-51 alone. The coalition's proposal includes building seven reactors across Australia, with two in Queensland, and aims to have them operational between 2035 and 2037. Labor has disputed the coalition's argument that their plan is more expensive, citing statements from the CSIRO that nuclear energy would be significantly more expensive for Australia.
