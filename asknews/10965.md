**Texas Heat Wave: Renewables Keep the Lights On Despite Legislative Headwinds**
As Texas faces an unprecedented May heat wave, solar and battery storage are proving their worth in maintaining grid stability. Despite lawmakers considering measures that could limit their growth, these renewable energy sources are performing well during peak demand hours. Texas has emerged as America's solar leader, with 22,000 MW of installed capacity and projections to add another 24 GW by year's end. Battery storage capacity has more than doubled over the past year, providing critical flexibility to balance supply and demand. However, the Texas Legislature is considering bills that could impact future clean energy development, including mandating 50% of new generating capacity be 'dispatchable' and stricter siting restrictions on wind and solar projects. Energy experts agree that grid resilience requires embracing diversity rather than relying on a single resource, and that advanced technologies like grid-forming inverters and demand response programs could further enhance system flexibility without legislative restrictions.

**Trump Administration Seeks to Lift Biden's Restrictions on Alaska Oil Exploration**
The Trump administration is seeking to lift the restrictions imposed by President Biden on oil exploration in most areas of the massive Alaska oil reserve, which is estimated to contain approximately 8.7 billion barrels of extractable oil. According to a report by Bloomberg News, this move aims to open up new avenues for oil and gas development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, which spans 23 million acres, roughly the size of the state of Indiana. This change comes as part of Trump's instructions issued after taking office in January, which included implementing a series of policy changes to expand oil and gas exploration and production activities, as well as mining in Alaska. The US Geological Survey estimated in 2017 that the reserve contains approximately 8.7 billion barrels of extractable oil. With the development of new discoveries, production is expected to increase significantly, with Alaska expecting oil production in the reserve to rise to 139.6 thousand barrels per day by fiscal year 2033, compared to 15.8 thousand barrels per day in fiscal year 2023. This move would repeal a 2024 base issued by Biden, which classified 13 million acres of the reserve as 'special areas', imposing restrictions on oil and gas leasing in those areas, while a leasing ban remains in place on 10.6 million acres of the reserve. 'ConocoPhillips' is currently developing the 'Willow' project, which includes a reserve estimated at 600 million barrels of oil within the protected area, and is expected to begin production by 2029. On the other hand, environmental advocates argue that Biden's base was necessary to protect vast areas of pristine land in the Arctic, which includes wetlands rich in wildlife, and that increasing oil extraction in the face of global warming is not justified. The new proposal gives the public 60 days to submit their comments and feedback, paving the way for a quick revision and reopening of leasing operations in the oil reserve. This shift in policy may face legal challenges from environmental advocates who welcomed the previous protection measures and may resort to federal courts to challenge this decision.

**Trump Administration to Lift Restrictions on Alaska Oil Drilling**
The Trump administration plans to lift restrictions imposed by Joe Biden's administration on oil drilling in Alaska, according to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. The move would allow for the development of oil and gas in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which spans 23 million acres, roughly the size of the state of Indiana. The reserve was created 100 years ago for the US Navy. The decision is linked to Trump's executive order signed in January, which aimed to increase oil and gas production in Alaska. According to official projections, oil production in the reserve is expected to rise to 139.6 thousand barrels per day by 2033, up from 15.8 thousand barrels in 2023. The new policy would repeal a 2024 rule introduced by Biden, which designated 13 million acres of the reserve as 'special zones' and prohibited leasing 10.6 million acres for drilling. ConocoPhillips is preparing a project called Willow, which would extract 600 million barrels of oil, with production expected to start in 2029. Energy Secretary Chris Wright noted that oil production on the North Slope could increase fourfold, and that the previous policy had hindered regional development, saying, 'This new policy will unlock the potential of the North Slope and create jobs and economic growth for Alaskans.'

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**Trump wants to maintain nuclear predominance**
US President Donald Trump announced his goal to quadruple the country's nuclear energy capacity by 2050. This decision is consistent with his aim to maintain the US's leading position in key areas and to give a strategy to the private sector. Trump ordered the Department of Energy to accelerate the construction of ten large reactors by 2030 and to contribute to the modernization of existing reactors. The executive order includes four decrees, which insist that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a 'culture excessively averse to risk' that establishes that nuclear facilities produce the lowest number of emissions, even below natural ones. According to Michael Katsios, Director of Scientific and Technological Policy of the Presidency, the executive orders will launch a 'nuclear renaissance in the United States' and will allow 'great innovators and entrepreneurs in the United States to overcome obstacles' in nuclear technology. The four executive orders are related to two areas of government: energy and defense. They allow the construction of nuclear reactors on federal land, reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and increase uranium mining and enrichment in the United States. Trump also signed an order to reinstall 'science with gold standards' in a moment when the government has cut billions of dollars in federal subsidies for scientific research and has reduced the staff of federal agencies focused on science. 'Today we sign important decrees that will make us the true force of this industry, which is enormous,' Trump said in the presentation of the executive orders. The Nuclear Energy Office has a budget cut of $400 million, but this is compensated by the increase of other items. According to the Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, the 'excess of regulation' will be reduced and the investment of risk capital in the industry will be encouraged, allowing 'to win the war of artificial intelligence with China.'

**From Leader to Laggard? U.S. Faces Carbon Capture Slowdown as EU Surges Ahead | OilPrice.com**
The United States, once a leader in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, is facing a slowdown due to policy uncertainty, while Europe is surging ahead with a regulatory-driven approach. The EU's Net-Zero Industry Act requires oil and gas companies to collectively develop and reserve at least 50 million tonnes of annual CO2 storage capacity by 2030, creating a stable environment for investors and reducing risk. This shift in global momentum highlights a changing dynamic in CCS leadership, with Europe positioning itself as a growing center of gravity for CCS innovation. 'This regulatory certainty offers investors a stable environment in which to commit capital, reducing risk and providing a clear roadmap for the long-term development of CCS infrastructure,' according to the article. The U.S. market, on the other hand, faces a potential slowdown due to the lack of stability in the regulatory environment, making it difficult for projects to reach final investment decisions.

**AI Drives Demand for Computing Power: McKinsey Estimates 6.7 Trillion Dollars by 2030**
According to McKinsey, the global demand for data center capacity is expected to almost triple by 2030, reaching 6.7 trillion dollars. 70% of this demand will be attributed to AI, while the remaining 30% will be for traditional IT applications. McKinsey presents three scenarios for the evolution of computing power demand by 2030: Scenario accelerated: 205 GW of additional AI capacity between 2025 and 2030, with a total of 7.9 trillion dollars in capital investments. Scenario intermediate (based on the report): 125 GW additional in the same period, for 5.2 trillion dollars. Scenario contained: 78 GW additional by 2030, with a total demand of 3.7 trillion dollars. The predictions take into account two main uncertainties: AI use cases. The value of AI lies in its application level—i.e., the ability of companies to transform it into concrete impacts on business. If companies fail to generate real value, the demand for computing power may be lower than expected. On the other hand, transformative applications could fuel a higher demand than current predictions, with a reduction in training costs of around 18 times and inference costs of around 36 times compared to GPT-4. 15% of investments (800 billion) will be allocated to builders, for land, materials, and site development. An additional 25% (1.3 trillion) will be allocated to operators. Despite the expected demands, the analysis highlights that current investment levels remain below demand. In dozens of interviews with CEOs, it emerged that many leaders hesitate to invest maximally in computing capacity due to limited visibility on demand evolution, uncertainty on AI adoption rate, and long project implementation times. To guide strategic decisions and investments, companies can be classified into five main archetypes, each with a specific role in the AI infrastructure ecosystem: Builder: real estate developers, design firms, and construction companies involved in expanding data center capacity. Energizer: utilities, energy providers, cooling system and electrical equipment manufacturers, and telecommunications operators. Technology Developers and Designers: semiconductor companies and IT suppliers that produce chips and computational hardware. Operators: hyperscalers, colocation providers, GPU-as-a-service platforms, and companies that optimize their computational resources. AI Architect: AI model developers, foundation model providers, and companies that build proprietary AI capabilities.

**Trump Plans to Quadruple U.S. Nuclear Power Capacity by 2050**
U.S. President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to ease regulations on the nuclear power industry, aiming to quadruple the country's nuclear power capacity by 2050. The plan includes concluding reactor construction permit decisions within 18 months, breaking ground on 10 large-scale reactors by 2030, and increasing nuclear generation capacity from 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts. Trump stated, 'Nuclear is a very safe and environmentally friendly industry. We need to do it right, and we're going to go very big.' The executive orders also include reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, overhauling nuclear energy research, promoting nuclear plant construction on federal lands, and expanding domestic uranium mining and enrichment. However, concerns have been raised that the U.S. may not be able to achieve these goals on its own, potentially opening the door to opportunities for South Korea to fill the resulting gap.

**Electric Grid Capacity Could Hamstring EV Growth**
Electric vehicle charge point operators are concerned that the U.S. electric grid's capacity will limit their growth in the next year, with 90% of charging operators anticipating grid capacity issues. A report from ICF predicts a 78% increase in electric demand in the U.S. by 2050, driven by demand from data centers, EVs, and electric buildings. Industry experts suggest that an 'all-of-the-above' approach to energy sources and charging infrastructure is needed, including low-level trickle charging for multifamily housing. As Forth Program Manager Anna Guida noted, 'It doesn't need to be high-speed charging requiring costly, complicated utility upgrades.'

**US Has Enough Enriched Uranium Reserves Until 2050s, Says Admiral William Houston**
The United States has enough reserves of enriched uranium to last until the 2050s, according to Admiral William Houston, who heads the US Navy's nuclear reactor program. 'We're getting it from existing stocks. We haven't produced highly enriched uranium since 1992, and for my program, which is the main user because I actually consume this highly enriched uranium because I use it in my reactors, we're good until the 2050s,' Houston said at a Senate hearing. The US Navy's nuclear reactor program relies on highly enriched uranium, which has been in short supply due to Russia's temporary restrictions on exports to the US. The restrictions were imposed last year in response to US sanctions, and were later reinforced by a law signed by former US President Joe Biden in May 2024, which bans the import of uranium from Russia until 2040. However, the law allows for exceptions until 2028, with permission from the US Department of Energy.

**Intel Defies Trump's Restrictions, Continues to Serve Chinese Market**
According to a report by The Economist, Intel's CEO, Jensen Huang, visited Beijing last month with a clear message: the company will continue to serve the Chinese market without hesitation, but Washington was not pleased. Before his visit, the Trump administration imposed new restrictions on the export of AI chips, effectively banning the sale of Intel's latest H20 chip to China. Over the past few years, the US has intensified efforts to limit China's access to advanced semiconductors, particularly those used in AI applications. Since 2022, the restrictions have focused on high-performance chips with high processing power and data transfer capacity, which are essential for training AI models. Intel responded by releasing a special Chinese model, H800, which meets the allowed limits. However, after tightening the rules again in 2023, Intel developed the H20 chip, which is now also banned. Despite these restrictions, Chinese AI companies are still obtaining these chips. A global, hidden supply chain has emerged to circumvent export regulations. Some companies rent servers in external data centers, while others use mysterious intermediaries to purchase them. The new round of restrictions, which will take effect on May 15, targets not only hardware but also cloud service providers. However, the challenges of implementation remain. For example, the Johor region in southern Malaysia, near Singapore, has become a hub for data centers due to low electricity costs and ease of obtaining licenses. Major US tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle have invested there. According to Night Frank, the total capacity of data centers in Johor has increased from 10 megawatts in 2021 to over 1,500 megawatts by 2024. Johor has become a backdoor for Chinese companies, such as ByteDance (owner of TikTok), which has rented cloud capacity there, allowing them to access banned Intel chips. By 2027, SemiAnalysis estimates that about half of Johor's planned data center capacity will contain AI chips like those produced by Intel. Trade data supports this trend. Intel's advanced chips are produced in Taiwanese TSMC factories. In the first quarter of 2024, Taiwan exported graphics processing units to Malaysia worth $3.6 billion, roughly equal to the country's total exports in 2023. In March alone, exports reached $1 billion, three times the previous month. There are also direct smuggling operations, where chips are transferred through third countries not covered by US restrictions, and documents are forged to bypass customs, such as changing classifications or using fake companies. Eric Grunwald from the Artificial Intelligence Policy and Strategy Institute estimates that smuggled American chips accounted for 10% to 50% of China's AI model training capacity in 2023. Before the restrictions in 2022, China accounted for 22% of Intel's revenue, which dropped to 13%. In February, Singaporean police arrested three men for selling servers containing Intel chips worth $390 million, which were later believed to have been transferred to Malaysia. It is unclear if they ended up in China, but the financial incentive is present. Banned chips are now sold at a price difference of 30% to 50% in the gray market. Despite Intel's auditing efforts, it is extremely difficult to track the end-user of each chip, according to industry insiders. Implementing laws also faces familiar challenges. The Industry and Security Office, responsible for enforcing them, suffers from a lack of resources, with only one person managing the Southeast Asia and Australia region, despite being a key hub for gray trade. Moreover, the office faces a 12% budget cut this year. The report concludes that if the US wants to remain at the forefront of the AI race, it needs to accelerate innovation rather than tighten restrictions.

**Amazon and Google Commit to Tripling Nuclear Capacity by 2050**
Amazon and Google have committed to tripling the world's nuclear capacity by 2050. This move comes as data centers struggle to keep up with energy demand, and companies are turning to alternative solutions. The nuclear option is now seen as key to ensuring a stable energy supply. According to Hugues Ferreboeuf, digital project manager at the Shift Project, data center energy consumption could triple by 2030, and Google's energy consumption is increasing by 20% annually. Google has partnered with Kairos Power to develop small modular reactors (SMRs) capable of producing 500 megawatts by 2035, while Amazon is supporting start-up X-Energy to create a fleet aiming for 5 gigawatts by 2039. Microsoft has signed a contract with Helion Energy to revive a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, with a goal of producing 837 megawatts by 2028. Meta has announced a call for American actors to exploit between 1 and 4 gigawatts using nuclear power by 2030. The US has over 2,000 data centers, and the demand is increasing, with a growing concern over energy supply. Tripling the nuclear capacity by 2050 will require massive investments and coordination between states and companies. The SMRs have the advantage of being able to be installed near data centers, but their deployment will not happen before several years. In the meantime, some companies may continue to use gas-fired power plants to meet their immediate needs. The uranium supply is also a key point, with some reactors requiring highly enriched uranium, mainly produced by Russia. According to Valérie Faudon, the European nuclear industry must invest to avoid dependence on foreign actors. The deployment of these reactors could follow a model similar to the aerospace industry, where companies with the ability to produce in series will dominate the market.

**The West Loses Grip on Uranium Market as Russia and China Gain Control**
The West has lost its grip on the uranium market due to sanctions, with Russia and Kazakhstan increasing their exports to China and Russia. The US, UK, and EU are facing a shortage of uranium for their reactors, with the largest producer, Kazakhstan, reducing its exports to the West and increasing them to Russia and China. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that China and Russia are rapidly increasing their uranium purchases, with two-thirds of Kazakhstan's sales in 2023 going to Russia, China, and the domestic market. Economists and experts see this trend as logical, given the expansion of nuclear energy in Russia and China, and the more favorable cooperation conditions. Russia is a leader in uranium enrichment, with 67% of resources concentrated in five countries: Australia, Kazakhstan, Canada, Russia, and Namibia. The West is facing a shortage of uranium, with the US and EU relying on imports, while Russia and China are expanding their nuclear energy programs. The global competition for uranium is expected to intensify by 2040, with the US and EU planning to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050. The current situation is exacerbated by the mutual restrictions on uranium trade between Russia and the US. As a result, the West is facing a critical shortage of uranium, while Russia and China have a surplus. The situation is further complicated by the fact that Western companies are losing control over uranium production, with Kazakhstan's largest producer, Orano, experiencing problems with increasing production due to depleted resources. The current geopolitical situation is driving Kazakhstan to diversify its uranium trade, while Russia and China are seeking to strengthen their energy independence and gain access to strategic resources. The dominance of China and Russia on the uranium market creates additional pressure, making it difficult for the West to find alternative sources of uranium. Analysts predict a risk of a 'sharp shortage of supply' and a sharp increase in prices, which will make it difficult for the US and EU to find new suppliers in the near future.

**Future AI data center capacity could require 10 gigawatts by 2025, more power used than Utah**
According to the RAND Corporation, future AI data centers will require significant power increases, with predictions of 68GW by 2027 and 327GW by 2030. This could overwhelm current infrastructure, with the United States leading the world in data centers and AI compute. The industry is struggling to find enough power capacity to rapidly build new data centers, and failure to address bottlenecks may compel U.S. companies to relocate AI infrastructure abroad, compromising the U.S. competitive advantage in compute and AI and increasing the risk of intellectual property theft. As RAND notes, 'More research is needed to assess bottlenecks for U.S. data center build-out and identify solutions, which may include simplifying permitting for power generation, transmission infrastructure, and data center construction.' Key findings include exponential growth in AI computation driving unprecedented power demands, permitting challenges causing significant delays to data center projects, and insufficient power generation increasing wait times for grid connections. 'Individual AI training runs could require up to 1 GW in a single location by 2028 and 8 GW by 2030', according to RAND, although decentralized training algorithms could distribute this power requirement across locations.
