**Pahalgam Terror Attack: India's Response and the Aftermath**
A month has passed since the Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, where 26 tourists were killed and many others injured. The Indian government has taken several actions against Pakistan, including suspending the Indus Water Treaty, closing the Attari-Wagah border, and banning the SAARC visa scheme for Pakistan. The Indian military also launched Operation Sundar, a targeted strike against terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Pakistan. The operation was successful, with over 100 terrorists killed. Pakistan was left reeling, with its defense minister threatening a nuclear attack. However, India's air defense system shot down Pakistani drones that were attempting to attack Indian cities. In response, India destroyed a Pakistani post and a terrorist launch pad. Pakistan's air defense system was also destroyed, and 11 of its airbases were targeted. Fearing India's retaliation, Pakistan sought a ceasefire, but India insisted that a ceasefire would only be possible if Pakistan's Director-General of Military Operations (DGMO) spoke directly with India's DGMO. After several days of tension, a ceasefire was agreed upon on May 10, 2025. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our military and the dedication of our government,' said a government official. 'We will not tolerate terrorism and will take all necessary measures to protect our citizens.'

**All-Party Delegations Take Op Sindoor to the World: What Are the Talking Points?**
The all-party delegations in India have emphasized several key points regarding Operation Sindoor and Pakistan's cross-border terrorism. These points include: India's patience in dealing with Pakistan's terrorism has come to an end, as it has suffered numerous terrorist attacks, including the 2008 Mumbai attack. Pakistan has been recognized as an epicentre of terrorism, and has continued to give sanctuary to terrorists. The international community has been informed of Pakistan's complicity in terrorism, but it has continued on the terrorist path. India has tried peaceful methods to build ties with Pakistan, but it has been disregarded and responded with terrorist attacks. The Indian people have demanded a change in approach, and India has undertaken limited kinetic actions targeting only terrorism in Pakistan. The Pahalgam terrorist attack was a turning point, and Operation Sindoor was a targeted exercise against terrorist targets. India will not allow Pakistan to use nuclear weapons as a shield to carry out terrorist attacks, and terrorism and talks cannot go hand-in-hand. India is resolved to root out the menace of cross-border terrorism.

**Pakistan's Ambassador to Ankara Briefs on India-Pakistan Tensions**
Pakistan's Ambassador to Ankara, Yousaf Junaid, met with some journalists at the embassy to brief them on the tensions between India and Pakistan. Junaid reminded that the tensions started with a terrorist attack in the Jammu and Kashmir region on April 22, 2025. He said, 'Fifteen minutes after the attack, the Indian authorities blamed Pakistan for the attack. However, the Indian military base in the region, where the first news of the attack would have been reported, was 45 minutes away from the attack site.' Junaid claimed that India planned the attack to 'defame and discredit Pakistan' and that it was a 'self-inflicted terrorist attack.' He stated that Pakistan does not accept these allegations, especially since Prime Minister Sharif had proposed an independent and transparent investigation into the attack immediately after it happened. Junaid also mentioned that on May 6-7, India launched airstrikes on Pakistan, targeting only civilian areas, resulting in the loss of 41 Pakistani lives, with over two-thirds of them being women and children. He added that Pakistani air defense forces intercepted over 100 Indian aircraft, including 5 jets, including 3 Rafale jets, and shot down 94 drones, including one from Israel, that were used to attack Pakistan.

In the press conference, Ambassador Junaid evaluated the tension and the complete ceasefire between Pakistan and India. The conference began with a video presentation about the Pakistan-India tension. Ambassador Junaid stated that the terrorist attack in Cammu Ke≈ümir was blamed on Pakistan by the Indian authorities, but he believed it was a planned terrorist attack by India to defame Pakistan. Junaid mentioned that Pakistan's Prime Minister, Shahbaz Sharif, immediately called for the identification of the real perpetrators of the attack, but the Indians refused and launched air strikes instead. Junaid stated that a total of 41 civilians lost their lives in the air strikes carried out by the Indian Air Force, and that 5 jets, including 3 Rafale fighter jets, were shot down by Pakistan's air defense system. Junaid also stated that India attacked several military bases, including the Noor Khan airbase, which is an important airbase for Pakistan. Junaid emphasized that Pakistan was ready for peace talks from the beginning of the tension, but instead, India launched a retaliatory attack using Fatah missiles and destroyed two S-400 systems. Junaid criticized the Indian media for spreading false information, such as the claim that the Turkish Navy was in Karachi, which he believed was intended to provoke war. Junaid stated that the Indian media's rhetoric is 'If you are not with us, then you are our enemy.'

**Nation Stands Resolute Against Terrorism: Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif**
Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif reiterated that the entire nation stands resolute behind its armed forces and law enforcement agencies in the collective will to eradicate terrorism and safeguard Pakistan's sovereignty and security. The prime minister and Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, visited Quetta to meet the injured children and victims of a horrific attack. They expressed deep grief over the loss of innocent lives and injuries to school-going children. The prime minister and chief of army staff highlighted that it's time for the nation to display a strong resolve to bring the fight against foreign-sponsored terrorism to its logical end. The attack was orchestrated by Indian state-sponsored proxies, which deliberately targeted civilians in a futile attempt to destabilize Pakistan. The international community must condemn and confront India's use of terrorism as a tool of foreign policy, particularly the deliberate targeting of children. Pakistan's security forces and law enforcement agencies will relentlessly pursue those involved in this barbaric act, and the architects, abettors, and enablers will be held accountable and brought to justice.

**Operation Sindhur: Indian Forces Launch Crackdown on Terrorists in Pakistan**
Following the brutal terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, which resulted in the loss of 26 lives, the Indian Armed Forces launched Operation Sindhur to target terrorist hideouts in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

Now, posters have been put up in Kashmir by the police and army, offering a reward of 20 lakhs to anyone who provides information about the terrorists.

**India Launches Global Diplomatic Campaign to Expose Pakistan's Terrorist Plans**
India has launched a global diplomatic campaign to expose Pakistan's terrorist plans and showcase its strong anti-terrorism policy. The campaign involves sending 7 bipartisan delegations to 33 countries, which will visit various countries between May 21 and June 5, 2025. The first delegation, led by Shiv Sena MP Eknath Shinde, will visit the UAE on May 21. The delegations will highlight India's 'zero tolerance' policy towards terrorism, following the Pulwama attack and Operation Sunbeam. Each delegation will consist of 7-8 MPs and former diplomats, who will convey India's message to permanent and non-permanent members of the UN Security Council, as well as other important countries. The campaign aims to expose Pakistan's 40-year history of terrorism, including its inaction on DNA evidence and call records provided by India after the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The Congress party has expressed objections to the selection of the delegation, saying that only one of their suggested names was included. Pakistan has also announced a delegation led by PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto, which will highlight its 'peaceful stance' on the global platform. However, India's campaign demonstrates its strong stance against terrorism.

**Pakistan and India Agree to Withdraw Troops and Return to Pre-Conflict Positions**
Pakistan and India have agreed to withdraw their troops and return to their pre-conflict positions, according to Pakistani intelligence sources. The agreement aims to ease tensions following a ceasefire agreement earlier this month. The agreement was reached during a new round of high-level military communications through the 'hotline' between senior officials from both sides. The agreement states that troops will return to their pre-conflict positions along the shared border and the Line of Control in Kashmir by the end of May. The region had seen a sharp escalation in May, culminating in a clash on May 10, when both nuclear-armed nations exchanged missile strikes, air raids, and artillery fire, targeting military installations and airbases in both countries. The recent tensions stem from a militant attack on April 22 in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, which killed 26 people, mostly Indian tourists. India blamed Pakistan for supporting militant groups behind the attack. In a swift military response, India launched airstrikes on Pakistani territory on May 7, targeting areas in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir, resulting in dozens of casualties and raising concerns of a wider conflict between the two nations. Pakistan denied any involvement in the attack and called for an independent investigation to uncover the circumstances surrounding the incident. Observers hope that the latest agreement will help ease the recurring tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors and reduce the risk of a large-scale conflict in one of the most sensitive regions in South Asia.

**India News | Explosions Heard Near LoC in Poonch and Rajouri Amid Escalating India-Pakistan Tensions | LatestLY**
Amid rising tensions between India and Pakistan, explosions were heard near the Line of Control (LoC) in the Poonch and Rajouri districts of Jammu and Kashmir early Friday morning. The Border Security Forces (BSF) also foiled a major infiltration attempt along the International Boundary in the Samba district of Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday. According to Defence sources, the Indian Army shot down two Pakistani drones in the Naushera sector of Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian Armed Forces responded strongly to Pakistan's attempts to target military stations in Jammu, Pathankot, and Udhampur, neutralizing the threat without any loss of life. These developments come after India launched 'Operation Sindoor' on May 7, which targeted nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.

**India foils Pakistan's drone, missile assault to attack Jammu, Pathankot, Udhampur**
The Indian Armed Forces have successfully foiled a large-scale drone and missile attack launched by Pakistan to target multiple military stations in Northern and Western India, including Jammu, Pathankot, and Udhampur. The Indian military responded swiftly and decisively, neutralising the threat using both kinetic and non-kinetic means in accordance with standard operating procedures (SoP). Colonel Sofiya Qureshi confirmed that India's Integrated Counter-UAS Grid and Air Defence systems had successfully countered the attacks. The escalation followed India's launch of Operation Sindoor -- a series of focused and precise strikes on nine terror camps located in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK) -- in response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people. 'Our actions have been focused, measured, and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in the selection of targets and the method of execution,' the Ministry of Defence said on Wednesday. The Indian response has been in the same domain and with the same intensity as Pakistan's, Colonel Qureshi said. 'This morning, the Indian Armed Forces targeted Air Defence Radars and systems at a number of locations in Pakistan. The Indian response has been in the same domain and with the same intensity as Pakistan's. It has been reliably learnt that an Air Defence system in Lahore has been neutralised,' Colonel Qureshi said. 'Any attack on military sites in India will invite a 'suitable response', Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said. Pakistan only can decide if it wants to de-escalate tensions with India as New Delhi responded to the 'original escalation' triggered by the Pahalgam massacre.'

**No losses in Pakistan's missile and drone attack on Jammu, Pathankot, Udhampur: Ministry of Defence**
The Indian Ministry of Defence confirmed that Pakistan used a combination of missiles and drones to target military stations in Jammu, Pathankot, and Udhampur, but the Indian Armed Forces swiftly neutralized the threat using kinetic and non-kinetic means. According to the Ministry, 'The threat was neutralised promptly and efficiently using a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic methods as per the operational protocols,' and 'The Indian Armed Forces acted in accordance with the established Standard Operating Procedures (SoP), and there were no casualties or damage to assets.' This attack comes at a time of intense military and diplomatic tensions between India and Pakistan, following a series of escalating incidents along the border. India has maintained a high level of military preparedness, with the Indian Air Force on heightened alert and conducting operations to neutralize potential threats from Pakistani-backed terror groups.

**Home Ministry gets ready to tackle 'hostile attacks', asks states to conduct mock drills and train civilians**
The Indian Home Ministry has asked states to conduct mock drills and train civilians in preparation for potential 'hostile attacks' amid escalating tensions with Pakistan. According to government sources, the drills will include the operationalisation of air raid warning sirens, training of civilians and students on self-protection, and provision of crash blackout measures. States have also been asked to update evacuation plans and rehearse them. Indian authorities have vowed a 'befitting reply' to the recent terrorist attack in Kashmir, while Pakistani intelligence has warned of an 'imminent threat of kinetic action'. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given the armed forces a 'free hand' to respond to the attack, saying, 'It was a great day' is not quoted in the article, but the article does quote the Prime Minister as giving the armed forces a 'free hand' to respond to the attack.

**Skirmishes continue at LoC as India weighs response to Pahalgam attack**
Ceasefire violations by Pakistan troops continued along the Line of Control (LoC) for the third night in a row on April 26, 2025, while India held exercises with the Indian Navy and the Air Force on April 27, 2025. Pakistan has mobilized equipment close to the LoC, while India has carried out anti-ship firings with the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile. 'Own troops responded effectively with appropriate small arms fire' to Pakistan's unprovoked fire, an Army official said. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar discussed the Pahalgam terror attack with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, emphasizing 'zero tolerance for terrorism'. India has a range of options, including kinetic action, but the absence of surprise means ongoing exercises serve as a show of strength. The Indian Navy has carried out anti-ship firings, while the Air Force operates 36 multi-role Rafale jets equipped with the Meteor Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missile and the Scalp long-range air-to-ground missile. The Air Force has also inducted the S-400 Triumf air defence systems from Russia. Pakistan has been holding war games, including live firing in the Arabian Sea, and has issued warnings for further firing. The situation remains tense, with all indicators pointing to a possible kinetic action by India.
