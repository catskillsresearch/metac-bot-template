**Taiwanese Progressive Party Chairman Warns of 'Ostrich-Like' Mentality Amid China's Military Threats**
Taiwanese Progressive Party Chairman Wang Hsing-huan warned that Taiwan cannot afford to be in a ' ostrich-like' mentality, ignoring the possibility of war. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently stated that China's military action against Taiwan 'may be imminent' and urged allies in the Indo-Pacific region to increase their defense budgets to deter China. Wang pointed out that various US think tanks, frontline Indo-Pacific commanders, and naval combat forces have warned that China will launch an invasion of Taiwan in 2027. China has also set a goal of 'winning a local war' by 2027. Wang emphasized that China's ideal script for invading Taiwan is to 'encircle and blockade' the island, creating pressure on Taiwanese society through localized military actions, and then using pro-China parties in Taiwan to advocate for 'peace talks' and shape international opinion to accept unification. He stated, 'Those who advocate for peace talks are Taiwan's enemies.' To counter China's military threats, Wang suggested that Taiwan must strengthen its military deterrent, solidify its alliances with Indo-Pacific nations, and cultivate an 'unyielding resistance spirit' to prevent China from launching an invasion. 'If China expects a blockade to lead to a long-term war and international sanctions, it will be hesitant to launch an invasion,' Wang said.

**US-China Trade War: Who Will Be the Dominant Power?**
The trade war between the US and China has raised questions about who will be the dominant power in the future. The US has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, but China has retaliated with its own tariffs. The situation has led to a decline in trade between the two countries, with the US experiencing a trade deficit of $700 billion in 2025. In contrast, China has a trade surplus of $700 billion, with a focus on exporting electronics and other goods. The US has a large national debt of $35 trillion, while China's debt is $15 trillion, but its total debt is 300% of its GDP. According to the IMF, China is expected to become the largest contributor to global growth in the next five years, with a 23% share. The US is still expected to be a major contributor, but its share is expected to decline. The two countries have different economic systems, with the US relying heavily on services, while China relies on industry. The US has a strong military, with over 6,100 tanks and 40,000 armored vehicles, while China has a large military with over 3.3 million soldiers and 3,260 aircraft. The US has a strong navy, with 490 ships, including 11 aircraft carriers, while China has a large navy with 777 ships. The US has a strong defense budget, with $740 billion in 2025, while China's defense budget is $178 billion. According to a report by the Telegraph, China has surpassed the US in terms of military strength, with over 1 million soldiers and a larger navy. The US is concerned about China's rapid military modernization, including its nuclear capabilities. The trade war between the US and China is not just about tariffs, but also about the future of the global economy and the balance of power between the two countries.

**China Accuses US Secretary of Defense of Reviving Cold War Mentality and Sowing Discord**
China has formally protested against the US Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, for 'reviving the mentality of the Cold War' and 'sowing discord' by seeking 'selfish interests' in his speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue. According to a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hegseth 'deliberately ignored the call of the countries in the region for peace and development, and instead preached the Cold War mentality in favor of confrontation between blocs, vilified China with defamatory accusations, and falsely labeled China as an 'threat''. China strongly rejected Hegseth's statements, calling them 'deplorable' and not in line with efforts to maintain stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Additionally, China accused the US of deploying offensive arms in the South China Sea, which, according to Beijing, is 'turning the region into a powder keg'. The Chinese Ministry of Defense also accused Washington of using the forum to 'fuel disputes, sow discord, and pursue selfish interests'. The tension between the two countries is increasing due to the constant clashes in the South China Sea, where China claims almost the entire area, including territories that overlap with the exclusive economic zones of several Southeast Asian countries. China emphasized that it has acted with 'good will and moderation' during multilateral talks, but accused 'external intervention' - referring to the US - of being the greatest risk to stability in those waters. Hegseth called on regional allies to increase their military spending, warning of the 'real and potentially imminent threat' posed by China. In line with this strategy, the US deployed Typhon launchers on the Philippine island of Luzón this year, capable of reaching targets in China and Russia. This deployment occurs within the framework of the historical defense ties between the US and the Philippines, a nation that also maintains an active dispute with China over islands and atolls in the South China Sea, leading to confrontations between their coast guards. Although China insists on its sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, an international arbitration tribunal ruled in 2016 that its claim lacks basis in international law, a ruling that Beijing has repeatedly rejected.

**China Warns US Not to 'Play with Fire' Over Taiwan**
China warned the US not to 'play with fire' over Taiwan, in response to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's accusations that Beijing is preparing an 'imminent' invasion of the island and seeking to alter the regional balance in Asia. 'The Taiwan issue is purely internal to China. No foreign country has the right to interfere,' said the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson in a statement issued after midnight. Beijing expressed its 'firm opposition' and 'deep discontent' with what it considered a 'provocative and inciting' speech by Hegseth, who on Saturday at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore warned that the Chinese military 'practices daily' a possible invasion of Taiwan and hinted at the supposed intention to do so before 2027. 'Let me be clear: any attempt by the Communist Party (Chinese) to conquer Taiwan by force will result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world (...) The Chinese threat is real. And it could be imminent,' emphasized the Pentagon chief. China also accused the US of fomenting confrontation between blocs, deploying offensive weapons in the South China Sea, and 'turning the region into a powder keg.' The spokesperson warned the US not to 'harbor illusions' about using the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China, and announced a formal protest had been lodged with Washington. 'China manages its differences through dialogue and in accordance with the law,' the spokesperson said.

**China Criticizes US Defense Secretary's Comments on Taiwan, Warns Against 'Playing with Fire'**
China has criticized US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's comments at the 'Shangri-La Dialogue' summit in Singapore on May 31, calling them 'insulting' and warning the US not to 'play with fire' regarding Taiwan. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Austin's comments, which referred to the Indo-Pacific region as a 'dangerous' area due to China's actions, were 'slanderous' and 'aimed at sowing discord'. The ministry also accused the US of 'ignoring the call for peace and development in the region' and instead promoting a 'Cold War mentality' that could lead to a 'block confrontation'. China's foreign ministry added that the US has deployed 'aggressive military equipment' in the South China Sea and 'continues to fan the flames' of tension in the Asia-Pacific region. The US has warned that any attempt by China to invade Taiwan would have 'devastating consequences'. China has reportedly increased its military capabilities to launch a surprise attack on Taiwan, with the Taiwanese Ministry of Defense predicting a possible invasion in 2027. Some analysts believe that China is sending its military to Ukraine to gain practical experience in modern warfare, with the aim of preparing for a potential invasion of Taiwan.

**China Accuses US of 'Playing with Fire' Over Taiwan Comments**
China has expressed its protest to the United States over the comments made by US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth at the 'Shangri-La Dialogue' summit in Singapore on May 31. The Chinese government considered Hegseth's statements 'insulting' and called on Washington 'not to play with fire' in the Taiwan issue. According to Reuters, China was unhappy with Hegseth's statement that the Indo-Pacific region is a dangerous place due to China's actions. Hegseth called on allies in the region, including key partner Australia, to spend more on defense, warning of a 'real and potentially inevitable' threat from Beijing. The Chinese Foreign Ministry called Hegseth's comments 'hurtful' and 'divisive', saying he had 'intentionally ignored the call for peace and development in the region and instead promoted a Cold War mentality of bloc confrontation, slandered China with false accusations, and falsely labeled China as a threat.' The ministry added that the US has deployed offensive weapons in the South China Sea and 'continues to pour oil on the fire,' creating tension in the Asia-Pacific region and 'turning it into a powder keg.' Hegseth had warned that any attempt by China to take Taiwan would have 'devastating consequences.' As reported by OBOZ.UA, China has increased its capabilities for a surprise attack on Taiwan, strengthening its air and missile forces, which are now 'ready to switch from peacetime to wartime at any moment.' The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense believes that a Chinese attack could occur in 2027. The US publication The Hill suggests that China is sending its military to Ukraine to gain practical experience in modern warfare, thus preparing its army for a possible invasion of Taiwan.

**China warns US 'not to play with fire' after Pentagon chief's Taiwan comments**
China warns US 'not to play with fire' after Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said Beijing is preparing to invade Taiwan and 'dominate and control' Asia. The diplomatic incident occurs at a time when the relationship between the two countries is tense on several fronts, including the ongoing trade war initiated by Donald Trump. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that the US 'should not try to use the Taiwan issue as a card to contain China and should not play with fire.' The statement added that China has lodged a formal protest with the US. Hegseth made the comments during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, where he said that China is 'preparing for the potential use of military force' to alter the balance of power in Asia, a region it wants to 'dominate and control.' He added that Chinese forces are improving their capabilities, training daily, to invade Taiwan. 'The threat that China represents is real and may be imminent,' Hegseth said, adding that Beijing 'hopes to dominate and control' Asia. 'It is public knowledge that Xi [Jinping, Chinese president] ordered his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. The People's Liberation Army is building its military to do this, training for it every day and rehearsing for real action.' The Chinese embassy in Singapore condemned Hegseth's speech, saying it was 'full of provocation and incitement.' The Chinese representative, Admiral Hu Gangfeng, denounced 'groundless accusations' that aim to 'sow problems, create divisions, incite conflicts and destabilize the Asia-Pacific region.'

**China Seeks to 'Dominate' Asia, Says US Pentagon Chief**
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that 'the threat posed by China is real and may be imminent' and added that 'it has demonstrated a desire to alter the status quo' in the region. Hegseth, the head of the Pentagon, warned on Saturday (May 31, 2025) that China is 'clearly and credibly preparing the potential use of military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific.' Beijing 'wants to dominate and control' Asia, Hegseth said at the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore, the most important security forum in Asia. 'The threat posed by China is real and may be imminent,' he added. Hegseth assured that his country 'does not seek a conflict with communist China, but will not be pushed out of this critical region of the Indo-Pacific.' 'China has demonstrated a desire to alter the status quo' in the region, Hegseth said, adding that 'we cannot look the other way and ignore it. It's a wake-up call and urgent,' he added, referring to Beijing's operations in the South China Sea and in Taiwan, an island governed by a government that does not rule out invading. Hegseth emphasized that 'China harasses Taiwan every day. It's public,' regarding its supposed intention to invade the island in 2027. When presenting his strategy to his allies in the region, he made a reference to the absence of the Chinese Defense Minister, Dong Jun, an unusual decision by Beijing. 'In fact, we are here this morning, and someone is not,' he highlighted, without directly referring to his Chinese counterpart.

**US Warns Allies of China's Growing Threat: 'Invading Taiwan in 2027'**
US Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, has warned allies not to 'look away' from the 'imminent risk' posed by China, which is investing in high-level nuclear arms and armament technology to 'invade Taiwan in 2027'. Hegseth has reiterated that China's attempts to conquer Taiwan 'by force' would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. China has warned the US that military aid to Taiwan increases the 'risk of conflict'. Hegseth has called for increased defense spending 'to prevent war, make the cost too high, and peace the only option'. Analysts interpret this as a signal from Washington to increase arms sales in Asia. Hegseth has also highlighted the 'risk' of economic dependence on China, which 'deepens its malign influence' globally. This comes as tensions rise, with China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, not attending the Singapore meeting, and instead sending a delegation from the National Defense University.

**Will there be a hot war between China and the United States? I think it's very likely**
The current situation between China and the United States is tense but not out of control. The two countries have been engaged in a trade war, technological competition, and geopolitical games, with the US imposing high tariffs on China and China fighting back. However, the leadership of both sides has shown some restraint. The potential conflict points include the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, where the US supports Taiwan and China has accelerated its military modernization. Despite the risks, economic interdependence, nuclear deterrence, and diplomatic mechanisms reduce the likelihood of direct conflict. The author believes that a hot war is not inevitable and that rational decision-making and communication can prevent the situation from getting out of control. Instead, the two countries may engage in continuous competition, unexpected escalation, or moderate coexistence. The author concludes that improved communication and multilateral cooperation are the keys to avoiding a hot war. 'It is a small probability event that there will be no hot war between China and the United States', according to some users on the X platform. However, the situation of 'fighting without breaking' is still the mainstream. 'A war in the Taiwan Strait will lead to huge losses for both sides and there is a risk of nuclear war', said US military generals. China is more likely to choose non-military means rather than full-scale invasion. 'A hot war will cause global supply chains to collapse, and semiconductor and rare earth disruptions will hit both sides hard', the author warned. 'A hot war will paralyze American military production', as China controls the global rare earth market. 'Neutral countries such as the European Union and India do not want a hot war between China and the United States, because it will trigger a global economic crisis', the author noted. 'Through cooperation with ASEAN and Europe, China is trying to weaken the US confrontational policy', the author added. 'The two countries may compete through trade wars, tech wars, and proxy conflicts, but avoid hot wars', the author predicted. 'China may exert economic pressure on Taiwan Province, while the United States will strengthen the military support of its allies', the author said. 'Restarting the military hotline and crisis communication mechanism can reduce the probability of unexpected escalation', the author suggested. 'Economic pressure may promote negotiations and achieve 'competitive coexistence'', the author believed. 'Trump has proposed nuclear arms control negotiations with China and Russia, showing room for cooperation', the author noted. 'Your concerns reflect hot-spot risks such as the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, but economics, nuclear deterrence and diplomacy set high barriers for conflict', the author concluded. 'Hot war is not inevitable, and rational decision-making and communication can prevent the situation from getting out of control', the author emphasized. 'Improved communication and multilateral cooperation are the keys to avoiding a hot war', the author concluded.

**China/US: The 'War' of the Powerful**
A fierce economic competition is brewing between China and the United States, with Africa being a key battleground. Observers predict that the confrontation between the two powers is entering a decisive phase, with a potential 'war of the powerful' on the horizon. The tensions between the two countries are disrupting global diplomacy and trade, and could even lead to a new Cold War. China has declared that its relations with the US have reached a 'low point', while the US has closed the Chinese consulate in Houston, calling it a 'spy nest'. China has retaliated by ordering the closure of a US consulate. The US views China as a threatening rival that must be contained, while China is confident that its economy will surpass that of the US by the end of the decade, becoming the world's largest economy. China is also accelerating its military modernization program, aiming to complete it by 2027, seven years ahead of schedule. Africa is becoming a key battleground in this duel, with both sides vying for influence and countering each other's rise. China is making its mark on African infrastructure, including the African Union headquarters, a symbol of the China-Africa relationship.

**US-China Rivalry: A Clash of Titans**
The United States and China, the world's two largest economies, are engaged in a trade war. The US has imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, while China has retaliated with 125% tariffs. The US has a significant trade deficit with China, with a deficit of $355 billion in 2024. The two countries are also rivals in the field of technology, with the US having given birth to the 'Gafam' (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft) and China having its own tech giants, the 'Batx' (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and Xiaomi). The US has also imposed a law requiring ByteDance to sell its US operations, including TikTok, due to concerns over data collection. The US is the world's largest military spender, with $916 billion spent in 2023, while China is second with $296 billion. The US and Russia possess nearly 90% of the world's nuclear arms, with China having significantly fewer. China has invested heavily in its space program, with plans to send a manned mission to the Moon by 2030. The US plans to return to the Moon by 2027 and send future missions to Mars.

**The War Between America and China: A Threat of Global War**
The United States has been at war with China, according to the book 'Project 2025' published by the Republican Party in 2023. The book mentions China 483 times and states that 'from afar, the greatest danger to American security, freedom, and prosperity is China... China seeks to achieve a dominant position in Asia and, based on this position, global domination.' The US has been trying to weaken Russia in order to eventually submit China, but the cooperation between Russia and China has complicated this ambition. Donald Trump is quoted as saying that 'Russia, probably tired of the conditions imposed by China in exchange for its support, entered into negotiations with a double risk: it could lose China's support, but it also hoped that China would increase its support without condition.' The article concludes that the conflict between the US and China, and the alliance between Russia and China, represents a dangerous threat of a global war.

**US-China Conflict Takes a Dark Turn: Mhoni Vidente's Pandemic Prediction Sparks Controversy**
According to astrologer Mhoni Vidente, the conflict between the US and China could take an unexpected and terrible turn. In a YouTube video, Vidente claimed that China could send a new pandemic to the US by the end of 2025 or 2026. 'It's visualized that China will send a pandemic to the US, it will be by the end of this year or in 2026. They will send it through technology, through cell phones. They will be extracting the viruses, and when people come into contact, they will start to get infected,' Vidente said. The prediction has sparked controversy, suggesting a biological attack through technological devices. Although there is no scientific evidence to support this theory, the claim has sparked debate on social media. Meanwhile, China has warned that the ongoing trade war will not only harm their economy but also have severe consequences for the US. The escalation of tariffs, trade restrictions, and technological sanctions has turned this dispute into a high-risk confrontation that could destabilize global trade. China has made it clear that their reprisals will not only affect large US corporations but also consumers and small businesses. The application of tariffs on key products, such as soybeans, semiconductors, and technology products, could increase prices and reduce the competitiveness of US companies in the global market. 'If what the US wants is a war, whether it's a tariff war, a commercial war, or any other type of war, we are ready to fight to the end,' said the Chinese embassy in the US, quoting a statement from the Chinese government issued on March 4.

**Taiwan Warns of Potential War with China in 2027**
A potential war between Taiwan and China may start in 2027, according to a document published by Bloomberg. The document, intended to inform Taiwanese lawmakers about future military drills, mentions the year as a possible date for a Chinese attack. '2027 is a way to overcome the contradictions in the Taiwanese parliament, where opposition parties reject military spending plans,' said Jack Chen, director of the Formosa Defense Vision rights group. Chen added that it could pressure the opposition to feel that increasing the military budget is a pressing need. A marker of China's readiness for an attack on Taiwan is Chinese leader Xi Jinping's demand to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to 'become more modern' by 2027 and a world-class army by 2047. Additionally, US officials have warned Taiwan about the threat of a 2027 invasion: by that time, China plans to increase the number of fighter jets, military ships, and double its stockpiles of conventional ballistic and cruise missiles. 'Chinese forces are conducting aggressive military exercises around Taiwan, and the official rhetoric from Beijing is full of threats against the island,' the Bloomberg journalists added. Taiwan considers itself an independent state, while China sees it as a breakaway province. Taiwan has its own constitution, army, and elected government. The island complains that Beijing is increasingly conducting missions near Taiwan, and Chinese fighter jets frequently violate Taiwan's air defense zone.

**US-China 'War in 2025': Memo Warns of Potential Conflict**
A memo signed by US General Michael A. Minihan, commander of the Air Mobility Command, has been sent to troops under his command, warning of a potential war between the US and China in 2025. The memo, first reported by NBC News, cites Chinese President Xi Jinping's ambitions and the possibility of the US being distracted by its own elections in 2024. Minihan wrote, 'I hope I'm wrong. My instinct tells me we will fight in 2025. Xi has secured his third term and created the Central Military Commission in October 2022. Taiwan's presidential elections are in 2024 and will give Xi a reason. The US presidential elections are in 2024 and will give Xi an America distracted.' A spokesperson for the Air Force, Major Hope Cronin, confirmed the memo's authenticity, stating that it is based on the Air Mobility Command's efforts to prepare the Air Force for future conflicts. However, a Defense Department official, speaking anonymously, said that Minihan's comments do not represent the department's view on China.

US Air Force General Mike Minihan predicted a possible war with China in 2025, stating 'I hope I'm wrong. My instinct tells me I'll be fighting in 2025.' In a memo sent to his officers in January 2023, Minihan warned of an impending conflict and advised them to 'aim for the head' of targets for greater lethality. However, two years later, tensions between the US and China remain high, but there is no indication of an open conflict. The US Department of Defense has stated that Minihan's comments do not represent the organization's view on China. Minihan has since retired from the military in September 2024, and his predictions are now considered personal opinions.

China is preparing for a large-scale war, including the possibility of using nuclear warheads, according to Colonel Philip Ingram, a retired British Army officer. China is building a new military command center near Beijing, which is ten times larger than the Pentagon, and is increasing its military presence in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Ingram stated that China is preparing its military, increasing its armed forces, and building up its naval and air forces. China is also stockpiling food, oil, gas, precious minerals, iron, and steel, in preparation for a potential conflict. Ingram emphasized that China is preparing for war, without any 'ifs' or 'buts'. He warned that a conflict between China and the US would have a global impact, and that the world would be at risk of a nuclear war. China is increasing its nuclear arsenal, with 100 new warheads added in 2024, and potentially over 1,000 by 2030. The US is reviewing its nuclear policy towards China in response. 'China is preparing for war, full stop, without any 'ifs' or 'buts', said Ingram. 'This is a very dangerous game for China, as it would lead to a mutually assured destruction, which has prevented nuclear war since 1945.'

**The AI Conflict Between the US and China: Who Will Win?**
The global technological conflict between the United States and China has escalated, with the two nations competing for technological supremacy. The conflict has taken on a more overt form, with the US imposing restrictions on Chinese tech companies, including Huawei and ZTE. The Biden administration has maintained many of Trump's policies towards China, including the imposition of wide-ranging export controls on advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment in late 2022. Trump has stated that the 'DeepMind' model is a 'wake-up call' for American companies, urging them to 'focus sharply on competition to win.' China's strategy to develop AI is not a coincidence, but rather a deliberate plan. The country's 2017 plan for developing the next generation of AI included a three-stage strategy for developing AI and its applications in the country. The Chinese government has also issued guidelines such as 'Accelerating the Innovation of Scenario-based AI to Promote High-level AI Applications for High-quality Economic Development' in 2022, which emphasizes the integration of AI technologies across sectors to facilitate sustainable economic growth. China has also presented 'Guidelines for Building a Comprehensive National AI Industry System' in 2024, aiming to promote a unified AI industry system through the establishment of more than 50 new national and industrial standards. China has set itself as a global leader in AI, with its AI industry exceeding $70 billion and developing over 4,300 companies that have contributed to a series of achievements. The Chinese government aims to become the main center of technological innovation by expanding its basic AI industry to over $140 billion by 2030 and increasing the value of related sectors to $1.4 trillion during the same period.
