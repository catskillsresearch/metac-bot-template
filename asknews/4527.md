**RBC sees S&P 500 likely falling from current levels by year-end**
RBC Capital has revised its year-end 2025 S&P 500 target to 5,730, up from 5,550, but warns that the index is likely to decline from current levels. According to RBC analysts, 'We expect the path of stocks to be choppy through year-end,' citing a wide range of potential outcomes and growing downside risks. The firm sees a broad range of possible outcomes by year-end, from a bull case of 6,400 to a bear case as low as 4,200-4,500. RBC's models factor in inflation in the upper 2% range, three Federal Reserve cuts starting in September, and real GDP growth of 1.3% for the year. However, the firm warns that rising 10-year yields or disappointing economic data could shift sentiment rapidly. RBC described its stance as 'rather neutral,' emphasizing that 'current pricing in the S&P 500 already reflects the step-up improvement in macro fundamentals.' Still, risks including policy uncertainty and weaker consumer sentiment could drive a correction before year-end.

**Here's the Average Stock Market Return Over the Last 10 Years | The Motley Fool**
The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite have moved sideways in 2025, with the S&P 500 advancing less than 1%, the Dow Jones declining less than 1%, and the Nasdaq Composite declining about 1% year to date. However, over the last 10 years, the S&P 500 returned 235%, the Dow Jones returned 193%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 314%. This translates to an average annual return of 12.8% for the S&P 500, 11.3% for the Dow Jones, and 15.2% for the Nasdaq Composite. For example, investing $150 weekly in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF would be worth $142,200 in 10 years, while investing in the Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF would be worth $159,900 in a decade.

**RBC lifts S&P 500 year-end target to 5,730 points**
RBC has raised its year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 index to 5,730 points, citing a modestly improved U.S. economic outlook and stronger-than-expected corporate earnings. This is the third time RBC has revised its target for the index this year. According to RBC strategists, 'Our new price target reflects our belief that the stock market is on a slightly better path than the one that we were on in early April, but not back to where it was in January or mid March.' RBC maintained its earnings-per-share forecast for the index at $258, lower than the consensus forecast of $264 for this year.

**US stocks see sliggish moves on Friday**
US stocks ended the month of May 2025 on a sluggish note due to trade concerns resurfacing after US President Donald Trump accused China of violating the trade agreement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DOW) added 54.34 points or 0.13% to finish at 42,270.07, while the NASDAQ eased 62.11 points or 0.32% to close at 19,113.77. The S&P 500 index fell 0.48 points or 0.01% to end at 5,911.69. A report by the Commerce Department showed consumer prices in the US crept slightly higher in April, with the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index inching up by 0.1% and the annual rate of growth slowing to 2.1%. The core PCE price index also crept up by 0.1% and eased to an annual rate of growth of 2.5%. The soft US PCE reading weighed on the US dollar index and pulled down treasury yields.

**RBC Capital Markets Adjusts S&P 500 Year-End Target Amid Market**
RBC Capital Markets strategists, led by Lori Calvasina, have increased their year-end target for the S&P 500 index from 5550 to 5730 points, citing better-than-expected market performance. However, they caution that the path forward remains 'bumpy.' Their models show a range of potential outcomes, with the S&P 500 potentially reaching 6400 points in a bullish scenario or around 5500 points in a more conservative model. The bank notes the lack of economic tailwinds and anticipates that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates until September, contributing to their neutral stance on small-cap stocks compared to large-cap stocks.

**Wall Street week ahead-jobs data, tax bill, trade on tap for rebounding US stocks**
Investors are bracing for a busy week ahead, with key US economic data, tax bill developments, and trade twists set to influence equities. The S&P 500 ended the week with a gain, and the Nasdaq Composite surged 9.6% in May, its biggest monthly increase since November 2023. Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said, 'Now that we're back up here not all that far from the record high, I think the hard data needs to hold in better than the market expects to really advance from here.' The employment report for May is expected to show an increase of 130,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll of economists. However, an overly strong employment report could delay interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp. The Senate will start considering a tax-and-spending bill passed earlier this month by the House of Representatives, which has added an estimated $3.8 trillion to the federal government's $36.2 trillion in debt over the next decade.

**Wall Street drifts toward the end of what may be its best month since 2023**
The stock market is drifting towards the end of what may be its best month since 2023. The S&P 500 was down 0.2% in morning trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13 points, or less than 0.1%, as of 10:10 a.m. Eastern time. The Nasdaq composite was 0.5% lower. Despite the mixed performance, the market is on track for a strong month, with the S&P 500 potentially reaching its best month since 2023. The market's performance is a reflection of the overall economic conditions, which are expected to remain stable in the coming months. However, investors are cautious and are waiting for more clarity on the economic outlook before making any major decisions.

**Morgan Stanley Maintains S&P 500 Forecast at 6,500 Points**
Morgan Stanley analysts maintain their year-end forecast for the S&P 500 index at 6,500 points, indicating a growth of over 11% compared to the market close on May 22. According to Michael Wilson, the bank's chief US equity strategist, 'Although we were surprised by the scale and speed of the tariff-related pressure in the first half of the year, our view on the sequence of events has not changed.' The analysts believe that the stock market, which declined after the US imposed large tariffs on imports in April 2025, has already hit bottom. However, there are still several factors putting pressure on the market, including the rapid rise in long-term government bond yields, which is currently the biggest concern for investors, Wilson notes. Nevertheless, he says that markets are likely to focus on more positive prospects, such as tax cuts and deregulation, which could be a stimulus for growth. 'In the second half of this year and in 2026, we expect a more constructive environment,' Wilson said. The 30-year US Treasury yield surged to 5.15% on May 22, a record high since October 2023, following the US House of Representatives' approval of President Donald Trump's budget proposal, which includes tax cuts and increased spending.

**Yardeni Research Lowers S&P 500 Target to 6,400 Points**
Yardeni Research has lowered its 'best-case' target for the S&P 500 to 6,400 points by the end of 2025, down from 7,000 points. Despite the revision, Yardeni's forecast remains relatively optimistic, suggesting the index could close around 8% higher than at the start of the year. However, this is a weaker outlook than the previous forecast, which predicted an 18% annual gain. Yardeni notes that the economy is being tested by 'massive' trade turbulence and the 'radical' spending cuts under Trump 2.0. 'We continue to bet on the resilience of the economy,' Yardeni writes, 'but we acknowledge that it is currently being put to the test.' Yardeni previously predicted the S&P 500 could reach 10,000 points by the end of the decade, saying 'the animal instincts are back.' However, Yardeni now admits to underestimating Trump's commitment to tariffs: 'The biggest surprise may be that President Donald Trump has not been bluffing or exaggerating when he said he loves tariffs,' Yardeni writes.

**J.P. Morgan Analysts Express Concern Over US Stock Performance**
Analysts at J.P. Morgan have expressed concern about the performance of US stocks in the second half of this year, and it may take Wall Street some time to reach the end-of-year target for 2025 set by the bank. According to a memo from the American lender, analysts are maintaining their end-of-year target for the S&P 500 index at 6500 points, but there is a significant error margin in this estimate. The memo states that the index may not reach this level until 2026, as reported by MarketWatch.

**Morgan Stanley Warns of Falling Short on S&P 500 Year-End Target**
Morgan Stanley strategists have warned that their initial prediction of a 6500-point year-end target for the S&P 500 index may be at risk of falling short. Despite maintaining the target, they warned that it comes with a 'larger standard error'. The team, led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, stated that the S&P 500 index may not reach this level until 2026, citing economic data volatility and a potential slowdown in economic growth. The team also predicted that the index may fluctuate between 5200 and 6000 points in the short term, with individual stocks experiencing high levels of differentiation. They expect the market to rebound later in the year.
