**Jerome Powell Rated 'Excellent' Or 'Good' By Most Retail Traders Amid Trump's Sharp Attacks On Fed Chief By Stocktwits**
A recent Stocktwits poll found that 56% of 14,000 users graded Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's performance as 'excellent' or 'good', with 32% rating it as 'excellent' and 24% as 'average'. Some users defended Powell, saying he has kept inflation down and unemployment low, while others criticized him for being 'six to eight months behind the curve'. Despite President Trump's criticism, Powell has maintained a steady stance, and fund manager Louis Navellier believes the Fed may cut rates if tariffs cause a recession. However, with a potential trade deal on the horizon, the economy may regain momentum, and Charlie Ripley, Senior Investment Strategist for Allianz, thinks the Fed will remain patient and data-dependent. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for June 17-18, with an 85.8% probability of an unchanged stance.

**Trump and Powell: A Tense Relationship Over Interest Rates**
US President Donald Trump has been pressuring Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates to mitigate the effects of the tariffs he has imposed. However, Powell has stated that the repeated criticism from Trump does not affect their work. Trump has called Powell an 'immense loser' and has suggested that the White House should have a say in monetary policy. This tension between Trump and Powell dates back to Trump's first term, when he nominated Powell to head the Fed. Since then, Trump has repeatedly called for lower interest rates, while Powell has maintained that there is no urgency to do so. The situation has become more complicated as the US-China trade war has escalated, with Powell warning of potential inflationary effects. Trump has even suggested that Powell's term should end early, but Powell has stated that he intends to stay in office until the end of his term in 2026.

**Powell's Delay: Is the Fed Too Late to Act?**
Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman, is facing criticism for not acting quickly enough to address the economic challenges. Some economists believe that Powell has a strong chance of being labeled as 'too late' due to the unique set of challenges he faces in achieving the Fed's dual mandate of full employment and low inflation. Powell has a history of being slow to act, and his decision not to lower interest rates despite rising inflation has been criticized. Trump has been calling for lower interest rates, but Powell has refused to make any 'preemptive' cuts, citing the uncertainty of the economic outlook. Experts believe that the Fed is often slow to act, and Powell's decision to do nothing may be the right move in this case. However, others argue that the Fed's inaction may be a repeat of past mistakes, and that Powell's delay may ultimately prove costly.

**Grant Cardone Says Jerome Powell Is 'Antagonistic To Trump Administration,' Claims He Might Be Trying To Block Trump's Pro-Business Agenda**
Grant Cardone, CEO of Cardone Capital, has accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of being 'antagonistic to the Trump administration' and potentially trying to block the president's pro-business agenda. Cardone claims that Powell's approach is 'always reactionary, never proactive' and that tons of economic data support immediate rate cuts. He points to signs such as a slowdown in U.S. GDP, weak home sales, and a global economic downturn. Cardone also suggests that Powell's reluctance to lower rates might be politically motivated, saying that Powell 'appears antagonistic to Trump Administration and Trump's goal to renegotiate international deals via tariffs.'

**Donald Trump's Criticism of Jerome Powell: A Threat to the Federal Reserve's Independence?**
US President Donald Trump has been critical of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, calling for his removal and criticizing his handling of interest rates. Trump has argued that Powell's policies have been too tight and have contributed to a slowdown in the economy. Powell has maintained that he is not influenced by Trump's criticism and that he has the authority to make decisions independently. However, the situation has raised concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve and the potential for political interference in its decisions. Economists have warned that if Trump's influence over the Fed continues, it could lead to a loss of confidence in the institution and potentially higher interest rates. Trump's criticism of Powell is not unprecedented, as he has also been critical of the Fed's handling of interest rates during his first term. However, the current situation is seen as a departure from the traditional deference shown to the Fed by previous presidents. The situation has sparked a debate about the role of the Fed and the potential consequences of political interference in its decisions.

**Fed holds interest rates steady, defying pressure from Trump**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has decided to keep interest rates steady, defying pressure from President Trump. Speaking at a press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the economy remains in 'solid shape' but warned that Trump's tariff policy could cause higher inflation and an economic slowdown. Powell shrugged off criticism from Trump, stating that the Fed's decision is based solely on economic data and not influenced by the president's opinions. The move marks the Fed's second consecutive decision to maintain the current level of interest rates. Powell noted that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen, but pointed to solid economic performance as a reason to take a patient approach. Despite this, recession fears are mounting on Wall Street as Trump's tariffs threaten to upend global trade. The U.S. gross domestic product declined at a 0.3% annualized rate over three months ending in March, according to government data.
