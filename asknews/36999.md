**Elon Musk Offers Free Internet: Starlink to Connect Smartphones Without Cost Until July 2025**
Elon Musk announced that some smartphone models will be able to connect to the Starlink satellite internet network for free until July 2025. This initiative aims to eliminate barriers to internet access in rural, remote, or areas with poor infrastructure, allowing more people to connect without relying on traditional mobile phone networks. Starlink, developed by SpaceX, has been recognized for its ability to provide connectivity in areas where terrestrial networks do not reach. The new feature will allow users in remote areas without access to traditional mobile networks to send text messages, share their location, and even contact emergency services without the need for a nearby mobile phone tower. This improvement will make a significant difference in rural areas and other remote regions where internet connections are limited or non-existent. However, not all devices will have access to this free service, and it will depend on the device model and software update installed. 'T-Mobile SpaceX' will appear on the screen when the phone connects to the Starlink satellite network. It is essential to note that devices must have the latest software version installed to access this network. Initially, this connectivity will only allow text messaging, location sharing, and emergency service contact. In a second phase, the functionality is expected to expand to include voice calls and internet navigation, increasing the utility of the Starlink network.

**Starlink Expansion: US Government Plays Key Role in Promoting Satellite Internet**
The Starlink satellite internet network, developed by SpaceX under Elon Musk's guidance, is rapidly expanding. According to an investigation by the Washington Post, the US government is playing a key role in this expansion by pressuring foreign governments to accelerate the necessary authorizations. The Department of State and some US embassies are reportedly exerting diplomatic pressure to promote Starlink in various countries. While no direct promises are being made in exchange for concessions, some governments, such as India, have seen an opportunity to strengthen their economic ties with Washington. India has indeed approved a license that formally opens the doors to Starlink. Other countries, such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Somalia, Lesotho, Vietnam, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are also making progress in the authorization process for the American satellite service. The prospect of connecting even the most isolated areas through satellite internet represents a concrete opportunity for development. The White House has confirmed its interest in supporting US companies abroad, but denies any intention of favoritism. However, some Democratic senators have requested an official investigation, raising doubts about Elon Musk's potential influence on US foreign policy to benefit his own companies. The concerns are based on the Washington Post's revelations, which suggest an ambiguous entanglement between private interests and international policy decisions. SpaceX has chosen to remain silent, leaving the evolution of Starlink's global expansion to be seen.

**Starlink Waiting Lists in Argentina: What's Happening with Elon Musk's Satellite Internet**
The demand for Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet service, has exceeded the available capacity in areas such as the AMBA and Córdoba, resulting in a waiting list for new users. Even those who have already purchased the installation kit cannot activate their connection immediately. This is because the satellite network is saturated in these regions, and Starlink blocks new activations to maintain the quality of service for existing customers. The waiting list system allows users to register for access when space becomes available, either due to expanded coverage or users leaving the service. According to Starlink's official availability map, the following areas have waiting lists in May 2025: The company offers two main alternatives for users: mobile or maritime plans, which have different technical conditions and higher prices. Existing customers are not affected. There is no confirmed date for the end of the waiting lists in saturated areas, as it depends on factors such as the launch rate of new satellites, the expansion of terrestrial infrastructure, and the evolution of demand in each region. Starlink has applied similar restrictions in other parts of the world, such as the US, Canada, and Europe, and has restored availability in some cases by reinforcing the satellite network. However, in high-concentration areas like the AMBA, the situation may persist if more technical resources are not added. In areas where Starlink is not available, users may consider other technologies with different characteristics.

**The End of Airplane Mode: Starlink's Satellite Internet Service Takes Flight**
The launch of Starlink's satellite internet service is expected to mark the end of the 'airplane mode' as we know it, but it's not all smooth sailing. According to Hawaiian Airlines, the service will be available on their flights starting from summer 2025. However, as The Verge notes, 'free Wi-Fi for all has its limits.' With thousands of satellites in low Earth orbit, Starlink can offer high-speed internet access, including in remote areas and in the air. But, it's not a guarantee that everything will be possible on board. As The Verge says, 'it's not all sunshine and rainbows' when it comes to in-flight internet.

**Donald Trump's Starlink Deal: A Form of 'Cynical Mercantilism'?**
According to a Washington Post investigation, dozens of poor countries are being forced to prove their loyalty to the US by purchasing tech products from Elon Musk's company, Starlink. The Lesotho, one of the poorest countries in the world, has signed a contract with Starlink to provide WiFi to its 2 million inhabitants at a high cost. An internal State Department message confirms that 'the Lesotho, while negotiating a commercial agreement with the US, hopes that the Starlink contract will demonstrate its good faith and desire to welcome American businesses.' This move is seen as a form of 'cynical mercantilism' and a demonstration of the US's 'mafia-like' business practices.

**Starlink Enters Somalia: A New Frontier for Satellite Internet**
Elon Musk's company Starlink has received a license to operate in Somalia, a country known for its high piracy rates. The company has already received approval to operate in several African countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. Starlink's satellite internet services are expected to benefit businesses in Somalia, although the cost of the service is not yet clear. In India, Starlink has partnered with Jio and Airtel to offer its services, but the service is not yet commercially available due to security concerns. Starlink has also been approved to operate in Bangladesh and Pakistan, but Pakistan has banned Elon Musk's X platform. The company's services are expected to bring high-speed internet to areas where fiber services are not available. Experts expect Starlink's services to be launched in India this year, pending spectrum distribution.

**Elon Musk's Starlink Obtains License in Somalia**
Elon Musk announced on Sunday, April 13, that he has obtained a license for his Starlink satellite network in Somalia, one of the poorest countries in the world where only a third of the population has access to the internet. 'Starlink is in Somalia', Musk said on his X network, without providing further details. The Somali Press Agency, Sonna, welcomed the news, saying, 'This is a historic day for the communication and technology sector in Somalia. We have granted Starlink, one of the major internet and telecommunications satellite services, an operating license.' The license was granted after two years of discussion. Currently, around 30% of Somalia's 18 million inhabitants have access to the internet, according to World Bank figures from 2022, but the connection is often disrupted by the poor state of infrastructure. Starlink, which has been operational for several years, has over 6,750 satellites in orbit and claims to have more than 5 million subscribers.
