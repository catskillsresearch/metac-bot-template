**Contract Worker Dies in Accident at Taean Nuclear Power Plant**
A 50-year-old contract worker, identified as Kim Mo, died on June 2, 2025, while working at the Taean Nuclear Power Plant in South Korea. The incident occurred in the mechanical workshop, where Kim was operating a cutting machine when he was struck by a rotating workpiece. According to police, Kim was working alone at the time of the accident and was handling a different type of workpiece than usual. The police and labor authorities are investigating the cause of the accident and will conduct an autopsy to determine the exact circumstances. The police are also reviewing the application of relevant laws, including the Industrial Safety and Health Act and the Severe Punishment for Industrial Accidents Act. The labor union has expressed its intention to actively participate in the investigation and to find the cause of the accident to prevent similar incidents in the future. This is the second time in six years that a worker has died at the Taean Nuclear Power Plant, following the death of Kim Yong-kyun in 2018. The Democratic Labor Party has called for the regularization of irregular workers and the strengthening of the Severe Punishment for Industrial Accidents Act to prevent such incidents. 'The accident scene is unrelated to the power plant equipment,' said a spokesperson for the West Power Plant, adding that they will cooperate fully with the police and labor authorities' investigation. 'The police are investigating the existence and compliance of safety guidelines in the workplace, the exact nature of the work being done at the time of the accident, and any differences from the usual work being done,' said a police spokesperson. 'We will review the application of relevant laws, including the Industrial Safety and Health Act and the Severe Punishment for Industrial Accidents Act, based on the results of the investigation.'

**Democratic Labor Party and Labor Party Condemn Repetition of 'Kim Yong-kyun Incident'**
The Democratic Labor Party and the Labor Party have issued emergency statements condemning the repetition of the 'Kim Yong-kyun incident' six years after the original incident. On June 2, a fatal accident occurred at the Taean Thermal Power Plant, where irregular worker Kim Yong-kyun died, prompting the progressive parties to issue emergency statements. The Democratic Labor Party's Chungnam Provincial Committee stated, 'Last month, many workers and citizens gathered to say, 'Even if the coal-fired power plant is closed, workers' lives will not be closed.' We thought of Kim Yong-kyun and demanded that irregular workers be regularized, and that the working environment be improved so that workers can work without dying.' However, they emphasized, 'But the outsourcing of death has not stopped. Workers have not escaped the anxiety of being laid off and the fear of death.' They demanded △strengthening of the Major Accidents Punishment Act △regularization of irregular workers as promised by the Moon Jae-in government △expansion of public renewable energy to ensure full employment, and so on. The Labor Party also issued a statement saying, 'How many more Kim Yong-gyuns will we kill?' They said, 'If we had punished those responsible for Kim Yong-kyun's death properly, and made a safer power plant, today's death would not have occurred. Today's death could have been avoided if the worker had been able to go home after a day's work. It is not inevitable for many workers to die while working in Korean society.' They argued, 'We can reduce major accidents by preventing more and punishing those responsible more severely. We will closely watch how Korea Western Power handles this incident, which did not take responsibility or punishment for Kim Yong-kyun's death. We will strongly push for a struggle to reveal the exact cause of this death and punish those responsible.'

**Debunking Common Misconceptions about Nuclear Power**
There are misconceptions about nuclear power, such as the idea that a nuclear accident is catastrophic. However, the only nuclear accident where radiation caused deaths was the Chernobyl disaster. South Korea does not have a nuclear power plant like Chernobyl, where the output was out of control or the containment building was not present. Therefore, it is unlikely that a similar accident will occur in South Korea. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster showed that the plant can withstand earthquakes but is vulnerable to flooding. South Korean nuclear power plants are designed to withstand earthquakes and flooding, and their containment buildings are five times larger than those at Fukushima. While it is possible for machines to fail and people to make mistakes, the probability of a nuclear accident is low. If Fukushima had a containment building like South Korea's, radioactive materials would not have leaked out and hydrogen explosions would not have occurred. The Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear accident in the US is an example that supports this claim. Although a nuclear accident occurred at TMI, radioactive materials did not leak out of the containment building, and there was no significant radiation leakage. Therefore, Jimmy Carter, the then-US President, visited the site without wearing a mask. TMI is similar to South Korea's Yonggwang nuclear power plant. The TMI 1 reactor, which was shut down in 2019, will be restarted in 2028 to supply power to Microsoft's data center. The cost of decommissioning a nuclear power plant and managing spent nuclear fuel is often misunderstood. However, these costs are already included in the cost of nuclear power generation. In 2024, the average cost of nuclear power generation in South Korea was 66 won per kWh, while the cost of electricity from solar and wind power was around 210 won per kWh. Nuclear power generation is not only cost-effective but also environmentally friendly. The claim that spent nuclear fuel can kill people or remain hazardous for 10,000 years is also an exaggeration. Spent nuclear fuel is currently stored in cylindrical containers above ground and can be seen at the Wolseong nuclear power plant. The radiation level near the containers is lower than that in Seoul. If the spent nuclear fuel is buried underground, it is not a significant risk. In fact, the cost of burying spent nuclear fuel is not a major concern, but rather the difficulty of securing a site for burial. For example, the 27,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel from South Korea's nuclear power plants can be buried in a 500-meter thick underground rock formation, which already contains 80,000 tons of uranium and 160,000 tons of thorium. The cost of dealing with a nuclear accident is often exaggerated. The cost of dealing with the TMI accident was around 300 billion won, which is equivalent to the cost of generating 2,000 billion won worth of electricity through nuclear power. The cost of managing spent nuclear fuel is also not a significant concern, as it is already included in the cost of nuclear power generation. South Korea has been accumulating a significant amount of funds for post-accident management, which is higher than that of Sweden, France, and the US. The claim that nuclear power plants cannot be built near cities is also an exaggeration. There are already research reactors operating in the middle of Boston and Cambridge, near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Similarly, small modular nuclear reactors can be built near cities without any significant concerns. Large nuclear power plants can also be built near cities if the site is available and the cooling system is secure. The only reason why large nuclear power plants are not built near cities is that it is more expensive than building them near the coast. However, there are already nuclear power plants operating near cities, such as the one located 95 kilometers upstream of the Seine River in Paris.

**Lee backs nuclear power - for now**
Presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being' but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables like offshore wind to supply industrial hubs and aims to phase out coal by 2040. He supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' In contrast, Lee's main rival Kim Moon-soo supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60% of the mix. South Korea's latest energy blueprint aims for nuclear to make up 35% of the power mix by 2038, with renewables at 29%. If elected, Lee is expected to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30% of the power mix by 2030.

**Korean Atomic Bomb Victims' Concert: A Call for Peace and Hope**
This year marks the 80th anniversary of Korea's liberation and the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, the history of the atomic bombing is not one-dimensional. The Soviet Union's involvement in the war had a greater impact on Japan's surrender, and the use of atomic bombs led to the division of Korea, a victim nation, rather than Japan, the aggressor. Korea is the second-largest victim of atomic bombing in the world, with 70,000 people affected and 31,000 killed. Among them, 100,000 Koreans were exposed to radiation, with 50,000 killed. Many survivors returned to their homeland, but many died sooner than Japanese survivors. Korean atomic bomb victims have experienced a 'triple hardship' of forced labor, radiation exposure, and neglect. The Korea Anti-Nuclear Peace Citizens' League and the Peace Tree Chorus are hosting a concert titled 'I am an atomic bomb victim: embracing peace, spreading hope!' on June 10th at the Korean Buddhist Cultural History Museum in Seoul. The concert will feature four parts, including songs about the pain of radiation exposure, nostalgia for their hometown, and a commitment to nuclear disarmament. The event is part of the 14th International Anti-Nuclear Peace Festival, which will be held on August 5th in Hapcheon. The festival aims to comfort atomic bomb victims and their descendants and to strive for a nuclear-free world. 'We hope that many victims will overcome despair and pass on hope,' said the organizers. 'We will work towards a world where all nuclear weapons, nuclear power plants, and nuclear materials are abolished.'

**North Korea Warns of Nuclear War in Space Amid Rising Tensions**
North Korea has warned that the US may spark a nuclear war in space, reigniting alarm in the international community. The warning comes as tensions between nations and the arms race reach concerning levels. The North Korean government criticizes the US's Golden Dome defense program, which it sees as a dangerous threat that could turn space into a nuclear battlefield. This rhetoric reflects the bellicose tone characteristic of the Kim Jong-un regime and highlights the challenges faced by the international system in containing nuclear proliferation. The Golden Dome program, announced by Trump on May 20, 2025, is an ambitious missile defense system based on a set of satellites and space-based arms designed to intercept ballistic attacks against the US. However, this initiative has generated a chain reaction among rival powers. China has pointed out that the program increases the risk of space becoming a battlefield, fuels an arms race, and undermines international security. The North Korean government aligns with this stance and accuses the US of seeking to impose its hegemony through this technology. North Korea has intensified its efforts to strengthen its nuclear and ballistic missile arsenal. According to a 2025 report by the US Defense Intelligence Agency, North Korea has approximately 50 nuclear warheads and a dozen intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching any point in the US. In June 2024, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested three independently guided warheads, although South Korea questioned the validity of this test, suggesting that the missile exploded in mid-air. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) documented a concerning increase in global military spending, reaching $2.71 trillion in 2024, a 9.4% increase from the previous year, the largest annual increase since 1988. This growth is driven by conflicts such as those in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as geopolitical tensions in Europe and Asia. According to SIPRI, the five countries with the highest military spending - the US, China, Russia, Germany, and India - represent 60% of the total, with a combined spending of $1.635 trillion. The US, with a 5.7% increase in its military budget in 2024, leads the ranking with 37% of global spending, followed by China, which increased its military budget by 7%. In Europe, rearmament is particularly notable, with a 155% increase in arms imports between the periods 2015-2019 and 2020-2024, largely in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine has become the world's largest importer of heavy arms in this period, with a nearly 100-fold increase in its external purchases compared to the period 2015-2019. Israel also increased its military spending by 65%, the highest since 1967 (reflecting the intensity of the conflict in Gaza and the conflict with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon). The UN has tried to curb North Korea's nuclear program through sanctions and Security Council resolutions for decades. However, Pyongyang continued its missile tests in violation of these measures, including short-range ballistic missile launches in May 2025, which, according to South Korea, could be intended to test arms for export, possibly to Russia. The UN Security Council has repeatedly condemned these actions, but the lack of consensus among its permanent members, particularly between the US and China, weakens the effectiveness of these sanctions. The North Korean warning is set against a backdrop of growing military cooperation with Russia. In April 2025, North Korea confirmed the dispatch of 14,000 soldiers to Russia to support its war in Ukraine. Some analysts suggest that this cooperation could be rewarded with transfers of armament technology from Moscow, complicating US and allied efforts to counter threats on multiple fronts. It appears that the UN will need to implement a new approach to address nuclear proliferation, but this requires overcoming the divisions between the great powers. Meanwhile, the US's Golden Dome program could accelerate the militarization of space, a site that has been relatively free of direct conflicts until now.

**North Korea's Nuclear Threat: A Catastrophic Scenario**
North Korea possesses approximately 50-100 nuclear warheads, according to various estimates. If all of these nuclear warheads were dropped on Seoul, the damage would be unimaginably enormous, with millions of deaths and injuries expected. A 20kt nuclear warhead explosion would result in approximately 114,000 deaths and 534,000 casualties, while a 100kt hydrogen bomb explosion would result in a total of 2 million casualties, including 360,000 instant deaths. A 250kt hydrogen bomb explosion would result in 780,000 deaths and 2.77 million injuries. The author, Moon Il-suk, emphasizes the need for a strong response to North Korea's nuclear threat, including strengthening the ROK-US alliance and developing independent nuclear capabilities. He also notes that the current situation is extremely dangerous and that a clear response from the presidential candidates is necessary to address the issue.

**South Korea's Nuclear Dilemma: Experts Debate the Possibility of Developing Nuclear Weapons**
A recent conference in the Korean National Assembly discussed the possibility of South Korea developing nuclear weapons to counter the threat from North Korea. Experts at the conference argued that South Korea is the country most threatened by nuclear weapons, with 78,000 people potentially dying and 277,000 injured if a 25-kiloton hydrogen bomb were to explode in Seoul. They also pointed out that the US's 'containment of nuclear proliferation' policy is no longer effective, as the US is now prioritizing its own defense over containing nuclear threats. Some experts suggested that South Korea should develop its own nuclear weapons to achieve nuclear balance with North Korea, while others proposed a 'dual-track' strategy of maintaining the status quo and breaking through it. The debate on whether South Korea should develop nuclear weapons has been ongoing, with some arguing that it would lead to a 'nuclear domino effect' and others seeing it as a way to strengthen the US-South Korea alliance.

**North Korea Warns of Nuclear War After South Korean Warplanes Accidentally Bomb Residential Area**
North Korea has warned South Korea that a recent incident where South Korean warplanes accidentally bombed a residential area could lead to a nuclear war. The incident occurred during a joint military exercise with the US, and North Korea claims that the exercise was a 'dangerous activity' that could lead to a nuclear war. North Korea stated, 'If the bombs had been dropped a bit further north and crossed our border, there would have been no need to speculate about the outcome.' The statement also warned that the incident showed that the joint military exercises between the US and South Korea are not aimed at maintaining peace and stability in the region, but rather are 'dangerous activities that could lead to the world's first nuclear war.' North Korea also threatened to take 'swift and merciless action' if the joint military exercises continue, stating, 'We will not hesitate to take action without warning if an unexpected development occurs. At that time, there will be no room for excuses.' The statement also called on the US and South Korea to stop their joint military exercises, stating, 'The US and South Korea should take the extremely dangerous signs of their joint military exercises seriously and immediately stop the nuclear war show in the Korean Peninsula.' The incident occurred when two South Korean KF-16 warplanes accidentally dropped 8 MK-82 bombs on a rural residential area in Pocheon, injuring at least 29 people and damaging many buildings.

**South Korea Bombs Residential Area 'by Error', Injuring 15**
South Korea has announced that it will remove the fences at the end of the runway after the worst air accident in its history. Two KF-16 fighter jets accidentally dropped eight explosive air-to-ground missiles on a residential neighborhood in Pocheon, 40 kilometers from Seoul, the capital. The detonation occurred at 10:00 local time and caused material damage to several homes and a church. The air force explained that each plane abnormally released four MK-82 bombs, and reported that the victims of the bombing, including two military personnel and two foreigners, were taken to a local hospital. According to the Yonhap news agency, at least two civilians are in critical condition. The MK-82 bomb contains 225 kilograms of explosive and is used to destroy buildings and bridges. Its impact leaves a crater of eight meters in diameter and 2.4 meters in depth, and the radius of destruction is approximately the size of a football field. Park, a resident in the area, said, 'I was at home watching TV when the bombing occurred. Suddenly I heard a huge explosion, like thunder, and the whole house shook. When I came out, everything was chaos.' The explosion was felt in a nearby elderly residence, one kilometer from the impact point. South Korean authorities have opened an investigation to determine the causes of the bombing, which appears to have been caused by a 'calculation error' made by one of the pilots, who entered incorrect coordinates for the target. The South Korean military has expressed regret for the damage caused and has committed to paying 'compensation' for the damage. The South Korean and US air forces have been conducting joint exercises near the border with North Korea in an attempt to showcase their military capabilities as Pyongyang's threat increases. The US has tens of thousands of soldiers deployed in South Korea, in part to protect the country from its northern neighbor, which has nuclear weapons. The two Koreas are technically still at war since the end of the 1950s conflict, which ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty.

**Fatal Error: Fighter Jets Bomb Village by Mistake, 15 Injured**
A military exercise between South Korea and the US ended in disaster when two KF-16 fighter jets accidentally dropped eight bombs over the town of Pocheon, 40 kilometers north of Seoul. The explosions caused significant damage, injuring 15 people, including four seriously. The incident was captured on camera, showing a massive fireball and thick smoke rising into the air. Residents described the scene as 'chaotic' with 'overwhelming fear'. The South Korean military initially called it a 'regrettable mistake', but later revealed that the pilot of the lead plane had entered incorrect coordinates into the computer, which were then automatically transmitted to the second plane. The investigation is ongoing, and diplomatic reactions are possible, as the exercise was conducted in close coordination with the US. The incident has raised concerns about the safety of military exercises and the potential for human error.

**North Korea could have more nuclear weapons than the UK by 2035**
Analysts have warned that North Korea could have more nuclear warheads than the UK by 2035, thanks to Russian assistance. Ankit Panda, an expert on North Korea's nuclear development, said that with Russian help, North Korea's arsenal of 50 nuclear warheads could rise to 300 in a decade. This would surpass the UK's estimated 225 nuclear warheads. Panda also stated that North Korea may already have the ability to detonate a warhead over an American city. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Director General, Rafael Grossi, accused North Korea of violating UN resolutions by continuing to develop nuclear weapons. Grossi also expressed concern over Iran's increased stockpile of 60% U-235, an isotope often used in nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, experts warned that Europe would need to dramatically increase its nuclear weapons stockpile should the US withdraw from NATO and cease to provide security guarantees to the continent.

**The Devastating Effects of a Nuclear War: A Hypothetical Scenario**
A new book, '24분, 애니 제이콥슨 지음, 강동혁 옮김, 문학동네 펴냄, 2만2000원', written by American investigative journalist and author Annie Jacobsen, presents a hypothetical scenario of a nuclear war between the US and North Korea. The book is based on interviews with individuals who have planned nuclear wars for decades, including presidential advisors, government officials, and scientists. According to the author, a 1-megaton nuclear bomb would destroy the Pentagon in Washington D.C. in 0.001 seconds, creating a massive fireball that would expand at supersonic speeds, killing hundreds of thousands of people in the first few seconds. The book describes the devastating effects of a nuclear war, including the initial blast, followed by a massive firestorm that would engulf the surrounding area, causing widespread destruction and death. The author estimates that within 2 minutes of the initial blast, over 1 million people would be dead or dying. The book also reveals a secret US military plan from 1960 to launch a nuclear attack on Moscow, which could have killed 6 billion people, or 5/5 of the world's population at the time. The author notes that the plan was so horrific that it made some witnesses compare it to the Nazi's genocide plans.

**This Is How North Korea Could Disable the Continental United States with One Missile**
North Korea has the capability to disable the entire continental United States with a single missile by detonating a nuclear explosion in space, which would cause a massive electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that would knock out power grids, electronics, and communication systems. This would have devastating effects on the economy, transportation, medical devices, and banking systems, potentially leading to the collapse of society and a loss of millions of lives. The US military would likely respond with a nuclear retaliatory strike against North Korea, but the effects of an EMP attack would be catastrophic. The article suggests that prevention, deterrence, and preemption are key to preventing such a disaster, and that technological options such as ballistic missile defenses and damage control measures can help mitigate the effects of an EMP attack.
