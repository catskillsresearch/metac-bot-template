**"Guarantee Sanctions Are Lifted" Iran Spells "Clearest Demand" to Trump, Warns "Reckless" Israel**
Iran has stated that it will not accept a nuclear agreement that restricts its 'peaceful activities', such as uranium enrichment. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi emphasized that Iran has 'nothing to hide' on its nuclear program and is willing to provide assurance to any party. He said, 'If the goal is to deprive Iran of its peaceful activities, then certainly no agreement will be reached.' Iran has warned the US that it will not accept any proposal that does not guarantee the lifting of sanctions, and has also warned Israel of a 'decisive reaction' if it continues to be 'reckless'.

**Iran's Araghchi: Israel Threatens Gaza with Nuclear Weapons, Urges International Action**
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated in a press conference in Cairo on June 2, 2025, that Israel is threatening Gaza with nuclear weapons, describing it as a 'blatant violation of international law and a direct threat to regional and global security.' He emphasized that Tehran will not agree to any agreement that does not recognize its right to enrich uranium, and that the Iranian response will be in line with the will of the people and the national interests. Araghchi met with his Egyptian counterpart, Dr. Badr Abdelatty, to discuss regional issues, including Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, as well as the security of navigation in the Red Sea and nuclear negotiations between Tehran and Washington. Abdelatty expressed his hope that the negotiations will lead to a comprehensive and peaceful solution that reduces regional tensions. The two ministers agreed on the importance of peaceful solutions and the need to curb military escalation, particularly in Gaza, where Abdelatty warned that any additional escalation could push the situation to the brink of explosion. He also mentioned that there is a consensus between Egypt and the US on giving priority to political tracks in resolving crises.

**Khamenei and Netanyahu Face the Real Test: Nuclear Agreement or 'Mother of All Wars'**
According to a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran's nuclear activities in recent months have shown that the country is close to having a nuclear arsenal. This contradicts statements made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who claimed that Israel had won against the Iranian axis. The report shows that at the beginning of the war on Gaza in October 2023, Iran had 128.3 kg of uranium enriched to 60%, which increased by more than three times, and Iran now has 408.6 kg of uranium enriched to 60%. Iran needs a single enrichment level to reach 90% to convert the fissile material into ten nuclear bombs. The head of Haaretz, Aluf Benn, believes that Iran exploited the war on Gaza to develop its nuclear program, and that it started on December 5, 2023, to collect as much enriched uranium as possible, which it then enriched to 60% at a rate seven times faster than before, moving the 'nuclear threshold' to the point of no return. Benn also believes that Iran has the capability and infrastructure to produce nuclear bombs, and that it only needs a few months to produce the necessary materials. Netanyahu's boasts about his victory in the war and the severe blow he dealt to Iran are now in the shadow of the strategic facts presented by Iranian leader Ali Khamenei, who chose to continue the fight and risk launching missiles on Israel, despite the opportunity to stop the war and save the situation. Khamenei's move has led to the collapse of Iran's military capabilities, but this is not a coincidence, as Iran has been focusing on its nuclear power. Now, Khamenei and Netanyahu are facing the real test, which will determine the outcome of the war and the balance of power in the Middle East. According to Benn, Iran believes that Israel is not capable of destroying its nuclear program, either due to a lack of suitable ammunition or due to Trump's opposition, and that a new nuclear agreement is in the works.

**US Proposal on the Table for Iran as Nuclear Talks Loom**
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi confirmed that his Omani counterpart conveyed the details of a US proposal to reach a nuclear agreement between Tehran and Washington during a short visit to Tehran on Saturday. The White House spokesperson Caroline Leavit later said that US Special Envoy Stephen Biegun 'sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian system, and it's in their interest to accept it.' Araghchi stated on the XAN platform that Iran 'will respond to the US proposal in line with national principles, interests, and the rights of the Iranian people.' This comes before a sixth round of expected talks between Washington and Tehran to resolve the decades-long dispute over Iran's nuclear program. The talks' date and location have not been announced yet. Leavit stated in a statement: 'President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never have a nuclear bomb,' confirming that the US proposal has been sent to Iran. Trump said on Friday that an agreement with Iran is possible in the 'near future.' Before that, Trump told reporters that he warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against taking actions that could disrupt nuclear talks with Iran. The comments suggest that the US is concerned about the possibility of Israel launching a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities amid ongoing diplomatic efforts. Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities if diplomacy fails to reach an agreement. One of the main sticking points in the talks between US and Iranian officials is the US insistence that Iran give up its uranium enrichment facilities, which Iran refuses to do. Trump, who reimposed 'maximum pressure' on Iran since February, had withdrawn from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers in 2018 and reimposed severe sanctions on Iran. Since then, Iran has consistently exceeded the limits set by the 2015 agreement on its nuclear program, which aims to increase the difficulties in developing a nuclear bomb, while denying Tehran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon.

**Netanyahu will obliterate Iran's nuke empire on own terms... and may snub Trump**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly planning to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, with his former advisor stating that 'number one is Iran before everything else' and that Netanyahu's 'main goal is to stop Iran and he needs to put every pressure he can.' The advisor, Shtrauchler, said that Netanyahu would want to do it with US backing, but 'if he sees it's not going, he will find a solution to change the equation with Iran and make sure that they don't have any nuclear weapon at all costs.' This comes as Iran has secretly amassed near weapons-grade levels of uranium and could soon have enough for nine bombs. Trump has cautioned Netanyahu to refrain from striking, arguing that negotiation coupled with the back-up threat of bombing is the ideal exploitation of Iran's vulnerability. However, a source close to the French government has insisted that Iran must be bombed 'immediately' if they develop the capacity to explode a nuke. Former Israeli foreign affairs minister Gabi Ashkenazi warned that military force will be the only alternative if talks hit a wall, stating that 'this is the only potential existential threat to the state of Israel.'

**Iran's Uranium Near Weapons-Grade: US Proposes Deal, Israel Fears Atomic Bomb**
Iran has almost 409 kilograms of uranium with a 60% purity level, according to the IAEA. Israel fears that this could be used to build an atomic bomb. US President Trump's spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, said that the US has proposed a 'detailed and acceptable' agreement to Iran. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghtschi stated that his Omani counterpart presented him with 'elements of a US deal', and that Iran will respond 'appropriately' and in accordance with its 'national interests'. The IAEA reported that the amount of near-weapons-grade uranium in Iran has increased by almost 50% in a short period. Iran has denied the report, calling it 'politically motivated'. Israel is concerned that Iran is planning to build an atomic bomb that could threaten its existence. There are speculations that Israel may be preparing an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. The Iranian Foreign Ministry accused Israel of sending fake documents to the IAEA, which are the basis of the report. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu called for rapid action from the international community after the report was published. Trump's spokesperson said that it is in Iran's best interest to accept the US proposal.

**White House urges Iran to accept nuclear deal as IAEA reports uranium enrichment spike**
The White House has urged Iran to accept its proposal on a nuclear deal after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported a significant increase in Iran's stockpile of near weapons-grade enriched uranium. The IAEA said Iran had increased its stockpile to 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched by up to 60% as of May 17, a nearly 50% increase since the agency's last report in February. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said, 'President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian regime, and it's in their best interest to accept it.' Iran's Foreign Ministry and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran have dismissed the report as 'biased and unprofessional,' while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office called the report 'grave' and said it 'strongly reinforces what Israel has been saying for years -- the purpose of Iran's nuclear program is not peaceful.'

**Iran Accuses Israel of Providing 'Unreliable and Misleading' Information to IAEA**
Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Israel of providing 'unreliable and misleading' information to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for use in its new report on Tehran's nuclear program. The ministry stated in a statement: 'Relying on unreliable and misleading information provided by the Israeli regime... is incompatible with the professional verification principles of the IAEA.' According to Agence France-Presse. Meanwhile, Israeli media reported that several Israeli ministries held secret meetings to discuss the possibility of an attack on Iran or defending against an Iranian attack on Israel. According to Maariv newspaper, the meetings were based on a hypothesis that an attack could be launched without prior warning. Israeli estimates suggest that an attack on Iran could lead to a war of unknown duration, with thousands of missiles weighing 700 kilograms of explosives each falling on Israel, crippling the country's economic infrastructure in the first days before gradually returning to normal under emergency conditions. The estimates also included the opening of all public shelters, which number over 10,000, with the provision of infrastructure to meet various needs, including the preparation of areas for evacuating the population, expanding hospitals, and enhancing the readiness of the home front command.

**US Intelligence: Israel Prepares to Strike Iranian Nuclear Facilities**
According to US intelligence, Israel is preparing to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. However, it is unclear if the Israeli leaders have made a final decision. An Israeli source told CNN that Israel will not accept a 'bad deal' with Iran. The source also stated that 'Israel is preparing to strike Iran alone.' Iranian sources said that the Iranian leadership needs a clear alternative plan to implement in case the efforts to resolve the ongoing nuclear dispute fail. They also stated that Iran may turn to China and Russia as an alternative plan, but given the ongoing tensions between Beijing and Washington, and Moscow's involvement in the Ukraine war, Iran's alternative plan seems fragile. A senior Iranian official said that 'the alternative plan is to continue the previous strategy before the start of the talks. Iran will avoid escalating tensions and is ready to defend itself.' The strategy also includes strengthening relations with allies such as Russia and China. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said earlier that US demands for Iran to halt uranium enrichment are 'excessive and humiliating.' He expressed doubts about whether the nuclear talks will lead to an agreement. After four rounds of talks aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, there are still many obstacles blocking the way. Iranian officials and a European diplomat said that Tehran refuses to ship all its high-enriched uranium stockpile abroad or engage in discussions about its ballistic missile program. The lack of trust from both sides, and President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 agreement with world powers, has made it essential for Iran to receive guarantees that Washington will not backtrack on a future agreement. The challenges facing Iran are compounded by the country's economic and security crises, including power and water shortages, currency devaluation, military losses among its regional allies, and growing concerns about an Israeli attack on its nuclear sites. The Iranian regime 'has no better option' than a new agreement to avoid economic chaos at home that could threaten its rule, according to sources. The recent protests in the country, sparked by social repression and economic hardships in recent years, and met with harsh crackdowns, have exposed the weakness of the Islamic Republic in the face of public anger, leading to the imposition of Western sanctions on human rights.

**Israel's Stance on a Nuclear Deal with Iran: A Delicate Balance**
Jonathan Freeman, a professor of politics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, believes that Israel will likely accept a nuclear deal with Iran if it is 'good' and guaranteed by US President Donald Trump. Freeman stated that Israel has had positive experiences with Trump, such as the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. However, if the deal is not satisfactory, Israel will express its views. Freeman also noted that if Iran continues to develop nuclear weapons, Israel may have to consider military action, even if it means going against the US. Freeman added that the opposition leader Benny Gantz and other leaders have called for military action to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Freeman also stated that some Israeli politicians believe that the best way to stop Iran's nuclear program is to overthrow the regime, and that a deal with Trump could lead to increased support for Israel and a delay or prevention of military action. Freeman also noted that the US has informed Israel about its negotiations with Iran and has taken Israel's views into account. Freeman also stated that a nuclear deal with Iran could give Israel more legitimacy in the region and that Iran's weakness could lead to its partners joining Israel. Freeman also noted that if Iran continues to develop nuclear weapons, Israel may have to break its silence and say 'we are not the first country to have nuclear weapons in the region, it is Iran'.

**Israeli Academic: Israel Will Accept US-Iran Nuclear Deal if it's 'Good' and Implemented by US**
Professor Jonathan Freedman of the Hebrew University in Israel believes that Israel will accept a potential agreement between the US and Iran on the Iranian nuclear program if it is 'good' and the US is responsible for its implementation and guarantees it. Freedman, in an interview with Anadolu, said that he doubts that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will reject such an agreement, given Trump's pro-Israel policies during his first presidential term (2017-2021). The US and its allies, including Israel, accuse Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, while Tehran claims that its program is for peaceful purposes, including generating electricity. Israel is the only country in the region with a nuclear arsenal, but it has not officially announced it and is not subject to international oversight. Freedman noted that Trump, during his first term, withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement and 'supported the way Israel viewed the agreement as a bad deal.' He added that 'this fact does not negate the fact that Israel wants a deal, but it must be good.' Since April 12, three rounds of indirect talks have been held in Oman and Italy between the US and Iran to discuss a new agreement on the Iranian nuclear program. The US, Britain, France, China, Russia, and Germany signed an agreement with Iran in 2015, imposing restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting international sanctions. However, Trump withdrew from the agreement in 2018, considering it 'bad, non-lasting, and not addressing Iran's ballistic missile program.' Trump reimposed US sanctions on Iran to pressure it to re-negotiate a broader agreement, while Iran remained committed to the agreement for a year after his withdrawal, then gradually retreated from its commitments. In addition to being 'good,' Freedman said that 'one of the things Israel is looking for is who will implement the agreement, will it be American inspectors? And will there be American guarantees?' He added that 'Israel has had very bad experiences with international bodies, such as the UN, which conduct inspections and impose sanctions.' Freedman continued: 'If there is an agreement that will be implemented, especially by the US, Israel will accept it. But if it's not satisfactory, Israel will express its opinion.' He added that 'if no agreement is reached, we cannot rule out military action against Iran. I cannot even rule out US military action if the agreement does not prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.' In recent days, Israeli analysts have said that Israel wants the negotiations to fail, and have called on opposition leaders, including former Defense Minister Benny Gantz, to take military action to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Freedman commented: 'There is a consensus among most Israeli politicians that Israel may have to take unilateral action against Iran if it tries to acquire a nuclear weapon, and I believe that the US is aware of this.' He added: 'The US continues to provide military support to us, and there are many tools we can use against Iran, which the US still supports us even while negotiating with Iran.' Freedman concluded: 'In the end, I think we should give Trump some time, he has only been in office for 100 days, and we think he has been there for 100 years.' Regarding the minimum requirements that Israel demands from the agreement, Freedman said that 'the main thing is who will implement it.' He added: 'We have heard Netanyahu talk recently about Libya and the agreement made with the late Colonel Muammar Gaddafi to dismantle his nuclear program, which Israel accepted.' Freedman continued: 'The matter with the expected agreement is who will implement it and guarantee it? This will also allow the Israeli government to promote the agreement to the public.' He added: 'If Trump is behind the agreement and is its creator, he may receive greater acceptance from the Israeli government and most of the coalition partners and the public opinion, which may prevent or delay military action against Iran.'

**Israel to Seek US Approval Before Attacking Iran's Nuclear Sites**
According to the Financial Times, Israel will not carry out strikes against Iran's nuclear infrastructure without US approval. The Israeli government is reportedly concerned about angering Donald Trump, who is trying to resolve the situation around Iran's nuclear program through peaceful means. However, the newspaper claims that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants the US to take a more forceful approach. Netanyahu had previously presented the White House with several options for attacking Iranian nuclear sites and was planning to launch the strikes in May, but Trump did not support military action. A US delegation held indirect talks with Iranian representatives in Oman on April 12, which were described as constructive.

**Israel's Lapid: No Decision to Strike Iran, but Will Take Unilateral Action if France Recognizes Palestine**
Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid stated that Israel has not made a decision to strike Iran and is open to a diplomatic solution to stop Iran's nuclear ambitions. However, he warned that Israel will take unilateral action if France recognizes Palestine. Lapid denied knowledge of a planned Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, saying 'I am a member of the small security cabinet and all the internal bodies, and I do not remember taking such a decision.' He added that Israel is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and that a diplomatic solution is acceptable if it can achieve this goal. Lapid expressed concern over France's intention to recognize Palestine, saying that Israel may take unilateral action if France proceeds with this decision, which would tighten the noose around Israel and force it to take unilateral decisions. He also expressed hope for a new agreement with Hamas, warning that 'if we are unable to achieve our goal through a diplomatic or political path, we will have to renew the military operation, and not a limited one, but a strong one.'

**Israel and US to Hold Strategic Talks on Iran's Nuclear File**
According to Axios, Israel and the US will hold 'strategic' talks next week in the US regarding Iran's nuclear file. The talks will include Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer and National Security Adviser Tsahi Hanegbi. Axios reported that US President Donald Trump gave Iran a two-month deadline to reach a new nuclear agreement, before taking military action against Iran's nuclear facilities, as stated in a letter sent to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The letter reportedly included a two-month deadline for Iran to reach a new nuclear agreement. It is unclear when the two-month deadline will start, but Iran's refusal to accept Trump's initiative and not engaging in negotiations may increase the likelihood of US or Israeli military action against Iran's nuclear facilities.

**Iran Rejects Threats from US and Israel, Vows to Defend Nuclear Program**
Iran has defended its nuclear program and stated that it will not allow 'any weakness' in this regard, amidst statements from the US and Israel that they will work to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, a claim that Iranian authorities have denied at all times. 'Iran seriously considers its rights and obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) over the past three decades and everything done in the Iranian peaceful nuclear program is based on its inalienable rights as a member of the NPT', said the spokesperson for the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Esmaeil Baqaei. 'We will not allow any weakness in this regard', he emphasized during a press conference in Tehran, before reiterating that there are consultations for a new round of talks with the E3 - composed of the UK, France, and Germany - according to the Iranian news agency Mehr. Baqaei also rejected the 'threats' from Israel against Iran and stated that they constitute 'a clear violation of International Law'. 'Threatening others is only a violation of the United Nations Charter', he said, before demanding that 'those who formulate these threats be held accountable'. The statements from Baqaei come a day after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated in Jerusalem that Iran cannot access a nuclear weapon and promised that the Trump Administration will dedicate its efforts to preventing it. 'A nuclear Iran would be immune to pressure and that cannot happen', he said during a press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu emphasized that 'Israel and the US are shoulder to shoulder in facing the Iranian threat' and added that 'the ayatollahs must not have nuclear weapons' and that 'Iran's aggression in the region must be repelled'. He also stated that Israel has dealt a 'huge blow' to Iran since the outbreak of the conflict in the Gaza Strip and highlighted that, with Washington's support, 'there is no doubt that Israel will finish the job and will finish it', in a direct threat to Tehran.

**Israel to attack Iran if no nuclear deal is reached by October – Al-Hadath**
According to a senior European diplomat, if no nuclear deal is reached between the US and Iran by October, Israel will launch a military attack on Iran. The diplomat stated, 'The Trump administration is trying to reach an agreement with Iran before October. However, if this agreement is not achieved, the region will face a serious crisis.' The US is seeking direct and confidential negotiations with Iran, and the diplomat believes that Iran is desperate to negotiate due to its weakened state. The diplomat added, 'Iran will accept any agreement that includes the lifting of sanctions.' Trump has expressed a preference for a deal with Iran over an Israeli attack, saying, 'I would love to make a deal with them without bombing them.' However, Trump also stated that Iran is 'very concerned' and 'very frightened' due to the loss of its air defenses, which were knocked out by Israel's October attacks.
