**As upbeat Indian economy closes gap with Japan, Germany, the real test will be at the podium**
India's economy is expected to surpass Japan's and close the gap with Germany, becoming the third-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP. According to the IMF, India's nominal GDP is projected to reach $4.19 trillion by FY26, while Germany's is expected to be $4.74 trillion. India's growth is driven by domestic consumption, services, and digitization, with a robust current account buffer and a rising trade surplus. However, challenges such as job creation, fiscal slippage, and institutional bottlenecks loom large. Experts warn that India must invest in human capital, strengthen its fiscal fundamentals, and deepen financial inclusion to truly consolidate its position in the top three. If India can achieve an 8% nominal GDP growth rate and maintain a stable rupee, its economy could cross $6.8 trillion-$7 trillion by 2030, firmly establishing it as the world's third-largest economy.

**Central Bank Analysts Reduce Inflation Projection for 2025**
Analysts consulted by the Central Bank have reduced their projection for Brazil's inflation in 2025, while maintaining the expectation for price growth in 2026, according to the Focus survey released on Monday. The survey showed that the expectation for inflation, measured by IPCA, is now 5.46% at the end of this year, above the previous forecast of 5.50%. For 2026, the projection for price growth was maintained at 4.50%. The Central Bank's target is 3%, with a 1.5 percentage point margin for tolerance. The change comes after the release of data for the IPCA-15 of May, which decelerated and was below expectations, leading to some relief in the 12-month result. The index rose 0.36% in May, after increasing 0.43% in the previous month, and 5.40% in 12 months, compared to a gain of 5.49% in April. The weekly survey with a hundred economists also showed the expectation that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow 1.80% next year, above the growth projection of 1.70% in the previous week. For 2025, the expectation for economic expansion fell slightly to 2.13%, from a gain of 2.14% previously. On monetary policy, there was maintenance of the expectation for the basic interest rate this year and next. The median of the projections for the Selic at the end of 2025 is 14.75%, while for the end of 2026, the expectation is that the rate will reach 12.50%, which was the 18th consecutive week of maintenance of this level. Currently, the Selic is at 14.75% per year. The survey also maintained the expectations for the price of the dollar at the end of 2025, at R$5.80, and 2026, at R$5.90. The US dollar has accumulated a 6.8% drop against the real this year, in a movement driven by a price correction process, after its surge at the end of last year, and greater uncertainty regarding US tariff plans.

**Dubai's US$10bln infrastructure spending key to the growth of the commercial vehicle market**
The GCC commercial vehicle market is poised for growth, driven by substantial infrastructure investments and strategic economic initiatives in key member states. Dubai has earmarked US$10 billion for infrastructure spending, focusing on scaling the Emirate's tourism economy. Saudi Arabia has announced investments worth US$267 billion, and Qatar is focusing on tourism and hospitality under its Third National Development Strategy 2024-2030. According to Frost & Sullivan's research, Saudi Arabia is leading the commercial vehicles industry in the Middle East, leveraging its strategic location and substantial infrastructure investments. The non-oil economy in the Middle East will remain a key driver of economic growth, with key industries identified as manufacturing (including automotive), renewables, infrastructure, construction, tourism, artificial intelligence, and fintech. In the UAE, a resilient non-oil economy performance will push GDP growth to 5.8% in 2025, up from 4% in 2024, while investments in Saudi's non-oil segments including, tourism, technology, infrastructure, and renewables, will see real GDP growth reach 4.8% in 2025. Sunny Manjani, Mobility Consultant at Frost & Sullivan, said: 'Current supply chain disruptions in maritime routes are creating short-term opportunities for road transportation in the region.' Tommy Le, Show Manager for Automechanika Dubai, said: 'Automechanika Dubai is the largest international trade show for the automotive aftermarket industry in the MEA region. The 22nd edition will span 20 halls at the Dubai World Trade Centre, featuring over 20 Pavilions and a host of new features.'

**India's Quest for AI Experts: A Strategic Move for Economic Dominance**
India is projected to need one million experts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) by 2026. The country aims to become one of the world's largest economies by 2047, with a GDP of over $30 trillion. To achieve this, India is investing in technological advancements as the driving force behind development. According to the Indian Technical Education Council, 1.49 million engineering seats were approved for the 2024-2025 period, a 16% increase from the past four years. The fields with the highest growth are computer science, AI, machine learning, data science, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and blockchain. The number of seats in these fields has increased by over 50%, reflecting the strong market demand. Institutions are also promoting a more comprehensive and interconnected education, shifting from the STEM concept to STEAM, which includes arts, communication, design, law, and psychology. This aims to form creative professionals with a broad vision and the ability to innovate. According to the Times of India, a report by Wheebox estimates that the Indian AI market will reach $28.8 billion by 2025, with a 45% annual growth rate. The number of qualified professionals in the field has grown 14 times between 2016 and 2023. Universities like SRM Institute are creating interdisciplinary courses that combine engineering with health, data science, and food technology. Partnerships with companies ensure that students have contact with real-world challenges and are ready to compete globally. With India determined to take a leading role in the global economy, the formation of AI specialists becomes a strategic pillar to support this advancement.

**US Treasury Secretary Confident US Will Never Default on Debt**
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the US government will never default on its debt, despite the lack of a decision on raising its debt ceiling. 'The United States will never default, this will never happen', he said in an interview with CBS News. Bessent added that the US authorities 'are on a warning path and will not hit a wall'. According to the International Monetary Fund's calculations, the US government debt will increase to 122.5% of GDP by 2025 and continue to rise, reaching 128.2% by 2030. Earlier, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the country's government debt is on an 'unsustainable trajectory', but has not yet reached an unacceptable level, and it is unknown when this threshold will be crossed.

**US Faces High Risk of Financial Collapse, Warns Congressional Budget Office**
The US is facing a high risk of financial collapse, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO predicts that the federal debt will rise to 117% of the country's GDP by 2034, up from 98% last year. The interest payments on the debt are also expected to increase to 4% of the GDP, which is a significant burden on the government. Despite these alarming numbers, investors are still confident in the US economy and are willing to buy government bonds and the dollar, which are the backbone of the global financial system. However, some experts warn that the US is heading towards a financial crisis, citing the country's high debt levels and the potential for a recession. If a recession were to occur, it would have a double impact on the US finances, with a decline in tax revenues and a significant increase in welfare payments, leading to a financial collapse. The Federal Reserve may be able to mitigate some of the effects of a recession by lowering interest rates, but this would not eliminate the risk of a financial crisis. The CBO's central projections assume that the US will experience a continuous and sustained economic growth over the next decade, but this is an optimistic assumption. If the economy were to experience a recession, the US finances would be severely impacted, with a significant increase in debt and interest payments. Some experts, such as Chris Marsh from Exante Data, warn that if the yield curve does not return to its natural state, the US could face a severe financial crisis, with the federal debt rising to 125% of the GDP by 2034 and interest payments reaching 30% of the government's revenues.

**Despite GDP growth, India's per capita income abysmally low**
India's GDP has grown to $4.187 trillion, surpassing Japan's, and is expected to reach $5.584 billion by 2028, overtaking Germany. However, India's per capita GDP is abysmally low, equivalent to Japan's in the 1950s, and would take 22 years to reach their level. Experts say India needs to diversify its export basket and leverage global value chains to reach its $1 trillion merchandise exports goal by 2030. To boost growth, India can harness its global trade potential by increasing exports in textiles, apparel, and footwear sectors, as well as electronics and green technology products. Economists project India's economic growth to average around 6.5 percent over the next few years, making it likely to maintain its status as the fastest-growing major economy globally. However, Indian citizens are demanding reforms and policies that will boost GDP per capita by improving wages for India's working class. Four potential ways to boost GDP per capita include allowing farmers to sell their products to the highest bidder, spending money on building and repairing roads and bridges, urbanization, and increasing competitiveness in sectors such as electronics, chemicals, textiles, auto goods, and pharmaceuticals.

**Italy's Demographic Minefield: A 11% GDP Risk by 2040**
According to Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta, the number of people in the workforce is expected to decrease by around five million by 2040, which could cost the country 11% of its GDP. Panetta also noted that the productivity issue remains a problem, with Italy's productivity growth being one of the lowest in the EU. The low level of salaries is also a concern, with real wages having fallen below those of 2000, despite a recent recovery. To ensure a sustainable increase in wages, it is essential to boost productivity and growth through innovation, capital accumulation, and public action. Panetta stated that the Italian industry is still solid, but the value added in the manufacturing sector has remained stagnant, reflecting the expansion in the energy sector and the new decline in the manufacturing area. However, Panetta emphasized that 'despite the current difficulties, the Italian industry is not destined to decline. In all sectors, there are dynamic and competitive companies that invest in technology and research and position themselves in high-end segments.' The main issue is the low level of innovation, with the expenditure on research and development being significantly lower than the EU average. Panetta warned that 'with tariffs at risk, we risk losing 1% of global GDP in two years.'

**Resilient Short-Term Perspectives for Africa's Growth Despite Global Headwinds**
Despite global economic and political headwinds, Africa has resilient short-term perspectives for growth. According to the 2025 Economic Prospects for Africa (PEA 2025) report, 21 African countries are expected to achieve a growth rate of over 5% in 2025, with four countries (Ethiopia, Niger, Rwanda, and Senegal) potentially reaching the critical threshold of 7% necessary for poverty reduction and inclusive growth. Africa's projected growth rates will exceed the global average and those of most other regions, except for emerging and developing Asia. The continent's resilience is based on effective national reforms and better macroeconomic management. However, regional growth perspectives vary significantly: East Africa leads with a projected growth rate of 5.9% in 2025-2026, driven by Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Tanzania's resilience. West Africa maintains a solid growth rate of 4.3%, driven by new oil and gas discoveries in Senegal and Niger. North Africa is expected to grow at 3.6% in 2025, while Central Africa's growth will slow to 3.2% and Southern Africa will only grow by 2.2%. Despite these challenges, Africa has a huge untapped potential for national resources. The PEA 2025 estimates that with appropriate policies, Africa could mobilize an additional $1.43 trillion in national resources from fiscal and non-fiscal sources, solely through efficiency gains. Africa's unexploited resources include: natural capital, with 30% of global mineral reserves and potential revenue of over $1.6 trillion by 2030; human capital, with a median age of 19 years, representing a demographic dividend that could add $47 billion to Africa's GDP through better labor participation; financial capital, with pension fund assets reaching $1.1 trillion and official transfers potentially reaching $500 billion by 2035 if transfer costs are reduced; and commercial capital, with the full implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) potentially increasing exports by $560 billion and the continent's revenue by $450 billion by 2035. Urgent measures are needed to combat resource leaks. The report highlights that massive capital outflows compromise the continent's development. In comparison to the $190.7 billion in financial inflows recorded in 2022, Africa has experienced approximately $587 billion in financial outflows. Of this total, around $90 billion was lost due to illicit financial flows, $275 billion was diverted by multinational corporations that transfer their profits, and $148 billion was lost due to corruption. When Africa allocates its own capital effectively (human, natural, fiscal, commercial, and financial), global capital will follow African capital to accelerate investments in the continent's productive sectors. The report calls for global reforms in several critical areas, including: improving macroeconomic management, quality institutions, good governance, and the rule of law; mobilizing fiscal revenues through improved tax administration, expanded tax bases, and strengthened social contracts with citizens; making natural capital accounting mandatory and enforcing national value retention through enrichment requirements; deepening financial markets by exploiting institutional savings, developing local currency bond markets, and harmonizing regulatory frameworks to facilitate cross-border investments.

**Shipping, the Scissors of Debt. 'A Brake on Global Trade'**
The European ports are seeking a new identity in an increasingly unpredictable geopolitical context, while the European Commission wants a new strategy for these infrastructures. The Espo, the European ports association, met in its annual conference in Thessaloniki. The occasion is also a moment to take stock of the sector. The first surprise that emerges, according to the analysis of Tim Power, director general of the British analysis company Drewry, is that the commercial battle of the United States against the rest of the world and particularly against China will not shake the growth of the global Gross Domestic Product: 'The trend - says Power - will be essentially in line with that of the past decade, with slow growth in Europe and normalization of China.' The global GDP growth forecast between 2025 and 2030 is 2.6%, slightly below the 2.9% of the period 2019-2025. The EU will go from 1.3% to 1.6%, the US from 2.6% to 2.3% and China will drop from 5.7% to 3.7%. The real alarm signal highlighted by Power is instead the growth of public debt. 'The sovereign debts of Italy and France are particularly high - explains Power - and this represents a high risk for their economies, and among the measures that they will have to adopt in the future to contain public spending, there could be the choice of cutting import volumes. Italy currently has the highest debt in the Western world, over 135% of its GDP, above the US and France. Overall, the debt-to-GDP ratio in the European Union is 80%, while that of China is destined to pass from the current 69% to 100% by 2030. The more the debt grows, the more its costs grow, reducing the room for maneuver of individual nations in the event of a future economic crisis. Trade relationships, including commercial ones, become rigid. Now, if it is true that at the current stage there are no expected - despite everything - major shocks to global growth, it is also true that there are several subjects that should start to take stock, starting from Italy, which, limiting ourselves to the port sector, would not only be faced with a lower volume of imports but would also have to pay - as is known - one of the highest prices in terms of exports, having precisely in the US the second largest export partner. Between this year and 2030, the growth of container traffic in European ports should be around 2-2.5%, while interesting movements could occur for oil traffic, particularly that of the United States: today China is a major buyer of this energy source, but the tariff policy could change the picture, and push Beijing to increase its purchases from the Middle East and Russia at the expense of American oil. Where will American oil go? With all probability to Europe, but the limited refining capacity makes the Old Continent a commercial partner able to absorb much lower volumes than those normally bought by China. And this considering that, at a general level, the import of US oil weighs 1.7% on the total Chinese purchases, but it is worth 5.1% of US sales. On the environmental front, while the passage of the Mediterranean to the area of control of emissions (ECA) established by the International Maritime Organization, the blue arm of the UN, has passed largely unnoticed, great importance has been given by all the speakers to the approval of the first draft of a global mechanism, approved by the IMO last month and which should be implemented by October, for the reduction of emissions from ships. 'In this way - explained the European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas - there will be a common field of competition for everyone' trying to counter the polemics arisen with the previous commission on the rigidity of the adopted scheme in Europe. However, notes Power, the global mechanism, which aims to achieve zero net emissions by 2050, will hardly be adopted before 2029.

**US Population to Decline Without Migration by 2033, CBO Predicts**
According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the US population without migration will start to decline in 2033, which may hinder economic growth. The CBO predicts that mortality will exceed birth rates in the US in eight years, and population growth will be driven only by migration. The National Center for Health Statistics reports that in 2023, there were 3,591,328 births, a historic low, and 3,090,582 deaths. The birth rate among women aged 20-24 (55.4) reached a record low. The CBO expects the gross domestic product (GDP) to grow at an average rate of 1.6% over the next 30 years, compared to an average annual growth rate of 2.5% over the past three decades. This is due to the decline in the workforce due to aging population and slowing productivity growth. The CBO also predicts a rise in the national debt from 100% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 156% of GDP in 2055. 'Even small changes in migration, birth, or death rates, accumulated over many years, can have a significant impact on results in later periods of forecasting,' the CBO said. The CBO's previous forecast, made in 2023, expected the US population to decline by 2040. The current forecast reflects the consequences of a government order issued in June 2024, which suspended the entry of most non-citizens through the southern border of the US, signed by former President Joe Biden.

**Global Public Debt to Reach 95% of GDP by 2025, Warns IMF**
The global public debt is expected to continue growing, according to the Fiscal Monitor report released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on April 23. The report states that the public debt will reach 95% of the world's GDP by 2025, and could even surpass 100% by 2030. The IMF has also lowered its forecast for global economic growth to 2.8% in 2025, down from 3.3% in January, due to the trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump. This will lead to lower government revenues and increased pressure on countries with high debt levels to either balance their budgets or increase spending. The report warns that the public debt could reach 117% of GDP by 2027, the highest level since World War II. The IMF attributes the growth of public debt to the dynamics in the US and China. The report also notes that the US is expected to see a slow decline in its budget deficit over the next two years, but its public debt will continue to rise, reaching 122.5% of GDP in 2025 and over 128% in 2030. 'The trade war is causing significant economic difficulties and will lead to increased requests for public support for affected sectors,' said the report. 'In a highly unfavorable scenario, the public debt could surge even further,' it added.

**US and China GDP to Remain Top 2 Until 2075, But Trump's Policies May Change the Ranking**
According to a recent report by the Japanese Economic Research Center, the GDP of the United States and China will continue to be ranked 1st and 2nd respectively until 2075, with no change in the ranking. However, if the policies of former US President Donald Trump are implemented in the long term, the US GDP may be surpassed by China as early as 2049. The report also predicts that the global average economic growth rate will decrease from 3.3% between 2021 and 2030 to 1.3% between 2071 and 2075, due to the decline in population and birth rate. The report also notes that the population of Asia will decline by 2075, while Africa's population will continue to grow and surpass East Asia in the mid-2040s. 'If the US continues to deport 1 million illegal immigrants every year and strictly limits legal immigration, the US economy will decline, and China's GDP will surpass the US by 2049,' the report said.

**US Population Expected to Start Declining in 2033, CBO Predicts**
According to a report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the US population is expected to start declining in 2033, excluding migration, which could undermine economic growth. The CBO predicts that mortality will exceed birth rates in the US within eight years, and population growth will only be sustained through migration. In 2023, the US saw a record low birth rate, with 3,591,328 children born, and a death toll of 3,090,582. The fertility rate among women aged 20-24 (55.4) reached a record low. The report also notes that the US GDP is expected to grow at an average rate of 1.6% over the next 30 years, compared to a 2.5% average annual growth rate over the past three decades. This is due to the shrinking workforce as the population ages and declining productivity growth. The CBO also predicts that the number of workers will increase from 171 million in 2025 to 185 million in 2055, with an annual growth rate of 0.1%. Additionally, the report notes that the 'slowdown in the growth of educational attainment' will also hinder economic growth. The CBO also forecasts a rise in the US national debt from 100% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 156% of GDP in 2055. As the CBO notes, 'even small changes in migration, birth, or death rates, accumulated over many years, can have a significant impact on results in later periods of forecasting.' The current forecast is a revision from the CBO's previous prediction of a population decline in 2040, which was made in 2023. The new forecast takes into account the consequences of a government directive issued in June 2024, which suspended the entry of most non-citizens through the southern US border, signed by former President Joe Biden.

**US Federal Debt to Reach 107% of GDP by 2029, CBO Warns**
The US Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has predicted that the country's federal debt will reach 107% of the country's GDP by 2029, surpassing the highest level reached after World War II. The CBO also warned that the large increase in debt will have a negative impact on economic growth, increase interest payments to foreign investors, and pose significant risks to the country's fiscal and economic outlook. The CBO also predicted that the US budget deficit will remain at a high level over the next 30 years, with a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 6.3% on average, and 7.3% in 2055. The CBO also predicted that the US population will grow more slowly over the next 30 years, with a potential labor force growth rate of 0.3% per year, compared to 0.8% over the past 30 years. The CBO also predicted that the population will start to decline in 2033 if foreign immigration to the US does not occur. 'This is a warning of the risks of strict immigration policies,' said a Bloomberg report. The CBO also predicted that the average annual economic growth rate will be 1.6% by 2055, and the potential growth rate will be 1.7%.

**US economic growth to slow in the next 30 years, fueled by debt and declining birth rates, CBO says**
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released a report stating that the US economy will experience slower growth over the next 30 years due to weak population gains and increased government spending. The report projects that publicly held debt will reach 156% of the gross domestic product (GDP) by 2055, down from a previous projection of 166% in 2054. The CBO also notes that the US population would begin to shrink in 2033 without immigration. The report assumes that all laws set to expire, including certain provisions of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, will expire. However, the White House and Republican lawmakers have suggested that the tax cuts will be renewed and potentially expanded, as well as reductions in government spending and an increase in revenues by taxing imports.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has advocated for a '3-3-3' plan to address the debt and economic growth issues, but the CBO has expressed skepticism about the plan's feasibility. The report's warnings come as the US is on track to hit its statutory debt ceiling as early as August without a deal between Congress and the White House.
