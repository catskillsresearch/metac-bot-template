**Kremlin Rejects Ukraine Ceasefire Ultimatum, Putin Proposes Direct Talks**
The Kremlin has rejected the 'ultimatum' issued by Kiev and its European allies calling for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine before peace talks, while not responding to Volodymyr Zelensky's proposal to meet Vladimir Putin in Istanbul on Thursday. 'The language of ultimatums is unacceptable for Russia, it's not suitable. We can't talk to Russia like that,' said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov. Peskov assured that Moscow wants 'serious' negotiations to achieve a long-term peace, but did not react to Zelensky's offer of a meeting with Putin. Kiev and its European allies have called for a 'complete and unconditional' 30-day ceasefire starting on Monday, a condition they say is necessary for direct peace talks between Russians and Ukrainians in Turkey, as proposed by Putin. 'There must be a ceasefire,' emphasized EU Foreign Affairs Chief Kaja Kallas, accusing Russia of 'playing a game.' A meeting on this proposal is scheduled for the afternoon between Ukrainians and European leaders, according to French President Emmanuel Macron. Meanwhile, Russian nighttime attacks against Ukraine using drones continued, as they have almost every day since the invasion began in February 2022, a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians on both sides. On Monday morning, a Russian drone killed one person and injured three in a car belonging to an essential company in the Sumy region (northeast), according to Ukrainian authorities. In the occupied part of the Kherson region (south), Ukrainian drone strikes killed four civilians in the village of Chelburda, reported Vladimir Saldo, the local Russian-appointed official, who still occupies nearly 20% of Ukrainian territory. 'Acceleration of diplomacy' On the diplomatic front, things have accelerated in recent days, as separate discussions initiated by US President Donald Trump seemed to be at an impasse. Kiev and its European allies, in concert with Washington, called on Russia for a 30-day ceasefire on Saturday, threatening 'massive sanctions' in case of refusal. Putin ignored the ultimatum, proposing direct and unconditional negotiations between Moscow and Kiev, starting on Thursday in Istanbul (Turkey). It would be the first discussions between Russians and Ukrainians since the early weeks of the Russian invasion in February 2022, when a series of bilateral meetings, also held in part in Turkey, did not lead to a peace agreement. Zelensky responded by inviting Putin to meet 'in person' on Thursday in Istanbul. Without getting a response from the Kremlin at this stage. For Ukrainian politician Volodymyr Fessenko, this invitation is a 'tactical maneuver' to try to put Putin in difficulty in the negotiation process. 'If Putin refuses (this invitation), it means he doesn't want to negotiate, and could look like a loser in the eyes of Trump,' estimates this expert, who considers the US leader as 'the main driving force' behind these negotiations. 'Deep causes' Putin - who still demands Ukraine's surrender, its renunciation of joining NATO, or the ability to keep the Ukrainian territories annexed by Moscow - seems to have a different reading, knowing his army is in a favorable position on the front. On Monday, the Russian army claimed to have taken a new village in the Donetsk region (east). In Bilystké, a small town near the front, in this same region, two residents, Aliona and Alla, said on Monday in favor of a Putin-Zelensky meeting. 'They must do it, because this (war) cannot last forever,' said Aliona to AFP. On Saturday, Putin had 'not ruled out' that the idea of a ceasefire could be discussed during these talks, which should, according to him, focus above all on 'the deep causes of the conflict.' A meeting on Thursday in Turkey 'will at least allow us to determine if an agreement is possible, and if not, European leaders and the United States will know what to do and will act accordingly,' estimated Donald Trump on Sunday.

**Putin Proposes Talks with Zelensky to Discuss 'Roots of the Conflict'**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed another round of bilateral talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss the 'roots of the conflict' in Istanbul, Turkey. This comes after Zelensky requested an unconditional ceasefire for 30 days, supported by Western European allies. In a joint statement, European leaders promised harsher sanctions and more military aid to Ukraine if the country fails to comply with the agreement. Putin stated, 'We are determined to hold serious negotiations to eliminate the roots of the conflict. We do not rule out that during the talks, we may be able to agree on some new type of ceasefire.' The meeting in Istanbul is significant, as Turkish President Recep Erdoğan is the only NATO leader with close ties to Russia. However, Putin reiterated Russia's victimhood narrative, saying, 'There is a war happening. But we are offering to resume negotiations that were interrupted, and not by us. What's wrong with that?' The talks will focus on Russia's grievances, including the transfer of occupied territories, such as Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk, and Ukraine's guarantee not to join NATO in the future.

**Putin Ignores 30-Day Ceasefire, Resumes Attacks on Ukraine**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ignored the 30-day ceasefire proposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and has instead resumed attacks on Ukraine. Putin reiterated the need to 'eliminate the root causes of the conflict', which includes ending the 'nazi' and 'coupist' nature of the current Ukrainian leaders, reducing the Ukrainian army, preventing Ukraine's accession to NATO, and ending the supposed 'Russophobia' policy of Kiev against the pro-Russian population in eastern Ukraine and against their culture and traditions. Putin considers these conditions necessary to guarantee 'a lasting peace'. The Russian presidential advisor on foreign policy, Yuri Ushakov, stated that the negotiations in Istanbul will start from the point where they were interrupted in March 2022, taking into account the current situation on the ground. Ushakov also mentioned that the composition and level of the Russian delegation will be announced later. Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, stated that 'Putin has made it clear: first conversations about the root causes and then about a ceasefire'. Zelensky has warned that there will be no negotiations until a ceasefire is declared on land, sea, and air. The head of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, Andriy Yermak, reiterated that 'first a 30-day ceasefire and then everything else'. Putin proposed that Kiev resume direct negotiations without preconditions, stating that 'it makes sense to eliminate the deep causes of the conflict and move towards the restoration of a lasting and long-term peace from a historical perspective'. He also mentioned that a real ceasefire, respected by both Russia and Ukraine, would be the first step towards a sustainable peace.

**World Awaits Putin's Decision on Immediate Ceasefire**
The world is waiting for Vladimir Putin to make a clear decision to immediately and unconditionally stop the war, said Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. He was commenting on Putin's proposal for bilateral negotiations with Ukraine from May 15. 'In response to our appeal, the Russians proposed peace talks from May 15. However, the world is waiting for a clear decision on immediate and unconditional ceasefire. Ukraine is ready. There will be no more victims,' Tusk wrote on social media. The leaders of the UK, France, Germany, and Poland, after an online meeting of the Coalition for Ukraine in Kiev on Saturday, emphasized that if Russia refuses to stop the war, sanctions against Russia will be strengthened, and support for Ukraine will increase. Their position is coordinated with the US. US President Donald Trump reacted positively to the events of May 10: 'A potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine! Think of the hundreds of thousands of lives that will be saved when this endless 'bloody bath' comes to an end,' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday morning Kyiv time.

**Putin Proposes 'Serious Negotiations' to Address War with Ukraine**
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed 'serious negotiations' to address the 'roots' of the war with Ukraine, a proposal that was accepted by Ukrainian leaders. Putin wants to address the 'roots' of the conflict to achieve 'a solid and lasting peace'. The negotiations will take place on May 15 in Turkey. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the proposal, saying 'the world has been waiting for this for a long time (...) It doesn't make sense to continue the massacre even for a single day.' However, Zelensky emphasized that a 30-day ceasefire is necessary for any type of negotiation. 'First, a 30-day ceasefire, then everything else,' said Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president's office. The reactions to Putin's proposal have been varied, with US President Donald Trump calling it a 'potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine.' French President Emmanuel Macron was more cautious, saying it's 'a first step, but not enough.' Macron also demanded an immediate ceasefire. Putin announced that he will speak with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday to host the bilateral negotiations.

**Russia Rejects Ceasefire Proposal, Insists on Bilateral Negotiations**
Russia has rejected the proposal to cease fire on May 12, instead insisting on bilateral negotiations on May 15. According to Maria Zakharova, the official representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the reaction of the Ukrainian government to Vladimir Putin's statement was misinterpreted. Zakharova stated, 'It seems that the Bankev (Ukrainian government) didn't read the transcript correctly.' She claimed that Putin had clearly stated that negotiations on the root causes of the conflict must come before discussions on a ceasefire. Zakharova's comments come after the leaders of the 'coalition of willing' warned Russia of additional pressure and increased aid to Ukraine if Putin did not agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire. France's President Emmanuel Macron supported this proposal, stating, 'President Volodymyr Zelensky has taken on the commitment not to make any demands. We expect a clear response from Russia.' Macron emphasized that negotiations cannot take place while the conflict is ongoing, and that a ceasefire is necessary before talks can begin.

**Russia Calls for Ceasefire to Allow Ukraine to 'Catch Its Breath'**
Russia is calling for a ceasefire to allow the Ukrainian army to catch its breath, according to Maria Zaharova, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry. Zaharova stated that Ukraine's President Volodimir Zelenski refused to sign a previously agreed document during a meeting in Paris on December 9, 2019, as part of the Normandy Format. 'He demanded the removal of the provision requiring the withdrawal of all armed forces along the entire contact line, and instead insisted on the withdrawal of forces in only three areas. However, he failed to fulfill even these commitments.' The Normandy Format was a group of states that came together from 2014 to 2022 to resolve the conflict in the Donbas region and the Russo-Ukrainian War. Zaharova also stated that Ukrainian officials admitted in August 2022 that they had no intention of fulfilling their commitments and were instead preparing for war with Russia. 'They confessed that they had been preparing for war with Russia, and that they were being supported by Germany and France in this effort.' Zaharova added that the Minsk process is still ongoing. 'Now, the same countries are calling for a 30-day ceasefire to allow the Ukrainian army to catch its breath and regain its military capabilities, so that it can continue to clash with Russia.'

**Rubio Prepares for Informal NATO Meeting Amid Ongoing Ukraine-Russia Conflict**
US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, is preparing to participate in an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Antalya, Turkey from May 14 to 16, 2025. This meeting comes at a critical time, as international efforts are intensifying to end the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, amidst growing calls for a ceasefire and renewed negotiations. According to a statement from the US Department of State, Rubio will work during the meeting to promote the agenda of US President Donald Trump, which aims to ensure that allies contribute fairly to strengthening NATO and increasing its effectiveness. The meeting will also discuss collective security priorities, including increasing defense investments for allies and developing a strategy to end the Russian-Ukrainian war. These moves come as Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, subject to certain conditions. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Western leaders insist on Russia's commitment to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire before any negotiations can begin. Several European countries, including the UK, France, Germany, and Poland, have expressed support for this position, warning of new sanctions if the ceasefire is not upheld. Rubio's visit to Turkey is his first since taking office, and comes after a tour of Saudi Arabia and Qatar aimed at strengthening bilateral relations and discussing regional challenges. These meetings are expected to pave the way for the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague in June 2025, which will be a critical milestone in efforts to reshape European security and strengthen the alliance's unity in the face of current challenges.

**Trump claims credit for India-Pakistan ceasefire but is 'frustrated' with Russia-Ukraine conflict**
US President Donald Trump has claimed credit for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, stating that the US 'mediated' between the two nations. However, India has clarified that the agreement was reached bilaterally through director general of military operations (DGMO)-level talks initiated by the Pakistani side. Trump expressed pride in the US role in the agreement, saying 'I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision.' Despite this achievement, Trump is reportedly 'frustrated' with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, which he had claimed he would solve within 24 hours as a presidential candidate. Trump has privately acknowledged that Russia is difficult to negotiate with because they 'want the whole thing,' according to sources. US Vice President JD Vance has stated that Moscow is 'asking for too much' to end its war against Kyiv. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed direct talks with Ukraine on May 15 in Istanbul, saying 'It was not Russia that broke off negotiations in 2022. It was Kyiv.'

**Will a 30-day ceasefire be possible in Ukraine?**
European leaders in Kiev on May 10 called for a complete ceasefire 'for at least thirty days' starting on Monday. Donald Trump, who was reached by phone, is now associated with this request. It remains to be seen if Vladimir Putin will accept it and if he will set conditions. Five factors could lead to a truce that would allow peace talks to begin. The US will continue to pursue a bilateral agreement with Russia, but Moscow no longer has the upper hand in the diplomatic game. The parade on May 9 on Red Square, attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping and only one EU leader (Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico), but without a high-ranking US representative, shows that the White House wants to move on. It's now up to Putin to act. European initiatives are no longer hindered by Washington. Putin can continue the fighting or increase military pressure on Ukraine, but he knows he can't win the war and that the Western front will only strengthen as Trump feels humiliated. A thirty-day truce, proposed by Europeans, also corresponds to Russia's official discourse, which has said it is ready to negotiate. This may be the point that most disconcerts Trump and Putin, who thought the united European front would not hold. However, the presence of French, German, British, and Polish leaders in Kiev on May 10 proves the opposite. Their visit is a symbolic response to the grandiose commemorations of the 80th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany held in Moscow on Friday. A new wave of EU sanctions against Russia is being considered, as well as the delivery of German long-range missiles Taurus. The coalition is solid.

**US Rules Out Bilateral Agreements with Russia Until Ceasefire in Ukraine**
The United States has assured that they will not sign any bilateral agreements with Russia until the ceasefire in Ukraine is achieved. According to US State Department spokesperson Temmy Bruce, 'There will be no negotiations, no decisions, no agreements, until this slaughter stops.' Bruce also stated that the US is concerned about who truly wants peace and a ceasefire, citing the recent attack on Sumy on April 13. She described the war in Ukraine as a 'meat grinder' where nothing has changed, and emphasized that the US continues to work towards a ceasefire. The US also maintains that they will not ease sanctions on Russia until the ceasefire is achieved.

**Riyadh Talks: US Seeks Comprehensive Ceasefire in Ukraine, Russia Proposes Bilateral Agenda**
The Russian and Ukrainian delegations, accompanied by American mediators, held secret talks in a Riyadh hotel. The discussions focused on a ceasefire in the Black Sea and the revival of a 2022 grain deal. The US is seeking a comprehensive ceasefire in Ukraine by April 20, but acknowledges that the timeline may be adjusted due to the significant gap between Moscow's and Kiev's positions. The Russian delegation is led by Foreign Minister's deputy and Energy Minister, while the Ukrainian side is headed by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and former President Petro Poroshenko's advisor, Pavel Paliy. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has prepared a list of energy infrastructure objects that Ukraine wants to include in the agreement with Russia. The US envoy, Stephen Wietkoff, expressed optimism about the chances of a Black Sea ceasefire, saying it would 'naturally lead to a full-scale ceasefire.' However, Zelensky did not confirm any possible agreements with Russia. The US is concerned that Ukraine's approach to negotiations is 'local' and lacks a clear vision, while Russia has proposed a comprehensive bilateral agenda. The US believes that Ukraine is trying to deceive Washington by refusing to acknowledge its debt for previously received US aid. The US is also frustrated with Ukraine's refusal to make concessions on key issues, such as the grain deal and energy infrastructure. The US is seeking to establish a long-term partnership with Russia on global issues, including energy policy in the Arctic, maritime routes, and LNG supplies to Europe. However, the conflict in Ukraine is hindering this progress. The US is trying to pressure Ukraine to reach a peaceful agreement with Russia, while Russia is seeking a comprehensive bilateral agenda. The talks in Riyadh are ongoing, and the outcome is uncertain.

**Trump and Putin Agree on 30-Day Ceasefire in Ukraine**
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine to start working towards ending the war that began in February 2022. They defined this in a 90-minute phone conversation and will consider a truce on energy and infrastructure issues. According to the White House summary of the conversation, technical negotiations will begin immediately to implement a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, a total ceasefire, and permanent peace. 'Both leaders agreed that this conflict must end with a lasting peace. They also emphasized the need to improve bilateral relations between the United States and Russia. The money and blood that Ukraine and Russia have spent on this war would be better invested in the needs of their people,' said the note. Trump and Putin 'discussed extensively the potential for cooperation in the Middle East to prevent future conflicts.' They also 'addressed the need to stop the proliferation of strategic weapons and will collaborate with others to ensure their wider application. Both agreed that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel,' highlighted the White House. 'A future with a better bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia offers enormous advantages,' according to Washington. These, according to the statement, 'include significant economic agreements and geopolitical stability once peace is achieved' in Ukraine. 'The application of this proposal could have started a long time ago. Every day in times of war is a matter of human lives,' said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. 'The proposal could have been applied a long time ago. Each day in times of war is a matter of human lives,' said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

**Ukraine Conflict: Ceasefire Proposal, Questions for Putin, Manipulations According to Zelensky**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has denounced 'manipulations' by Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding a proposed ceasefire in Ukraine. Putin stated that 'important questions' need to be addressed before a truce can be implemented, while Trump expressed his desire for the ceasefire to be put in place without delay. Zelensky warned against 'very predictable and manipulative words' from Putin in response to the idea of a ceasefire. Trump stated that 'it would be a very disappointing moment for the world' if Russia rejects the plan for a 30-day suspension of hostilities. The Russian President has expressed his willingness to discuss the proposal with the Americans, but emphasized that 'questions need to be answered' before a truce can be implemented. He questioned how to ensure that the conflict does not resume and how the control would be organized. The Russian government has also rejected the idea of deploying European soldiers as a peacekeeping force in Ukraine, calling it a 'direct armed conflict' with the Russian army. Since the first official phone call between Putin and Trump on February 12, Russia and the US have agreed to review their bilateral relations and resolve the Ukrainian issue as soon as possible. Delegations from both countries have already met in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Trump has repeated Kremlin-backed misinformation, including blaming Ukraine for the Russian assault in February 2022. The Russian forces have retaken territories occupied by Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region, including the town of Sudja, which was a key Ukrainian conquest in the area since the summer of 2024.

**Putin and Trump Discuss Ceasefire in Ukraine, Zelensky Warns Against 'Manipulative Words'**
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that 'important questions' need to be addressed regarding the US proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Donald Trump expressed his desire to implement the ceasefire without delay. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned against 'very predictable and manipulative words' from Putin in response to the idea of a ceasefire. Trump stated that it would be 'very disappointing for the world' if Russia rejected the plan for a 30-day suspension of hostilities. Putin emphasized the need to answer 'important questions' before the implementation of a ceasefire, including how to prevent the conflict from recurring and how to organize control. He also expressed concerns that Ukraine might use the pause to recruit more soldiers and receive new Western arms. 'We are in agreement with the proposals to end hostilities, but we proceed from the principle that this truce must lead to a durable peace and address the deep causes of this crisis,' Putin said. Russia has also rejected the idea of deploying European troops to Ukraine as a peacekeeping force, considering it a 'direct armed conflict' with the Russian army. 'We will respond with all available means,' said Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson. Since the first official phone call between Putin and Trump on February 12, Russia and the US have agreed to review their bilateral relations and resolve the Ukrainian issue as soon as possible. Delegations from both countries have already met in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Trump has repeated Kremlin-fabricated claims, including blaming Ukraine for the Russian assault in February 2022. He has also interrupted military and intelligence aid to Ukraine, which has since been reinstated.

**Putin Ties Ceasefire to Conditions, Raises Questions on Ukraine's Use of Truce**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has tied a proposed 30-day ceasefire in the Ukraine conflict to several conditions. In a press conference after meeting with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, Putin asked rhetorical questions about how Ukraine would use the ceasefire, saying 'Would it be to continue forced mobilization? To continue delivering weapons? To train newly mobilized units? Or none of the above?' He also questioned how 'control and verification' would be ensured, saying 'How can we be guaranteed that this won't happen? How will control be organized?' Putin's statements reflect his goal of 'demilitarizing' Ukraine, which he stated before the 2022 invasion and is now pushing in negotiations for a first ceasefire. Putin also stated that the Russian army is attacking almost everywhere, making it unclear how the situation at the contact line would be resolved during a ceasefire. Russia rejects peacekeeping troops from European countries. Putin emphasized that he is relying on bilateral talks with US President Donald Trump, saying 'The idea of a ceasefire is right, but it requires further discussion with our American colleagues, partners.' Putin said a ceasefire must lead to 'a long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis.' However, this implies further war goals, including 'denazification' of Ukraine, which means establishing a pro-Russian regime in Kiev. Putin also made it clear that he will continue his attack war for now, saying 'We will decide on the next steps to end the conflict based on how the situation develops on the ground.'

**UPDATE 9-Cautious Russia weighs Ukraine ceasefire plan as US tries to seal a deal | Law-Order**
The Kremlin is awaiting details from Washington about a proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine before responding. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hopes a deal will be struck within days. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops are on the verge of losing a foothold. Ukraine's top army commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said fighting continues in the area. The U.S. has agreed to resume weapons supplies and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Rubio said, 'Here's what we'd like the world to look like in a few days: Neither side is shooting at each other, not rockets, not missiles, not bullets, nothing... and the talking starts.' The Kremlin said it was carefully studying the results of a meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia. Russian forces have made gains in Ukraine in 2024, and President Donald Trump has reversed U.S. policy on the war, launching bilateral talks with Moscow and suspending military assistance to Ukraine. Rubio said that Europe would have to be involved in any security guarantee for Ukraine, and that the sanctions Europe has imposed would also be on the table. He also said that Russia could accept the ceasefire unconditionally, but that's what they want to know - whether they're prepared to do it unconditionally.'

**Diplomatic Tug-of-War: Ceasefire Prospects Amidst Ukraine Conflict | Politics**
The Kremlin is evaluating a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, following significant Russian military gains in 2024. U.S. President Donald Trump has initiated bilateral talks with Moscow, calling for Ukraine to contribute to ending the conflict. Kyiv has expressed readiness to support the ceasefire proposal after recent talks in Saudi Arabia. However, Russia seeks assurances that its territorial advances, particularly in Ukraine's Kursk region, are acknowledged. The U.S. anticipates detailed feedback from Russia's senior officials regarding ceasefire conditions, with collaboration from European stakeholders.

**US and Ukraine Draft Ceasefire Proposal for Russia**
After over eight hours of negotiations in the Saudi city of Yeda, Ukrainian and US high-ranking officials drafted a ceasefire proposal that will be delivered to Russia. If accepted, the truce will apply immediately to the entire front and both sides for 30 days, renewable 'on land, sea, and air.' Now it's up to the Kremlin to respond. So far, Moscow has refused to comment, waiting to receive information from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Following Russia's advances in 2024, US President Donald Trump shifted US policy, initiating bilateral talks with Moscow and, after suspending military aid and intelligence sharing, pressuring Ukraine to end the conflict, as stated by Rubio, 'It was a great day when we were able to put an end to the conflict'.

**Sergueï Lavrov: 'No ceasefire in Ukraine, no illusions about Donald Trump'**
Russian Foreign Minister Sergueï Lavrov held a press conference to discuss the state of Russian diplomacy in 2024. In response to questions, Lavrov expressed his views on the Ukrainian crisis and the prospects for relations with the United States under the administration of Donald Trump. Lavrov reiterated Russia's fundamental positions on several major geopolitical issues, emphasizing the increasingly complex nature of international relations and Russia's continued defense of its interests. On the Ukrainian question, Lavrov criticized the lack of concrete engagement from Kiev and its Western allies for a peaceful resolution, stating that 'despite growing speeches on the need for peace talks, there is no real action showing a genuine willingness to negotiate.' He also recalled that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had legally prohibited any negotiations with Moscow, as per a decree signed in September 2022. Lavrov stated that the West's strategy is to maintain the active conflict to weaken Russia, and that Russia is opposed to a ceasefire or temporary truce, as it would be exploited by the West to rearm Kiev. He emphasized that Russia insists on legally binding agreements guaranteeing the absence of renewed hostilities. Lavrov also noted that the negotiations initiated in 2022, including those in Minsk and Istanbul, could serve as a basis for a future settlement, but only if they take into account the new realities on the ground. Regarding relations between Moscow and Washington after Trump's election, Lavrov was cautious, stating that 'the Russian-American relations under the Biden administration have deteriorated to the extreme and are now on the brink of collapse.' While Trump's return to the White House in December 2024 has raised hopes, Lavrov remains realistic, stating that 'we are not making illusions.' He qualified Trump's goal of relaunching a direct dialogue between Moscow and Washington as 'praiseworthy,' but emphasized that 'if the Americans take into account our interests, the dialogue can be restored gradually. Otherwise, everything will remain as it is.' He also stressed the importance of restoring the functioning of embassies in Moscow and Washington for a resumption of effective bilateral relations.
