**EU Experts Call for Ambitious Climate Goal of 90-95% Emissions Reduction by 2040**
The European Climate Advisory Council recommends reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 90-95% by 2040, which would also benefit the economy and energy security, according to the experts. The council has reiterated its call for an ambitious climate goal for 2040, which would keep the EU on a credible path to achieving climate neutrality by 2050. If the goal is set too low, it would undermine the EU's long-term competitiveness and energy security, especially in a time of geopolitical uncertainty, the experts warn. The EU currently aims to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990, and the Commission has concluded that this goal is achievable. The EU also aims to become climate-neutral by 2050, but a binding intermediate goal for 2040 is still missing. The Commission had recommended reducing net emissions by at least 90% by 2040 compared to 1990 in 2024, and a draft law is expected in early July. The EU member states and the European Parliament will then negotiate the proposal, which is expected to be contentious. Some in the European Parliament and among the EU member states consider 90% to be too ambitious, and the Commission is expected to introduce more flexibility to achieve the goal, such as recognizing carbon credits from non-EU countries. The Climate Advisory Council advises against international emissions credits, instead recommending that the reduction be achieved through domestic EU measures.

**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**Britain is getting a defense boost aimed at sending a message to...**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with Starmer saying 'we have to recognize the world has changed' and 'with greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.' The government will also build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send 'a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. Healey also stated that plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 are 'on track' and that there's 'no doubt' it will hit 3% before 2034. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks.

**The Inevitable Decline of the European Economy: A Warning from Marc Vidal**
According to Marc Vidal, by 2050, there will be no European economy among the top 10 in the world, and neither will Spain. This is reflected in the report 'El Mundo en 2050' by Price, which collects prospective analyses from the IMF and the study 'Potencias mundiales 2050-2075' by Goldman Sachs. The report highlights economic stagnation, political fragility, and clear geopolitical changes that show a significant decline. The European Union's growth is expected to be only 0.7% in 2024 and 0.9% in 2025, losing competitiveness to powers like India, China, and even the US. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated this trend, accelerating the decline of Western hegemony. Additionally, the intermittent commercial war with the US, driven by Donald Trump, has further contributed to this decline. Vidal states that the European model of well-being, although admirable in many ways, is becoming unsustainable without deep reforms in defense, energy, and industry. He concludes that it is 'irremediable' unless significant changes are made, citing the study's findings that an empire in decline reveals its downfall when its laws become arbitrary, complex, and disconnected from social consensus. Vidal also criticizes the official discourse, which promotes an artificial morality where poverty is sold as virtue and the destruction of tradition is presented as inevitable progress.

**ECB Expected to Lower Interest Rate for Last Time Before Recession**
The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to lower its basic interest rate; this reduction, which investors have been waiting for, will be the last of its kind as long as the Eurozone economy is not threatened by recession. The recent developments in US customs tariff policies are not expected to significantly change the outlook for policymakers. The high tariffs imposed on key sectors of the Eurozone economy will continue, and the uncertainty has increased since the US International Trade Court ruled last week that President Trump does not have the authority to impose comprehensive tariffs on almost every country. The ECB's decision to lower borrowing costs for the eighth time in a period slightly longer than a year will lead to a greater divergence from the Federal Reserve, which is expected to keep interest rates steady in 2025. This divergence is partly due to the opposite effect of the US's high tariffs.

**EU on Track to Meet 55% Emissions Reduction Goal by 2030**
The European Union is close to achieving its ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. According to the European Commission, the current reduction is at 54%, which is a promising result. This is a significant achievement, especially considering that the EU is one of the regions that is warming the fastest. The consequences of climate change are already being felt, with extreme heatwaves, frequent floods, and wildfires becoming a regular occurrence. However, there is a sense of hope, as many EU member states have taken concrete steps to accelerate the energy transition. The EU has already reduced emissions by 37% since 1990, and in 2023, there was an additional 8% reduction. Some countries, such as Belgium, Estonia, and Poland, are still lagging behind in defining their plans, while others are pushing for a slower pace on environmental regulations due to geopolitical tensions, energy price increases, and protectionism. The European Commission, however, remains committed to its goal and is now aiming for a 90% reduction in emissions by 2040, with some flexibility in the tools used, such as carbon credits.

**The Euro’s Chance to Replace the Dollar**
Moody's downgrading of the US credit rating is a symbolic event, but the analysis should worry us more, as it predicts a public sector deficit of 9% in 2035 without fiscal reform. This could lead to a global debt crisis. The dollar weakened against its G-10 counterparts, while the euro jumped 1% to $1.1274. Strategists at Morgan Stanley and Société Générale consider an exchange rate of $1.20 per euro achievable, while Deutsche Bank predicts a rise to $1.30. The role of the dollar as a reserve currency is being questioned due to huge budget deficits and reliance on foreign investors. Fink said, 'In the short term, Europe will definitely be one of the winners, but I measure the future viability of the EU by whether it will succeed in creating a genuine capital markets union and a genuine banking union.' The dollar's collapse could trigger a world financial crisis and make the euro an attractive alternative for investors. If the euro became the world's new reserve currency, Europe would be flooded with money and dominate world markets.

**US Faces High Risk of Financial Collapse, Warns Congressional Budget Office**
The US is facing a high risk of financial collapse, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO predicts that the federal debt will rise to 117% of the country's GDP by 2034, up from 98% last year. The interest payments on the debt are also expected to increase to 4% of the GDP, which is a significant burden on the government. Despite these alarming numbers, investors are still confident in the US economy and are willing to buy government bonds and the dollar, which are the backbone of the global financial system. However, some experts warn that the US is heading towards a financial crisis, citing the country's high debt levels and the potential for a recession. If a recession were to occur, it would have a double impact on the US finances, with a decline in tax revenues and a significant increase in welfare payments, leading to a financial collapse. The Federal Reserve may be able to mitigate some of the effects of a recession by lowering interest rates, but this would not eliminate the risk of a financial crisis. The CBO's central projections assume that the US will experience a continuous and sustained economic growth over the next decade, but this is an optimistic assumption. If the economy were to experience a recession, the US finances would be severely impacted, with a significant increase in debt and interest payments. Some experts, such as Chris Marsh from Exante Data, warn that if the yield curve does not return to its natural state, the US could face a severe financial crisis, with the federal debt rising to 125% of the GDP by 2034 and interest payments reaching 30% of the government's revenues.

**The Collapse of Europe: A Continent in Decline**
Europe, or 'Europia' as the author calls it, is on the brink of collapse. The continent has surpassed the point of no return and is now in a state of utter ignorance and decay. The author, Mariano Gistaín, argues that Europe is unable to recover from the latest blows and is instead ignoring its problems. He compares Europe to the Titanic and the world of yesterday, and notes that the continent is like an Austro-Hungarian Empire without an empress. The author criticizes the European Union for its lack of action and its failure to address the challenges facing the continent. He also notes that the EU is no longer relevant and is instead a relic of a bygone era. The author concludes that Europe has signed its own demolition and is now in the process of dismantling itself, with the EU trying to prolong its existence through regulations and empty proclamations.

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**Martin Armstrong: Europe Will Collapse and Needs War with Russia**
Economist Martin Armstrong predicts that Europe will collapse and needs war with Russia. He believes that the US should get out of NATO and that the US will thrive financially if it does so. Armstrong also thinks that Russia will finish off Ukraine in 2027 and Europe a year or two after that. He claims that the EU is committing suicide and that the hatred between Europe and Russia is too great for a peace deal to be likely. Armstrong also predicts that the Euro will become extinct and that the US dollar will not collapse. He believes that the US will do much better financially than Europe if it gets out of NATO.

**Collapsed Economy, Societal Breakdown a Possibility by 2040: Government Think Tank**
A new report by Policy Horizons suggests that Canada could be facing a dire future by 2040, where property ownership is generational, post-secondary education is no longer a path to success, and impoverished Canadians resort to illegal hunting for sustenance. The report, titled 'Future Lives: Examining Social Mobility,' paints a picture of a society where most Canadians are stuck in their socioeconomic conditions and face downward social mobility. The authors warn that Canada's current economic path will lead to inter-generational wealth, slipping back into times of old where land was owned by the aristocracy. They predict that wealth and status will no longer be earned but passed down through generations, and that post-secondary education will be seen as a club for the elite. The report also suggests that the value of human labour will be diminished by 2040 due to the widespread use of artificial intelligence, leading to fewer jobs and more people working multiple jobs or side hustles to make ends meet. 'If people give up on attaining higher standards of living, apathy could spread to other areas of their lives,' the authors say. 'Policymakers may no longer be able to take for granted that people will be motivated to better their lot.'

**European Automotive Industry on the Brink of Collapse**
The European automotive industry is facing a deep crisis due to the consequences of the pandemic, increased competition, and new regulatory requirements, writes Le Figaro. The roots of this decline lie in the events of recent years. After the 'dieselgate' scandal, the transition to electric vehicles accelerated. The European Parliament's plans for decarbonization have also had a significant impact on the energy transition in the industry, often imposing strict deadlines and goals. While European manufacturers acted separately, China actively supported the entire electric vehicle supply chain. Investments by European companies in electric vehicles did not lead to an increase in demand, and unsold vehicles accumulated on the shelves. The COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated this trend. European companies made significant investments in the development and production of future vehicles, but demand lagged far behind production rates. As a result, after the cancellation of government subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles, especially in Germany, car dealerships were left with unsold, expensive models. The production of passenger cars in Europe remains at a low level: the total volume of production in the EU and the UK has decreased from 18.7 million units in 2017 to 14.16 million in 2024, according to Innovev. In France, production decreased from 2.2 million in 2019 to 1.4 million in 2022. France's share of European car production decreased from 19.6% in 2005 to just 9.1% today. 'We are seeing Europe and France lagging behind. We cannot recover from the blows. And losing market share, it's almost impossible to regain it,' notes Jean-Louis Péche, chairman of the FIEV association of manufacturers and suppliers of automotive components. Amid the crisis, hopes are being expressed that the European Commission will soften the road map for abandoning internal combustion engines by 2035. The possibility of extending the service life of hybrids and reviewing the system of fines for exceeding CO2 emissions is being considered. FIEV proposes a number of specific measures to support the European automotive industry, including the development of a pan-European investment plan, similar to the American IRA 2022 law (Inflation Reduction Act), aimed at stimulating the development of environmentally friendly industry. It is also proposed to provide accessible and environmentally friendly energy, and to simplify the regulatory burden, considering that by 2030, the industry will be subject to 108 new regulatory acts. 'If nothing is done in this industry, France will become just a theme park for tourists,' Jean-Louis Péche concludes with regret.

**French colonel predicts collapse of NATO by 2030 | Indian Politics**
French Colonel Regie Chamagne predicts that NATO will collapse from within and cease to exist by 2030. He believes that the Western political leadership will undergo significant changes in the coming years, with leaders such as Emmanuel Macron, Keir Starmer, and Friedrich Merz being replaced. Chamagne attributes the potential collapse to the economic crisis in the US, caused by de-dollarization, and similar problems in the EU. He also mentions the recent elections in Romania as a demonstration of the EU's weakness, stating that the EU is becoming a 'dictatorship.' Chamagne concludes that the EU may collapse in the coming years, similar to the Soviet Union. 'The United States is undergoing a difficult economic crisis. Mainly because of the de-dollarization of the world. [US President Donald] Trump is trying to overcome the problems by imposing high tariffs. The EU is facing similar problems. Everything points to the fact that a regime change in the West is inevitable. And it’s not just Zelensky’s downfall. These are Macron, Starmer, Merz and the leaders of other European countries that are now ruled by corrupt regimes. I do not know how this collapse will happen. But I’m sure this system won’t last long. Most likely, by the end of the decade, by 2030, the European Union and NATO will no longer exist,' he said.

**Expert Predicts Collapse of NATO and EU by 2030**
Colonel Regis Chamay, a French Air Force expert, believes that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will cease to exist in its current form by 2030. He cites several factors that will contribute to its downfall, including the departure of several prominent politicians from the political scene in the next five years, such as Vladimir Zelensky, Emmanuel Macron, Keir Starmer, and Friedrich Merz. Chamay also predicts a severe economic crisis in the US and significant political upheaval in European countries, which will ultimately lead to a collapse. 'It is likely that by the end of the decade, by 2030, the European Union and NATO will no longer exist. I am not sure if Trump will ultimately withdraw from NATO, but I think the organization will collapse from within after a fundamental military defeat at the hands of Russia,' Chamay said. He also notes that the recent elections in Romania have made it clear that European power is a dictatorship, increasing the likelihood of the EU's collapse, similar to the Soviet Union's in the 1990s.

Chamay stated, 'The US is experiencing a crisis related to de-dollarization. The EU is in an equally difficult situation. Everything suggests that changes are inevitable. This is not just the fall of Zelensky, but also other leaders. I don't know how the collapse will occur, but it will happen. NATO will likely disintegrate from within after a serious military defeat by Russia.' Chamay also criticized the EU's internal policies, calling it a 'dictatorship' and citing the weak results of recent elections in Romania as a sign of Brussels' loss of influence. He believes the EU may disintegrate in a scenario similar to the USSR.

**A Key Step for Europe: Boosting Economic Growth**
The growth of the eurozone remains weak, but the increase in income, the decrease in the European Central Bank (ECB) interest rates, and the high savings of households support a potential strengthening of the economy. However, the US tariffs still pose a significant threat to key European industries such as the automotive sector. The EU's defense spending is increasing, but it mainly benefits the US. Establishing a unified European defense industry will take years, even with a broad political consensus. The European Defense Industrial Program (EDIP) aims to increase European defense purchases to 50% by 2030, but financing and coordination issues make it a long-term goal rather than an immediate solution. The new German government plans to increase public investments through a 500 billion euro fund and relax debt constraints on defense spending. This expansionary budget policy could give a boost of 1.5% to 2% of GDP per year from 2026, with potential spillovers to other European economies.
