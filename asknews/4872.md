**Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Company Will Be Worth Over $5 Trillion in 10 Years**
Nvidia is expected to reach a market value of over $5 trillion in 10 years, according to a prediction. The company's revenue grew by 114% to $130.5 billion in fiscal 2025, and is forecast to increase by 52.8% and 23.9% in fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027, respectively. Nvidia's dominance in the AI market has allowed it to steadily expand its margins, with a net income margin of 55.8% in fiscal 2025. The company's software ecosystem, including its CUDA parallel programming platform and TensorRT software package, has become a strong moat, making it difficult for competitors to switch to their chips. Nvidia has also partnered with Humain and is playing a key role in the Stargate Project, which could be significant growth catalysts for the company. With its upcoming AI initiatives, such as Sovereign AI, agentic AI, and physical AI, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue growing and reaching new heights. 'It is reasonable to expect Nvidia to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next decade,' according to the prediction. 'If it does, it would wind up with about $808 billion in revenues in its fiscal 2035.' With a top line of $808 billion, Nvidia would produce a net income of around $225 billion that year. Assuming a valuation multiple of 23.5x for the next 10 years, the company can reach a market value of $5.29 trillion by 2035.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment,' the report reads. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer.'

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.
