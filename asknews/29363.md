**Google's Business Internship Program 2025: A Great Opportunity for Students**
Google has opened a new call for its Business Internship Program 2025, which is open to students until May 19. The program is for students in marketing, sales, communications, or related fields, with a graduation date between February and June 2026. The internship will last 8 months and will be held in Google's Buenos Aires offices in person. 'This is a great opportunity for students to demonstrate their talent, apply their knowledge, develop professional skills, and improve their English in a work environment,' said Google. Interns will work on 'challenging and innovative projects, surrounded by teams that drive growth and transformation at Google.' Interested individuals can register on Google Careers to apply. Once the registration period closes, they will receive updates on the next steps in their registered email. 'Throughout the 8 months, they will participate in practical training, collaborate with multidisciplinary teams, face real challenges that enrich the experience, and develop professional skills and problem-solving skills,' said Google. 'In addition to developing professional skills and problem-solving skills, they will contribute to high-impact projects and build a valuable network of contacts within the organization.' The areas of internship are usually related to sales, support and services, business strategy, technology, marketing and communications. Each profile will be evaluated to assign each student to the most suitable team, taking into account their curriculum and preferences,' concluded Google.

**Time For Complete Alphabet breakup To Boost Google Stock, Says Analyst**
D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria believes that Alphabet (GOOGL) should be broken up to maximize total shareholder value. He argues that investors want a complete breakup, not isolated spinoffs, and that the company is headed towards an eventual spinoff of its advertising network and possibly Chrome/Android to appease the Department of Justice. Luria notes that a breakup would cause dis-synergies, but investors are more interested in total shareholder value than short-term profits. He also points out that the company's business model is being threatened by new artificial-intelligence-driven competition from OpenAI's ChatGPT, and that Google's search ad revenue growth could persist despite this competition. Google stock rose 3% to 157.34 in morning trades, despite a 16% decline in 2025. Luria's comments come amid two Department of Justice antitrust cases against Alphabet, one focusing on the internet search business and the other on its advertising business.

**Unicredit's Orcel: 'We will exit Russia by mid-2026' and re-evaluate Banco BPM offer**
Unicredit's CEO, Andrea Orcel, has stated that the bank will exit Russia by mid-2026. He also criticized Banco BPM's deal with Anima, calling it 'distruttivo di valore'. Orcel said that Unicredit is re-evaluating its offer for Banco BPM, and that the current offer is 'a premio del 40 o al 50%' and therefore unlikely to be re-launched. The bank's quarterly results showed a profit of 2.77 billion euros, exceeding expectations. Orcel also mentioned that Unicredit is positioned for a series of inorganic possibilities, but will only pursue those that can improve its standalone investment case. The bank's CEO also announced a memorandum of understanding with Google Cloud to accelerate its digital transformation.

**US seeks breakup of Google's ad tech empire**
The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking the breakup of Google's digital advertising business, specifically the sale of its AdX marketplace and DFP ad-serving platform. This follows a federal judge's finding that Google held illegal monopolies in two online ad-tech markets. Google opposes forced divestitures, arguing that they would harm publishers and advertisers, and instead supports behavioral changes to promote competition. Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of Regulatory Affairs, stated, 'The DOJ's additional proposals to force a divestiture of our ad tech tools go well beyond the Court's findings, have no basis in law, and would harm publishers and advertisers.' Alphabet shares fell nearly 1.1 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday. AdX and DFP are essential tools for publishers and content providers to monetize digital inventory, and Google had previously offered to sell AdX to settle a European Union antitrust investigation, but the offer was rejected by publishers.

**Google abbandona Nest in Europa: smart home a rischio**
Google's decision to exit the European market for Nest smart home devices has raised concerns among users. Starting October 25, 2025, owners of first and second-generation thermostats will lose access to key features, including remote control through the app, Home/Away mode, and software updates. Only manual control on the device will be available, limiting the effectiveness of smart functions that made these products popular. To mitigate discontent, Google has offered significant discounts for upgrading to newer models, but this promotion is not available in Europe, where Google has decided to completely stop selling new models. Users in Europe will only be able to purchase the third-generation Nest and the Nest Thermostat E, outdated models. This decision raises doubts about Google's commitment to investing in the European market, further fragmenting an already fragmented market and eroding consumer trust in smart home technology. Moreover, it highlights an important environmental issue: devices that are still functional are being pushed to obsolescence, contributing to the increase in electronic waste. This is a paradox, considering that many smart products were promoted for their positive environmental impact. If technology is not supported in the long term, initial benefits are quickly cancelled out by a logic of continuous consumption.

**So is the DOJ breaking Google up or what?**
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has proposed dramatic remedies in a case where Google has been found to maintain an illegal monopoly in the online advertising space. The DOJ wants Google to sell off its online ad marketplace, Ad Exchange, and ad management platform, Google Ad Manager. Google is opposed to the changes, arguing that a forced divestiture is both legally and practically unfeasible. The company has proposed its own remedies, which are much more limited in scope than the DOJ's. The case has been ongoing since 2023 and still likely won't conclude for months or even years. Depending on how the case unfolds, Google may be forced to sell off important pieces of its advertising business and its browser, consequences that would have serious implications for how the company would operate going forward.

**The End of Google Search, Facebook, and iPhone: Is it Near?**
Google, Facebook (now Meta), and Apple have revolutionized the way we live in the digital world over the past 20 years, becoming an integral part of our daily lives. However, their central role is being increasingly questioned. According to Bloomberg, the top executives of these big tech companies have publicly admitted that the technologies that made them famous are losing their appeal and relevance. The decline of Google searches from Apple devices, the decrease in Facebook friendship requests, and predictions of a future without iPhone are just a few signs. According to Gartner, search engine usage may decrease by 25% by 2026, with more users relying on chatbots and artificial intelligence tools for answers and information. Facebook is also experiencing a drastic reduction in friend interactions and new connections, especially among young people: only 32% of US teenagers claim to use Facebook, compared to 71% ten years ago. The iPhone, although still the second best-selling smartphone in the world in the first quarter of 2025, is starting to show signs of fatigue, with Apple itself looking beyond traditional smartphones.

**Google cofounder Sergey Brin settles with the family of a pilot killed in a plane crash**
Google cofounder Sergey Brin has settled a lawsuit with the family of Dean Rushfeldt, a pilot who died in a plane crash in May 2023. The lawsuit claimed the crash was caused by a failure in the plane's fuel equipment. The settlement is 'pending the exchange of closing documents and disbursement of the settlement fund,' and is expected to be completed in about 60 days. The family of Rushfeldt had alleged multiple counts of negligence against Brin, his private family office Bayshore Global, and several related entities. Google was also named in the original complaint, but was later dismissed from the suit. The widow of the other pilot, Lance Maclean, had filed a separate lawsuit against Brin and Bayshore, but it was dismissed with prejudice in January 2025.

**Google Under Siege: A Blow to Mozilla Firefox**
The US Department of Justice (DoJ) is considering measures to break up Google's monopoly on search and online advertising. If implemented, this could have a devastating impact on Mozilla Firefox, which relies heavily on Google for 85% of its revenue. Eric Mulhaupt, Mozilla's financial director, has expressed concerns that the loss of this partnership would be 'scary' for the organization. Without Google's revenue, Mozilla would have to significantly cut costs, including development of Firefox. Mulhaupt warned that without funding, the browser would lose its appeal, with fewer updates and features, making it impossible to compete with Chrome and Edge. A potential solution could be to switch to Bing from Microsoft, but this is unlikely to generate the same revenue as Google. As a result, the DoJ's efforts to break up Google's monopoly may inadvertently kill off the independent Firefox browser. 'The paradox of the situation is that the state, trying to destroy Google's monopoly, may inadvertently kill... independent Firefox,' said Mulhaupt. The DoJ is still considering the case, but if the measures are implemented, the digital ecosystem will lose two pillars: Google and Mozilla Firefox.

**US expands attempts teardown of Google's ad technology**
The U.S. Justice Department is seeking to break up Google's digital ad network by forcing the company to part with its AdX business and DFP ad platform. The proposal, filed in a Virginia federal court, aims to punish Google for abusing its market power to stifle competition. Google has vowed to oppose the proposal, arguing that it would cause 'economic chaos and technological dysfunction' and harm millions of advertisers and publishers. Instead, Google has proposed a plan to bring more transparency to its ad network and foster more competition. The attempt to tear down Google's ad network comes on top of the Justice Department's ongoing effort to separate Google's Chrome browser from its dominant search engine. If successful, it would be the biggest breakup of a U.S. company since AT&T was forced to spin off its phone service in 1974. Google's digital ad network generated $265 billion in revenue last year, making it a key cog in the company's business. Google is also facing threats to its search engine and Play Store for apps, which were declared illegal monopolies in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's VP of regulatory affairs, stated, 'The DOJ's additional proposals to force a divestiture of our ad tech tools go well beyond the Court's findings, have no basis in law, and would harm publishers and advertisers.' The trial is set to begin on September 22, 2025, with both sides presenting their proposed remedies.

**US DOJ Proposes Breaking Up Google Over Search Engine Dominance**
The US Department of Justice has proposed breaking up Google, citing its dominance in the online search market. The proposal, made in a three-week hearing, suggests that Google be forced to sell its Chrome web browser, end its exclusive search engine agreements with smartphone manufacturers, and grant competitors access to its data. This would weaken Google's control over the search engine market. The DOJ has not taken such action against any US company since breaking up AT&T in 1982. Google responded that the proposal would come at a critical time, hindering US innovation in AI as it faces intense competition from China. 'This is a critical moment for the US to develop AI,' said Google. 'Breaking us up would only serve to hinder American innovation and make it harder for the US to compete with China.'

**US Seeks to Break Up Google for Online Search and AI Dominance**
The US Department of Justice is seeking to break up Google for its dominance in online search and AI. 'Today marks the final chapter of this historic case,' said Gail Slater, head of the antitrust department at the US Department of Justice, before adding, 'the future of the internet is at stake.' The California-based company was found guilty of illegal practices to establish and maintain its monopoly in online search by Judge Amit Mehta in the summer of 2024. The judge is now re-examining the case before deciding on the penalty to be imposed on the company. The authorities are seeking to have Google separate from Chrome, the world's most used internet browser, as it is a major access point to the search engine, undermining the chances of potential competitors. They are also asking the judge to ban the company from signing agreements with Apple, Samsung, and other smartphone manufacturers to install Google by default. Without Chrome, 'Google would lose a huge source of data on consumer searches and online behavior,' comments Yory Wurmser, analyst at Emarketer. The goal of these measures is not only to give consumers more choices but also to provide competitors with the data they need to create an equally effective search engine, adds Wurmser. Google has described these demands as 'radical' in November 2024. 'The approach of the Ministry of Justice would lead to unprecedented government overreach that would harm consumers, developers, and small American businesses and put the world's economic and technological leadership at risk,' said Kent Walker, Google's global affairs president. For Gail Slater, a breakup is necessary to promote innovation at a time when competition is raging in AI. The emergence of interfaces such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google) represents the greatest threat to Google's dominance in online search since its creation, as chatbots are now able to respond to all sorts of user questions... including those they would have previously asked the internet leader. The Mountain View-based company is increasingly integrating AI-generated content to respond directly to internet users in Google. The US prosecutor wants to prevent the company from transforming its current monopoly into another one, as OpenAI and other startups, such as Perplexity AI, try to compete in AI-enhanced online search.

**Google Faces Possibility of Breakup After US Judge Rules Monopoly**
Google is facing the possibility of being broken up after a US judge ruled that the company has a monopoly on web search and has used unfair methods to defend it against competitors. The US Department of Justice is now calling for the separation of Google's Chrome browser business. Google is fighting against this, citing the previous ruling that it has a monopoly on web search. The case will continue in a follow-up trial in Washington, starting on April 21, 2025, to determine the consequences of the ruling. As the US Department of Justice stated, 'the breakup of Google could be a possibility'.

**Google Confirms Layoffs in 'Platforms & Devices' Division**
Google has confirmed that it will be laying off hundreds of employees in the 'Platforms & Devices' division, which includes the teams responsible for Android, Chrome, and Pixel. This move comes after a voluntary departure plan was proposed in January 2025. According to a statement from Google, the layoffs are part of an effort to 'become more agile and function more effectively' since the merger of the Platforms and Devices teams last year. The company stated, 'Since the merger of the Platforms and Devices teams last year, we have been working to become more agile and function more effectively, which has involved job eliminations in addition to the voluntary departure program we proposed in January.' The layoffs are expected to have little impact on consumers, with Google's ambitions for its products remaining unchanged. This is not the first time Google has undergone significant layoffs, with Alphabet, its parent company, laying off 12,000 employees in January 2023, representing 6% of its workforce. Google had previously laid off hundreds of employees in January 2024, who were responsible for selling online ads. The company's proposal of voluntary departures in January aims to address criticism of the previous layoffs.

**Despite Google's Efforts To Prevent A Breakup, The DOJ Remains Firm In Its Push To Make The Company Sell Off Chrome**
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) remains firm in its push to make Google sell off Chrome, despite the company's efforts to prevent a breakup. According to the DOJ's final proposed remedy, Google would be restricted from setting its search engine as the default option for platforms and devices, and would be required to provide notifications prior to new ventures or collaborations. The proposal also suggests that Google should divest its Chrome browser and potentially the Android operating system. The case is a landmark for being one of the aggressive antitrust actions and the far-reaching implications it would have on the industry. Hearings for the proposal are scheduled for April 2025, and the proposed breakup of Google might happen in August 2025.

Google met with US government representatives to urge them to reconsider the idea of breaking up the company. According to a source familiar with the situation, Google expressed concerns that potential measures, including the sale of separate divisions, could harm the US economy and national security. A Google spokesperson confirmed the meeting, stating that the company regularly interacts with regulators and discusses the details of the antitrust investigation. The US Department of Justice has proposed several possible solutions in the antitrust case related to Google's search business, including the sale of the Chrome browser and the termination of agreements that make Google the default search engine on Apple devices. The court hearings on the possible measures are scheduled to begin in April, with a final decision expected in August.

**US Department of Justice Proposes Breaking Up Google's Dominance in Online Search Market**
The US Department of Justice has proposed a plan to break up Google's dominance in the online search market. The plan, which was submitted on October 8, 2024, suggests that Google sell off parts of its business, including Chrome browser, Android operating system, and AdWords advertising platform, due to its alleged monopoly in the online search market. This move is based on a previous ruling by a US federal judge that Google has engaged in anti-competitive practices. The DOJ is considering a range of remedies, including requiring Google to license its AI technology to competitors, allowing websites to choose whether to use Google's AI products, and requiring Google to provide more information to advertisers about where their ads will appear. Google has responded to the proposal, calling it 'radical' and saying that it goes beyond the specific legal issues at hand. The company argues that its search engine is popular because of its quality, and that it faces intense competition from Amazon and other websites. The potential breakup of Google would have far-reaching consequences, including a significant impact on the global tech industry and the loss of billions of dollars in revenue for Alphabet, Google's parent company.

**Google Offers Voluntary Departure Option to 'Platforms & Devices' Team Members**
Google is offering employees in its 'Platforms & Devices' team the option to leave voluntarily and receive a severance package in return. This move, reported by 9to5Google, is aimed at employees in the US. The 'Platforms & Devices' team is responsible for various projects, including Android, Chrome, Fitbit, and Pixel smartphones. This offer comes after Google merged several teams in April 2024 to create a larger department, sparking concerns among employees that jobs might be cut. As Rick Osterloh, Google's manager, wrote in an internal email published by 9to5Google, 'In this team, there is an enormous dynamism.' He emphasized the importance of full engagement and focus on developing great products quickly and efficiently. This move follows Google's mass layoffs in January 2024, which affected several hundred employees, mostly from the former Hardware team. Google had previously laid off employees in various departments in 2023 to reduce its workforce, which had grown from 119,000 to 187,000 employees worldwide between 2019 and 2022.
