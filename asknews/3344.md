**Changes in Switzerland in June**
In June, several changes will take place in Switzerland. The country's egg import quota will be increased by 50% on June 1, 2025, allowing for the import of up to 10,000 additional eggs at a lower customs rate. According to the Federal Council, this change is necessary because domestic production cannot meet the increased demand. 'This decision was necessary, as national production cannot cover the increase in demand alone,' explains the Federal Council. Additionally, Swisscom will lower its prices for international calls and SMS, with a maximum reduction of 66% depending on the country. The company will also introduce new data packages for international roaming, with 1 gigabyte of data costing 5.90 francs in the EU, UK, and US. The CFF will also expand its summer train connections to Italy, including a direct train from Zurich to Sestri Levante and Pisa. Swiss Airlines will also introduce new flights to Montpellier, Heringsdorf, and Niš. Finally, the Schengen Information System will undergo legislative changes on June 15, 2025, which will include the introduction of the ETIAS travel authorization system for non-EU citizens.

**Egg prices have plummeted since Trump took office  --  after hitting...**
The price of eggs has dropped by 61% since President Donald Trump took office, from $6.49 per dozen in January 2021 to $2.52 per dozen in the most recent data from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The decline is attributed to weaker demand and a lull in new cases of bird flu, which has affected over 166 million birds since 2022, resulting in an average loss of 42.3 million egg layers per year. According to Bernt Nelson, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Foundation, this equates to about 11% of the five-year average annual layer inventory of 383 million hens. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirms that the effects of the outbreak continue today, with 43 outbreaks in layer flocks in 10 states. As a result, the US has increased imports of eggs from Turkey, Brazil, and South Korea to increase supplies.

**US Egg Prices Fall 61% Since January Amid Avian Flu Outbreak**
According to USDA data, the price of eggs in the US has fallen by 61% since January, from $8 to $2.52 per dozen, despite the impact of the avian flu outbreak. The price of eggs reached its historical maximum last year due to the outbreak, which severely affected production and supply chains, forcing producers to increase costs. However, with the USDA working to contain the virus and prevent further losses, the market has seen a significant decrease in prices. As Bernt Nelson, economist at the American Farm Bureau Foundation, noted, the average loss per bird affected by the virus is approximately 11%, equivalent to around 383 million laying hens since the outbreak began. The USDA has increased imports from countries such as Turkey, Brazil, and South Korea to meet demand, and the Egg Markets Overview report notes that 43 outbreaks have been confirmed in flocks of laying hens in 10 states.

**600 Hens Up for Adoption in Thorigné-d'Anjou**
On June 5, 2025, the association La Voix des Poules will hold a sale of 600 reformed hens at Thorigné-d'Anjou, near Angers (Maine-et-Loire). The operation aims to save these 18-month-old hens, which are destined for slaughter, by finding them a new home with private individuals. These aged hens, which come from professional farms, are still capable of laying eggs. A solidarity price will be applied to encourage adoption. This initiative is also beneficial for the environment, as each hen can consume up to 150 kg of organic waste per year. Reservations are mandatory online through the La Voix des Poules website, and the exact location of the event will be communicated by email to those who have reserved.

**Switzerland to allow more egg imports as of June 1**
Switzerland will increase the import quota of eggs from June 1 due to high demand. According to market data, per capita consumption of eggs increased by 9% to 198 eggs per year from 2023 to 2024. However, production only increased by 2.8% during this period, resulting in a need for additional imports. The government will allow a maximum of 10,000 additional eggs to be imported at a reduced rate of duty until the end of the year. This decision comes as the Swiss egg producers are unable to meet the demand. Meanwhile, the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) will change its customer information on personal accidents, replacing the term 'external incident' with 'personal accident' on all communication channels. The SBB aims to achieve more transparent communication, but the Zurich Society for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (ZGPP) is concerned that this change could lead to more imitations, contradicting suicide prevention recommendations. As stated by the SBB, 'We are pursuing the goal of more transparent communication.'

**Campaign Aims to End Battery Cages for Chicken Farming in Spain**
A new campaign, 'End the Cage Age', aims to eliminate the use of battery cages for chicken farming in Europe by 2025. However, many supermarkets in Spain, including Carrefour, Lidl, Aldi, and Ahorramás, have not yet met their commitment to eliminate eggs from battery-caged hens. The Observatorio de Bienestar Animal (OBA) has launched a campaign to raise awareness about the issue, encouraging consumers to make informed choices when buying eggs. The campaign's message is clear: 'The change is in the shopping cart.' By making individual choices, consumers can pressure companies to meet their commitments and accelerate the transition to cage-free systems. According to recent reports, although the percentage of battery-caged hens has decreased from 93% in 2016 to 67% in 2024, there are still over 9 million birds living in these conditions in Spain. The price of eggs has also increased significantly, with a dozen medium eggs reaching prices of up to €2.60 in March 2025, a 50% increase from the previous year. Despite the rising cost, studies indicate that up to 96% of Spanish consumers support measures to improve animal welfare.

**Colorado Adopts Law Requiring Cage-Free Eggs, Impacting Egg Sales**
Colorado has adopted a new law that requires all eggs sold in the state to come from hens that are not kept in cages, benefiting 5.5 million hens. The law, which takes effect in 2025, follows a trend set by other states like California and Massachusetts, and was pushed by animal protection organizations and companies seeking more humane practices. Currently, 26% of eggs in the US are produced by cage-free hens, a significant increase from 5% six years ago. The new law promotes the breeding of cage-free hens to improve their welfare and meet consumer expectations. To ensure compliance, annual audits will be conducted to certify companies that follow these standards. The benefits of raising cage-free hens include eggs with more resistant shells and better nutritional profiles, as well as increased omega-3 and vitamin D content. However, production is less predictable and can be affected by factors like climate and animal behavior. Despite higher production costs, demand for cage-free eggs has grown in recent years due to perceived higher quality and animal welfare. The law comes amid the largest outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the US, which has affected over 127 million domestic birds, including nearly 10 million in Colorado, causing egg prices to rise.

**The Fate of 12 Million French Laying Hens Hangs in the Balance**
The fate of 12 million French laying hens is now at a turning point. In 2015, 70% of hens were still kept in cages, but the French egg industry has been gradually phasing out this system of farming. Today, only a quarter of the French flock is still kept in cages, which are barely larger than a sheet of A4 paper, and are unable to express their natural behaviors, such as scratching and pecking at the ground, stretching their wings, and taking dust baths. This could soon be a distant memory, marking a decade of success in the fight against animal cruelty. As one might look back on the 2015-2025 decade as a model of success in the history of animal cruelty.

**Campaign Aims to End Sale of Eggs from Caged Hens in Spanish Supermarkets**
The Observatorio de Bienestar Animal (OBA) has launched a campaign to raise awareness about the sale of eggs from caged hens in Spanish supermarkets. The campaign, which is part of the European initiative 'End the Cage Age', aims to put an end to the sale of eggs from hens that are confined to small cages. The OBA has placed a notice in some supermarkets, reading 'Do not buy these eggs. Goodbye code 3', which refers to the code used to identify eggs from caged hens. According to the OBA, many supermarkets have failed to meet their commitment to stop selling eggs from caged hens by 2025. The OBA is calling on consumers to demand transparency and action from supermarkets that continue to sell eggs from caged hens. The campaign has already seen some progress, with the percentage of caged hens in Spain decreasing from 93% in 2016 to 67% in 2024. The production of eggs from free-range hens has also increased, with over 390 million dozen eggs produced in 2023. The OBA is urging consumers to sign petitions and demand action from supermarkets that continue to sell eggs from caged hens.

**US Egg Shortage: A Crisis Exposed**
The United States is facing a severe egg shortage, with prices reaching record levels in 2025. The main cause is a bird flu outbreak (H5N1) that has led to the culling of over 156 million birds, including millions of laying hens, since 2022. According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), 30.3 million birds were lost in nine states this year alone, affecting 12.3% of conventional caged hens. The average price of a dozen eggs reached $8 in March, a 159% increase from the previous year, and projections indicate it could exceed $8.32 by the end of the year. The shortage has triggered a chain reaction: supermarkets are rationing sales, restaurants like Waffle House are imposing a 50-cent surcharge per egg, and some consumers are crossing the border to Mexico, where a dozen eggs costs $2, risking fines of up to $300 from customs authorities. The crisis, exacerbated by the transition to cage-free production in states like California, has put the supply chain at risk. The US is looking to Europe for help, but the response has been lukewarm. Poland, for example, produces 45 million eggs per day, but the US needs 50 million per day to cover its deficit, according to Katarzyna Gawronska of the Polish National Chamber of Poultry. There are also logistical and regulatory hurdles, including differences in egg washing and salmonella prevention. Other solutions are being explored, including commitments from Turkey and South Korea, but these volumes are insufficient. Internally, the government is investing $1 billion in biosecurity and vaccines, and some states have temporarily suspended cage-free egg laws to increase supply. However, the prices have only fallen 40% since February, and consumers are still feeling the pinch.

**Eggs from Organic and Free-Range Farms Surpass Those from Battery Cages**
According to recent data, approximately 70% of eggs in Germany come from free-range or organic farming, while 14.7% come from free-range and 8.2% from battery cages. In 2024, 1.43 billion eggs were produced in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) alone. Although this is a 1.4% decrease from the previous year, it is still an increase from the 1.31 billion eggs produced in 2015. The percentage of organic eggs has increased from 4.8% to 8.2% since 2015, while the percentage of free-range eggs has almost doubled from 7.4% to 14.7%. The majority of eggs still come from barn-raised hens, which decreased from 73.1% in 2015 to 69.9% in 2024. The number of laying hens also decreased by 1.4% to 5.02 million. The laying performance remained constant at around 285 eggs per hen. According to the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, organic hens have 0.16 square meters of stall space and 4 square meters of outdoor space, while free-range hens have 0.11 square meters of stall space and 4 square meters of outdoor space. Barn-raised hens have 0.11 square meters of stall space but no outdoor space. The Consumer Centre notes that in Germany, battery cages are only allowed for small groups of hens, with a minimum of 0.08 square meters of floor space per hen, a nesting area, and a cage height of 50 centimeters.

**Cage-Free Eggs Not What They’re Cracked Up to Be - Moonbattery**
California's 2018 law mandating cage-free eggs by 2022 has led to a significant decline in egg production in the state, with many farmers fleeing due to the regulations. The law has had a ripple effect across the industry, with 40% of eggs sold in the US now being cage-free, up from 5% in 2010. However, this shift has not improved the welfare of the chickens, as crowding them together has led to increased stress, disease, and even cannibalism. As one might expect, the USDA analysis found no significant correlation between housing type and initial infection, but it's 'common sense that pathogens would spread faster in cage-free facilities.' The author notes that 'Big Government studies tend to find the results they look for,' implying that the analysis was biased. The article concludes that 'liberals get a warm glow of righteousness when they see “cage-free” on their carton of eggs,' but at the cost of animal welfare.

**Why 'cage-free' eggs are not all they're cracked up to be**
The current bird flu pandemic has led to the culling of nearly 150 million egg-laying hens in the US, driving egg prices up to $12 to $15 a dozen in states like California and New York. California's 2018 law mandating cage-free eggs by 2022 has had a ripple effect across the industry, with 40% of eggs sold in the US now being cage-free. However, critics argue that cage-free facilities are more prone to disease spread and are harder to clean. Chicken farmer Frank Hilliker notes that cage-free conditions can lead to increased stress and cannibalism among birds. Agriculture advocate Stephanie Nash blames globalization, silly laws, and central planning for the rise in avian pandemics, and suggests that the US should return to eating by region to support rural communities and improve food security.

**EXPLAINER - US egg crisis deepens as bird flu, supply chain woes drive prices up**
The US is experiencing a severe egg shortage due to the avian influenza outbreak and supply chain disruptions. The crisis has led to a 15.2% increase in egg prices in January 2025, with a 53% surge over the past year and a staggering 230% increase over the past five years. The loss of millions of egg-laying hens has created significant supply chain disruptions, and several states have introduced regulations requiring cage-free environments for egg-laying hens, further exacerbating the crisis. In response, Nevada Governor Joe Lombardo has temporarily suspended the state's cage-free egg regulations, and the US has increased egg imports to stabilize the market. However, prices are expected to remain high, with the USDA warning of an additional 20% increase throughout 2025.
