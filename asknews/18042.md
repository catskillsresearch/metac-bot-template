**From Artificial Intelligence to Artificial Creativity**
The next great disruption will not be who thinks faster, but who imagines better in alliance with machines. In just over a decade, we have gone from being amazed by the first digital assistants to living with algorithms that can write novels, compose symphonies, and suggest scientific hypotheses. This qualitative leap forces us to re-examine the central question: no longer is it enough to ask what Artificial Intelligence (AI) can predict, but what it can imagine. From this concern, Creativity Artificial emerges, a post-predictive phase where machines stop limiting themselves to continuing patterns and start proposing possible worlds. To understand it, we need to look at the System 3, a conceptual model that I have proposed on human creativity as the fusion of intuition (System 1) and deliberate reasoning (System 2) in 'thoughts of thoughts' capable of transforming the mind and the environment. When a generative model combines its internal statistics - that intuition made of large volumes of data - with loops of self-evaluation, external memory, and human feedback - the algorithmic equivalent of reason - it approaches that architecture and becomes, in a strict sense, creative. The first chatbots worked like giant autocompletion dictionaries: they extrapolated probabilities and delivered the most plausible word. The arrival of multimodal transformers added two decisive ingredients. On the one hand, a planner that evaluates the global coherence of the text; on the other hand, a search engine that incorporates external information in real-time. From 2024 onwards, these systems began to 'reflect' on their own outputs, correcting contradictions and proposing conceptual turns. That internal micro-dialogue sparked the spark of Creativity Artificial. Today, this new capacity already designs unprecedented pharmaceutical molecules, drafts patent drafts, and produces photorealistic storyboards in minutes. Laboratories like DeepMind have shown that, when asked to imagine an enzyme that folds in a certain way, the responses exceed known libraries and accelerate months of wet experimentation. Audio platforms allow a composer to hum a melody and receive ten orchestral variations ready to mix. In the film industry, video generators convert a script into pre-visualized scenes that save weeks of shooting. The impact is transversal. In science, Creativity Artificial shortens the conjecture-proof cycle by suggesting research routes that didn't even appear in the literature. In philosophy, it forces us to rethink authorship: if a model proposes an unprecedented mental experiment, who owns the idea? In the arts, it transforms the creator-tool dialogue: one of the most recognized paintings generated in 2025 ('augmented intelligence') stood out less for its hyperrealism than for the conceptual irony co-designed between human and machine. Creativity ceases to be an inspired monologue and becomes a fertile conversation. In the short term - three to five years - we will see Creativity Artificial assistants embedded in all workflows. An architect will sketch a volume and ask the system to optimize structure and acoustics without losing poetry; a lawyer will explore regulatory scenarios that integrate jurisprudence and ethics; a teacher will design adaptive classes where AI varies examples to find the spark that awakens the student's curiosity. At five or ten years, Creativity Artificial will hybridize with light neural interfaces and corporate digital twins (dynamic replicas based on software that reflect with high fidelity the integral functioning of a company). Complete companies will have 'metacerebros' that synthesize internal data, market trends, and organizational theory to propose unprecedented strategies. In the social sphere, a massive co-creation economy will emerge: millions of people will earn micro-royalties for refining algorithmic ideas, and countries that regulate well the traceability of those contributions will capture most of the added value. The spark of invention is no longer the exclusive property of the human brain, but it does not automatically emerge in silicon either: it arises when both systems cooperate under principles of transparency, diversity, and shared purpose. If we direct that power towards the great challenges - from personalized vaccines to carbon-negative cities - we can affirm that the creative revolution not only expands the repertoire of imagination, but also the possibilities of our common future. The next great disruption will not be who thinks faster, but who imagines better in alliance with machines.

**The Media-Agency Duality: A Pattern Language for Multi-Agentic AI**
A new design methodology, media-agency design, is emerging to create organizational forms that generate collective intelligence exceeding the sum of their individual parts. This approach recognizes coordination mechanisms as transformative media that enhance individual capabilities while creating emergent collective intelligence. The methodology involves designing coordination-as-media systems, embracing dialectical tensions, enabling strategic de-scaffolding, cultivating edge spaces, optimizing trade-offs, and applying media effect analysis. AI systems can amplify each of these design principles in unprecedented ways, enabling dynamic, adaptive coordination media, multi-dimensional optimization, and continuous tetrad monitoring. The result is an organizational form that learns and adapts at speeds impossible for traditional human management while maintaining the creative, strategic, and relational capabilities that make human agents valuable. The media-agency design methodology has profound implications for how we develop AI systems themselves, suggesting AI development priorities focused on multi-dimensional optimization, pattern recognition, adaptive coordination architectures, human capability amplification interfaces, and emergent intelligence detection systems.

**5 ridiculous myths that businesses hold on Agentic AI**
Businesses are holding onto outdated ideas about Agentic AI, which is a fundamental shift in the tech industry. Agentic AI is not just another tool, but a transformative technology that offers real autonomy, innovation, and growth. It combines powerful models, intelligent agents, and human-guided decision-making to create complex, multi-agent workflows. According to Deloitte research, 50% of companies using generative AI will launch agentic AI pilots or proofs of concept by 2027. Five myths about Agentic AI are holding businesses back: it's not just about fine-tuning responses, it's about setting objectives and adapting independently; it's not just another tool, it reshapes how work gets done; it doesn't eliminate the need for human oversight, but enhances autonomy; it's not about letting AI take the wheel, but designing smarter systems for human-machine collaboration; and it's not just for operations, but for sales, marketing, strategic planning, and product innovation. Successful agentic AI deployments require a fresh look at business workflows, smart orchestration, and clear accountability. Agentic AI offers autonomy, adaptability, goal-driven behavior, complex problem-solving, improved efficiency, scalability, and collaboration with humans.

**Decisive role of AI in defining multipolarity or unipolarity**
The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the global order, with countries and corporations competing for dominance in AI production and control. This has raised concerns about regulation, competition, and the global power structure. The development of AI is concentrated in the hands of a few nations and corporations, creating technological inequalities. The author argues that the current model of capitalism, based on monopolies, is similar to communism and weakens competition. The US's attempt to contain China's AI progress through sanctions has only accelerated China's pursuit of self-sufficiency. The author suggests that a shared and sustainable monopoly in AI among the US and its allies could be a solution, but American greed may hinder this. The article concludes that the world is shifting towards a multipolar system, with the US and Russia seeking a regulated multipolarity to balance global power and prevent Chinese dominance.

**Transformative AI: From the horse's mouth (Explained Like I'm 5)**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the next revolution, enabling us to do more than we can now. AI systems can think and learn like humans, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and improving knowledge over time. To build these systems, we need powerful computers, real information (data), and mathematical functions (algorithms). Improvements in computing, data, and algorithms have led to significant achievements in AI systems, including the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini. Some experts define transformative AI as advanced AI systems with the potential for societal impact, proposing three levels of transformativeness: narrowly transformative, transformative, and radically transformative. Modern AI researchers hope to build superintelligence AI, but there are concerns about bias, decision-making, and the potential for the AI's interests to diverge from ours. Some experts, including Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, and Demis Hassabis, share their opinions on the future of AI, highlighting its potential benefits and risks. They emphasize the need for AI safety and alignment, and the importance of building these systems ethically and safely.

The Learning Sciences Institute of the University of Foggia is pleased to announce the publication of the 105th issue of the Mondo Digitale journal, a special edition entirely curated by Professor Giusi Antonia Toto, ordinary professor of Didactics and Special Pedagogy. This issue represents an in-depth and multidisciplinary analysis of the transformative impact of artificial intelligence on education, society, and various areas of knowledge. The editorial, signed by Professor Toto, highlights how AI-based technologies are redefining the way we learn, teach, and interact with the world, offering extraordinary opportunities but also raising ethical and operational questions that require careful reflection. The issue addresses topics of great relevance and topicality, such as the personalization of educational paths through adaptive learning platforms and virtual tutors, emphasizing their crucial role in school inclusion and the reduction of barriers for students with Special Educational Needs. However, the adoption of these technologies raises questions related to equity and accessibility, recalling the need for responsible and sustainable use. The journal explores the implications of artificial intelligence in the protection of minors in the digital environment, with particular attention to risks and opportunities. AI is presented as a tool that can ensure safe and respectful digital environments, without neglecting the delicate balance between technological innovation and the protection of fundamental rights. The issue dedicates ample space to the medical training sector, where innovative tools such as interactive chatbots, virtual patients, and gamification-based platforms are revolutionizing learning, making it more engaging and personalized. However, the challenges of ethical and professional nature related to data reliability and the importance of maintaining a human relationship are highlighted. Another central theme concerns the impact of artificial intelligence on critical thinking and philosophy. The reflection focuses on how tools like ChatGPT and Gemini are redefining the human-machine relationship, opening new frontiers for abstract reasoning but also raising doubts about delegating cognitive abilities to external systems. The importance of preserving the authenticity of human interactions is reiterated, avoiding that technology simplifies the emotional experience too much. Among the concrete examples of the transformative potential of AI, the predictive algorithm Cri.Pre., developed by Radici Future Produzioni, represents an innovative model for the prevention of deviant behaviors such as bullying and cyberbullying, highlighting the need for an ethical reflection to ensure equity and transparency in algorithmic decisions. The journal does not fail to address the applications of artificial intelligence in psychotherapy, highlighting its role as a support for personalized treatments and diagnosis, while reiterating that human relationships remain the indispensable core of psychological care. The entire issue is configured as an invitation to critical and aware reflection on the use of AI, which must be accompanied by an ethical approach to preserve fundamental human values, promoting an inclusive and sustainable society. 'This issue of Mondo Digitale represents a significant contribution to the understanding of artificial intelligence and its implications, not only as a technological tool but as a force capable of transforming our relationships, our educational processes, and our very way of living. We wanted to offer a articulated and multidisciplinary reflection, aware that every innovation brings with it new opportunities but also great responsibilities. It is essential to maintain a balance between technological progress and the values that define our humanity, ensuring that artificial intelligence is used as an ally to build a more equitable and inclusive society. I invite everyone to read this edition with a critical and open eye, to grasp the challenges and opportunities that await us,' declares Professor Giusi Antonia Toto. Following the Winter School 2025, held in Accadia and focused on the theme H-DIA. How to deal with scientific Dissemination, artificial intelligence and Academic teaching?, the need to prepare instant books and documents dedicated to the dissemination of good practices and guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence has emerged. Currently, there are numerous directives already developed for specific scientific-disciplinary sectors, which sometimes result in contradictions. Therefore, it is indispensable to rethink these practices comprehensively, a process that will be the subject of development in future publications of the Learning Sciences Institute of the University of Foggia.
