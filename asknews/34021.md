**DOGE Disruptions Are Just Beginning To Impact Budgeting**
The White House's DOGE Service is implementing spending cuts and administrative actions that are disrupting government operations and impacting budgeting in ways that raise significant legal and Constitutional concerns. The Trump administration's approach to budget execution appears to be at odds with congressional power of the purse laws and principles, particularly the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The president has used executive orders to freeze funding and withhold funds for policy reasons, which may violate the ICA and infringe on congressional power. The Government Accountability Office has 39 impoundment investigations underway and has asserted that workforce reductions can effectively constitute impoundment. The fiscal year will soon be over, and it is unclear what happens if funds have not been made available before they expire at the end of September. Congressional appropriators will be challenged to determine whether and how agencies have spent current-year funds to inform next-year decisions.

**California Sues Trump Administration Over Blocked Funds for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure**
California and a coalition of 16 states have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that it had illegally blocked $5 billion in congressional funds allocated for building electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The states claim that a Trump executive order directing federal agencies to stop releasing money allocated for electric vehicle infrastructure under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed by President Joe Biden is illegal. This is the latest in a series of legal challenges by states led by Democrats against orders from the administration that they claim are unlawful. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has accused the president of illegally withdrawing millions of dollars in federal funds for electric vehicles and working to 'roll back environmental and climate change protections.' 'California will not back down, not to big oil nor to federal government overreach,' Bonta said in a statement. California Governor Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential candidate, is positioning himself as a leader in opposition to the Trump administration. California has filed 19 lawsuits since Trump's inauguration. Newsom has joined 16 other Democratic governors in a legal action against the administration to block the federal government's measure to freeze new wind energy projects nationwide. Last month, he was one of a dozen states that challenged the legality of Trump's broad tariffs, arguing that they were unconstitutional because Congress had not given him the authority to raise import taxes. In a statement, Newsom said that Trump's action to withhold funds for electric vehicle charging was 'another gift to China: ceding American innovation and eliminating thousands of jobs.' 'Instead of promoting Teslas in the White House garden, President Trump could help Elon [Musk] -- and the country -- by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding,' Newsom added.

**California sues Trump administration for withholding EV charging funds**
California and 16 other states are suing the Trump administration for withholding federal funds allocated to build more electric vehicle chargers. According to the lawsuit filed in federal court, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta claim that the Trump administration unlawfully withheld funding approved by Congress. The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program had dedicated $5 billion to expand clean car charging across the country, including over $300 million for projects in California.

**Judge orders temporary halt to Trump administration’s government overhaul**
A federal judge has temporarily halted the Trump administration's plans to overhaul the government through large-scale staffing cuts and mass layoffs. According to Judge Illston, 'As history demonstrates, the President may broadly restructure federal agencies only when authorized by Congress.' The ruling is the broadest of its kind against the government overhaul led by Elon Musk. The plaintiffs, a coalition of government agencies and employees, argued that the Trump administration exceeded its authority and violated administrative law. The judge agreed, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and that they will suffer irreparable harm without the temporary restraining order. The order preserves the status quo and will be considered in a hearing on May 22.

**Washington, other states sue to regain electric-vehicle funding as sales sag**
Washington state and 15 other states have sued the Trump administration for blocking funding for electric vehicle charging stations. The administration froze federal funding for electric charging stations on President Trump's first day in office, citing 'burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations.' Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said, 'The president's illegal claw-backs aren't spending reductions — they're cash grabs that rob taxpayers, steamroll Congress, and stifle critical economic development.' The lawsuit argues that the President has no authority to rescind or revise statutes, or to withhold funds duly appropriated by Congress. The Trump administration has aggressively blocked or undone programs and funding to slow, study, and adapt to climate change. Without federal support, private companies are unlikely to build chargers in areas with lower densities of electric-vehicle drivers, creating a 'chicken-and-egg situation.' However, Seattle City Light is committed to electrification with or without federal help, using credits based on the amount of kilowatts dispensed to vehicles. Washington state law mandates that 22% of new car sales in 2025 be electric or other zero-emission vehicles, increasing to 100% by 2035. Tesla sales plummeted in Washington state, with a 54% drop from January to March, contributing to a 60% drop in sales of new electric vehicles since January.

**Trump faces bipartisan pressure to restore public funding tracker**
The Trump administration is facing bipartisan pressure to restore a public website that tracks how funding is apportioned to federal agencies. Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) said, 'It's the law. It's a requirement of the law, so it's not discretionary on OMB's part.' Top appropriators from both parties in the House and Senate sent a letter to OMB Director Russell Vought calling for public access to the site to be restored. The website's takedown has been challenged in court, with a federal judge hearing arguments on Friday. Representatives for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) and Protect Democracy Project argued that the Trump administration broke the law when it nixed the database, pointing to legislation enacted during the Biden administration that required OMB to operate the apportionments tracker. The administration has said it cannot continue to operate the system, arguing it contains sensitive information that could pose a threat to national security. However, Democrats have rejected the administration's claims, arguing that apportionments are final agency actions subject to the Freedom of Information Act and that the website publishes no sensitive data.

**Amid Trump's battle against DEI, nonprofits filling critical labor gaps are caught in the crossfire**
The Trump administration's anti-DEI executive orders have put community-based organizations that provide critical labor gap services in jeopardy. These organizations, such as Chicago Women in Trades, have been instrumental in recruiting women into construction and other skilled trades. The orders have led to the cancellation of federal funding for dozens of community groups, including apprenticeship readiness programs and anti-harassment training. Nonprofits are challenging the orders in court, arguing that they are too vague and violate free speech. Jayne Vellinga, Executive Director of Chicago Women in Trades, said that the organization's hiring and future programming has stalled due to the uncertainty surrounding their funding. Sam Barraza, a 24-year-old nonbinary individual who participated in the program, credits it with helping them discover a trade and find a foothold in the industry. The construction industry has invested billions of dollars in expanding apprenticeships and other programs to draw younger generations into the skilled trades, but the Trump administration's actions threaten to undermine this progress.

**US Treasury Secretary Warns Congress of Potential Debt Default in August**
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned Congress that if no action is taken, the US government may be unable to pay its debt as early as August. Bessent urged Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling before July 15. In a letter to House Speaker Johnson, Bessent stated that after evaluating the April tax situation, the Treasury Department believes that it is likely to exhaust all means and cash by August to prevent the US government from defaulting on its debt. 'Given that Congress will be in recess during the summer, I urge Congress to pass legislation to raise the debt ceiling before the recess begins on July 15 to ensure the US fulfills its responsibility to pay its debts.' Bessent emphasized that any default on US debt would have a significant impact on the US financial system, as well as harm US national security and international leadership. The US Congress is currently discussing President Trump's tax cut and spending reduction plan, which is expected to be a critical period in the coming weeks, and is closely related to the X date. The US Treasury Department currently has a debt of over $36 trillion, exceeding the debt ceiling. In 2023, Congress passed a law temporarily allowing the government to disregard the debt ceiling until January 1 of this year. Since then, the Treasury Department has begun using extraordinary measures to prevent Washington from defaulting on its debt. The US Congressional Budget Office had previously stated in March that the X date may occur as early as August. At a hearing of the House Appropriations Committee on the Trump administration's budget proposal, Bessent said that Congress will eventually raise or suspend the debt ceiling again, and the Trump administration will not use any 'stopgap measures' to avoid the debt ceiling issue.

**Bummer: States Sue Over Trump Admin Freezing Charging Station Funds - Pirate's Cove**
California and 15 other states, including the District of Columbia, have sued the Trump administration over the freezing of funds for electric-vehicle charging stations. The states claim that the federal government is illegally withholding billions of dollars awarded to states for building charging stations. Senate Democrats stated that President Trump was withholding more than $3 billion from the program, which was approved as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. The lawsuit argues that the administration's decision will 'devastate the ability of states to build the charging infrastructure necessary for making EVs accessible to more consumers, combating climate change, reducing other harmful pollution, and supporting the states' green economies.' The states involved in the lawsuit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Vermont, and Washington. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington State.

**'This is the law, allocate the funding': Trump's funding freeze faces bipartisan and renewed court opposition**
Top Senate appropriators, Sens. Susan Collins and Patty Murray, are accusing the Trump administration of unlawfully withholding $3 billion from the FY25 spending bill. The administration claims the money was 'improperly designated' as emergency funds, but Collins and Murray argue that this decision violates federal law and the longstanding implementation of it. They stated, 'Just as the president does not have a line-item veto, he does not have the ability to pick and choose which emergency spending to designate.' Murray added, 'This is the law, allocate the funding.' The administration is also facing pressure from federal courts to spend the money, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit declining to grant the Trump administration's request to block a lower court's ruling that said the president could not unilaterally stop the flow of federal dollars. The 1974 Impoundment Control Act prohibits the executive branch from withholding congressionally appropriated funds for policy reasons.

**Judge reprimands Trump admin for power play on USAID**
A U.S. district judge, Amir Ali, reprimanded the Trump administration for withholding foreign aid, saying its actions likely violated the constitutional separation of powers by unlawfully impounding congressionally approved funds. The ruling bars the Trump administration from impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds and requires them to pay USAID bills for existing contracts and grants through February 13. The judge criticized the defendants' 'unbridled view' of executive power, saying it 'flouts multiple statutes whose constitutionality is not in question.' The ruling tends to support the widely held position that the president has limited authority to cut foreign aid, but Congress ultimately controls government spending, including foreign assistance. The power of the purse belongs to Congress, which determines how much aid is allocated and to which countries or programs through appropriations bills. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the Trump administration is canceling 83 percent of the programs at USAID, but the judge's ruling requires the release of withheld foreign aid.

**With Trump's funding freeze paused, can he just not spend instead? That's the point. | Opinion**
A judge has paused President Donald Trump's order to temporarily freeze certain federal assistance until at least February 3, when another hearing will be held. Trump's spending freeze has been blocked by courts, marking the first blow to his plan to use executive power to curb spending. The main issue hindering the Trump administration's plan is that the president is obligated to spend funds appropriated by Congress, which Trump has been openly hostile toward. The Impoundment Control Act (ICA) requires the president to notify Congress of a proposed withholding of funds for 45 days, and Congress must affirm the impoundment if funds are to be withheld. However, if Congress ignores the impoundment request, the funds must be released after 45 days regardless. Experts suggest that Congress should amend the ICA to require lawmakers to vote one way or the other on presidential impoundments. Judges were quick to halt Trump's initial spending freeze, and swift legal action would likely be taken if Trump refused to spend further funds. The Supreme Court is likely to disagree with Trump's assertion that the president has a constitutional right to impound funds, citing precedent from cases such as Train v. City of New York and a 2013 opinion by then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh.

**Letitia James Files Lawsuit Against Trump Administration Over Federal Grants Freeze**
New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its directive to halt federal grants and loans. James criticized the move as 'reckless and dangerous,' stating that 'programs in communities across the entire nation depend on this funding to support our families.' The administration's action, which excluded programs like Social Security and Medicare, led to widespread confusion and concern. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the funding freeze, allowing for further judicial review. The lawsuit contends that the administration's action violates the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which restricts the executive branch from unilaterally withholding funds allocated by Congress. James stated, 'Not only does this administration's new policy put people at risk, but it is plainly unconstitutional.'

**Trump pushed to freeze some federal funding. Does he have that power?**
President Donald Trump has moved to block the government from disbursing funds authorized by Congress for various programs, potentially seizing power from the legislative branch. This move has set off chaos and uncertainty for the federal government, and could lead to a Supreme Court fight over the constitutionality of a law banning unilateral 'impoundment' by presidents. Impoundment is the act of withholding or delaying spending of funds that Congress has appropriated. While the practice is not new, the 1974 Impoundment Control Act essentially banned presidents from unilaterally and permanently impounding funds. Trump's administration has pushed back against criticism, saying the freeze is temporary and will allow for a review of spending to ensure it aligns with the administration's priorities. However, the Trump campaign had vowed to challenge the constitutionality of the 1974 law restricting presidential impoundment power, and the current freeze has raised concerns about the potential for a legal confrontation.

**Trump's effort to withhold federal funding will trigger 'imminent legal action'**
The Trump administration's attempt to withhold federal funding has sparked a legal battle over the constitutional principle that Congress decides how to spend taxpayer money. The administration claims it is evaluating programs to ensure they align with Trump's agenda, but critics argue this is a power grab. 'It seems clear to me that the Trump administration is aching to get this issue to the Supreme Court,' said Sam Bagenstos, former OMB general counsel. The Constitution gives Congress 'the power of the purse,' and challengers to Trump's actions would likely cite the Impoundment Control Act, a law passed in 1974 to regulate the president's control over the budget. The administration's nominee to run the OMB, Russ Vought, has expressed his belief that the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional, foreshadowing a potential legal argument. Litigation could also focus on a provision in the Constitution that requires the president 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' 'The part that is abnormal is the flagrant and across the board impoundment of allocated funds,' said Jed Shugerman, a professor at Boston University School of Law. A potential case on the issue could reach the Supreme Court quickly, but legal experts say this could be one of several uphill legal battles for the administration.

**Can Trump Cancel Government Funds Through Impoundment? What To Know As He Pauses All Federal Assistance.**
President Donald Trump's administration has issued a memo ordering a temporary pause on all federal assistance, citing the president's ability to block government funds that Congress has already authorized. However, legal experts argue that this move is a 'flagrant' violation of the Impoundment Control Act, which forbids the president from withholding congressionally approved funds. Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University, noted that even if the pause is temporary, the president can only defer giving out federal funds after sending a request to Congress, which has not been done. Trump's nominee for the Office of Management and Budget, Vought, denied that the president violated the Impoundment Control Act, but refused to explicitly say that the administration would follow the law. Democrats have criticized Trump's efforts to oppose the Impoundment Control Act, with Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Rose DeLauro warning that the order will have 'devastating consequences' across the country. The dispute over the Impoundment Control Act could be ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, which has previously ruled against Nixon's use of impoundment in the 1975 case Train v. City of New York.

**Can Trump Overrule Congress' Spending Decisions? What To Know As He Pauses Infrastructure And Climate Change Funding.**
President Donald Trump has signed an executive order blocking federal agencies from disbursing funds that Congress has already authorized, potentially starting a bigger battle over whether he can refuse to disburse government funds allocated by Congress. Trump's administration argues that he should be able to do so, despite a federal law forbidding it. Michael Vought, Trump's nominee for the Office of Management and Budget, denied that Trump violated the Impoundment Control Act, saying that the president was only pausing the funding while his administration assesses the situation. However, Vought refused to explicitly say that the Trump administration would follow the Impoundment Control Act, which he believes is unconstitutional. Democrats have criticized Trump's efforts to oppose the Impoundment Control Act, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal saying, 'I am astonished and aghast that someone in this responsible a position would, in effect, say, that the president is above the law.' It remains to be seen how the Supreme Court will rule on the issue, with some justices having previously expanded Trump's personal presidential power.
