**Anduril and Meta Collaborate on Augmented Reality Devices for US Army**
Tech giants Anduril and Meta are working together to create augmented reality (AR) devices for the US army, integrating Meta's Llama AI and Anduril's Lattice platform. According to Defence News, this partnership is part of the Soldier Borne Mission Command (SBMC) Next program, previously known as Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) Next. The IVAS program was a major military contract worth $22 billion, initially awarded to Microsoft in 2018 to develop AR glasses similar to HoloLens for soldiers. However, after numerous issues, the army stripped Microsoft of control in February 2025 and transferred the program to Anduril, with Microsoft remaining a cloud services provider. The goal is to have multiple suppliers of AR glasses for soldiers. As explained in the article, the devices will be based on Meta's AR/VR Reality Labs technology, use Meta's Llama AI model, and connect to Anduril's Lattice software for management and control. The idea is to provide soldiers with real-time battlefield data visualization. Anduril's representative told TechCrunch that the family of products being developed by Meta and Anduril is called EagleEye and is planned as a whole ecosystem of devices.
