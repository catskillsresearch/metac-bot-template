**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Logitech MX Master 4: New Flagship Mouse Announced for 2025**
Logitech's MX Master 3 is considered the best mouse on the market, but it has been around for three years. According to rumors, Logitech is planning to release the MX Master 4 in 2025, which would be a new generation rather than a revised version of the MX Master 3. Two hints have been found, one of which comes from Logitech itself. A leaked advertisement on Reddit shows a version of the MX Master that is not the 3S, suggesting that it could be the MX Master 4. Additionally, Tecnoblog found a reference to the 'MR0118' in a local regulatory agency, which could be the model number for the new mouse. However, no further details are available yet.

**Cromossomo X Reveals New Clues on Aging: Why Women Tend to Live Longer Than Men**
A study on mice has discovered that genes on the X chromosome, previously thought to be inactive, are being reactivated in the hippocampus area of the brain in later stages of life. This reactivation may be linked to the longer lifespan of women compared to men. According to the researchers, this mechanism could be one of the reasons why women tend to live longer than men. The study found that around 20 genes on the X chromosome were reactivated in the mice, which could explain, in part, the higher longevity of women. As one researcher noted, 'This is a new mechanism that could be protecting women from cognitive decline related to age.'

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**This anti-aging drug can extend the lifespan of mice by up to 30%**
Scientists at the Max Planck Institute have discovered that a combination of two anti-aging drugs, rapamycin and trametinib, can extend the lifespan of mice by up to 30%. When tested together, the drugs boosted longevity in mice by 35% for females and 27% for males. The anti-aging mix also improved the health of the mice, reducing tumors, inflammation, and organ decline. The researchers believe the mix's effectiveness lies in its dual targeting of a cellular signaling pathway linked to aging. Importantly, the study found no additional side effects from using the combination, suggesting it could be safe for further testing in humans. While the researchers do not expect humans to gain decades of extra life, the main goal is to improve health during aging and delay the onset of age-related diseases. 'The study points to the possibility of using anti-aging drugs to delay the onset of age-related diseases and maintain physical and cognitive abilities later in life,' said the researchers.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Study Reveals Combination of Cancer-Fighting Drugs May Pave the Way for Anti-Aging Treatment**
A team of researchers has found that a combination of two cancer-fighting drugs, Trametinib and Rapamycin, can extend the lifespan of mice by up to 30%. According to a new study, the international research team discovered that combining these two drugs, known for their effectiveness in inhibiting cancer cell growth, resulted in extending the lifespan of mice beyond the use of each drug individually, while also reducing inflammation and delaying cancer progression in aging mice. Although the results do not necessarily mean that these drugs will extend human lifespan with the same efficiency, they represent an important step towards developing 'anti-aging' medications, a new category of treatments aimed at preventing diseases and improving quality of life in advanced age. Dr. Linda Partridge, a researcher from University College London and the Max Planck Institute for the Biology of Aging, said, 'We don't expect similar results in humans, but we hope these drugs will help people age healthier and live longer'.

**Some male mice fiercely guard females within their territories, while others seek out quick flings**
Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology studied the behavior of 244 wild-derived male house mice over their entire lives, up to 11 months. The study found that some male mice fiercely guard females within their territories, while others seek out quick flings. Territorial males tend to reproduce more often, but at a cost, as defending the nest areas can be stressful and risky. Roamers, on the other hand, may reproduce less frequently, but still manage to pass on their genes, especially when competition is high. The researchers also found that roaming males have relatively larger testes, suggesting they invest more in sperm production. The findings reveal how flexible and dynamic these behaviors are, and suggest that males might respond differently as environments change, offering new insight into how animals adapt and evolve.

**Why Some Animals Live for Only Days and Others Live for Thousands of Years**
Some species, such as turtles, fishes, and salamanders, appear to not age, according to João Pedro de Magalhães, a molecular biologist at the University of Birmingham. These species do not show signs of degeneration or senescence as they grow older, and could live extremely long lives if they didn't die of predation, accidents, or infectious disease. Magalhães notes that it's a biological mystery why some species age faster than others, and that the mechanisms behind aging are not yet well understood. He suggests that species that face high predation evolve to grow quickly and reach sexual maturity rapidly, while those that don't face this pressure can age slowly. DNA mutations are also thought to play a role in determining lifespans, with longer-lived species tending to evolve better DNA-repair systems to ward off cancer. For example, Greenland sharks may take 150 years to reach sexual maturity, while laboratory-raised mice have very high rates of cancer due to their lack of these abilities.

**Mice in Space: A Study of Bone Density and Muscle Mass in Microgravity**
A recent study by NASA has found that mice in space experience significant changes in their bone density and muscle mass after 37 days in microgravity. According to NASA, the weight-bearing bones of mice, such as the femur, lose around 1% in density for every month in space. Muscles also follow suit, losing up to 20% of their mass in under two weeks. The explanation for these changes is unclear, but may be related to the altered blood circulation in space, which causes the face to swell and the nose to stop. As the body adapts and sheds excess blood, the changes may reverse. However, one thing is clear: the human body does not behave as expected in microgravity. This is particularly relevant as Elon Musk and other space enthusiasts discuss manned missions to Mars in the 2030s. NASA has previously studied how fish, such as the medaka, lose bone mass in space, but the results for mice are different. The study highlights the complexity of the human body's response to microgravity and radiation, and raises questions about the long-term effects of space travel on the human body.

**Longevity Briefs: Klotho Protein Extends Mouse Lifespan, But There Are Problems**
Researchers investigated the effects of a specific klotho protein, secreted KL (s-KL) isoform, on mice lifespan and age-related deterioration. The study found that treated mice experienced improved physical performance, tissue regeneration, and lifespan, but the benefits were exclusive to either male or female mice. Male mice treated at 12 months of age showed statistically significant improvements in average and maximum lifespans, while female mice experienced improvements in bone structure and balance. However, female mice suffered worse side effects, including skin ulcers and rectal bleeding. The study highlights the challenges of translating anti-ageing therapies to humans due to differences in male and female biology and genetic diversity.

**Colossal Biosciences Develops 'Woolly Mouse' in Lab, Aims for De-Extinction of Woolly Mammoths**
Colossal Biosciences, an American company, claims to have developed a new breed of laboratory mouse called the 'woolly mouse' by modifying multiple genes in laboratory mice to mimic characteristics of the extinct woolly mammoths, which lived around 4,000 years ago. According to the company, this is a first step towards applying these genetic editing techniques to Asian elephants, which are related to the woolly mammoths, with the goal of de-extinction and potentially repopulating the Arctic. However, the research has not been published in a scientific journal or peer-reviewed, and more information is needed. In the meantime, a photo of the new mice with their long, curly, and golden-brown fur has been selected for this week's Weekly Beasts.

**Scientists Create Genetically Modified Mice with Woolly Mammoth Fur**
Scientists at Colossal Biosciences have genetically modified mice to have a fur similar to that of the woolly mammoths. This breakthrough in de-extinction science is a significant step towards bringing back the woolly mammoth. The team of researchers, led by geneticist Rui Chen, analyzed the genomes of 59 mammoths that lived between 1.2 million and 3,500 years ago and compared them to those of Asian elephants, their closest living relatives. They identified seven key genes related to the distinctive characteristics of the woolly mammoth, including the structure of the fur and the distribution of body fat, essential for survival in the cold climates of the past. The researchers then used three different gene editing techniques to introduce eight modifications to the DNA of some mouse embryos, creating the new species of Colossal Woolly Mouse. According to Ben Lamm, co-founder and CEO of Colossal Biosciences, the Colossal Woolly Mouse represents a turning point in the research on de-extinction: 'We have demonstrated our ability to recreate complex genetic combinations that nature has taken millions of years to develop. This success brings us closer to our goal of bringing back the woolly mammoth.' The ultimate goal of Colossal Biosciences is not just an exercise in genetic experimentation, but an ambitious project to reintroduce the woolly mammoth into Arctic ecosystems. The company plans to use Asian elephants as a base for genetic modifications that will give them the characteristics of the mammoth. If the project is successful, the first mammoth calf could be born as early as 2028.

**Colossal Biosciences Creates 'Woolly Mouse' in Step Towards Reviving Mammoth**
Colossal Biosciences, a US-based startup aiming to revive the woolly mammoth, has announced a breakthrough by creating a 'woolly mouse'. According to Bloomberg, scientists modified 38 mice to have longer fur and the ability to withstand low temperatures using DNA and genomics technologies. The modified mice will live as long as regular mice and will not be bred or sold. 'We've demonstrated our ability to recreate complex genetic combinations that took nature millions of years to develop,' said Ben Lamm, the startup's CEO. The 'woolly mouse' is seen as the first step towards reviving the mammoth. The startup plans to use the remains found in the tundra to edit the genes of an Asian elephant cell, which is the closest living relative of the mammoth. They expect a surrogate elephant mother to give birth to a mammoth calf by the end of 2028.

**Farelerde Denendi! Kalori ve Stres Kısıtlaması Ömrü Uzatıyor**
Researchers at the Jackson Laboratory in the US conducted a study on 960 mice to understand the effects of calorie restriction and stress on longevity. The mice were divided into five groups and fed different diets, with some groups receiving only 60% or 80% of their normal daily calorie intake, while others were subjected to intermittent fasting. The results, published in Nature, showed that the mice that received 60% of their normal calorie intake lived an average of 34 months, while those that fasted intermittently lived an average of 28 months. The mice that received 80% of their normal calorie intake lived an average of 30 months. The researchers found that low-calorie diets extended the lifespan of the mice, regardless of their body fat percentage and blood glucose levels. However, the study also found that the mice that lost the most weight lived the shortest lives, and that those that lost weight had lower energy levels, weakened immune systems, and reduced reproductive capabilities. According to Prof. Gary Churchill, the study's lead researcher, 'Our study highlights the importance of resilience.' He added, 'The most resilient animals were those that maintained their weight despite stress and calorie restriction, and they were also the ones that lived the longest.' However, the study's results are not yet clear on whether they can be applied to humans, and the researchers note that the lifespan of the mice that received calorie restriction varied from a few months to 4.5 years, suggesting that genetic factors may play a more significant role in longevity than dietary habits.

**Aubrey de Grey’s Large Mouse Antiaging Study**
Aubrey de Grey's recent large mouse study on antiaging treatments showed that combination treatments have additive benefits, improving the lengthening of lifespans. Rapamycin is the strongest confirmed antiaging treatment, and de Grey's group is setting up a second experiment with new combination treatments, including rapamycin and exercise wheels, aiming to double the remaining life of the mice. Damage repair could add 12 extra months of life to mice, and de Grey is confident that this will also work in humans. This study marks a significant breakthrough in extending the life of mice, which has been stuck at adding 4 months for 50 years.
