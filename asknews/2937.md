**Bacteriophages: a weapon against resistant bacteria**
According to microbiologist Stan Brouns, the overuse of antibiotics has led to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which could cause 10 million deaths a year by 2050. Brouns is exploring bacteriophages, natural enemies of bacteria, as a potential solution. Unlike antibiotics, which target multiple types of bacteria, bacteriophages target specific types, making them a more targeted treatment. Brouns has established the Netherlands' first phage bank, which houses bacteriophages effective against two problematic bacteria in the Netherlands. However, there is still potential to expand the bank to help more people, as there are 10 types of bacteria worldwide that urgently need alternative treatments.

**Don't skip diagnostic tests, they are key to avoid antibiotic resistance: Experts - ET HealthWorld**
Experts at the 3rd Criticare Convention 2025 emphasized the importance of diagnostic tests in preventing antibiotic resistance. According to Dr. Camilla Rodrigues, a microbiologist, 'Nowadays, very good diagnostic tests are available to detect precisely which kind of infection a patient has, allowing for targeted antibiotic or other drug prescriptions.' However, many patients are reluctant to conduct these tests, considering them 'useless' or 'costly.' Dr. Rodrigues warned that by 2050, more than 50 per cent of deaths worldwide could be attributed to antibiotic resistance. Dr. Rajeev Soman echoed these concerns, stating, 'Antibiotic resistance is a major issue, and doctors are worried.' Dr. Kapil Borawake added that antibiotic resistance poses significant problems in ICUs, making it 'extremely difficult to handle patients in critical condition.' The experts advised patients to seek medical attention promptly and get their infections diagnosed early to avoid hospitalisation and prevent 20 per cent of hospitalisations due to infectious diseases. 'Lesser the use of antibiotics, better for your larger health,' Dr. Rodrigues said.

**Episode 50: This week in India's science: 12 May 2025**
A recent study from the Indian Institute of Science has found that the death of one bacterium can help other bacteria become stronger and more resistant to antibiotics. This natural process can occur even in pristine environments and is not solely caused by human activity. An international team of researchers has also built the first-ever immune cell atlas for Asian populations, which has revealed fascinating insights into immune diversity and gene variants that are common in Asian populations. Additionally, a 23-million-year-old fossil has been discovered in Assam, which suggests that a lush evergreen forest once stretched across India. Finally, scientists in Ahmedabad have developed a new compound that could offer a safer and more targeted treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia.

**Drug-resistant fungus Candida auris reported in these 17 states**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is closely monitoring the spread of the deadly and drug-resistant fungus Candida auris in the US. According to data reported to the CDC, 1,052 cases have been reported in 2025, with Texas accounting for about a quarter of these cases. Other states with high numbers of cases include Michigan, Ohio, Virginia, and Arizona. The CDC considers Candida auris an 'urgent antimicrobial resistance threat' due to its ability to develop resistance to antifungal medications, making infections difficult or impossible to treat. People with weakened immune systems, particularly those with catheters, breathing tubes, or PICC lines, are at high risk of infection. The fungus can survive on surfaces for a long time and spread to vulnerable patients. As Melissa Nolan, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of South Carolina, explained, 'It's really good at just being, generally speaking, in the environment.' The CDC estimates that 30-60% of people with C. auris infections have died, although many of these individuals had other serious illnesses that increased their risk of death.

**Researchers find 8,500 tonnes of antibiotics enter rivers every year**
A study led by McGill University reveals that nearly a third of global antibiotic use ends up in rivers, threatening aquatic ecosystems and accelerating the rise of drug-resistant bacteria. Researchers calculated that about 8,500 tonnes of antibiotics -- nearly one-third of what people consume annually -- end up in river systems around the world each year. According to Heloisa Ehalt Macedo, a postdoctoral fellow in geography at McGill, 'While the amounts of residues from individual antibiotics translate into only very small concentrations in most rivers, which makes them very difficult to detect, the chronic and cumulative environmental exposure to these substances can still pose a risk to human health and aquatic ecosystems.' The study found that amoxicillin, the world's most-used antibiotic, is the most likely present at risky levels, especially in Southeast Asia. The researchers emphasize that their study is not intended to warn about the use of antibiotics, but rather to highlight the need for mitigation and management strategies to avoid or reduce their implications on aquatic environments and antibiotic resistance.

**Vet Talk: Can antibiotic-resistant bacteria be shared between pets and their owners?**
The misuse of antibiotics in pets and humans can lead to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within households. Emerging research shows that humans and their pets often develop similar microbiomes, increasing the risk of resistant bacteria transmission. To minimize the risk of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), pet owners should consider the following steps: avoid sourcing pets from unverified breeders, use C&S testing to determine the type of bacteria and effective antibiotics, complete the full course of prescribed antibiotics, and cook pet food to reduce the risk of AMR transmission. The World Health Organisation reports nearly five million annual deaths associated with resistant infections, and the United Nations General Assembly has reaffirmed its commitment to tackling this growing crisis.

**Brazil Treats Only 0.36% of Severe Cases of Antibiotic-Resistant Infections**
A study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases revealed that Brazil treats only 0.36% of severe cases of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, one of the lowest rates among the countries analyzed. The average among the eight nations studied was 6.9%. The research highlights a significant gap in access to appropriate medications for infections caused by CRGN (gram-negative resistant to carbapenems) bacteria, considered the most difficult to combat. The study, conducted by researchers from the GARDP (Global Partnership for Research and Development of Antibiotics), used 2019 data to estimate the number of people who needed treatment and those who actually received the correct antibiotics. In Brazil, an estimated 101,000 severe cases of infection by these 'superbacteria' occurred, but only 363 patients received the correct treatment. The researchers explain that these bacteria, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are among the most lethal and resistant to various medications. They cause infections in vital organs, such as lungs and bloodstream, and generally affect patients in ICUs. The study also shows that the difficulty in accessing treatment goes beyond the lack of medications. Many patients do not even receive the correct diagnosis on time. In countries like Brazil, there is a lack of laboratories with adequate technology, hospital infrastructure to identify infections, and public policies that guarantee the correct use and distribution of antibiotics. The study warns of the vicious cycle of resistance: the inadequate use of antibiotics contributes to the emergence of 'superbacteria', but even those infected with them often cannot receive the necessary treatment, resulting in preventable deaths and greater dissemination of these infections in hospitals. The authors propose the creation of global goals similar to those used in the fight against HIV, such as the 'cascade of care', to identify and properly treat these patients. They advocate for coordinated actions between governments, healthcare systems, and pharmaceutical companies to ensure access to the right medications, expand diagnoses, and invest in new antibiotics.

**Study highlights lack of access to right antibiotics in eight countries**
A study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal has revealed that only 7.8% of patients with drug-resistant infections in India received an appropriate antibiotic, highlighting a significant gap in access to treatment. The study, conducted by the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP), looked at nearly 1.5 million cases of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CRGN) infections across eight low- and middle-income countries, including India. According to Jennifer Cohn, GARDP's Global Access Director, the study aimed to evaluate the access to antibiotics gap, create better data, and identify strong programmes for better antibiotics stewardship. Abdul Ghafur, an infectious diseases specialist, noted that India had nearly 10 lakh carbapenem-resistant gram-negative infections in 2019, yet less than 1 lakh patients received appropriate treatment, resulting in an estimated 3.5 lakh deaths. The study recommends setting regulatory guardrails to control antibiotics use and bridge the access gap, as well as conducting more research to understand the barriers in accessing care, diagnoses, and treatment. 'We must act on both fronts: preserve existing antibiotics through responsible use and ensure access to those who genuinely need them,' Dr. Ghafur suggested.

**Antimicrobial Resistance to Worsen Due to Climate Change, Study Warns**
A new study led by scientists from the University of Sun Yat-sen in Guangzhou, China, published in Nature Medicine, predicts that if things don't change, the global burden of antimicrobial resistance will increase by 2.4% by mid-century. The study analyzed 4,502 records covering 32 million isolates of 6 key bacterial pathogens resistant to antimicrobials, obtained from 101 countries between 1999 and 2022. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), addressing this global problem requires urgent multi-sectoral measures, such as reducing the misuse of antibiotics and controlling infections through measures like access to clean water and sanitation. However, climate change and the failure to implement sustainable development strategies are accelerating this global health problem. The study's authors, led by Lianping Yang, call for urgent action to address broader socio-economic and environmental factors beyond just reducing antibiotic use to mitigate this serious problem.

**Antibiotic Resistance: A Growing Threat to Children's Lives**
According to a new historical study, more than three million children worldwide died in 2022 due to infections related to antibiotic resistance (AMR). The study's data showed that 752,000 children in Southeast Asia and 659,000 children in Africa died alone in 2022. These children were mainly infected with diseases, but the antibiotics did not work, resulting in the death of so many children. AMR is a serious threat to children, who are highly sensitive to infections. Due to delays in product development, access to new antibiotic formulations for children is often severely limited. The study's data showed that many of these deaths were linked to the use of watch antibiotics (high-risk drugs) and reserve antibiotics (last resort for severe, multi-drug-resistant infections). Experts say that in the past three years, there has been a tenfold increase in infections related to antibiotic resistance in children, and the COVID-19 pandemic may have made this situation worse. AMR means that bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites become resistant to drugs. In other words, drugs fail to kill them. This situation can be particularly dangerous for children, as their immune system is not fully developed. According to the WHO, if AMR is not controlled, 1 crore people may die every year by 2050, with a large proportion being children.

**Over 3 Million Children Died from Antibiotic-Resistant Infections in 2022, Study Finds**
A recent study presented at the ESCMID Global 2025 conference found that over 3 million children worldwide died from antibiotic-resistant infections in 2022. The study highlights the urgent need for regional and global strategies to control pediatric antibiotic resistance, particularly in high-burden regions such as Southeast Asia and Africa. AMR is a significant threat to vulnerable children, and access to new antibiotics is often limited due to delayed product development. According to the study, over 752,000 children in Southeast Asia and over 659,000 children in Africa died from AMR-related complications in 2022. Many of these deaths were related to the use of Watch antibiotics (high-risk for resistance) and Reserve antibiotics (last resort for severe multi-drug resistant infections). 'The increase in Watch and Reserve antibiotic use is necessary to respond to the simultaneous emergence of resistance, but it also poses several severe long-term risks,' said co-author Professor Joseph Harwell. 'If these antibiotics are used excessively, particularly without careful monitoring, it can increase the risk of resistance and limit future treatment options. If bacteria become resistant to these antibiotics, there will be few, if any, alternative options for treating multi-drug resistant infections.'

**Over 3 Million Children Died in 2022 Due to Infections Related to Antimicrobial Resistance**
A study presented at the ESCMID Global 2025 conference revealed that over 3 million children worldwide died in 2022 due to infections related to antimicrobial resistance (RAM). The research highlights the urgent need for regional and global strategies to control pediatric RAM, particularly in high-burden areas such as Southeast Asia and Africa. RAM poses a critical threat to children, who are highly vulnerable to infections. The study found that in 2022, over 752,000 children in Southeast Asia and 659,000 children in Africa died from complications associated with RAM. Many of these deaths were linked to the use of 'watch' antibiotics (high-risk medications) and 'reserve' antibiotics (last-resort treatments for severe and multi-resistant infections). 'Although the increased use of watch and reserve antibiotics may be necessary in response to the simultaneous increase in resistant infections, the significant increase in the use of these medications presents several serious long-term risks,' said Professor Joseph Harwell, co-author of the study. 'Their increased use, especially without careful supervision, raises the risk of resistance and limits future treatment options. If bacteria develop resistance to these antibiotics, there will be few, if any, alternatives for the treatment of multi-resistant infections.' Several factors contribute to the gravity of RAM in low- and middle-income countries, including overcrowded hospitals, poor sanitation, and weak infection prevention measures that facilitate the spread of resistant pathogens in healthcare environments and communities. Professor Harwell added: 'Mortality rates, already alarmingly high, will continue to increase significantly, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where access to alternative treatments and advanced medical interventions may be limited. Addressing this issue requires urgent and coordinated action, both at the regional and global levels.'

**More than 3 million children died from antibiotic-resistant infections in 2022**
More than 3 million children died from infections related to antibiotic resistance (RAM) in 2022, according to a significant study. A historic study presented today at ESCMID Global 2025 revealed that over 3 million children worldwide lost their lives in 2022 due to infections related to RAM. The study highlights the urgent need for regional and global strategies to control pediatric RAM, particularly in high-incidence areas such as Southeast Asia and Africa. RAM represents a critical threat to children, who are highly vulnerable to infections.

**Antibiotic Resistance: A Growing Threat to Global Health**
The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human health and agriculture has led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, causing increasingly difficult to treat infections. According to a recent study published in The Lancet, the number of deaths attributed to infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to available antibiotics has increased from 1.06 million per year in 1990 to 1.14 million in 2021. The study projects that the number of deaths will continue to rise in all regions of the world until 2050, with a projected 1.91 million deaths per year. This represents a 69.6% increase from 1990, and could be even higher in regions such as South Asia and Latin America. The study estimates that 39.1 million people could die from 2025 to 2050 as a result of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The study's lead author, Mohsen Naghavi, said, 'The increase in deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections is a major cause for concern. Understanding how the trends in deaths from these infections have changed over time and how they are likely to change in the future is vital for taking informed decisions that can help save lives.' The study highlights the importance of preventing infections through measures such as vaccination, hand hygiene, and proper use of antibiotics. It also emphasizes the need for improved access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare. The study's authors note that the problem of antibiotic resistance is not just a health issue, but also an environmental and economic one. They call for a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach to address the problem, including the development of new antibiotics, improved infection control measures, and enhanced surveillance and monitoring of antibiotic resistance.

**Confronting Resistances: A Growing Global Health Concern**
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 1.3 million people die each year due to ineffective antibiotics worldwide. In Germany, up to 9,700 deaths per year are attributed to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by the Robert Koch Institute. A 2024 study published in The Lancet predicts that by 2050, up to 2 million deaths directly and up to 8.22 million indirectly will be caused by AMR worldwide. Professor Dr. Maria Vehreschild, head of the Infectiology department at the University Hospital Frankfurt, stated, 'Antimicrobial resistances are a one-health problem and a creeping pandemic.' She explained that the resistance formation is an ancient evolutionary process in bacteria, but the immense selective pressure caused by antibiotics is new. Vehreschild warned that the AMR problem is not as large in Europe as in Southeast Asia, but 'we are observing the increasing development of infections with multi-resistant bacteria.' This includes various diseases such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis. 'Multi-resistant pathogens like carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae or highly resistant Mycobacteria significantly limit treatment options,' she said. Doctors may have to rely on reserve antibiotics, but even these may not be effective.
