**The Origins and Consequences of Avian Flu in Humans**
A new outbreak of the avian flu virus in Brazil, the world's largest chicken exporter, has put the country and neighboring nations on high alert due to the risk of human transmission. According to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the number of outbreaks in mammals has increased more than double in 2024 compared to 2023, with 1,022 outbreaks in 55 countries, up from 459 in the previous year. We spoke with Eric Delgado, a doctor and master's degree holder in epidemiology, infectious diseases, and public health expert, to analyze the situation.

**Avian Influenza: A Growing Concern for Human and Animal Health**
According to Mauricio Rodríguez Álvarez, a researcher at the UNAM, the H5N1 avian influenza virus has changed its behavior in recent years, no longer only affecting migratory and domestic birds, but also a growing variety of marine and terrestrial mammals, including seals, sea lions, felines, canines, and bovines. Since 2024, there have been around 640 reported outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry farms in the United States, affecting at least 89.6 million birds, leading to a significant decrease in egg and poultry production, and consequently, an increase in prices. Rodríguez Álvarez warns that the virus's potential transmission to humans and other animals is a cause for concern, and that the risk of person-to-person transmission is increasing. He also notes that the virus's ability to cause severe illness may decrease as it becomes more contagious. Rodríguez Álvarez emphasizes the importance of addressing the issue from a 'one health' perspective, recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. He also highlights the need to strengthen virological and epidemiological surveillance, as well as prevention culture, to mitigate the risk of infection.

**US Cancels Contract with Moderna for Avian Flu Vaccine**
The US government has decided to cancel a $766 million contract with Moderna to develop a vaccine based on mRNA technology to combat potentially pandemic strains of flu, such as the H5N1 avian flu virus. The decision, announced by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has sparked a wave of reactions among public health experts and scientists. According to Andrew Nixon, director of communications at HHS, the decision was made due to concerns about the safety and ethics of using mRNA technology. Nixon stated that, after a thorough review, it was concluded that continuing to fund the H5N1 vaccine developed by Moderna was not justifiable from a scientific or ethical perspective. He added that the current administration will not replicate past decisions that, in his opinion, minimized legitimate concerns about this technology. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, described the decision as 'disappointing, but predictable', and accused the government of giving in to political pressure. Moderna expressed its disappointment and stated that the preliminary results of the phase 1/2 clinical trials have been positive, showing a robust immune response and an acceptable safety profile. Stéphane Bancel, CEO of the company, insisted that the mRNA technology has proven to be a crucial tool against emerging threats and that they will explore other avenues to continue the project. Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University and former COVID-19 response coordinator in the Biden administration, warned that the cancellation of the contract seriously weakens the country's ability to respond to a possible flu pandemic. 'Discarding the mRNA platform in this context is absurd and puts human lives at risk,' he said. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, agreed with this stance, stating that the decision leaves the US 'less prepared' to face a potential health emergency caused by a new strain of flu.

**US Cuts Research Funding: Will Europe Seize the Opportunity?**
The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr, has canceled a $700 million contract with Moderna to develop an mRNA vaccine against the H5N1 avian flu and five other pandemic influenza subtypes. An internal review found the project's progress to be insufficient compared to scientific and regulatory standards. 'We won't spend taxpayer money to repeat the mistakes of the previous administration, which hid legitimate safety concerns from the public,' said Andrew Nixon, HHS spokesperson. The contract was part of federal efforts to strengthen pandemic preparedness, including in response to the increase in H5N1 cases in farms and about 70 people in the country. The interruption of the agreement will not completely block research; Moderna has stated that it will continue to develop the vaccine with its own funds and in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an internal entity of the Nih. This approach is antithetical to that adopted by Donald Trump in 2020, when he launched the Warp Speed operation, a public-private partnership to facilitate and accelerate the development and production of vaccines against Covid-19. 'The government is dismissing what could be one of the most effective and rapid tools to counter an avian flu epidemic,' warns Amesh Adalja, expert in infectious diseases, bioterrorism, and emergency medicine, and professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. 'It's essential to remember that mRNA technology has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Today, after years of the Covid-19 pandemic, the positive cost-benefit ratio of this technology is undeniable. In this moment, with the growth of avian flu cases overseas, applied research on tools like these is crucial. And the technology works,' said Massimo Ciccozzi, professor of epidemiology and health statistics at the University of Campus Biomedico. 'We must not confuse science with politics,' he concluded. This is not the only new chapter in the heated debate on public health management overseas. Last Tuesday, the US Secretary of Health announced the intention to prevent scientists from the Nih from publishing in top medical-scientific journals such as Jama, The Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine, which he defined as 'corrupted' and influenced by the pharmaceutical industry. 'Unless those journals change radically, we will prevent Nih scientists from publishing there and create our own internal journals (at the National Institutes of Health, ndr).' It is essential to remember that the Nih, already hit by significant cuts to research, is historically the world's largest public funder of biomedical and behavioral research. In this context, the US stop could open a competitive space. The EU now has the opportunity to position itself as a global reference point in innovation, including the development of mRNA vaccines against new epidemic threats, as it will not do so, someone else might. A GlobalData report from last February showed that China has surpassed the US in clinical trials for medicines. And pharmaceutical and medical technology patents - underlines a CBRE report - have increased by 379% in China over the past decade. It remains to be seen whether the EU will seize the opportunity to strengthen its position or remain behind while others set the pace. The choice is between being a follower or a leader.

**Doubled in 2024: Global report flags rising disease risks, calls for science-based solutions**
A new global report has revealed that Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreaks in mammals have more than doubled in 2024, with over 1,000 cases reported in 55 countries. According to the World Organization of Animal Health, nearly half of all animal diseases now have the potential to infect humans. To address this growing concern, they are calling for stronger surveillance systems, science-based decisions, and broader access to vaccines to protect both animals and people. 'The report highlights the urgent need for science-based solutions to address the rising disease risks,' said the World Organization of Animal Health. The report emphasizes the importance of taking proactive measures to prevent the spread of HPAI and other animal diseases that can affect humans.

**Brazil Confirms New Focus of Avian Influenza in Montenegro, RS**
The Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture confirmed a new focus of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Montenegro, Rio Grande do Sul, on May 28. The case was detected in a wild João-de-barro bird and does not affect commercial poultry in the region. This is the second recorded case in the municipality. With the new focus, Brazil has 170 cases since the first report in 2023. Of these, 166 occurred in wild birds, three in subsistence farms, and one in a commercial farm - also in Montenegro. According to the Ministry, seven cases are still under investigation, including one in a commercial farm in Anta Gorda (RS). After confirming the commercial case in Montenegro, 24 countries imposed temporary restrictions on the importation of Brazilian chicken meat. The impact on exports is a concern for the sector. On the same day, during a hearing at the Chamber of Deputies, Minister of Agriculture Carlos Fávaro stated that the government has already initiated negotiations to reverse the embargoes. He emphasized that the World Animal Health Organization's (OMSA) recognition that the focus is restricted to Montenegro is an important technical argument for the negotiations. China, the main buyer of Brazilian protein, signaled possible flexibility, requesting information only about slaughterhouses in Rio Grande do Sul. Despite the restrictions, the minister stated that the country still has 128 open markets where the loads can be redirected. Brasília Zoo - The Secretariat of Agriculture of the Federal District informed that there are no other suspected cases in the region and that the closure is a preventive measure, following biosafety protocols. The reopening will depend on the laboratory results. According to the secretariat, there is no risk to human health in the consumption of properly inspected chicken meat and eggs. National Fund for Sanitary Emergencies - The project, reported by Deputy Rafael Pezenti (MDB-SC), provides for contributions from the Union, donations, investment profits, and voluntary contributions from the private sector. The fund will be managed by a council with representatives from the government and the productive sector.

**Minas Gerais Government Assures No Risk of Avian Flu Transmission to Humans**
The government of Minas Gerais is not concerned about the risk of transmission of avian flu to humans, according to Secretary of State Adjunta of Health, Poliana Lopes. 'We are not worried, we are very calm about this. There is no risk in consuming these foods,' she emphasized during a press conference on Wednesday (28/05). 'We make an alert about the health of the worker (who deals with birds) about the use of personal protective equipment (PPEs). With their use, there is no risk for the workers.' The government did not provide information on how many workers at the farm where the infected birds were found had contact with them or are being monitored, but assured that all are asymptomatic. The transmission of avian flu from birds to humans is not common, but can affect people who directly handle birds and have been exposed to a high viral load or have low immunity. The Ministry of Health and other public bodies emphasize that consuming chicken or eggs does not represent a risk of infection with avian flu. The recommendation is to cook them well to avoid other problems. 'We have no evidence that undercooked food transmits the disease, but cooking it is an extra prevention, because not doing so can cause salmonella,' said Secretary of State Adjunta of Health, Poliana Lopes.

**Avian Flu Outbreaks in Mammals Double in 2024, Posing Greater Risk to Humans**
In 2024, there was a doubling of avian flu outbreaks in mammals, posing a greater risk to humans. According to the OMSA, this is a major concern. The World Health Organization (OMSA) has its headquarters in Paris and is working to address the global emergency. Donald Trump has also spoken out about the need for increased security measures to prevent the spread of avian flu. The OMSA has reported that there is a growing risk of avian flu outbreaks in wild birds, mammals, and humans. The organization is also concerned about the increasing resistance to antibiotics and the need for global collaboration to address the biosecurity threat. The World Health Organization (OMSA) has warned that the risk of avian flu is becoming a major concern for human health, particularly in light of the changing climate and the potential impact on global food security.

**The Next Pandemic: Avian Flu and the Threat to Human Health**
The COVID-19 pandemic has left people on edge, waiting for the next big infectious disease. While the COVID-19 vaccines have been effective in reducing cases, the three diseases that most concern public health officials are malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis. These three diseases kill around 2 million people per year. Scientists are also constantly monitoring the horizon for potential new problems, including viruses like the flu. A particular strain of the flu, the H5N1 avian flu, is causing concern and is on the verge of becoming a major problem in 2025. This virus is widespread in both wild and domestic birds, and has recently infected cattle in several US states and horses in Mongolia. If the virus were to jump to humans, it could cause a pandemic. However, the H5N1 virus does not currently transmit easily between humans, as it is adapted to bird receptors, not human ones. A recent study has shown that a single mutation in the virus's genome could make it capable of spreading between humans, which could trigger a pandemic. Governments must act quickly to control the spread if this were to happen. Even without the potential for human-to-human transmission, the avian flu is likely to continue to affect animal health in 2025, with significant implications for animal welfare and food supply. As Dr. Conor Meehan, Professor of Microbial Bioinformatics at the University of Nottingham Trent, notes, 'knowing and preventing diseases in our environment and in the animals around us can help us prepare and combat those that enter humans.' However, we must not forget the 'slow pandemics' that continue to affect humans, such as malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis. Addressing these is crucial, as well as monitoring the horizon for new diseases that may emerge.

**Scientists Warn of Potential Avian Influenza Pandemic, Call for Immediate Action**
A group of scientists have published a letter in the journal Science warning of the potential for an avian influenza pandemic. They are calling for immediate action to prepare for a possible outbreak of H5N1, which has already infected humans in the US and caused severe illness. 'Preparing now can save lives and reduce social and economic impacts if H5N1 or another virus leads to a pandemic,' the letter states. The scientists, led by Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, note that the virus has already crossed species and adapted to mammalian hosts, including cattle, causing widespread exposure and sporadic infections in humans. They emphasize the need for urgent action to address gaps in preparedness, including the development of an effective vaccine that can be produced in large quantities quickly. They also stress the importance of equitable access to the vaccine, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, they recommend implementing a communication strategy based on scientific data to address public concerns and rebuild trust in public health. Finally, they suggest testing pandemic response plans in a transparent and collaborative manner, transcending political divisions. Currently, human infections have been contained, with 88 reported cases worldwide since January 2024, and 5 reported cases in 2025. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the risk of zoonotic transmission, including H5N1, is low for the general population, but moderate for individuals exposed professionally, depending on risk mitigation measures in place.

**Measures Already In Place For Another Plandemic – Here’s The Evidence**
The Department of Health and Human Services has awarded $590 million to Moderna to develop multiple modified mRNA injections for several 'avian influenza viruses', including H5N1 and H7N9. The funding is based on a potential public health emergency declaration, which was updated on July 24, 2024, declaring a potential public health emergency with a potential impact to national security that involves biological agents, specifically naming pandemic influenza A viruses and influenza A viruses with pandemic potential. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, has defined pandemic influenza A viruses and influenza A viruses with pandemic potential as 'animal viruses and/or human influenza A viruses circulating in wild birds, domestic animals and/or humans that cause or have significant potential to cause sporadic or ongoing human infections, or historically have caused pandemics in humans, or have mutated to cause pandemics in humans, and for which the majority of the population is immunologically naïve'. This broad definition would encompass any and all 'influenza A viruses', including H5N1, H5N2, H7N9, H10N3, H5N8, and H7N4. The PREP Act is invoked for the development of 'medical countermeasures' and the response to be directed and controlled by the military. Moderna has now received money from the government to develop multiple 'medical countermeasures' for several iterations of avian influenza. The FDA has established four Animal and Veterinary Innovation Centers (AVIC) to explore 'the use of gene editing in chickens to reduce susceptibility or provide resistance to HPAI and other avian viruses by genetically targeting pro-viral host factors, antiviral proteins, or viral genes'. The government has chosen to cull millions of commercial chicken flocks based on results of a PCR test, made infamous during the CONvid-1984 planned scam-demic. The FDA has updated their 'medical countermeasures initiative' (MCMi), which occurred on June 27, 2024, a mere month before the emergency declaration update in July 2024. The pieces are in place for rapid implementation on any 'influenza A virus' from any source to usher in medical tyranny once more, not only on the people but also on the food supply.

**Avian Influenza: A Growing Concern, Despite Trump's Block on Studies**
The avian influenza is a problem, but not a cause for alarm. The world has experienced two record-breaking epidemic seasons, recognized by the scientific community as the most severe ever. The virus has been spreading among mammals, killing polar bears for the first time, and in the US, raw milk has been identified as a vector of transmission. Now, the news is that Donald Trump has blocked studies on the virus. According to CNN, the studies would have revealed whether veterinarians who treated infected cattle were unknowingly infected themselves, and a second study would have documented cases where people infected with the virus transmitted it to their domestic cats. However, the avian influenza is not a threat to humans. The studies were supposed to be published in the official journal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the White House has put a hold on them until they are reviewed and approved by a presidential appointee. In November 2024, a Canadian boy contracted the virus, and scientists are concerned about its ability to mutate and adapt to other organisms. A month later, the first severe case in a human was reported in the US, and scientists agree that human-to-human transmission is not yet possible, and the risk to public health is considered 'low'. However, a new strain (D1.1) has been detected in a dairy worker in Nevada, which has been circulating among wild birds and cows but had not yet infected humans. This is the second time a strain of the virus has been transmitted from birds to cows. 'It's a big problem', said Michael Osterholm, an expert in infectious diseases and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. The virus is continuing to mutate, and unlike the studies, it doesn't need the White House's approval to do so.

**Federal Government Changes May Influence Avian Influenza Surveillance and Disease Prevention**
The American Public Health Association's (APHA) Executive Director Georges C Benjamin, MD, expressed concerns about the avian influenza virus, stating that it has the potential to become more infectious and lethal, potentially leading to a significant outbreak. Benjamin noted that the virus has already shown the ability to move from one species to another and could adapt to humans, easily spread by humans. He warned that if it becomes easily spreadable and more lethal, it would be worse than COVID. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) plays a crucial role in keeping the public informed about disease threats and responding to individual cases or outbreaks. However, under the Trump Administration, the CDC may face significant challenges, including layoffs and reduced funding. Additionally, the administration has been accused of withholding public information, including deleting a report on avian influenza transmission from cats to humans. Benjamin expressed concerns about the administration's actions, stating that they will diminish the CDC's capacity to respond to emergencies and new health threats. He believes that the US is not prepared for a public health emergency, saying 'If we had a big outbreak today, I don't know that we'd be able to handle it.'

**Will Bird and Swine Flus Cause the Next Pandemic? Why Experts Say Yes.**
Global health authorities are warning of a potential pandemic due to the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has killed millions of birds and infected mammals across the world. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has identified 34 genetic mutations in the virus, which could increase its ability to spread to humans. Bernhard Url, EFSA's acting director, said, 'In 2024, avian influenza viruses expanded their reach, infecting previously unaffected species. Our work identifies key mutations linked to a potential spread to humans, requiring rapid detection and response.' Experts are concerned that the virus could become airborne, making it easier for humans to contract and pass on the virus. The spread of animal diseases and their potential to cross over to humans raises concerns about another global health crisis. Wendla Beyer, Policy Coordinator at Four Paws, said, 'The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza is linked to the intensification of the poultry sector. Intensive farming has accelerated the circulation and mutation of the virus and continues to do so.' To prevent the next pandemic, experts recommend improving animal welfare within the industrial farming industry and shifting away from animal protein altogether. However, a proposed legislation, The Ending Agricultural Trade Suppression Act (EATS Act), aims to undo these steps forward for animal welfare and public health.

**Avian Flu: A Low-Risk Global Emergency, but a Concern for Human Health**
The avian flu, caused by the influenza A (H5N1) virus, has been spreading mainly in the United States since the beginning of 2024, infecting domestic birds, dairy cattle, and humans who have had contact with infected animals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the risk of a global emergency caused by the H5N1 virus is low. 'Although additional human infections associated with exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments are expected, the overall impact on public health globally at this time is small,' the WHO stated in a document published on December 20, 2024. Since 2003, over 950 human infections caused by the H5N1 virus have been reported to the WHO, with about half resulting in deaths. The Brazilian government detected a surge in wild birds in May 2023, while in the US, the number of cases jumped from one in 2022 to 66 in 2024. 'Infections in animals [by avian flu viruses] have been happening for decades, with small localized outbreaks,' explains infectious disease specialist Emy Akiyama Gouveia, of the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. 'They usually start when migratory birds spread the disease to places like Europe and the US. They also appear in regions where there is contact between a large number of animals.' According to Gouveia, the problem arises when a large number of animals are affected or there is high mortality among birds, for example. This increases the risk of human contamination and the possibility of the virus mutating. 'The pigs, for example, can be infected at the same time with the common flu virus and the avian flu virus, which would allow for a genetic exchange capable of generating a strain more adapted to human infections,' Gouveia said. The WHO maintains a program to monitor cases and the characteristics of the viruses. So far, no mutations have been found capable of generating sustained transmission between humans. The WHO also evaluates the development of possible vaccines against this infectious agent. 'Even if you find a dead bird in the park, do not touch it. You should call the competent authorities,' Gouveia advises. As the symptoms of avian flu are similar to those of common flu, it is essential to be alert if they occur after exposure to sick animals. The WHO recommends increasing vigilance and early detection of cases, as well as measures to reduce the risk of contamination for exposed workers. The document also highlights the importance of the concept of Single Health, which considers that environmental, animal health, and human health aspects are interconnected and one affects the other.

**Avian Flu: A Low-Risk Pandemic or a Growing Concern?**
The avian flu, caused by the influenza A (H5N1) virus, has been spreading in the United States since the beginning of 2024, infecting domestic birds, cattle, and humans who have had contact with infected animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US have assessed the risk of a global emergency caused by the H5N1 virus as low. 'Although additional human infections associated with exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments are expected, the overall impact on public health globally at this time is small,' the WHO said in a document published on December 20, 2024. Since 2003, over 950 human infections caused by the H5N1 virus have been reported to the WHO, with about half resulting in deaths. The risk of a pandemic is concerning due to the low immunity of the human population against this agent. 'Infections in animals [by avian flu viruses] have been occurring for decades, with small localized outbreaks,' explains infectious disease specialist Emy Akiyama Gouveia, from the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. 'They usually start when migratory birds spread the disease to areas like Europe and the US. They also appear in regions where there is contact between a large number of animals.'
