**Healthy life now for healthy ageing**
According to current trends, people born in 2040 and beyond are expected to live longer than those who are in their 40s or younger today. The average life expectancy in Europe, Oceania, America, and Japan is close to 80 years, and in Malaysia, it is more than 74 years. Considering the increasing life spans, it is not unlikely that those in their 40s or younger today will live longer than those who were in their forties 20 years ago.

**Ferramenta shows how many 'twins' you have and your estimated life expectancy**
The Population.io tool uses data from the United Nations' (UN) World Population Prospects survey to reveal how many 'doppelgangers' you have around the world. The interactive platform shows how many people were born on the same day as you in each country and globally, as well as an estimate of how many people were born at the same time. According to the tool, a person born in July 2001 would be approximately 3.1 billionth in the world's ranking of age, with the estimate updated in real-time. The platform also provides information on the percentage of younger and older people compared to the user in their country and globally. Additionally, the tool estimates a person's life expectancy based on demographic data, allowing users to compare how long they would live if they resided in another country.

**What if you could live up to 200?**
As scientists explore the possibility of living up to 200 years, many questions arise about the impact on our mindset and way of life. If humans could age relatively healthy up to 200, it would likely change our perspective on time, allowing people to pursue multiple passions and develop skill sets over decades. However, this would also require significant improvements in medical care to prevent painful aging symptoms. From a psychological perspective, being attached to one's body for 150 years would be a significant difference. This development would likely shape our societies, science, ethics, and way of living in a profound way. As one person noted, 'it is a topic we should start thinking about' and consider the potential effects on our lives.

**The Invention of the Fourth and Fifth Age**
The concept of the fourth and fifth age is emerging as the global population ages. According to the World Health Organization, in 2020, the population over 60 surpassed that of children under 5 for the first time. By 2050, there will be over 2 billion people over 60 worldwide. In the US, centenarians are expected to quadruple in the next three decades. Harvard researcher David Sinclair predicts that the first person to live to 150 is already alive, and that advances in AI will accelerate discoveries and help find cures for complex diseases. However, there is a lack of thought and writing on how new older adults will adopt new customs, what social rules they will establish, and how they will differ from each other. Journalist Dariela Sosa has launched an investigation into this topic, asking questions such as how families with four or five generations will function, and how inheritances will be transferred between generations. The concept of retirement may also be replaced by new rhythms of work, pause, and re-invention. The invention of the fourth and fifth age is underway, and we are creating a new universe of ideas, objects, and interpretations.

**Eliminating Cardiovascular Risk Factors by 50 Can Increase Life Expectancy by Over a Decade**
A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that eliminating five major cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity) by the age of 50 can increase life expectancy by over a decade. The study, conducted by the Global Cardiovascular Risk Consortium, analyzed data from over 2 million participants in 39 countries. According to cardiologist Fabiana Rached, 'The difference of more than 10 years in life expectancy and years free of cardiovascular disease between those who have and those who do not have the five main risk factors at 50 is striking and shows clearly how these factors impact cardiovascular health in the long term and in death.' The study found that women who do not have any of these risk factors develop cardiovascular disease 13.3 years later and die 14.5 years later than those who have all five. Men who do not have these risk factors live 10 years longer and die 11.8 years later. Rached emphasizes the importance of controlling these risk factors from a young age, saying, 'The accumulation of cardiovascular risk is progressive and silent. Many times the damage, such as atherosclerosis, is already underway decades before a clinical event, such as a heart attack or stroke. Controlling these factors early reduces not only future risk but also increases life expectancy and allows for a life of quality.' Even those with a high genetic risk can minimize cardiovascular problems by adopting a healthy lifestyle from a young age. The good news is that it's never too late to make changes, as even interventions made between 55 and 60 years old can still bring significant gains in years of life without cardiovascular diseases and premature death, according to Rached.

**David Sinclair: Humans Can Live Up to 150 Years**
Harvard Professor David Sinclair believes that humans can live up to 150 years. He attributes this to a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and intermittent fasting. Sinclair's research has shown that the body's natural aging process can be slowed down or even reversed through the activation of certain genes, such as sirtuins. He has also developed a method to activate these genes using a combination of exercise, diet, and supplements. Sinclair's goal is to make this method available to the general public, and he is working on a gentherapy that can be used to treat age-related diseases. He believes that this could lead to a significant increase in human lifespan, potentially up to 20-25 years. Sinclair also emphasizes the importance of preventive medicine, including regular check-ups and screenings, to detect age-related diseases early on. He is critical of the current healthcare system, which he believes is focused on treating symptoms rather than addressing the underlying causes of aging. Sinclair's research has been met with skepticism by some, but he remains optimistic about the potential of his work to improve human health and increase lifespan. He is currently working on a podcast to raise awareness about his research and is seeking funding to continue his work.

**John Cena Explains Reasons for WWE Retirement**
John Cena, a recent guest on 'Stephanie's Places', explained why he decided to retire from the WWE. He stated, 'Before, I could do a 150kg squat. I can't do it anymore because my body can't keep up. When I accepted it, I thought, I'm going to see what I can do at my best today. It's similar to the WWE. My skills are declining. It's time to move on. I wish I could be 18 again, at the top of my game, because I've never felt more at home than on the ring, except in my wife's arms.' Cena proposed the idea of a farewell tour, hoping they would be interested. They agreed, and it will take place at WWE Money in the Bank 2025.

**'MythBusters' star Adam Savage explores longevity and life hacks: 'There's no magic secret'**
Adam Savage, former 'MythBusters' star and YouTube creator, has partnered with Medtronic to explore the science of longevity. He believes that there is no 'magic secret' to living longer, but rather a mix of daily habits, including what you eat, how you move, and how you handle stress. Savage has taken a personal interest in testing different longevity strategies, including intermittent fasting, which helped him lose 25 pounds and eliminate sleep apnea. He also spoke about the psychological aspects of aging, emphasizing that mindset and community play a significant role in longevity. Medtronic, a healthcare technology company, is developing medical devices designed to manage chronic conditions and improve heart health, with the goal of enhancing not just lifespan but quality of life. Savage thinks that 150 is a 'very realistic target' for human lifespan, and that it's possible that the first person to live to 150 may already have been born.

**Billionaires are racing to extend human life by decades. They are closer than you think**
Professor David Sinclair, a Harvard genetics professor, believes that humanity is at a turning point in medical history, similar to the invention of antibiotics and vaccines. He predicts that the first person to live to 150 has already been born. Sinclair notes that the chance of reaching 100 has increased significantly over the past 100 years, from 2% to 50%, without any major technological advancements. He suggests that with future technologies, there is a reasonable chance that someone could live to 150. 'A person born 100 years ago had a 2 per cent chance of reaching 100. A child born today has a 50 per cent chance of reaching 100. That's without any major advance in technology - it's just standard medicine. So if half of the people make it to 100, there's a reasonable chance that somebody could make it to 150 with technologies that are in the future,' he says.

**Nope. There are no 150-year-olds on Social Security. It's COBOL!--UPDATED Feb 15**
Elon Musk claimed that his team found 150-year-old people collecting Social Security, implying that dead people were receiving benefits. However, it was discovered that the people receiving benefits are very much alive and are collecting their own benefits. The issue lies in the outdated computers used by Social Security, which are programmed with an old version of the programming language COBOL. COBOL uses a baseline date of May 20, 1875, which is stored as the number of days after this date. When a birthdate is unknown, it is stored as May 20, 1875, resulting in people appearing to be 150 years old. This is why Musk's team found 150-year-old people with the same birthday, May 20, 1875.

**Medtronic: Is the First Person To Live to 150 Already Among Us?**
Scientists speculate that the first person to live to 150 years may already be among us. Medtronic, a global healthcare technology company, and Sperling's BestPlaces, a research firm, have identified the top 10 US cities where this future supercentenarian may live. The cities are: Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Calif., Bridgeport, Conn., Boston, Mass., Seattle, Wash., Madison, Wis., Honolulu, Hawaii, Portland, Ore., Denver, Colo., and Raleigh, N.C. The research highlights the unique factors that could contribute to their remarkable longevity, such as access to quality healthcare and a healthy environment. As Bert Sperling of BestPlaces notes, 'the next person to defy the limits of age may already be among us.'

**Scientists Establish 150-Year Limit for Human Life**
Scientists from Singapore have established that 150 years is the maximum age limit for human life, even with the advancements of modern medicine. Researchers took thousands of blood samples from residents of the UK and US to conduct a large-scale study. They aimed to investigate and decipher the mechanisms that the body uses to fight stress, diseases, and recovery processes. During the experiment, scientists found that the body rapidly loses its regenerative function with age. This process is called physiological stability and was found to be a key factor in determining the length of human life. 'Aging is a gradual loss of the ability of the body to maintain homeostasis. Eventually, even minor stress factors can lead to a critical failure of all body systems,' explains the lead researcher of the project, Timothy Pyrkov. According to mathematical models, the absolute limit of human life is 150 years. After this threshold, even the healthiest body loses its ability to regenerate. Scientists emphasize that even overcoming serious age-related diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular, and other chronic diseases, will not be able to overcome this fundamental age barrier. Although scientists are confident that revolutionary achievements in biotechnology, regenerative medicine, and cellular reprogramming can not only slow down the aging process but also overcome the 150-year limit of human life, which was previously considered unattainable.

**Scientists Discover Maximum Age Limit for Human Lifespan**
Scientists have established the maximum age limit for human lifespan, despite claims that it's possible to live up to 150 years. According to a study by researchers in Singapore, the biological limit is clear, and it's not possible to overcome it. The study, which analyzed thousands of blood samples from the US and the UK, found that the human body's ability to recover from stress and diseases decreases with age. This process, called physiological resilience, is the main factor that determines human lifespan. 'Aging is a gradual loss of the body's ability to maintain homeostasis,' explained lead researcher Timothy Pyrkov. 'Even minor stress can cause a critical failure of all systems.' The study's mathematical models suggest that the maximum human lifespan is 120-150 years. After that, even the healthiest body loses its ability to recover. However, researchers believe that advances in biotechnology, regenerative medicine, and cellular reprogramming may be able to slow down the aging process and potentially overcome the 150-year barrier. 'These innovations can not only slow down aging but also help us overcome the 150-year barrier,' said Pyrkov. 'We are confident that these technologies will be able to help us live longer and healthier lives.'
