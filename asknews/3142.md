**Protecting the Moon's Cultural Heritage: A New Challenge for Space Exploration**
The increasing number of missions to the Moon is raising a new question: how will the cultural and historical sites on the Moon's surface be protected? The World Monuments Fund (WMF) has added the Moon to its 2025 'Watch List', highlighting the risk of damage to these sites. WMF is calling for an international protection protocol similar to the Antarctic Treaty, to prevent irreversible damage to the landing sites on the Moon. This call is supported by many global actors, including the International Council on Monuments and Sites. WMF is currently working to bring together international partners to develop common principles and long-term goals for the conservation of cultural heritage in space. The increasing activity on the Moon is also creating uncertainty about who can land where, and the potential for second landings in areas where previous missions have left their mark is raising both scientific and ethical concerns. Organizations like 'For All Moonkind' are working to establish national and international regulations to protect these areas, and the United Nations' Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) has launched a new initiative, the 'Lunar Activities Advisory Action Team' (ATLAC), to promote sustainable use of the Moon. However, this protection effort may have an interesting side effect: if access to these areas is restricted, it could provide a new platform for conspiracy theorists who still question whether humans actually landed on the Moon in 1969. Therefore, a delicate balance must be struck between preserving space history and leaving a truthful and accessible record for future generations.

**The moon: Why we want to go back**
NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole, called Artemis Base Camp, and launch a new space station, Gateway, into the moon's orbit. A joint China-Russia project, the International Lunar Research Station, also plans to build a moon base by 2035. The moon's resources, including water, regolith, and helium-3, make it an attractive destination for future space missions. These resources can be used to sustain lunar bases, extract minerals from asteroids, and even provide fuel for nuclear fusion power. The moon's distance from Earth also makes it an ideal location for testing technologies and equipment for future Mars missions. According to Sara Pastor, ESA's Lunar and Gateway Program Manager, 'Humans have had a continued presence in space for the past 20 years aboard the International Space Station. But the ISS is only 250 miles away in low-Earth orbit, which is as little as four hours after launching from Earth. The moon is 250,000 miles away -- about three days' spaceflight -- and a far riskier journey for astronauts.' The first research on the moon aims to make that journey safer and easier, and to determine how human activity affects the lunar environment. 'ESA is developing instruments for radiation environment measurements, drilling and in-situ sample analysis, geophysics and lunar space weather,' Pastor said. The long-term goal of building surface and orbital moon bases is to serve as a staging post for more distant space travel, and to provide a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration, as Pastor noted, 'A colony on the moon will be extremely useful and a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration.'

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**American, European, and Japanese Missions to Explore the Moon**
After a half-century since the Apollo mission left footprints on the moon, the moon has re-emerged as a destination for ambitious and precise engineering. However, this time, the competition is not limited to the major powers competing to raise their flags on the moon, but also private companies, multi-national partnerships, and 'robotic scouts', all seeking to explore the moon and pave the way for human return in the future. The Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) assessment test results released by the school system show that literacy levels have improved across the board for kindergarteners, first- and second-graders in the Montgomery County Public Schools system. The DIBELS assessment consists of short tests that measure phonics, reading fluency and other literacy skills, depending on the age group. The fall 2023 DIBELS assessment results showed 49.9% of kindergarten students, 58.0% of first-graders, and 60.4% of second-grade students met or went above benchmark status. That's up from fall 2022, when results showed 47.0% of kindergarten students, 52.5% of first-graders and, 56.0% of second-graders met or went above benchmark literacy goals for their age group. The moon's surface topography makes landing on it a challenging task. The moon's gravity is weaker than Earth's, and the surface is covered with craters, mountains, and lava flows. The moon's rotation is also synchronized with its orbit around Earth, which means that the same side of the moon always faces our planet. This makes it difficult to land on the moon's surface, as the spacecraft must navigate through the moon's gravitational field and avoid obstacles such as craters and mountains. The European Space Agency (ESA) is planning to launch the Lunar Pathfinder, a small lunar satellite, to facilitate communication between future missions and Earth. The mission will be launched in 2025 and will provide a communication relay for future missions, especially those that will operate on the far side or at the poles of the moon. The US company Intuitive Machines is planning to launch the IM-3 mission in late 2025 to test new advanced tools and possibly transfer NASA experiments to the moon. The mission will be launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and will include a lunar lander and a rover. The rover will be designed to explore the moon's surface and collect samples, while the lander will provide a platform for the rover to operate from. The mission will also include a communication relay to facilitate communication between the rover and Earth. The mission is part of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon by 2024. The program includes several missions, including the IM-3 mission, which will test new technologies and provide a platform for future missions to the moon. The mission will also include a lunar lander and a rover, which will be designed to explore the moon's surface and collect samples. The rover will be equipped with advanced instruments, including a drill and a spectrometer, which will allow it to collect and analyze samples from the moon's surface. The mission will also include a communication relay to facilitate communication between the rover and Earth. The mission is expected to launch in late 2025 and will provide a significant step forward in the exploration of the moon.

**Turkey Aims to be First to Send Two Exploration Vehicles to Moon's South Pole**
Turkey aims to be the first country to send two exploration vehicles to the Moon's south pole simultaneously. The 'CHERI' vehicles, developed by ODTÜ ROMER researchers, will land on the Moon's surface in 2028 as part of China's Chang'e-8 mission. They will create a 3D map of the surface using artificial intelligence, despite the harsh conditions. ODTÜ Aviation and Space Engineering Department Professor Dr. Halil Ersin Söken said, 'Currently, there are 5 countries that can send rovers to the Moon. We aim to be the 6th country to successfully complete this mission and the first to operate two rovers simultaneously on the Moon's surface.' Rektor Prof. Dr. Ahmet Yozgatlıgil added, 'This project will enable us to establish Turkey's presence on the Moon's surface in 2028.' Meanwhile, the Turkish government has announced several other initiatives, including the digital transformation of tapu and kadastro processes, which will reduce processing times to seconds. Additionally, the Diyanet has issued a warning that kurban animals sacrificed before the Bayram namazı are invalid. The Turkish Parliament will also convene this week to elect a new Speaker and discuss the 10th Yargı Paketi. Furthermore, the government has introduced a new regulation requiring musicians and instrumentalists to obtain a professional license, and there has been an increase in interest in camping and caravaning ahead of the summer season and Bayram holiday.

**Elon Musk targets 2026 for first space mission to Mars**
Elon Musk aims to launch the first space mission to Mars by the end of 2026, but acknowledges that overcoming technological hurdles, particularly in-orbit refueling, is crucial for the long journey. A favorable planetary alignment in late 2026 provides a unique opportunity for a relatively short transit between Earth and Mars. If Starship is not ready by then, a new mission in 2028 would be targeted. The first mission would consist of -built Optimus humanoid robots. Despite failed test flights, including a fuel leak and uncontrolled spinning on the ninth test flight, Musk remains optimistic, citing each failure as valuable data for accelerated testing. NASA relies on Starship for its Artemis program, which aims to send astronauts to the moon as early as 2027, a stepping stone to possible human missions to Mars in the 2030s. Musk's ultimate vision is to launch up to 2,000 Starships every two years to establish a permanent and self-sustaining human settlement on Mars.

**More than half of young people will face health problems by 2030**
A new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, more than 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity and overweight have increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The document also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. In 2016, fewer than 1,000 adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, but by 2021, the number had already exceeded 1.1 billion. Another concerning aspect is the role that climate change and technology will play. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with an average annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. According to UN estimates, by 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24. This generation faces a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.

**The New Space Race: Who Will Be the First to Return to the Moon?**
The competition to explore and potentially exploit the Moon has been ongoing since the Cold War era between the USSR and the US. The US was the first to land humans on the Moon in 1969, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin being the first to set foot on the lunar surface. Since then, 12 American astronauts have visited the Moon, with the last being Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt in 1972. The private sector has recently become involved in the competition, with China successfully landing a spacecraft on the Moon's far side in 2019 and announcing plans to send humans to the Moon by 2030. The US has also announced plans to return to the Moon, with a mission scheduled for 2027, but this has been delayed due to budget cuts. The US is counting on private companies to participate in the competition, with companies such as Intuitive Machines and Firefly Aerospace launching modules to the Moon in recent months. As the competition heats up, other nations such as India and the UAE are also joining the race.

**Musk Predicts 1 Million People on Mars in 20 Years, Establishing a Self-Sufficient City**
Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has predicted that humans will establish a self-sufficient city on Mars within 20 years, with a population of 1 million people. He also revealed that 2029 will be a historic moment when humans first set foot on Mars. According to Deutsche Welle, Musk stated on X platform that SpaceX plans to execute a landing mission in 2026, aiming to send Tesla's humanoid robot 'Optimus' to Mars using the 'Starship' rocket. If the mission is successful, he estimates that humans will complete their first Mars landing in 2029, but the most likely implementation time is 2031. Musk emphasized the importance of establishing a self-sufficient Martian city for the continuation of human civilization, saying, 'Even if Earth faces a disaster, Martian residents can survive independently.' He added, 'We need to build a self-sufficient city on Mars as soon as possible, which is the key threshold to ensure the survival of civilization. Even if Earth's supply ships stop flying or a major disaster occurs, the Martian civilization can continue.' Musk also mentioned that building a self-sufficient Martian city requires rebuilding all industrial foundations on Earth, and the primary task in the harsh Martian environment is to build a living module similar to a glass dome to provide a suitable space for human habitation. The 'Starship' rocket, developed by SpaceX, is considered the core of Musk's Mars plan. This reusable heavy-lift rocket will not only support NASA's 'Artemis' program to help humans return to the Moon but also undertake the mission of humans setting foot on Mars.

**Blue Ghost Lunar Module Successfully Lands on the Moon**
The Blue Ghost lunar module, developed by Firefly Aerospace, successfully landed on the Moon on Sunday, March 2, at 03:34 EST. The module is conducting research near the LaGrange L1 point in the Mare Crisium on the visible side of the Moon. It is equipped with ten research instruments and tools, including those for studying the lunar regolith, lunar dust, and various radiation. The mission aims to collect data that will help prepare for future manned missions to the Moon. The mission will last 14 days, and there are no plans to return the module to Earth in the near future. The module will transmit graphic content back to Earth, including a photo taken immediately after landing. The Blue Ghost mission is the largest commercial mission to the Moon to date, with private companies developing the modules and the rocket. However, NASA provided some funding for the program. NASA aims to collect more data about the Moon before returning humans to the lunar surface, which is planned for over 50 years after the last manned mission, Apollo 17, in December 1972. The US is the only country to have sent astronauts to the Moon, with 12 people visiting between 1969 and 1972. China is now competing with the US, aiming to land humans on the Moon by 2030. China has already successfully landed several robotic missions on the Moon, as have the US, Russia, Japan, and India.

**Blue Ghost Lands on the Moon, Paving the Way for Human Return**
The private spacecraft Blue Ghost has landed on the Moon, carrying ten scientific instruments, including one built by the Italian Space Agency (ASI). The lander, named after a rare type of dragonfly, will study the lunar surface in search of water, paving the way for a human return. The ASI's instrument, called LuGre, will determine the lander's position on the Moon with high accuracy. Other instruments will measure the temperature of the lunar soil and analyze the dust kicked up by the landing. Blue Ghost will collect data for 14 days before the lunar night sets in, and will also attempt to capture a total solar eclipse. Another lander, Athena, is set to land near the Moon's south pole on Thursday, and will search for water on the lunar surface. The US space agency NASA is planning to return humans to the Moon by 2026-2027, and is funding private companies to conduct scientific missions on the Moon. The Chinese space agency has announced plans to return humans to the Moon by 2030, sparking a rivalry with the US.
