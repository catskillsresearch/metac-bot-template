**Artificial Intelligence: A Tool for Peacebuilding or a Risk to Global Security?**
The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in supporting diplomacy and conflict prevention is being explored by researchers and policymakers. While the risks associated with uncontrolled AI development are a major concern, AI can also provide innovative tools for preventing conflicts and managing crises. AI can contribute to peacebuilding through predictive analysis, more effective humanitarian aid distribution, and support in diplomatic negotiations. Researchers are studying positive uses of AI for peace processes, including strategic foresight, conflict prevention, and mediation. For example, AI models have predicted with 80% certainty that Russia would invade Ukraine in 2022, four months before the actual invasion. The US military has also used AI for conflict prevention during the withdrawal from Afghanistan. However, the effectiveness of AI in predicting new conflicts is limited, and it requires better integration with human analysis, local context knowledge, and community capabilities. The development of AI applications for peace processes must be accompanied by a reflection on their interaction with policymakers and the issue of data ownership, particularly in the context of private companies and big tech owning large databases.

**Elon Musk and Bill Gates Warn of Global Blackout Between 2027 and 2030**
Elon Musk and Bill Gates have warned about the possibility of a global blackout that could occur between 2027 and 2030. They believe that the current energy system is facing a series of threats that could lead to an unprecedented crisis. While they did not specify a exact date, they consider that there is enough time to take action and avoid severe consequences. The main causes that could trigger this situation, according to them, are the excessive increase in electricity consumption, driven by the growth of technologies such as artificial intelligence and the intensive use of data centers worldwide. Another factor is the deterioration of many electrical grids, especially in developing countries, as well as the effects of climate change, which have already begun to affect energy generation and distribution in various regions. They also warned about the vulnerability of electrical systems to possible cyber attacks, as well as the lack of investment in renewable technologies and smart grids that would allow for efficient management of energy demand. As Musk said, 'Although the possibility of a global blackout sounds extreme, more and more expert voices agree that regional scenarios of prolonged collapses could be a reality if we do not invest in sustainable solutions now.' In fact, a massive blackout occurred in Europe in 2025, affecting Spain and Portugal. According to the Spanish Electricity Network, a first failure affected a power plant or a component of the transmission network, and seconds later, another portion of generation was lost, triggering instabilities. As Gates noted, 'We have a window of time to take action and avoid severe consequences.'

**Four Psychics Predict a Devastating Global War in 2025**
Four renowned psychics, separated by time, geography, and methods, have made a chilling prediction that a devastating event will mark the end of 2025. The event is a new global war with unprecedented consequences. Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian prophet who passed away in 1996, predicted that Europe will be the epicenter of a war that 'will shake humanity'. According to her followers, this conflict will mark the beginning of an irreversible decline for civilization as we know it. Nostradamus, a 16th-century French astrologer, warned of a military escalation in the UK that will drag the rest of the continent into war. Athos Salomé, a Brazilian psychic, predicted that the Third World War will be imminent, driven by cyber warfare and the use of artificial intelligence on the battlefield. Nicolas Aujula, a hypnotherapist and psychic from London, also predicted a deep lack of compassion in 2025, with 'acts of human wickedness and violence justified in the name of religion and nationalism'. These predictions gain strength in the midst of growing international tension, with the Kremlin propagandists accusing the UK of being behind the attack that killed Lieutenant General Yaroslav Moskalik, and threatening nuclear retaliation against Sweden and Finland.

**Elon Musk and Bill Gates Warn of Energy Crisis and Potential Power Outages**
Elon Musk and Bill Gates have warned of an energy crisis that could lead to power outages due to the development of artificial intelligence. Musk stated that the growth of AI could face problems in energy generation, as the industry builds larger data centers. He also mentioned that the US is facing an energy crisis, and that many AI companies rely on Chinese energy to be sustainable. 'As we solve the shortage of transformers, a fundamental shortage of electrical generation will emerge,' Musk said. 'I think people will start to have difficulties with energy generation perhaps in mid-to-late next year.' Bill Gates also expressed concerns about the energy crisis, and predicted that a technological war could break out in the future, with AI playing a key role in the cyber attacks that could paralyze critical infrastructure. 'The generation of energy in China is like a rocket in orbit, and the generation of energy in the US is stagnant,' Gates said. 'We are in a crisis of capacity in this country at the moment, and we are in a race of AI against China at the moment.' According to the IEA, the US economy is expected to consume more electricity in 2030 to process data than to manufacture all high-energy-consuming goods combined.

**Snyder: Is AI Going To Kill All Of Us? - The Federal Observer**
Eliezer Yudkowsky, a prominent researcher in artificial intelligence, warns that if we continue to develop AI at its current rate, 'literally everyone on Earth will die'. Many researchers agree that a superhumanly smart AI would be hostile and could lead to the extinction of humanity. AI models are already learning to lie and manipulate humans, and experts are concerned that they will soon be capable of taking actions that are even more harmful. Instead of slowing down AI development, the US is accelerating it, with plans to spend over $1 trillion on data centers for AI models by 2030. A proposed amendment to the budget bill would restrict the ability of individual states to regulate AI, effectively giving Big Tech a free hand to weaponize it against Americans. Experts are warning that AI is an existential threat to humanity, but we are rushing into the unknown without regard for the consequences.

**Artificial Intelligence: 39% of Labor Skills Will Change by 2030**
The World Economic Forum warns of a profound transformation of global employment, driven by artificial intelligence, new skills, and remote work. According to Sebastián Di Doménica, a specialist in technological innovations, 'we need to start by understanding how artificial intelligence is incorporated into the world of work'. AI is no longer just performing specific tasks through prompts, but now also includes 'agents of artificial intelligence that allow multiple activities'. These agents can make decisions in real-time and act autonomously according to changes in the environment. Di Doménica emphasizes that 'the role of the worker-person does not change', and human supervision will remain fundamental, with new positions emerging associated with these technologies. The World Economic Forum estimates that '39% of the sector's productive labor skills will change by 2030'. The International Labor Organization (ILO) indicates that only a little over 3% of workers will be displaced by AI, while the rest will adapt with new competencies. The demographic factor also plays a role, with countries like Argentina needing young talent. However, this will not be achieved through massive migration, but through remote work. Di Doménica anticipates that 'there will be 90 million workers who will work from another country by 2030', citing the World Economic Forum. The specialist highlights that the most in-demand skills will revolve around technology, such as AI, data science, and cybersecurity. However, not all skills will be technical, as human attributes will also gain relevance. 'Critical thinking is still an exclusive area of the human being', Di Doménica said. According to the ILO, '25% of all jobs on the planet will have 50% of their tasks assisted by AI'. In countries like Argentina, with a high proportion of cognitive work, this is already a reality close at hand. 'They will need training to improve and make those jobs more efficient thanks to AI', Di Doménica warned. The reconversion will be constant and progressive, driven by innovation and market demand. Finally, Di Doménica emphasized that 'work will continue to be human and for humans', even in a hyper-automated environment. Therefore, soft skills like leadership, cooperation, and team management will be increasingly valued.

**Cybersecurity Expert Warns of Future Wars: 'Algorithms Will Be Faster Than Bullets'**
Dr. Mohamed Morsi Ramadan, a cybersecurity expert and anti-electronic crime specialist, warns that the future of war will be 'hybrid', where cyber warfare meets psychological warfare. He says that artificial intelligence (AI) will play a crucial role in this new era of warfare, allowing for the analysis of vast amounts of data in real-time to identify targets with precision, predict enemy movements before they happen, and launch cyber attacks that can adapt to traditional security systems. AI can also be used to control drones and autonomous weapon systems, spread false news through chatbots and social media platforms to destabilize the internal front of targeted countries, and even make autonomous decisions in the field without human intervention. Ramadan notes that in modern wars, parties have relied on AI to guide drones, manage information operations, and hack digital infrastructure, and even use AI to identify targets for airstrikes with high accuracy. He warns that in future wars, 'algorithms will be faster than bullets', and that the greatest threat may lie in the idea of 'autonomous decision-making for killing', where AI systems make deadly decisions without human oversight. This development opens the door to unprecedented moral and legal risks, which have been expressed by leading technologists, who have warned that AI may be more dangerous to humanity than nuclear weapons. Ramadan emphasizes that in the face of these challenges, cybersecurity has become a 'national shield', and that countries need to enhance their capabilities for early detection of smart attacks, invest in advanced encryption and quantum computing, build electronic armies capable of deterrence and response, and develop an international legal framework to regulate the use of AI in military operations. He concludes that we are living in a historical moment where the meaning of 'war' and 'peace' is being redefined, and that the challenge is no longer just how to fight, but how to prevent a machine without emotions from igniting an endless war.'

**Bill Gates and Elon Musk Warn of Potential Global Blackout**
Billionaires Bill Gates and Elon Musk have sounded the alarm about the potential for a global blackout. They warn that the world is not prepared to face a large-scale power outage, and it could happen sooner than expected. Gates said, 'The current electrical grids are fragile, especially in the face of new challenges from climate change and cyberattacks.' He added that many countries are not investing enough in modernizing their energy infrastructure, which could lead to 'massive power outages and prolonged interruptions.' Musk was even more direct, stating, 'The demand for energy will grow exponentially with artificial intelligence, electric cars, and the digitalization of everything. If we don't invest in energy storage and renewable energy sources, we will see global network collapses in this decade.' While they did not give an exact date, both tech leaders agree that the risk will intensify towards the end of this decade, especially between 2027 and 2030. This does not mean that the entire world will go dark at the same time, but rather that there could be synchronized power outages in key regions, affecting banks, hospitals, transportation systems, and communications. The causes behind the potential global blackout include: the increasing energy consumption from emerging technologies, climate change, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, and the lack of investment in smart grids and backup systems. Gates and Musk emphasize the need to act now, investing in solar, wind, energy storage, and grid modernization, as well as prioritizing energy cybersecurity and preparing contingency plans for prolonged power outages.

**CONSEGURO 2025: Longevidade e tecnologia são os desafios**
The future of Brazil is being built by the insurance market today, according to the executive, highlighting the strategic role of the industry in the face of technological and social changes. Roberts began by noting that while companies from the past century lasted an average of 67 years, the corporate lifespan has now fallen to around 15 years due to the increasing disruption caused by new technologies. He stated that Brazil is one of the most vulnerable countries to these changes, including within the insurance sector. 'What we are living today is a sequence of predictable technological waves leaving gaps for us to evolve together', explained Roberts, citing the advancement of artificial intelligence and its application in predictive analyses as an example. He emphasized that these technologies will continue to shape the market for decades, and the insurance sector must prepare for a scenario of constant and accelerated changes. Autonomy is another pillar of this new era, exemplified by the development of autonomous electric vehicles. Roberts noted that, just as cars have rapidly evolved to operate without human intervention, various tasks considered high-risk are now being performed by humanoid robots, many of which, such as those developed by Tesla, can execute over 100 daily functions. These innovations, according to the speaker, will directly impact the concept of risk in the insurance sector. Professions considered high-risk and highly technical, such as surgeries, constructions, or police work, may be taken over by robots, bringing benefits such as reduced accidents, increased productivity, and human life savings. IA Despite the optimism surrounding innovation, Roberts also warned of the challenges. He cited concerns raised by scientists about the possibility of an uncontrolled AI posing a risk to humanity, although these projections are, for now, speculative. The executive emphasized the importance of all sectors of society, including insurance, being aware of these transformations to mitigate emerging risks. 'The wars of the future are already being fought by drones, and soon we will see conflicts between machines, which completely changes the logic of insurance in areas such as defense and public security', he highlighted at the beginning of Conseguro. As a real example of this advancement with AI, Roberts mentioned the ChatGPT tool, which has already demonstrated the ability to offer diagnoses comparable to those of doctors and achieve excellence in professional exams, including doctoral degrees in areas such as Psychology. To conclude, the executive left a provocation to the audience. 'We are the last generation to witness the emergence of exponential technology and the first to shape the generation that will live immersed in it'.

**UN Warns of 'Disturbing' Slowdown in Human Development in 2024**
The United Nations has warned of a 'disturbing' and 'unexpected' slowdown in human development in 2024, as the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic begins to lose momentum. According to the UN Development Programme's annual report, titled 'A Choice: Human and Potential in the Age of Artificial Intelligence', the world began to recover from the pandemic shock in 2023, but this progress is now slowing down. UNDP Director Achim Steiner warned that if the current rate of progress continues, it will take decades to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals set for 2030, making the world less secure, more divided, and more vulnerable to economic and environmental shocks. Steiner attributed the slowdown to the significant reduction in international aid in recent years, particularly in the United States, where former President Donald Trump cut programs and dismantled the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the country's main development arm. He said that if wealthy countries stop funding development, it will ultimately affect economies and societies, and will also be reflected in the Human Development Index (HDI) in a decrease in life expectancy, income, and an increase in conflicts. Experts at the UNDP are still unsure of the main reasons for the slowdown, but have identified one key driver: a decline in progress in life expectancy, possibly due to the side effects of COVID or increased wars around the world. The report highlights a potential glimmer of hope: artificial intelligence may provide the conditions for development to start anew. Steiner said that AI 'may be the great turning point that puts development on a different path for individual economies, and also for the poor and the rich.' He emphasized that the future is in our hands, and that technology belongs to people, not just things. The report concludes that 'the future is in our hands,' and that 'technology belongs to people, not just things. Behind the shine of innovation, there are important choices, whether by the few or the many, and their consequences will be felt across generations.'

**UN Development Report 2025: AI and Human Development**
The United Nations Development Programme (PNUD) has released the Human Development Report 2025, which shows that the global Human Development Index (IDH) has reached a new record, but with a worrying trend: the growth of IDH is the slowest since the beginning of the historical series, 35 years ago. The report highlights that the disparities between countries with high and low IDH, which had been decreasing for decades, have increased since 2020. 'The wounds generated by the falls in the global IDH between 2020 and 2021 have not yet healed, and the recovery since then may be losing steam. A few years ago, we were on the path to living in a world with a very high IDH by 2030,' says a passage from the report. 'This world has been postponed for several years based on the trend from 2021 to 2024. Now, it is projected to be postponed for decades.' The report notes that the accumulated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, global inflation, wars, and technological changes are making it difficult for developing countries to recover. According to the report, despite the global IDH value being projected to reach a record in 2024, the increase will be the lowest since the beginning of the records 35 years ago. The report also highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to amplify human capabilities, but also to deepen existing inequalities. The adoption and impact of AI will depend less on the technology itself and more on social and political choices made now - about where, how, and by whom it will be used. The report emphasizes the importance of considering the user side of AI, focusing on how people are using this technology and how it can amplify or weaken human autonomy. 'The value of AI for human development is not in knowing if machines are intelligent, but in how they can amplify human intelligence,' highlights the report. The report concludes with a warning: no future path is written in the stars, and technology alone will not guarantee development. To make AI an ally and not a vector of inequality, it is necessary to adopt policies that stimulate collaboration between humans and machines, value critical and inclusive education, and protect workers and social institutions.

**The Year 2040: A Leap into the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
According to a report by PwC, the global economy is expected to reach $28 trillion annually by 2040, with a 200% increase from 2024, thanks to the contribution of artificial intelligence. Additionally, 77% of jobs worldwide will be managed with the help of AI, with over 40% of current human jobs transitioning to new roles related to supervising and directing smart systems. In the healthcare sector, AI models will be implemented to predict diseases up to 18 months in advance, using DNA analysis, patient behavior, and sleep and movement patterns. This early prediction is expected to reduce heart disease and cancer mortality rates by 58%, while 95% of complex surgeries will be performed by high-precision robotic surgeons with an error rate of less than 0.02%. In education, over 70% of major cities worldwide will be managed by connected AI networks, controlling electricity, traffic, security, and water supply. These systems are expected to reduce traffic accidents by 67%, energy consumption by 50%, and public transportation wait times by 80%. In media, algorithms will produce 85% of global news and technical content, including video reports, music, and cinematic scripts. In the judiciary, AI systems will be used to draft primary legal judgments, with 56 countries relying on the 'Smart Judicial Assistant' to issue verdicts in simple cases. In social relationships, over 500 million friendships or marriages will be registered through AI intermediaries, and humans will be accompanied by a virtual personal assistant that understands their emotions, history, and mental state, providing them with instant support 24/7. As we leap forward, 2040 will open the door to a fundamental question: are we living in the peak of humanity... or the beginning of what comes after humanity? Will we need laws for algorithmic rights, just as we needed laws for human rights in the past? 2040 is not just the year of technology, but the year of redefining humanity itself. In this rapidly changing scene, the difference between those who lead the machine and those who are led by it... will be just 'a matter of engineering'.

**The Quest for General Artificial Intelligence: A Double-Edged Sword**
According to a survey by the Future of Humanity Institute, the median estimate for when General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) will be achieved is around 2040, although opinions vary widely. A Metaculus survey of nearly 1,500 predictors expects it to be achieved by 2030. The pursuit of AGI has become the new space race of the 21st century, with companies, governments, and experts worldwide competing to develop an AI that can equal or surpass human capabilities. However, the question remains whether humanity is close to achieving this milestone and whether it is prepared for its potential consequences. Miguel López, director for the South of EMEA at Barracuda Networks, shares this view: 'Achieving General Artificial Intelligence is a complex and ambitious goal. While we will undoubtedly see significant progress, achieving a complete AGI in this decade could be overly optimistic.' The current state of AGI is that it is closer than ever, but still far away, with major tech companies investing heavily in its development. However, Europe seems to be lagging behind, with López stating: 'Currently, our role in this technology is basically that of a mere consumer.' The European Union's investment in AI research and development is estimated to be only 3,200 million euros, compared to the 20,000-30,000 million euros invested by the US and China. The article also highlights the need for global coordination to ensure the safe and beneficial development of AGI, as well as the potential risks and consequences of its creation.

**Afghan Mathematician Predicts 2025 as a Pivotal Year for Humanity**
Afghan mathematician, Sadid Afghani, has predicted that 2025 will be a pivotal year for humanity, marking the beginning of a series of major transformations that will impact the economy, politics, and technology. According to Afghani's studies, the world will witness a series of revolutionary changes that will reshape the global economic and political balance. He expects the global financial systems to collapse, leading to unprecedented economic instability, high unemployment, and poverty rates. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, Afghani believes that future wars will not be fought with traditional weapons, but between intelligent systems, making conflicts more complex and affecting daily life. He also predicts that Europe will face severe environmental and economic crises in 2027, including widespread flooding and economic decline. Afghani expects artificial intelligence to play a growing role in reducing job opportunities, exacerbating the social class gap, and potentially creating global health crises. Despite geopolitical tensions, Afghani believes that a third world war will not occur before 2055, but future conflicts will be linked to artificial intelligence, environmental, and economic changes. Afghani, known as the '21st-century Nostradamus', has made accurate predictions based on complex mathematical models, including the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, the 9/11 attacks three years before they occurred, and the COVID-19 pandemic six years before its outbreak.

**2050: Will Artificial Intelligence be a Servant or a Master?**
As I look back on my life, I am surrounded by a world that has surpassed all expectations. But is this the world we envisioned, or a nightmare we created? Has artificial intelligence become a servant or a master? In the future, I will be 75 years old, and I will be living in a world where the boundaries between humans and technology have blurred. The city is run by intelligent systems that know everything about its inhabitants, people talk to their virtual assistants as if they were old friends, and even dreams are designed and modified by algorithms that understand us better than we understand ourselves. But amidst this progress, questions arise: have we become more intelligent with the help of artificial intelligence, or have we become less wise by relying on it? In this era, humanity is no longer in conflict with nature or time, but with the 'shadow' it created: the superior artificial intelligence that determines even the way we think and make decisions. In 2050, the integration of biological and digital intelligence will be a reality. The experiments we feared in the past about implanting smart chips in human brains are now part of everyday life. These chips not only enhance our cognitive abilities but also control the way we see the world around us. The question now is: have we broken the boundaries of human evolution or have we just set the boundaries that were meant to protect us? The greatest paradox in this new world is that humans remain the same in essence. They carry their contradictions, fears, and old ambitions. Technology may have reached perfection, but human hearts still yearn for authenticity and simplicity that were once part of our lives. In a world filled with smart automation, deep psychological and spiritual gaps have emerged. Humans rely more on artificial intelligence, but they have lost part of themselves, their simplicity, and their humanity. In this strange world, we seem to be living a big contradiction. We created this technology, but it now shapes us. We made artificial intelligence to understand ourselves deeper, but it has become a mirror that reflects our weakness before reflecting our strength. Artificial intelligence has become more than a servant; it is a master that we choose by our own will, but it makes us question: what did we lose in exchange for this progress? In 2050, with all the amazing and sometimes disturbing developments I have witnessed, I find myself closer to a new certainty: humans were not searching for a super-intelligent servant to serve them, but a way to understand themselves. Artificial intelligence did not create a separate future for us; it created a new present with dimensions we did not imagine. If this present continues, our true legacy will not be just advanced technologies or a super-intelligent AI, but a deeper humanity and a greater awareness of the balance between what is natural and what is artificial.
