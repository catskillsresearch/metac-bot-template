**EUA to Develop 'Artificial Sun' with Big Tech Support**
Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a startup from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has raised over $1 billion (R$ 5.7 billion) to build the world's first commercial-scale fusion power plant in the United States. The investment was led by an unnamed hyperscale developer, according to Axios Pro. Google and Microsoft, among other big tech companies, have already invested in the project. Microsoft is also the cloud services provider for CFS. The ARC plant, which aims to start operations in the early 2030s, will generate 400 megawatts of clean and carbon-free electricity, enough to power large industrial facilities or around 150,000 homes. The plant will be built in collaboration with Dominion Energy Virginia, which will provide development and technical expertise, as well as land rights. CFS will finance, build, own, and operate the plant independently. The project is seen as a cleaner alternative to nuclear fission, using less resources and generating no long-lasting radioactive waste. However, harnessing fusion energy has proven to be challenging, requiring high temperatures to create and maintain the fusion reaction. CFS is currently developing its SPARC machine, which is expected to produce its first plasma in 2026 and demonstrate a commercially relevant project that produces more energy than it consumes.

**Lee backs nuclear power - for now**
Presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being', but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables to supply industrial hubs and aims to phase out coal by 2040. He supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' In contrast, Lee's main rival, Kim Moon-soo, supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60% of the mix. South Korea's latest energy blueprint aims for nuclear to make up 35% of the power mix by 2038, with renewables at 29%. If elected, Lee is expected to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30% of the power mix by 2030.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**US Announces Largest 'Deployment' in History: A Global Effort to Combat Fossil Fuels**
The US has announced its largest 'deployment' in history, but it's not a military operation. Instead, it's a global effort to combat fossil fuels, led by tech giants Meta, Amazon, and Google. The companies have joined forces to promote a clean energy future, as reported by The Pulse (translated by Charter97.org). At the CERAWeek conference in Houston, the World Nuclear Association (WNA) signed an agreement to triple the world's nuclear energy production by 2050. This goal has been supported not only by IT companies but also by representatives from the aviation, maritime, oil and gas, and financial sectors. This agreement complements the promise made at the 2023 UN Climate Conference, where over 30 countries and leading financial institutions, including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, agreed to also triple nuclear energy production. The document, titled 'Commitment of Large Energy Consumers,' is the first case where representatives from other industries, aside from nuclear, have officially supported a massive expansion of the nuclear sector. Nuclear energy is a clean and reliable source of power, and it's becoming a key element in the global energy transition. According to WNA data, there are currently 439 reactors in operation worldwide, with a total capacity of 371 gigawatts. However, nuclear energy accounts for only 9% of global electricity production. Expanding these capacities is necessary not only for the environment but also for energy security, especially for countries dependent on imported fossil fuels. 'As the global economy expands, reliable, clean, and sustainable energy supply becomes essential. Nuclear energy can provide a stable energy flow. We're happy to join the joint initiative to develop nuclear energy and confirm our commitment to this direction,' said Urvvi Parekh, Meta's global energy head. Amazon and Google have already announced investments in small modular nuclear reactors (SMR) in October 2024, a technology that could reduce the cost and construction time of new reactors. In December, Meta joined the project and began considering proposals from developers to build up to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity in the US. Tech giants see nuclear energy as a necessary foundation for sustainable development and a key tool for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

**Nuclear energy: How much more does the EU need to invest by 2050?**
The European Union (EU) needs to invest at least €350 billion in new nuclear reactors by 2050 to meet its energy needs, according to the World Nuclear Association (WNA). Currently, nuclear energy accounts for 22.8% of all electricity generated in the EU, with France being the largest provider, generating 55% of the EU's output. However, investment in nuclear energy is not picking up, and the WNA warns that there won't be enough reactors in the future to generate the same electricity as those that will shut down. The EU has only two new reactors under construction and 12 more planned, which is less than Russia's 14 new reactors in the pipeline. Poland seems the most willing to ramp up nuclear production, with 26 new reactors proposed to be built across the country.

**Amazon and Google Commit to Tripling Nuclear Capacity by 2050**
Amazon and Google have committed to tripling the world's nuclear capacity by 2050. This move comes as data centers struggle to keep up with energy demand, and companies are turning to alternative solutions. The nuclear option is now seen as key to ensuring a stable energy supply. According to Hugues Ferreboeuf, digital project manager at the Shift Project, data center energy consumption could triple by 2030, and Google's energy consumption is increasing by 20% annually. Google has partnered with Kairos Power to develop small modular reactors (SMRs) capable of producing 500 megawatts by 2035, while Amazon is supporting start-up X-Energy to create a fleet aiming for 5 gigawatts by 2039. Microsoft has signed a contract with Helion Energy to revive a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, with a goal of producing 837 megawatts by 2028. Meta has announced a call for American actors to exploit between 1 and 4 gigawatts using nuclear power by 2030. The US has over 2,000 data centers, and the demand is increasing, with a growing concern over energy supply. Tripling the nuclear capacity by 2050 will require massive investments and coordination between states and companies. The SMRs have the advantage of being able to be installed near data centers, but their deployment will not happen before several years. In the meantime, some companies may continue to use gas-fired power plants to meet their immediate needs. The uranium supply is also a key point, with some reactors requiring highly enriched uranium, mainly produced by Russia. According to Valérie Faudon, the European nuclear industry must invest to avoid dependence on foreign actors. The deployment of these reactors could follow a model similar to the aerospace industry, where companies with the ability to produce in series will dominate the market.
