**'How to Train Your Dragon' Live-Action Film: A New Level of Storytelling and Coexistence**
Director Dean DeBlois, who directed the film 'How to Train Your Dragon', said, 'The story and characters have evolved to the next level, and the message of coexistence is conveyed.' The film is a live-action adaptation of the successful animated series, which has grossed over $16 billion worldwide. DeBlois aimed to maintain the core content and emotions of the original animation while bringing the wonder of the original to life in live-action. He said, 'I tried to implement a realistic environment, and I traveled to Iceland, Scotland, and the Faroe Islands to find the perfect location for the dragon's habitat.' The film's highlight is the dynamic flying scene between Hiccup and Toothless, which gives the audience a sense of speed and immerses them in the island and ocean scenery. DeBlois explained, 'To create the flying scene, I used aerial photography to capture the location, added visual effects to create the background, and installed a 3m high structure that allowed the actors to move freely and interact with the robot dragon.' He also worked hard to bring the animated character of Toothless to life in a realistic way, saying, 'I tried to adjust the cartoonish parts to make it more realistic, and I based the movement of Toothless on that of a tiger or leopard.' The film conveys the message of coexistence and acceptance, as Hiccup, a outcast, dares to challenge the norms and befriends a dragon, ultimately saving his tribe's fate.

Disney's live-action Lilo & Stitch has surpassed Sinners to become the second highest-grossing movie of 2025, with a domestic total of $280.1 million and global earnings of $610.8 million.

Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning kept its grip on the No. 2 spot this weekend with $27.3 million from 3,861 locations, but still has a long way to go to recoup its massive $400 million production cost.

**Record-Breaking Memorial Day Weekend at the Box Office**
The Memorial Day weekend is shaping up to be a historic one at the box office, with Disney's live-action remake of 'Lilo & Stitch' raking in $183 million and surpassing 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One'. According to studio estimates cited by various media outlets on Sunday, the US box office is expected to reach a record $322 million over the weekend, surpassing the previous record set in 2013 when films like 'Fast & Furious 6' and 'Hangover III' generated $314 million. 'Lilo & Stitch' is projected to take the top spot at the box office with an estimated $183 million by Monday, marking the highest opening weekend for a Memorial Day film of all time, surpassing 'Top Gun: Maverick' and its $126 million opening in 2022. 'Mission: Impossible-Dead Reckoning Part One' is in second place with an estimated $77 million in box office revenue by Monday, making it the highest-grossing opening for any 'Mission: Impossible' film. 'Final Destination: Bloodlines' takes third place in the box office, earning $24 million over the four-day weekend, followed by 'Thunderbolts', 'Sinners', and 'The Last Rodeo'. Experts cited by Los Angeles Times believe that the strong Memorial Day box office and the highest spring movie attendance on record suggest that box office revenue will likely be high this summer, which is typically the busiest time for movie theaters. Upcoming summer releases that could generate big box office numbers include 'Karate Kid: Legends', the live-action remake of 'How to Train Your Dragon', 'Elio' from Disney/Pixar, 'Ballerina', the 'John Wick' spin-off, 'Jurassic World Rebirth', a new 'Superman' film, and 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' from Marvel Studios. 'Lilo & Stitch' is on track to outperform the original animated film's box office total during its entire theatrical run, not accounting for inflation. The original animated film grossed $145.8 million in domestic box office revenue during its initial release in 2003. 'Lilo & Stitch' is poised to be one of the biggest openings for Disney for one of its live-action remakes, behind 'The Lion King' in 2019, which grossed $191.7 million over three days.

DreamWorks' live-action adaptation of How to Train Your Dragon has the potential to start a new trend for the studio, similar to Disney's live-action remakes. The film's positive early reviews and impressive visuals suggest it will be a hit. With a combined budget of $439 million, the original animated trilogy has grossed over $1.6 billion worldwide. While most DreamWorks movies may not work in live-action, a few others like Road to El Dorado, Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas, Megamind, The Croods, and Ruby Gillman Teenage Kraken could be considered for live-action remakes if How to Train Your Dragon succeeds. The studio should learn from Disney's approach, enhancing the original narratives rather than merely recreating them.

**Disney and DreamWorks Clash in Live-Action Market with 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' and 'How to Train Your Dragon'**
Disney and DreamWorks, known for their animated films, are now competing in the live-action market with their latest releases, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' and 'How to Train Your Dragon'. The two films have received positive reviews and are expected to perform well at the box office. Disney's live-action remake of '101 Dalmatians' was a success, but their recent live-action adaptation of 'Snow White' has been a disappointment, with a total box office gross of less than $100 million in North America. However, Disney's live-action remake of 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' is expected to perform well, with a predicted opening weekend of over $100 million in the US. DreamWorks' live-action remake of 'How to Train Your Dragon' is also expected to be a hit, with a predicted opening weekend of over $100 million in the US. The two films are expected to be major players in the box office this year.

**Disney pauses live-action 'Tangled' remake in wake of 'Snow White' underperforming**
Disney has paused its live-action remake of Tangled, following the underwhelming performance of its recent live-action update to Snow White. The film, which had a reported $270 million budget, has earned around $145 million at the global box office in its first two weeks of release. This news comes after Disney's live-action remake of The Lion King opened to just $35 million domestically in December, but still managed to cross the $700 million mark worldwide. Disney's live-action remakes of Lilo & Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon are set to be released in the coming months, and a live-action Moana is scheduled for next year. As one industry expert notes, 'The box office performance of Snow White is a clear indication that the audience's appetite for live-action remakes of beloved animated films is waning.'
