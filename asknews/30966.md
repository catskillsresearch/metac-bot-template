**Donald Trump Jr. Considers 2028 Presidential Run, But Faces Competition from Other Republicans**
Donald Trump Jr. has not ruled out the possibility of running for president in 2028, saying 'it's an honor to be considered' and 'some people don't have a problem with the idea.' He is considered the natural heir to the MAGA movement, following his sister Ivanka's departure from politics. However, he is not the only one in the running, as Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are also potential candidates. Vance has denied any rivalry with Rubio, saying 'there's no competition with Marco.' The Democratic Party is also searching for new faces, with potential candidates including Governor Gavin Newsom of California, Governors Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, and Representatives Pete Buttigieg and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 'The 2028 election is still far away, and there's a lot of work to be done,' said Buttigieg in response to speculation about his candidacy. Ocasio-Cortez, on the other hand, has not ruled out a potential run for the presidency, saying 'I'm not closing any doors.'

**An Update on the 2026 Senate Races**
The 2026 Senate races are shaping up to be competitive, with several seats potentially flipping from Republican to Democrat. However, the national environment does not currently favor the Democrats, with President Donald Trump's approval rating at 47.1% and a Republican edge in the RCP average. The article analyzes the individual Senate races, including Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. The Democrats are expected to have a strong chance in Georgia, Michigan, and Minnesota, while the Republicans are favored in Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, and South Carolina. The article concludes that the Democrats will need to pick up all five Republican seats without losing any of their own, which will require a bad national environment or a lot of luck. Currently, this does not appear to be happening.

**Democrats abandon tradition as 2028 presidential hopefuls openly declare White House ambitions**
Democrats are abandoning the tradition of denying presidential ambitions, with many openly declaring their interest in running for the White House in 2028. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said he 'would consider' a White House run, while Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz stated that he will 'do whatever it takes' to run. Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, who has been in office for about 12 minutes, said that 'babies get older,' implying that he is waiting for his third child to grow up before running. Pete Buttigieg, who ran in 2020, is also considering another bid, but is playing coy, saying 'Right now I'm not running for anything.' The article notes that many potential contenders have little name recognition, which may lead them to run without fear of losing, potentially resulting in a cable news contract. At least 19 potential contenders have been identified, but many may not make it to the debate stage or be forced out of the race due to low polls or fundraising issues.

**Carville suggests he'd support Ocasio-Cortez as Democratic nominee**
Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville expressed support for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) as the party's presidential nominee in 2028, despite previously criticizing the progressive lawmaker. Carville stated, 'If AOC wants to run for president and she gets the [nomination], then God bless you. You are the leader of the Democratic Party.' He also acknowledged that the Democratic Party is not in as 'nearly as bad shape as it's being portrayed' after suffering losses in the 2024 election. Carville's comments came after he criticized the party's lack of a message and leader, saying, 'It's not going to be picked by the press, it's not going to be picked by polling. It's going to be picked by Democratic voters, and that'll have to come in due time.'

**Democrats may require 2028 contenders to release full health information**
Democratic strategists are considering requiring 2028 presidential candidates to release extensive health information, following concerns about Joe Biden's health during his presidency. Biden recently announced an aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis, which raised questions about his fitness for office. Anthony Coley, a Democratic strategist, said that Biden's claims of winning the 2024 election if he had stayed in the race are 'not looking good' in history's first draft. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa called for Kamala Harris and Xavier Becerra to apologize for covering up Biden's health status, citing a recent book that alleges a systematic cover-up. The revelations may lead to significant changes in how the Democratic Party conducts its elections and how candidates run their campaigns.

**Lee Jae-myung's Incheon Visit: A Crucial Battleground in the Presidential Election**
Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung visited Incheon on May 21, 2025, as part of his three-day campaign to win over the votes of the capital region. Incheon is a crucial battleground for Lee Jae-myung, who won the parliamentary by-election in Incheon's Gyeyang-gu in 2023 after losing the 2022 presidential election to Yoon Suk-yeol. Lee Jae-myung emphasized the importance of Incheon in his speech, saying, 'Incheon citizens are the ones who will decide the fate of this country. Will we continue to decline and fall, or will we rise again and become a nation of hope?' He also stated, 'I will do my best to win in Incheon, but I need your help.' Yoon Young-jun, the DPK's senior general election strategy committee chairman, said, 'Incheon has always been a barometer of public opinion, and every presidential candidate who has won in Incheon has become president.' He added, 'Incheon's choice was not wrong, and they supported Lee Jae-myung even when he was at his weakest.' The DPK has been focusing on winning over the votes of the capital region, with Lee Jae-myung visiting Seoul on May 19 and Gyeonggi Province on May 20. The party is concerned about the 'optimistic' mood among its supporters, which could lead to complacency and a decrease in voter turnout. Kim Kyung-soo, the DPK's general election strategy committee chairman, warned, 'If we become too confident and complacent, we will lose the election.' He also emphasized the importance of avoiding 'sweeping victories' and 'landslide wins,' which could lead to a decrease in voter turnout. The DPK has been urging its supporters to be cautious and avoid making premature predictions about the outcome of the election.

**$2 million betting market shows odds stacked against Democrats in 2026 midterm elections**
According to the Kalshi betting market app, nearly $700,000 in bets have been placed on Republicans maintaining control of the Senate after the 2026 midterms, with 68% of total wagers ($1.9 million) favoring the GOP. In contrast, 32% of wagers ($632,000) are on Democrats taking control of the Senate. The odds are currently in favor of Republicans, with a $100 wager potentially turning into $141 if they maintain control. However, the GOP's odds have dipped by 15 percentage points since February 21, while Democrats' odds have increased by 15 percentage points. In the market for House control, 81% of wagers ($3.3 million) are on Democrats winning, compared to 19% on the GOP. 'If Democrats want to engage in proper oversight of President Donald Trump through investigations or impeachment proceedings, they will need the Senate,' highlighting the significance of Senate control for Democrats.

**A Look At Stephen A.'s Chances In Hypothetical 2028 Election Against JD Vance**
Stephen A. Smith has a 5% chance of earning the Democrat nomination in the 2028 election, according to betting site Kalshi. However, polling data suggests he is less viable in a general election, trailing Vice President JD Vance by nine points in a hypothetical 2028 race. Vance and Kamala Harris are polling at 39% each, while Smith is expected to struggle debating policy with Vance. The market gives Vance a 44% chance of winning the nomination, with Tulsi Gabbard and Donald Trump Sr. tied for second at 10%. The prediction is that if Smith enters the race, he will lose badly, with Vance and Gavin Newsom being the most likely primary winners.

**Democrats May Be Down, but Their Appetite for Voting Hasn’t Dimmed**
Despite the Democratic Party's current struggles, their appetite for voting has not diminished. In special elections, Democrats have shown strength, particularly in Florida's First and Sixth Districts and Wisconsin's Supreme Court election. While these results may not be indicative of a high-turnout presidential election, they suggest that Democrats will likely win many elections between now and November 2028. The continued Democratic strength in special elections may also erode President Trump's support among congressional Republicans, particularly in lower-turnout midterms. As Republican members contemplate a challenging cycle, they may decide it's in their interest to distinguish themselves from the president. As noted by The Downballot, Democrats' strength in special elections is similar to their strength in 2017 and stronger than it was during the Biden years. As one observer points out, 'Democrats, despite their challenges, are probably going to win a lot of elections between now and November 2028.'

**Donald Trump's Odds for 2028 US Presidential Election Increase Following Comments on Third Term**
Donald Trump's odds for the 2028 US presidential election have increased significantly among bookmakers following his comments on a potential third term. 'I'm not joking,' Trump said on NBC, referring to methods to circumvent the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution, which limits a president to two terms. Trump confirmed that JD Vance, the current vice-president, could be his running mate and then hand over the presidency to him after winning the election. The bookmaker BetOnline.ag now lists Trump as the second favorite to win, behind Vance. Trump's odds have improved from 10:1 to 6:1, while Vance's odds have worsened. The startup Kalshi, which allows users to buy contracts predicting election outcomes, has seen an increase in contracts predicting Trump's nomination. 'We've seen an acceleration of contracts predicting Trump's nomination, especially on Sunday,' said a Kalshi spokesperson. Trump is now the favorite to win the Republican nomination, ahead of JD Vance.

**2028 US Presidential Election: Top Democratic Candidates Emerge**
Despite the 2028 presidential election being relatively far away, the competition within the Democratic Party is already heating up. Several prominent leaders are seeking to strengthen their national presence and build strong support networks in preparation for the biggest race in the United States. While no official candidate has announced their candidacy yet, the actions of some political figures clearly indicate their future ambitions. Amidst the ongoing uncertainty within the party about how to deal with President Donald Trump's policies after his 2024 win, the competition between Democrats in 2028 appears more open than ever. A report by Axios highlighted the top names vying for the potential presidential race, and their political moves that may pave the way to the White House. Pete Buttigieg has shown his national ambitions clearly by running for president in 2020 while serving as the mayor of South Bend in Indiana. He served as the Transportation Secretary in President Biden's administration, where he faced numerous crises. He was considered a strong candidate for the Michigan governor or Senate race next year, but he announced his withdrawal from both races last week. Stacey Abrams has long been considered a potential Democratic presidential candidate, as she has worked to build a national network of supporters and donors over the years and has received more media attention. After Trump's 2024 win, Abrams called for a special legislative session in California to raise funds to challenge the Republican president's policies legally. Abrams has recently tried to present himself as a moderate politician to expand his base of support, and he sparked controversy when he said in a conversation with right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk that allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' and women's sports is 'extremely unfair.' Emanuel, who served as the US Ambassador to Japan during the previous Biden administration, has raised questions about his potential candidacy. Emanuel was Obama's White House Chief of Staff and has appeared in several public events warning of the need for Democrats to reassess their political strategies before the 2026 midterm elections. Emanuel joined CNN as a commentator last month and writes an article in The Washington Post. Walz announced last month that he would not run for the new Senate seat in Minnesota in 2026, leaving the door open for a potential presidential candidacy. Walz, who served as the Governor of Minnesota for two terms and was the Democratic nominee for Vice President in the 2024 presidential election, began a national tour of town halls in Republican-leaning districts. Pritzker is a wealthy businessman who has established himself as one of the symbols of 'Democratic resistance' in Illinois. He has worked to strengthen his national image in recent years and was included in unofficial lists as a potential alternative to President Biden after his poor performance in the first presidential debate last year. Whitmer is considered one of the rising stars in the Democratic Party and has presented herself as a pragmatic and moderate leader since Trump's win. She met with Trump this week to discuss issues related to jobs, tariffs, and defense investments. In recent weeks, she has praised the deployment of National Guard troops to the border to combat illegal immigration and expressed openness to imposing new tariffs to protect industry. However, she refused to join a multi-state lawsuit against Trump's attempt to ban birthright citizenship. Polis, who served as Governor of Colorado for two terms, was one of the names floated as a potential alternative to Biden in the 2024 election. Like Yoder, he has taken a centrist approach since Trump took office, saying in his address to the state that he hopes to work with Trump and Congress 'to secure the border, stop human trafficking, and prevent the flow of illegal weapons and drugs.' He supported Trump's controversial nomination of Robert Kennedy Jr. for Secretary of Health and Human Services. The list of potential candidates also includes Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, and Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy. Axios believes that Democratic leaders are divided on how to face Trump, given the party's identity crisis after the 2024 elections. This time, there is no consensus on the strategy, as Democratic leaders are taking different paths.

**Donald Trump won’t like what betting market is saying about 2028 Republican odds after first week**
According to the betting market on Kalshi, the odds of Republicans winning the 2028 presidential election have shifted in favor of Democrats, with a 51-49 advantage after President Donald Trump's first week in office. This is a change from the initial 50.3-49.7 margin in favor of Republicans. The site updates its percentages daily, and this shift could be a concern for Republicans, especially considering the odds from Covers.com, which had Republicans as 60% favorites and Democrats as 45.4% favorites just a few weeks ago. As one observer noted, 'this could very well depend on how the flurry of executive orders that Trump issued during his first week, pan out.'
