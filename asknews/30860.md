**Psychedelic Drugs Show Promise in Treating Mental Health Conditions**
There is a growing interest in the use of psychedelic drugs as a tool to help treat various mental health conditions. According to Michael Pollan, many in the psychiatric establishment considered LSD and psilocibina as 'wonder drugs' to treat depression, anxiety, trauma, and addiction in the 1950s and early 1960s. However, as these drugs became associated with the counterculture of the 1960s and stories of bad trips and psychotic breaks emerged, a moral panic ensued. Currently, the interest in their utility as a tool to help treat various psychiatric conditions is growing rapidly. Dr. Jerrold Rosenbaum, director of the Center for Psychedelic Neuroscience at Massachusetts General Hospital, explains that psychedelics cause temporary changes in the brain, which seems to facilitate a reset and allow modifications in ways of feeling and thinking that were stuck. This process can occur in several ways: new connections are established in neural networks while the brain's resting state, known as the default mode network, loses connectivity and then is restored. 'It's like restarting your computer,' he notes. Research on unapproved medications and drugs has revealed promising results. A 2021 study published in JAMA Psychiatry demonstrated that psilocibina-assisted therapy produces significant and lasting antidepressant effects in patients with major depressive disorder. Another study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that those who received two doses of psilocibina showed results comparable, and even superior, to those of patients treated with escitalopram after six weeks. Additionally, a study in Nature, which followed a rigorous randomized and double-blind design, concluded that MDMA-assisted therapy is highly effective and safe for individuals with severe PTSD.

**Dreams of improving the human race are no longer science fiction**
Christian Angermayer, a German tech billionaire, has a personal mission to help humanity improve itself through the use of psychedelic drugs and other treatments. His investment fund is championing the use of such drugs as a treatment for mental-health problems and is also 'pushing the boundaries for human enhancement overall'. Angermayer is not alone in his beliefs, as human enhancement is already a $125bn industry, growing by more than 10% a year. Tech luminaries such as Peter Thiel and Sam Altman are pouring money into the idea that the human body can be improved. The industry is focused on three broad categories of treatments: supplements, gene therapies, and neural implants. While some may consider this quixotic, the world of enhancement is excited about a study called TAME, which is the first clinical trial that targets ageing specifically to be approved by America's Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The study will test whether metformin, a drug to treat diabetes, can also prolong human lifespans. Another type of treatment championed by enhancers is gene therapy, whereby new genetic material is introduced to the body to alter the way it functions. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are also being developed to collect and analyze signals from the brain or send signals to it. Investors seem enthusiastic about this vision, with Neuralink, a firm founded by Elon Musk, securing several rounds of funding. The jurisdiction where BCIs are being developed most eagerly is China, where multiple trials are under way involving monkeys and humans. Chinese scientists recently claimed to have developed the world's first non-invasive two-way BCI, allowing a drone and human pilot to communicate with one another. The government has also issued various regulations to hasten the adoption of BCIs. BCIs raise all manner of ethical and legal concerns, but some entrepreneurs hope that the American authorities will soon be taking a more permissive approach to enhancement in general.

**OPINION: Fear-based Rhetoric in the Debate Over Therapeutic Psychedelics – Pagosa Daily Post News Events & Video for Pagosa Springs Colorado**
Luke Niforatos recently argued against the legal use of psilocybin, citing concerns about facilitator qualifications, federal drug scheduling, and child safety. However, a psychiatrist and licensed psilocybin facilitator, Brandon Sklar, disputes these claims, pointing to a 'vast body of research' supporting the use of psilocybin for various psychiatric conditions. Sklar notes that institutions like Johns Hopkins and New York University have demonstrated its potential to treat depression, PTSD, and addiction. He also argues that the FDA's approval of psychiatric medications with serious risks, such as increased suicidality, does not necessarily mean that psilocybin is safe. Sklar emphasizes that many facilitators are licensed mental health professionals working in regulated environments, and that healing centers are subject to strict safety standards and state oversight. He concludes that Colorado's regulatory framework for natural medicine is comprehensive and provides strong safeguards, and that psilocybin can offer real relief when used in a structured setting with trained professionals.

**California Coalition Against Drug Abuse Scores Major Victories in State Legislature**
The California Coalition Against Drug Abuse (CCAD) announced two significant developments on May 23, 2025. The highly contested bill SB 751, which aimed to legalize psychedelic mushrooms, was rejected by the California Senate Budget Committee. In contrast, SB 28, which proposes funding for substance abuse treatment, passed with a unanimous 6-0 vote and is expected to be sent to the full Senate for further consideration. CCAD's action director, Frank Lee, stated that the victory was hard-won and demonstrates the power of collective action. He emphasized that the success of SB 751's defeat and SB 28's passage is a testament to the effectiveness of grassroots mobilization and the importance of holding elected officials accountable. Lee also highlighted the impact of CCAD's 'phone blitz' campaign, which generated a significant number of calls to lawmakers' offices, putting pressure on them to reconsider their stance on SB 751. He expressed gratitude to the public for their support and urged continued vigilance, particularly in regards to Senator Brian Jones' efforts to push for drug legalization. 'We cannot accept a situation where the government is open to legalizing drugs but is not willing to provide funding for treatment services,' Lee said. 'SB 28's passage is a crucial step in correcting this imbalance.'

**Changes in the REPROCANN: What you need to know to register or renew your registration in 2025**
The Argentine Ministry of Health announced on May 23, 2025, a key update to the REPROCANN, the official registry that regulates the use of medicinal cannabis in Argentina. The new regulation, published in Resolution 1780/2025 of the Official Gazette, introduces significant changes affecting both those who wish to initiate the process and those who are already registered and waiting for approval. According to the government, the adjustments aim to improve control, prevent abuses in the figure of the solidary cultivator, and ensure that the use of cannabis remains within a medical, therapeutic, and legal framework. The REPROCANN (Cannabis Program Registry) is the official system of the Ministry of Health of the Nation that regulates the medicinal use of cannabis in Argentina. Since its creation in 2021, it has allowed patients with a medical indication, solidary cultivators, NGOs, and researchers to access cannabis legally for medicinal purposes. One of the most important structural changes is the creation of three clear categories of people authorized to register in the program: individuals with a formal medical indication for the use of medicinal cannabis, authorized individuals or entities for cannabis cultivation, and institutions, NGOs, or academic entities developing research projects related to medicinal cannabis. The new regulation ratifies and expands the legal framework for medicinal cannabis cultivation. As a registered user, you can: transport up to 40 grams of dried flowers or 30 ml of oil in any means of transportation within the country, as long as you have an active permit in the Mi Argentina app. The resolution introduces stricter restrictions to prevent unauthorized commercial use of cultivation permits: only accredited professionals can now prescribe medicinal cannabis. This stricter control aims to consolidate a therapeutic approach based on evidence and prevent prescriptions without academic backing. Approximately 100,000 people waiting for approval will need to start the process again, respecting the new regulation. Not complying with the updated requirements can have severe consequences: it is essential to update and regularize the situation as soon as possible.

**Covid-19 Case: FDA may change Covid-19 booster rules from 2025: What it means for you**
The US FDA is considering a change in Covid-19 booster rules, which could mean that annual booster shots for healthy individuals under 65 would only be approved if supported by robust clinical trial data. New Covid-19 vaccines have shown a 33% reduction in hospitalisation risk among immunocompromised individuals, but their effectiveness in otherwise healthy people remains uncertain. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and vaccine adviser Vinay Prasad expressed skepticism about the need for yearly boosters for all Americans, proposing that future booster approvals be streamlined only for high-risk groups such as people over 65 or individuals with medical conditions. Pfizer, a leading producer of Covid-19 vaccines, stands by the science behind their vaccine and continues to believe that broad vaccination programmes are essential for preventing Covid-19-associated hospitalisations and severe disease. Meanwhile, India is seeing a rise in Covid-19 cases, with Kerala reporting 182 cases in May and the state health department urging people to wear masks and remain vigilant.

**Trump Limits COVID-19 Vaccine Approval: Who Will Receive It in 2025?**
The Trump administration announced that it will 'limit the approval' of COVID-19 vaccines, which provide protection against severe illness, considering that the virus spreads among people in direct contact. The FDA established new guidelines for COVID-19 vaccines, stating that although a person can still get sick after vaccination, it is more likely that they will have mild or no symptoms. The New England Journal of Medicine began to pressure pharmaceutical companies to conduct 'broad and prolonged studies' before new modified COVID-19 vaccines can be approved for healthy people. The journal stated, 'The Trump administration's announcement is a radical break from previous federal policy, which recommended an annual COVID-19 vaccine for all US citizens over six months old.' The FDA noted that COVID-19 vaccines will still be available for adults 65 and older, as well as for children and adults with at least one high-risk health condition. Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's vaccine chief, stated that at least 100 million US citizens should receive a booster, as that is the approximate number of people in the high-risk group. Prasad warned, 'Simply, we don't know the answer to whether many US citizens should or should not receive the seventh COVID-19 booster.' He added, 'Will pharmacists determine if someone is in a high-risk group? The only thing that can come out of this is that vaccines will be less covered by insurance and less available.' According to Univisión, over 48,000 US citizens died from COVID-19-related causes in 2024, with the virus being the underlying cause in two-thirds of those deaths and a contributing factor in the rest.

**Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions (VETS) Leads Legislative Day of Action in Support of AB 1103 at California State Capitol**
Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions (VETS) is hosting a Legislative Day of Action on May 14, 2025, at the California State Capitol in support of Assembly Bill 1103 (AB 1103). This legislation aims to eliminate unnecessary administrative delays to commencing FDA-approved clinical research on psychedelic therapies to treat Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), treatment-resistant depression, substance use disorders, and other conditions fueling the disproportionate incidence of suicide in the veteran community. According to Marcus Capone, former U.S. Navy SEAL and VETS Co-Founder, 'AB 1103 is a common-sense, bipartisan solution that preserves the state's role in protecting human and animal research subjects, while also accelerating critical research into mental health treatments that will save thousands of lives.' VETS has organized a Legislative Day of Action to meet with lawmakers and share the transformative journeys of special operations veterans who have experienced life-changing results from psychedelic-assisted therapy. 'At VETS, we've witnessed the profound healing potential of psychedelic-assisted therapies for veterans who've tried everything else,' said Amber Capone, CEO and Co-Founder of VETS. 'AB 1103 represents an important opportunity to streamline California's research approval process and expedite federally-sanctioned clinical research.'

**Bipartisan Bill to Require VA to Establish Centers of Excellence to Study Psychedelic Therapies Gains Eighth Sponsor**
A bipartisan bill, the Innovative Therapies Centers of Excellence Act of 2025, has gained its eighth congressional sponsor, Representative Sarah Elfreth (D-MD). The bill, led by Representatives Jack Bergman (R-MI) and Lou Correa (D-CA), aims to establish at least five research centers at the Department of Veterans Affairs to study psychedelic-assisted therapies for conditions like PTSD, depression, and chronic pain. These therapies, which include MDMA, psilocybin, ketamine, and ibogaine, would be evaluated for their effectiveness in treating mental and physical health conditions common among veterans. The bill is supported by several major veterans groups, who say it is a critical step towards providing veterans with alternative therapies that may be more effective than current treatments, as stated by supporters. 'It is a critical next step to ensure veterans have access to alternative therapies that may be more effective than current treatments,' said supporters. The bill was originally filed in early April and has gained significant support since then.

**Texas Lawmakers Take Up Bills To Expedite Access To Psychedelic Therapy**
A Texas House committee heard testimony on two bills aimed at expediting access to psychedelic therapy in the state. HB 4014 would establish a state-backed study on the use of psychedelics to treat mental health disorders, while HB 4813 would dictate that substances reclassified under federal law be similarly controlled under state law. Supporters of the bills said they would work together to minimize delays to military veterans and others who stand to benefit from the potentially life-saving therapy. HB 4813 sponsor, Rep. Oliverson, said, 'All we’re seeking to do is to amend statute to accelerate that process for these very promising compounds that have been shown to be very effective in these conditions.' He noted that psilocybin and MDMA are both in Phase 3 clinical trials and are likely to be approved by the FDA soon. Oliverson said the goal is to 'avoid an unnecessary, lengthy delay' to access to psychedelic therapies in Texas. Lynnette Averill, a Baylor College of Medicine professor, testified in support of the measure, saying, 'What a bill like this would do is really continue build on the landmark move that Texas made in the 2021 legislative session.' She emphasized the need for prompt state-level review following federal rescheduling action, suggesting a 30-day review period. Rep. Mike Olcott (R) expressed concerns about ceding state sovereignty, but ultimately sided with the state in its lawsuit challenging the city of San Marcos’s implementation of a local marijuana decriminalization law.

**Is it cool for non-cannabis companies to do 4/20 promotions? (Newsletter: April 16, 2025)**
A new poll from NuggMD shows that three out of four marijuana consumers support non-cannabis brands promoting themselves on 4/20. Meanwhile, Montana lawmakers sent a bill to reduce marijuana-impaired driving by people under 21 to Governor Greg Gianforte, which advocates say would put young medical cannabis patients at risk. The Indiana Senate rejected an amendment to legalize marijuana, while the Florida House Health and Human Services Committee approved a bill to waive medical cannabis patient registration fees for military veterans. In Nevada, the Assembly Health and Human Services Committee approved a bill to create an Alternative Therapy Pilot Program for patients with certain mental health conditions to use psychedelics. A Pennsylvania senator is asking colleagues to support a bill to clarify that a person's status as a medical cannabis patient cannot be used against them in parental custody rulings. The Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation revoked 25 marijuana microbusiness licenses for failing to meet ownership requirements. At the federal level, the Congressional Research Service included a passage about marijuana vapes in a report on electronic nicotine delivery systems. Former Department of Veterans Affairs Under Secretary for Health Shereef Elnahal discussed his work on psychedelics. In other news, a review highlighted the 'promising role of cannabis in cancer pain management,' and a study found that music undergoes a profound change during psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.

**Psychedelics Space Regroups as RFK Jr. Signals Support**
The psychedelics space is experiencing a resurgence in 2025, following a demoralizing blow from the FDA's rejection of Lykos Therapeutics' MDMA-based PTSD treatment last year. Recent approvals and positive data are generating new momentum, with experts expecting continued growth throughout 2025 and 2026. Johnson & Johnson's esketamine nasal spray Spravato secured the first FDA approval as a monotherapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), while GH Research and atai Life Sciences reported positive mid-stage results for their 5-MeO-DMT candidates in TRD and alcohol use disorder (AUD), respectively. 'I think there's a lot of pent-up excitement,' said Doug Drysdale, CEO of Cybin. 'Folks that are close to the space and the work are excited about the results we're seeing, and I don't think that it's broadly appreciated yet just how life-changing these things can be.' The sector could be undergoing a bit of a reset, with the number of companies in Phase III having tripled to six since last June. 'I think we are at sort of a waiting post right now,' said Hans Eriksson, chief medical officer at HMNC Brain Health. 'But data readouts are starting to roll out and 2025 is off to a good start already.' The psychedelics pipeline consists of drugs targeting neuropsychiatric indications, including depression, anxiety and PTSD, which has been a lag for the space. 'The Western world does not have a great track record of bringing new psychiatric drugs on the market,' said Nick Kadysh, CEO of PharmAla Biotech. 'The last major sort of revolution in psychiatric pharmacology was Prozac. That's a very, very long time ago.'

**RFK Jr. Vote Looms. How He Could 'Go Wild' On Health Care.**
The US Senate will vote on Thursday to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, has expressed enthusiasm for psychedelic treatments in mental health conditions. If confirmed, he will oversee the FDA, CDC, and NIH. Analysts expect Kennedy to focus on chronic diseases, with potential changes in vaccine use, drug pricing, and patent life. However, much is still unclear, and some experts question whether Kennedy's views will lead to significant changes in the US healthcare system. Kennedy has promised to maintain the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and adhere to existing review processes. He has also agreed to seek congressional input on any vaccine policy changes. The psychedelics space could receive a boost under Kennedy, with stocks such as Cybin and Mind Medicine potentially benefiting. However, other analysts believe Kennedy's impact may be muted due to his lack of medical experience compared to other nominated health officials.

**Psychedelics in clinical settings**
State legislatures across the country are experimenting with the decriminalization of psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin, in response to issues surrounding addiction and mental health. Colorado's House Bill 25-1063 has advanced with bipartisan approval, permitting the prescription and use of FDA-approved synthetic psilocybin. Oregon has already been ahead of the curve with Measure 109, promoting similar initiatives since 2020. Research indicates that psychedelics have restorative abilities to repair damaged neural pathways associated with mental disorders, and have been studied in managing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), mood disorders, substance use disorders, and psychological distress. However, there is still ambiguity surrounding the precise mechanisms of psychedelics and how exactly they combat mental disorders. Experts agree that restricting their legality to medical settings is the most viable option to ensure safety and well-being. Therapeutic psychedelics have garnered notable political support, with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs announcing a study on MDMA-assisted therapy for veterans with PTSD. As long as they are limited to curative avenues, psychedelics can advance medical research, promote safer access to substances, and encourage individuals struggling with addiction to seek treatment.

**Lawmakers propose legalizing medicinal ‘magic mushroom’ use in New Mexico**
A group of lawmakers in New Mexico has introduced a proposal to establish a program for medicinal use of psilocybin mushrooms. Senate Bill 219, the Medical Psilocybin Act, would create a program for New Mexicans to receive medicinal treatment for pre-qualified behavioral health conditions such as major treatment-resistant depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, end-of-life care and others approved by the Department of Health. According to Dr. Deborah Thorne, an integrative psychiatry provider, 'As an integrative psychiatry provider in the state of New Mexico I strongly support the need of new tools such as medical psilocybin, to assist the rising number of New Mexicans with mental health needs.' The bill would establish an advisory board, treatment equity fund and research fund, as well as remove psilocybin from the Controlled Substances Act to protect 'qualified and registered patients, clinicians and producers.' If passed, the program would be available by Dec. 31, 2027.
