**Gemini Season 2025: A Turning Point for All Zodiac Signs**
The Gemini season 2025, which runs from May 20 to June 19, promises to be a turning point for all zodiac signs. Under the rule of Mercury, this period is characterized by its lightness, sociability, and mental openness. However, in 2025, this period is also loaded with powerful planetary transits that will impact various aspects of life. The influence of Gemini will intensify 5 days after the start of the season, when Mercury, its ruling planet, also enters this sign. This synchronization will increase mental clarity, curiosity, and the ability to communicate ideas more effectively, according to astrologer Narayana Montúfar. A favorable lunar event, a New Moon in Gemini, will occur on May 26, forming harmonious aspects with five planets. This phenomenon will open a manifestation portal ideal for setting intentions related to learning, expression, and new beginnings. Two weeks later, the Full Moon on June 11 in Sagittarius will reveal what mental patterns need to be released for intentions to flourish. Additionally, on June 9, Jupiter will enter Cancer, starting a yearly cycle of expansion, protection, and emotional abundance. Each zodiac sign will be affected differently by these transits, as described below.

**INPS Pensioner's Cedolino for June 2025: What to Expect**
The INPS (Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale) will make the pensioner's cedolino for June 2025 available online on their website after May 20th. The cedolino will show the details of the pensioner's income, including any trappings for fiscal, contributory, and assistance purposes. Additionally, the INPS will apply a monthly deduction of 50 euros to those pensioners who received the 2022 bonus for error, which was automatically assigned based on provisional fiscal data from 2021. The bonus was intended to help with the increase in living costs, but some recipients had higher incomes than the threshold and were not entitled to the sum. The INPS will recover these amounts by deducting 50 euros per month from the pensioner's net income, starting from June 2025, until the total amount is repaid, which can range from 200 to 350 euros. This recovery is not considered a 'cut' but rather a reimbursement of excess amounts paid in 2022. Pensioners can access their cedolino online through the INPS portal, using their SPID, CIE, or CNS credentials, or by requesting assistance from a CAF or patronato.

**Who will be exempt from mobilization in June 2025**
In June 2025, mobilization in Ukraine will continue, but not for everyone. Some citizens have a legal right to deferment or complete exemption from service. According to 24 Kanal, there are several categories of citizens who cannot be mobilized - both due to health status and social circumstances. In June, men aged 25-60 may be called to the Defense Forces, excluding those with official deferment or reservation. Candidates with combat experience and specialists in shortage military specialties - shock troops, sappers, UAV operators, artillerymen - are given special attention. Despite age, men over 50 can also be mobilized - many such military personnel already serve in the ZSU, including in hotspots. Lawyer Dmitry Françuk reminded that according to the law, in June 2025, the following will not be subject to mobilization: men 25-60 years old who have a status of limited suitability must undergo a repeat VCL by June 5. In case of evasion, a compulsory summons to the TCC and a fine are possible. We recall that the state of war in Ukraine has been extended to August 15, 2025, and mobilization will continue at least until that date.
