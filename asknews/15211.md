**Lithuanian President Calls on NATO to Speed Up Defense Funding Commitments**
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda called on NATO to accelerate the implementation of future defense funding commitments, warning that Russia is moving quickly to reorganize its military forces. Nauseda said, 'Russia is not waiting, it is currently reforming its military forces. We have very limited time to do the same. We should be talking about a period of three to five years.' He noted that his country has already reached the goal of allocating 5% of its GDP for military spending, calling for a collective agreement on this ambitious goal at the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague in June. Nauseda emphasized the need to reduce the timeline, saying, 'There is no need to talk about transitional periods extending until 2035 or 2040. We have, at most, five years to take decisive and committed actions.' The Vilnius summit aims to unify regional positions in preparation for the NATO summit in The Hague on June 24, which is expected to make critical decisions on defense spending and keeping pace with increasing security threats, particularly from Russia. Currently, NATO member states are committed to spending 2% of their GDP on defense, but several countries have not yet achieved this goal. In contrast, the Baltic states and Poland have announced plans to increase their defense spending to 5% or more of their GDP.

**Russia's Road Agency Plans to Improve Transportation Infrastructure**
The Federal Road Agency (Rosavtodor) plans to develop the country's transportation infrastructure on the principles of seamless logistics. By 2030, it is planned to bring 60% of regional and inter-municipal roads and 85% of federal roads to a state of normative condition. Experts believe that these goals can be achieved, including through the development of domestic business leaders. New solutions and materials used in the transportation industry were discussed at the 'Road Construction in Russia' forum. The development of transportation infrastructure is directly related to the increase in road safety. By 2030, Rosavtodor aims to reduce road fatalities by 50% and by 2036 by 100% compared to 2023. 'At every stage of road creation, we face safety. During design, many factors depend on the plan, profile, cross-section, compliance with technologies, operating conditions, maintenance of marking, lighting, fencing, road surface, and other aspects. All this forms a single entity that primarily affects road safety', said Oleg Ponareshin, deputy head of the Main Directorate for Road Safety of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia. According to him, road safety will largely depend on the quality of materials used and technologies of road construction. Participants of the forum noted that the industry is not standing still and is rapidly developing. The development of transportation infrastructure in Russia on the principles of seamless logistics will become one of the main areas of activity of the Federal Road Agency (Rosavtodor) in the coming years.

'We adhere to a comprehensive, systemic approach to the development of transportation infrastructure and do not promote the use of any particular product. First and foremost, we need to prove to ourselves, the industry community, and the regulator the effectiveness of the proposed solution. And if we see that it allows us to improve the properties of the structure or has a positive impact on the life cycle of the object, we offer its large-scale implementation. Close interaction with industry partners allows us to consider real market needs and jointly develop innovative products to solve key industry problems', said Ruslan Khayrullin, director of the 'Engineering and Road Infrastructure' division of SIBUR. In his turn, the president of the Russian Academy of Transport, Alexander Misharin, noted that recently, Russia has adopted the Concept of Scientific and Technological Development of the Transport Complex until 2035. 'This concept has undergone a comprehensive discussion in the Ministry of Transport, the expert and scientific community. It sets new priorities. Today, transport is not only construction investments, it is science, technology, a platform on which the future of the industry and the country as a whole should be built', said Misharin.

**UK PM: We can't ignore Russian threat**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that Britain cannot ignore the threat posed by Russia, citing the conflict in Ukraine as an example. The UK will increase military spending to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. This move is part of a broader effort to deter Russia and bolster Europe's defenses. NATO chief Mark Rutte is expected to discuss a commitment to spend at least 3.5 percent of GDP on defense at an upcoming meeting. Robert Jenrick, a Conservative Party spokesman, called for the government to be more ambitious and raise spending to 3 percent of national income by 2029, stating, 'We think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation.'

**Copper Demand to Grow by Over 40% by 2040, Report Says**
The Center for Information and Decision Support at the Council of Ministers has released a report on the future of copper, highlighting the growth in global production and consumption, as well as the increasing demand for the metal due to the growing need for renewable energy and digital technologies. The report notes that the global copper production is divided into two main categories: primary production from mines and secondary production from recycling. Primary production has increased significantly over the past few decades, with a growth rate of 142% between 1990 and 2023. Secondary production has also increased, with a growth rate of 145% between 1990 and 2023. The report highlights the importance of recycling in meeting the growing demand for copper, with the International Copper Study Group estimating that around 30% of global copper consumption in 2023 came from recycled sources. The report also notes that the top five countries with the largest copper reserves are Chile, Australia, Peru, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Russia, which together account for around 50% of the world's copper reserves. The report concludes that the growing demand for copper will require significant investments in new mining projects, with an estimated 80 new mines needed to meet the demand by 2030, at a cost of around $250 billion. Additionally, the report highlights the importance of recycling in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainability, with the recycling of copper being a key factor in the transition to a circular economy.

**Russian Dealers Association Proposes Restrictions on Online Car Sales**
Members of the 'Russian Automotive Dealers Association' (RoAD) have submitted a proposal to the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) to restrict car manufacturers from selling their vehicles online without intermediaries. The proposal is included in the plan to develop competition in Russia for 2026-2030. The measure aims to improve the position of dealers on the market. However, the current plan suggests that by the end of next year, the share of online sales from manufacturers and distributors should be at least 5% of total sales, according to the newspaper 'Vedomosti'. The RoAD association opposes this approach, arguing that increasing the share of online sales could lead to the infringement of dealers' rights and interests. They claim that manufacturers would impose unfavorable cooperation conditions, such as supplying unsold vehicles, fixing prices, territorial division of the market, and forced use of agency schemes. In response, the RoAD proposed expanding the 5% online sales requirement and including it in the competition development plan. 'We believe that the 5% threshold is too high and will lead to the infringement of dealers' rights and interests,' said a representative of the RoAD. 'We propose to reduce the threshold to 1% and to exclude the requirement for online sales altogether.'

**Germany's Top General Warns of Potential Russian Attack on NATO by 2029**
German Chief of Staff, General Carsten Breuer, believes that Russia may attack NATO within the next four years. He stated in an interview with the BBC, published on June 1, that NATO members must prepare for a possible Russian attack by 2029 or even earlier. According to Breuer, NATO is facing a 'very serious threat' from Russia, which he has never encountered in his 40-year career. He noted that Russia is rapidly increasing its military capabilities, producing around 1,500 main battle tanks per year and 4 million 152mm shells in 2024, not all of which were sent to Ukraine. Some of the military equipment is being stored in warehouses, awaiting a potential attack on the West. 'There is an intention and a buildup of reserves' for a possible future attack on Baltic states, he said. 'We must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it won't happen before 2029, I would say no, it's not. So we must be able to fight tonight,' Breuer said. He highlighted the Suwalki Corridor, a territory bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable areas. General Breuer asserts that NATO members must again increase their military forces. He added that it will take years for the European military-industrial base to ramp up to match the scale of Russia's military production.

**Russia Aims to Reduce Poverty Rate Below 5% by 2036**
Russian Vice-Premier Tatyana Golikova announced plans to reduce the country's poverty rate below 5% by 2036. Golikova stated, 'Further reduction of this indicator, and by 2030 it needs to be reduced below 7%, and by 2036 - below 5%, will require from us very targeted, precise, and comprehensive work. The lower we need to reduce this indicator, the more precise our measures should be and the more targeted they should be.' The focus of this work will be on increasing the income of large families, with the first step being the introduction of a family tax allowance for parents of two or more children from 2026. Golikova emphasized that the President's task is not only to reduce poverty, but also to reduce the gap in income inequality. She noted that the Gini coefficient (a measure of the degree of unevenness in the distribution of income among the population) should decrease, 'especially in the first and second deciles, which characterize the well-being and well-being of families with the lowest income, that is, 20% of the population with the lowest incomes.' Labor income plays a key role in reducing poverty, Golikova said. 'And here, 2024 showed quite serious indicators of growth in real income of the population. Real income of the population, preliminary data, grew by 8.4%', she said. Golikova also presented preliminary data from Rosstat on the growth of real monetary income in 2024, with the top performers being the Kalmykia, Adygea, Orlov, Smolensk, and Chelyabinsk regions. 'These are good achievements, but, of course, there is still something to strive for', Golikova said.
