**UAE Adopts First Legislative Framework in Region to Combat Climate Change**
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has adopted a new legislative framework to combat climate change, making it the first country in the region to do so, according to the Greenpeace organization. The federal law, 'Concerning the Reduction of the Impact of Climate Change,' which was adopted nine months ago and came into effect on Friday, requires companies to measure the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, and to prepare and implement climate adaptation plans in various sectors. According to Greenpeace, this law 'represents a bold and progressive step' in the UAE's journey, which hosted the Climate Conference (COP28) in 2023. The law establishes a framework for monitoring emissions and adapting to climate change, setting a model for other countries in the region, said Greenpeace's Executive Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Gwiem Nekt. The UAE aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and has committed to reducing its emissions by 47% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels, as outlined in its latest climate roadmap submitted to the United Nations as part of the Paris Agreement. The law requires public and private companies operating in the UAE to 'measure their emissions on a regular basis' and submit regular reports, and to 'take measures to reduce those emissions,' with penalties of up to 2 million dirhams (approximately $540,000). 'This law enshrines the UAE's commitment to climate action through a binding legislative framework,' said Greenpeace.

**East African Business Council Urges Member States to Negotiate as Bloc - Taarifa Rwanda**
The East African Business Council (EABC) has advised member states of the East African Community to negotiate trade agreements with third parties as a bloc, citing improved negotiation leverage. According to Adrian Raphael Njau, Acting Executive Director of EABC, a unified approach will enhance trust among partner states. However, the EABC noted that partner states have found it difficult to collectively negotiate and conclude reciprocal trade agreements as a bloc with third parties outside Africa. The EAC is currently implementing two reciprocal trade agreements with third parties, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the COMESA-EAC-SADC Tripartite Free Trade Area (TFTA), which require the uniform implementation of the EAC Common External Tariff (CET). Njau said, 'Individual country having separate tariff concession with third parties which is different from the existing EAC CET may compel other Partner States to restrict free circulation of goods to mitigate trade deflection.' Article 37(4) of the EAC Customs Union Protocol (CUP) permits partner states to negotiate and enter into trade agreements independently with third parties, provided that the terms of such agreements do not conflict with the provisions of the EAC CUP.

**African Countries Condemn M23's Parallel Administration in Eastern DRC**
A high-level meeting in Entebbe, Uganda, attended by 12 African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, has condemned the establishment of a parallel administration by the M23 rebel group in eastern DRC. The final communiqué, signed by the leaders of the participating countries, criticized the M23's advances and the installation of parallel administrations, as well as the external support received by the group. The statement did not mention Rwanda by name, but called for the rapid and complete implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2773, which specifically mentions Rwanda. The meeting also called for the dismantling of the FDLR armed group, a demand regularly made by Kigali and the international community. Burundian President Évariste Ndayishimiye, who handed over the presidency of the mechanism to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, again pointed to Rwanda as a regional risk factor. Museveni, on the other hand, denounced excessive dependence on external support and emphasized the role of regional mechanisms. He also pledged to revitalize the Addis Ababa Framework Agreement, which outlines measures to bring peace and security to eastern DRC and strengthen regional cooperation.

**Russia and UAE Agree to Eliminate Double Taxation**
The Russian government has submitted a bill to the State Duma to ratify an agreement with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to eliminate double taxation and prevent tax evasion on income and capital. The agreement, signed on February 17, 2025, in Abu Dhabi, aims to ensure that legal and physical entities from both countries do not pay taxes twice on the same type of income. According to the explanatory note, the goal of the agreement is to create conditions for mutual attraction of investments. 'In order to ensure the sustainable development of the Russian economy, the development and expansion of external trade and economic and investment ties, at present, there is an active reorientation of Russian business to the markets of Asian and Middle Eastern countries. In the expansion of economic ties of the Russian Federation in the Middle Eastern direction, a special role is played by the UAE,' the explanatory note states. The agreement applies to the tax on profits of organizations, income tax for individuals, property tax for organizations and individuals in Russia, and corporate tax and income tax in the UAE. The mechanism for eliminating double taxation is based on mutual offsetting, where taxes paid in one country are credited against tax liabilities in the other, but cannot exceed the amount of tax calculated according to the national legislation of the country of tax residence. The tax rate at the source on dividends, interest, and royalties cannot exceed 10%, and they are fully exempt from tax if paid to the state or its financial and investment institutions. An extended regime of exchange of information on taxes, including banking, is provided for. It is specifically noted that the provisions of the agreement do not restrict the right of the parties to apply their own national tax legislation in relation to income from hydrocarbons.

**European Commission Proposes Changes to Safe Third Country Concept to Facilitate Asylum Procedures**
The European Commission has proposed changes to the concept of 'safe third country' to facilitate its application in asylum procedures. Currently, authorities must prove a link between the applicant and the safe third country. The Commission suggests removing this requirement, allowing member states to apply the concept if a link exists, as defined by national law. The proposal aims to accelerate asylum procedures and reduce pressure on asylum systems while preserving legal guarantees for applicants and ensuring respect for fundamental rights. The Commission also suggests considering a transit country as a sufficient link for applying the concept of safe third country. Currently, no African country is officially recognized as a safe third country by France or the EU. The goal is to externalize asylum management by allowing another country, deemed safe, to examine the application and provide protection if necessary. However, such agreements do not exist between France and East African countries. The Commission notes that a country can be considered safe if it meets certain conditions, such as protection against refoulement, absence of real risk of serious harm, and possibility of effective protection. It is now up to the European Parliament and the Council to approve this proposal. In Mayotte, asylum seekers must first deposit their application with the association Solidarité Mayotte and then submit it to the Office français de protection des réfugiés et apatrides (OFPRA) within 7 days. The OFPRA is the competent authority for examining asylum applications and deciding on refugee status or subsidiary protection. If the application is rejected, asylum seekers can appeal to the Cour nationale du droit d'asile.

**West African bloc 'confident' Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger will return to bloc**
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is 'confident' that Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger will return to the regional bloc, according to Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar. ECOWAS President Omar Alieu Touray expressed his understanding of the need for the three countries to continue as members of the West African family, saying, 'Even without brothers who left our organization,' the bloc has an 'understanding of the need to continue together.' The three countries, which formed the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), withdrew from ECOWAS in January 2024, citing dissatisfaction with sanctions and perceived foreign influence. ECOWAS has set a six-month transition period to encourage the AES to reconsider their exit, which is set to end on July 29, 2025.

**Federation Council Ratifies Agreement on Strategic Partnership with Iran**
The Federation Council has ratified the agreement on strategic partnership with Iran, which was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in January 2025. The 20-year agreement, with the option to extend, includes 47 articles covering all areas of cooperation between the two countries, including defense, counter-terrorism, energy, finance, transportation, and agriculture. According to the document, in the event of aggression against one of the contracting parties, the other party will provide support to the aggressor, while trying to resolve the conflict based on the UN Charter. However, Russia is not obligated to provide military aid to Iran. The agreement also includes provisions for countering sanctions, building energy facilities, and strengthening peace and security in the Caspian region, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the Middle East. As noted, the document was worked on since 2022 and was ratified by the State Duma in early April.

**Gulf Countries Unite to Host Rugby World Cup in 2035 or 2039**
Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia are working together to submit a joint bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2035 or 2039. The Asian Rugby Federation is supporting this initiative, which aims to promote the sport in the region and utilize the advanced infrastructure of these countries. According to The Times, the three Gulf countries are interested in hosting the tournament in 2035 or 2039, with the Asian Rugby Federation hoping that the International Rugby Board will consider a different approach. Qais Al-Zaabi, the president of the Asian Rugby Federation, expressed his optimism about the possibility of achieving this dream, saying, 'I expect it to happen in 2035, I don't want to downplay the value of other offers, and I believe that countries like South Africa and some European countries may also be interested, but if the International Rugby Board works seriously on this project and sets a solid plan, it may become a reality.' He added, 'I am in favor of the multi-city hosting model, not single-hosting, this idea has proven successful in football since the 2002 World Cup in Japan and Korea, and it is being applied again in 2026 in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and also in 2030 with Spain, Morocco, and Portugal, why not in rugby?' The Asian rugby officials believe that the region has a large fan base and significant financial power, and the region has a rich history of hosting major sports events, such as the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and Saudi Arabia is expected to host the 2034 World Cup. This may encourage the International Rugby Board to support this bid, Al-Zaabi said, 'The economies of the Middle East are very strong, look at golf, tennis, and combat sports that are held there, as well as major European clubs like Liverpool, Arsenal, and Manchester City that head there in the winter.' He pointed out that Gulf airlines such as Emirates and Qatar Airways have become major sponsors of rugby tournaments, showing the growing interest in the sport in the region. However, this idea faces some challenges, as all previous host countries had qualified for the tournament before hosting it, so the International Rugby Board may need to change the rules to allow these countries to participate if they do not qualify, in addition to the timing of the tournament, which may be subject to debate, as the organizers propose holding it in December and January instead of the usual period between September and October to avoid high temperatures.

**East African countries face $160mln forfeiture in tax revenues under AfCFTA but long-term future gains**
Four East African countries (Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda) face a potential loss of up to $160 million in tax revenues this year due to the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement. However, the report by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) suggests that the pain will be short-lived, as bigger gains on larger sales between African countries will compensate for the losses. The report estimates that Africa will lose 3% ($2 billion) in tax revenues in 2025 as a result of the AfCFTA agreement. Rwanda is expected to be heavily impacted, losing 3.5% of its tax revenues equivalent to $70 million. The decline in tariff revenues is expected to accelerate in 2030 with an anticipated 8.2% ($7 billion) reduction, before progressively reaching 10.7% ($21.1 billion) reduction in 2045. However, the report notes that governments have other sources of revenues at their disposal to compensate for such losses, and the AfCFTA Adjustment Fund has been established to assist vulnerable countries to mitigate tariff revenue losses.

Infrastructure development of football facilities was the other significant area of discussion,' said Hussein Mohammed. 'The offer of support from the Kingdom of Morocco to our Federation is a significant step in the realization of our aspirations in reclaiming our football glory days. I also congratulated the President and his team for the exemplary performance in the Qatar World Cup 2022 and the development of the world-class iconic Mohamed V football academy in Rabat,' added Hussein Mohammed.

**How Africa can make 2025 its ‘super year’ for ocean governance**
Africa has the potential to be a significant player in shaping global ocean governance, but its current approach lacks consistency. To make 2025 a 'super year' for ocean governance, African countries should actively engage in three key initiatives: the High Seas Treaty, deep-sea mining regulations, and the WTO fisheries subsidies agreement. Implementing the High Seas Treaty would have numerous benefits for African states, including shared marine genetic resources and technology transfer opportunities. However, only two out of 55 African countries have ratified the treaty, and 60 ratifications are needed by September to bring it into force. African countries should also champion a delay in deep-sea mining until robust scientific evidence ensures its environmental safety. Additionally, increased African involvement is needed to achieve the 111th ratification of the WTO's Agreement on Harmful Fisheries Subsidies. Africa needs to build on global momentum and expand regional ocean governance partnerships, such as the 2030 Africa-Europe ocean roadmap.

**How Africa can make 2025 its 'super year' for ocean governance**
Africa has the potential to be a significant player in shaping global ocean governance, but its current approach lacks consistency across issues and projects. To make 2025 a'super year' for the continent, African countries should lend their weight to three key initiatives: the High Seas Treaty, deep-sea mining regulations, and the WTO fisheries subsidies agreement. Implementing the High Seas Treaty would have numerous benefits for African states, including shared marine genetic resources and technology transfer opportunities. However, only two out of 55 African countries have ratified the treaty, and 60 ratifications are needed by September to bring it into force. African countries should accelerate the domestic legal processes required for ratification and those who have not signed the treaty should take immediate steps to sign and ratify. Additionally, African states should champion a delay in deep-sea mining until robust scientific evidence ensures its environmental safety. The continent should also prioritize ratification of the WTO fisheries subsidies agreement, which is crucial for promoting sustainable fishing and combatting illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. African countries must build on global momentum and expand regional ocean governance partnerships, such as the 2030 Africa-Europe ocean roadmap. They should also prepare for the implementation of international agreements by developing technical capacity, mobilising resources and adopting capacity-sharing initiatives.
