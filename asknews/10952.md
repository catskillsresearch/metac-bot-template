**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**Sobchak Proposes Ban on Men Under 30 Getting Married**
Ksenia Sobchak has suggested that men under the age of 30 should be prohibited from getting married on a legislative level. According to her, men of this age are still not mature enough for marriage. She stated, 'Men under 30 are still boys and in principle, not ready for serious relationships.' When asked about her opinion, Vanya Dmitrienko, a young performer, replied that age is not a significant factor for him, but rather the depth of feelings he has for a woman. He said, 'I cannot build a relationship with a girl if I do not have serious and deep feelings for her.' This is not the first time Sobchak has expressed her opinion on social issues, as she previously criticized a proposal to abolish pensions for television presenters.

**Rainbow Map 2025 Shows Alarming Setbacks in LGBTQIA+ Rights in Europe**
The Rainbow Map 2025, released by ILGA-Europe, shows alarming setbacks in LGBTQIA+ rights in Europe. The map evaluates the legal and political situation of LGBTQIA+ individuals in 49 European countries, with a scale ranging from 0% (severe human rights violations) to 100% (full equality and human rights protection). The evaluation considers concrete laws and political measures that directly affect the lives of LGBTQIA+ people. According to Katrin Hugendubel, a lawyer at ILGA-Europe, 'democratic erosions' are a major concern, with national laws that do not serve societal needs but rather aim to marginalize LGBTQIA+ individuals. She cites the example of Hungary's constitutional amendment, which states that 'the mother is a woman and the father is a man' and that 'gender is determined by birth.' Hugendubel says, 'Courts can be a source of hope, as they have already overturned some decisions or are currently considering cases to defend the rights of rainbow families, such as in Italy.' ILGA-Europe's Executive Director, Chaber, notes that the Rainbow Map 2025 not only shows the legal situation but also 'how acute the pressure on democracy is across Europe. If we don't act now, the deliberate erosion of rights will become the norm.' The current numbers show a clear picture: many European countries lack fundamental rights and protection mechanisms for LGBTQIA+ individuals. Only 10 countries in Europe have banned 'conversion therapies' legally. In 6 countries, there is no legal protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Only 9 countries, including Belgium, Spain, and Denmark, provide comprehensive protection regarding sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender characteristics (SOGIESC). Only a few countries, including Belgium, Iceland, and Malta, explicitly prohibit hate crimes and hate speech against LGBTQIA+ individuals. 22 countries recognize marriage for same-sex couples. 18 countries offer no legal protection for same-sex partnerships. Trans-parenting is only fully recognized in 8 countries. Only 6 countries, including Germany, Greece, Iceland, and Spain, prohibit medically unnecessary interventions on intersex children. In 11 countries, there is no legal possibility to recognize one's own gender. In Bulgaria, Hungary, and Russia, a legal gender recognition is even completely prohibited. Only 12 countries allow the change of gender entry based on self-determination, without medical or psychological assessments. In at least 14 countries, the assembly and association rights of LGBTQIA+ organizations are restricted or systematically under pressure. In 27 countries, sexual orientation and gender identity are considered asylum grounds. Only 6 countries explicitly protect intersex refugees in asylum law.

**France to Ban Smoking in All Public Outdoor Spaces from 2025**
France has announced a ban on smoking in all public outdoor spaces starting from 2025, as part of a broader national plan to combat tobacco. According to Health Minister Frédéric Valletoux, the measure aims to create a 'smoke-free generation' by 2032. 'It's unacceptable that in 2024, 75,000 people still die every year in France due to smoking,' Valletoux said. 'We want to create environments where smoking is no longer the norm.' The ban will be implemented gradually, following the example of over 7,000 areas that have already become 'smoke-free' through local ordinances. The government will establish the ban nationwide, uniforming the rules across the country. The new regulations will be accompanied by awareness campaigns, fines for those who break the rules, and incentives for those who quit smoking. The price of cigarette packs will also increase, reaching 13 euros by 2026. The plan has received support from health and environmental organizations, which highlight the harm caused by smoking not only to human health but also to the environment. Some representatives of the tobacco industry and tobacconists have expressed concerns about the economic impact, while some smokers have questioned the measure, considering it too restrictive. France is taking a leading role in Europe in the fight against tobacco, following the example of countries like New Zealand and Canada. The French government hopes that this move will inspire other European countries to take similar initiatives to protect public health and the environment. This ban represents a deep cultural shift: from a symbol of freedom and transgression, the cigarette becomes an habit to overcome for the common good.

**Copenhagen Inaugurates New Power Grid for Cruise Ships**
A new power grid for cruise ships has been inaugurated in the North Harbour of Copenhagen. The grid allows cruise ships to connect to the electrical grid while docked, reducing emissions by 90% compared to burning fossil fuels. According to Klaus Bondam, director of Cruise Denmark, most cruise ships will use the grid instead of diesel. Meanwhile, in Poland, the presidential election results are still pending, with a narrow lead for Rafal Trzaskowski over Karol Nawrocki. In Ukraine, a drone attack on Russian airbases has been reported, and a prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia is expected to take place. In Denmark, a tourist has been detained for flying a drone too close to the Livgardens kaserne in Copenhagen. In other news, a stonemine in Indonesia has collapsed, killing 19 people and injuring 8. A Pride parade was held in Bangkok, Thailand, marking the first time the country has celebrated LGBT+ pride since same-sex marriage was legalized. 1,194 migrants crossed the English Channel and arrived in the UK in small boats, the highest number on a single day in 2025. A Swedish cargo ship has been detained for suspected violations of maritime law, and a Thai woman has won the Miss World 2025 title. Two Danish athletes will participate in the EU's military training mission in Somalia. A car chase ensued after a burglary in Risskov, Denmark, and a 21-year-old man was arrested for owning the getaway car.

**Russian Car Dealers Seek to Ban Direct Online Sales by Manufacturers**
Russian car dealers are concerned that manufacturers may capture their margin by selling cars directly to consumers online. They want to ban carmakers from selling cars online without intermediaries, according to Forbes.ru. The Association of Russian Car Dealers (RADA) has proposed to the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) to establish a ban on direct online sales of cars by manufacturers and distributors. RADA wants to include this restriction in the national plan for the development of competition for 2026-2030, as stated in a letter from RADA President Alexei Podshchekoldin to FAS Head Maxim Shaskolsky. 'We are trying to protect consumers and maintain competition in the automotive retail market,' said Igor Chikin, Executive Director of RADA. 'We understand that the development of direct online sales may lead to a decrease in the rights and interests of car dealership owners and the imposition of unfavorable cooperation conditions on them.' RADA suggests excluding manufacturers and distributors from the national plan, so that the 5% online sales target applies to all market participants. 'We propose to ban manufacturers and distributors from making any direct sales to consumers, including online,' said Chikin. 'Direct sales mean the transfer of ownership of a car directly from the manufacturer or distributor to the end consumer,' explained Chikin. 'Dealers are trying to protect themselves from future competition,' said Sergey Udalov, Executive Director of Autostat. 'No one will refuse to work with them in the near future,' added the expert. 'In the coming years, the share of direct online car sales is likely to grow,' said Vladimir Bessonov, an analyst at Euler. 'Buying a car is still an event for the client, and often people want to see and touch the car before buying, which is impossible to do online,' he said.

**World coming up short on promised marine sanctuaries**
A global target of having 30% of the oceans protected by 2030 is at risk of not being met, with only 8.4% of the oceans currently protected. Conservationists say that countries like the US are reversing course and abandoning efforts to protect marine areas. 'With less than 10% of the ocean designated as MPAs and only 2.7% fully or highly protected, it is going to be difficult to reach the 30% target,' said Lance Morgan, head of the Marine Conservation Institute. The institute's research shows that many MPAs are not effective in protecting fish populations, with only a third of them having levels of protection that would yield proper benefits. Daniel Pauly, a professor of fisheries science, said that MPAs have not been proposed for the protection of biodiversity, but rather to increase fish catches. He emphasized the importance of fishing bans in MPAs, but noted that such restrictions account for only 2.7% of the ocean's area. The NGO Oceana is calling for a ban on bottom trawling, a technique that involves towing a heavy net along the sea floor, churning it up. A recent WWF report said that just 2% of European Union waters were covered by MPAs with management plans, highlighting the need for governments to back their words with action.

**Ohio man who challenged same-sex marriage ban has died**
Arthur Obergefell, an Ohio man who challenged the state's same-sex marriage ban, has passed away. He and his partner, John Arthur, decided to get married after the US Supreme Court's decision striking down portions of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in 2013. Due to Arthur's terminal illness, they had to travel to Maryland to get married, and then filed a lawsuit in federal court in Cincinnati against the state and the city, claiming that failure to recognize their marriage violated the equal protection clause of the US Constitution. The case moved quickly through the court, with federal Judge Timothy Black issuing a temporary order requiring that Arthur be listed as married on his death certificate and Obergefell be named his surviving spouse. Arthur's terminal illness played a significant role in the case, as it allowed the couple to argue that they would face 'irreparable harm' if Arthur was listed as single on his death certificate. Arthur's family plot at Spring Grove Cemetery is limited to direct descendants and their spouses, so the question of recognizing their marriage also influenced where he was buried and whether his partner could someday be buried next to him. 'It's been a swell of anonymous support,' Arthur said in August, referring to the publicity from his court case, which gave him a link to the outside world as hundreds of people sent gifts, letters and cards of support. 'It's truly the supporters who are seeking us out to congratulate us and acknowledge us and give us words of support and thanks.'

**France to Ban Smoking in Public Spaces Where Children Are Present**
France will make it illegal to smoke in public spaces where children are present, starting from July 1. The law aims to create a tobacco-free society by 2032. Those who break the law will face a fine of 135 euros. According to Health and Families Minister Catherine Vautrin, 'where there are children, tobacco must disappear.' The law does not apply to smoking in cafes' terraces or the use of e-cigarettes, but new measures are expected to reduce vaping. Tobacco causes 75,000 deaths per year in France, representing 13% of all deaths. The law is part of a National Program to Combat Tobacco, which started in 2023 and will end in 2027, with the goal of creating a tobacco-free generation by 2032. Yves Martinet, president of the National Committee against Tobacco, said that this law is also positive for non-smokers, as it protects them from 'passive smoking, which also kills.' Martinet added that the law 'desnormalizes tobacco consumption and leads smokers to think about quitting gradually.' The law has been shown to be effective, with many local governments in France already having similar measures in place.

**Islamabad bans child marriage with new law**
The National Assembly in Islamabad has passed a bill banning child marriage, introduced by PPP leader Sharmila Faruqui. The law, which criminalizes marriage under the age of 18 for both boys and girls, aligns with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals to end child marriage by 2030. Violators, including Nikah registrars, face up to one year in prison, a Rs100,000 fine, or both. According to the bill, child marriage causes 'scientific and social harm'.

**The Silent Scandal of Child Marriage in America**
In the United States, children are being forced into marriage, often with little to no public outcry. According to the UNICEF, 91% of child marriages involve a child being paired with an adult, and 78% of these children are girls. This is not only a human rights issue, but also a public health crisis. The mortality rate for mothers aged 15-19 is 93% higher than for those aged 20-24, and 41% of these children suffer from depression. The rate of suicidal attempts is three times higher than for their unmarried peers. Furthermore, half of these children do not complete high school, leading to a cycle of poverty that can last for generations. Despite the US State Department labeling child marriage as a 'global human rights abuse' in its 2023 Human Rights Report, five states (Missouri, Wyoming, Florida, Louisiana, and West Virginia) rejected bills to ban the practice in 2023. However, there is hope: Delaware, New York, and Michigan have banned child marriage, and the rate of child marriages in these states has decreased by 91%. The organization 'Unchained At Last' has rescued over 1,200 children from forced marriage in 14 states in the first half of 2024. A Gallup poll found that over half of Americans believe that child marriage is already banned, highlighting the public's lack of awareness about the issue. The media has also been largely silent on the topic, with child marriage stories making up only 1% of gun violence stories over the past four years. As the author notes, 'every child marriage is a lost future.'

**Delhi Takes Action Against Pollution: Ban on Gasoline and Diesel Vehicles by 2035**
The city of Delhi, with 32 million inhabitants, is trying to breathe: it has already planned to ban internal combustion engines by 2035, but in the meantime, it proposes a drastic law. According to the latest available data, 16 million Italian drivers would be on foot. Delhi's Minister of the Environment, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, has announced plans to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2035 and to stop refueling vehicles over 15 years old. In the meantime, 900 new electric buses and 5,000 of the 7,500 vehicles will be powered by clean fuels by 2025, 2026, and 2027. The city also plans to ban tuk-tuks by 2030 and 2035. Delhi is taking action to reduce pollution, as stated by Minister Sirsa, 'We are taking a big step towards a cleaner and healthier Delhi.'

**12 US States Are Planning to Ban the Sale of Gas-Powered Cars**
Twelve US states have announced plans to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035, following California's lead. The states are California, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. These states have adopted California's Advanced Clean Cars II regulations, which require 35% of new cars to be zero-emission by 2026, 68% by 2030, and 100% by 2035. The ban does not affect existing vehicles or prevent the purchase of used cars. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. President Joe Biden has set a goal of having half of all new vehicle sales in the US be electric by 2030. Automakers such as General Motors, Stellantis, and Mercedes-Benz have announced plans to phase out gas-powered vehicles in the coming years.

**First Roe v. Wade, now Obergefell: How gay marriage is next on the Supreme Court's chopping block, thanks to Trump**
Following the lead of the Trump administration, Republican lawmakers in several states are pushing to overturn the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage in the United States. Michigan Rep. Josh Schriver introduced a resolution asking the Supreme Court to delegate the ruling on same-sex marriage to state law, citing the 'sanctity of marriage' and the Michigan Constitution. Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota are also introducing measures to challenge the Obergefell ruling. Meanwhile, Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee are introducing bills that reinforce the concept of 'covenant marriage' between a man and a woman. Michigan Democrats have condemned the resolution as a 'ridiculous distraction' that doesn't help a 'single Michigan family.' The developments have raised concerns over the future of Obergefell, especially considering the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. However, the Biden administration's 2022 Respect for Marriage Act has codified the right to same-sex and interracial marriage into law, offering some protection to minority groups.

**Bill to Ban Marriages for Undocumented Immigrants Sparks Debate in France**
The French government supports a bill proposed by Senator Stéphane Demilly, which aims to 'interdire un mariage' (prohibit a marriage) when one of the spouses is present illegally in France. However, even if the bill is adopted by Parliament, the Constitutional Council may still reject it. This comes as the mayor of Béziers, Robert Ménard, was summoned to court for refusing to marry a French woman to an Algerian resident under an OQTF (obligation to leave the territory) in July 2023. Demilly's bill seeks to prevent marriages between individuals in irregular situations, sparking debate on the issue.

**Ballot initiatives protecting marriage equality advancing in some states**
Following a successful round of ballot initiatives in the 2024 elections, several states are taking steps to enshrine protections for same-sex marriage in their constitutions. However, some conservative lawmakers are actively targeting the Supreme Court's 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage. In response, legislators and residents in Idaho, Arizona, Virginia, and Nebraska are proposing ballot initiatives to repeal state restrictions on gay marriage. Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, said, 'Rather than wait for federal action that might take away rights, or undermine rights that we've had protected for more than a decade, there is an opportunity for people to have their voices heard through the ballot measure process.' According to a 2024 Gallup poll, 69% of Americans believe that marriage between same-sex couples should be legal. If the Obergefell decision were to be overturned, trigger laws banning same-sex marriage would go into effect in more than two dozen states. The Respect for Marriage Act, signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2022, guarantees the recognition of same-sex and interracial marriages, but does not enshrine the right to marriage in every state.
