**Cuts to federal domestic terrorism resources could leave states vulnerable to attacks**
Federal cuts to domestic terrorism combating efforts have raised concerns among advocates and researchers about the possibility of more attacks. President Donald Trump's administration has reallocated law enforcement resources to focus on mass deportation, including shutting down a national database of attempted and successful terrorism and targeted violence events. This decision has left some violence prevention advocates fearful of gaps in security measures, leading to tragic events. 'It's simple: we will see more school and workplace violence, more hate-fueled violence and terrorism and our political leadership will see more assassination attempts,' said William Braniff, former director of the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships at the Department of Homeland Security. Officials across the country have hinted at similar concerns, with Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel stating, 'The federal government used to prioritize domestic terrorism, and now it's like domestic terrorism just went away overnight.' The administration has also shut down the Terrorism and Targeted Violence program, which maintained a public dataset of targeted violence instances. Experts have predicted a 25 percent increase in terrorism or targeted violent events in the first two months of 2025 compared to the same time period last year.

**US Federal Court Orders Trump Administration to Lift Ban on Migrant Applications**
A US federal court has ordered the Trump administration to lift a ban on accepting migrant applications, including those from Ukraine. The ruling applies to military personnel, Afghans, and Ukrainians, according to the article. The court argued that the Trump administration's decision to end the legal presence of these groups, who are temporarily residing, working, or studying in the US, is likely unlawful and may sow discord in the country. Judge Indira Talwani called the Trump administration's comprehensive campaign to strip protection from those who already had it a 'serious escalation.' 'It is not in the public interest to create circumstances in which hundreds of thousands of people will be in the country illegally for several months, unable to legally work in their communities or support themselves and their families,' Talwani wrote. The judge certified all affected individuals as a separate class, temporarily extending general protection to those participating in multiple programs until a final decision is made. According to NYT, the new class will include Afghans who collaborated with US military for 20 years of the Afghan war; Ukrainians who fled after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022; and participants in the family reunification program, which allowed migrants from Central and South America to reunite with relatives in the US while waiting for a visa. NYT reports that the court's decision will likely be challenged. However, lawyers and immigration rights advocates welcomed this step. The lawsuit was filed in response to Trump's January order, which prohibited the government from considering immigration applications from migrants from Ukraine and several other countries, which were allowed to enter the US under special programs during the presidency of Joe Biden.

**US Federal Court Orders Trump Administration to Lift Ban on Migrant Applications**
A US federal court has ordered the Trump administration to lift a ban on processing migrant applications, including those from Ukraine. Judge Indira Talwani of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled that the administration's decision to end the legal presence of these groups, who are temporarily residing, working, or studying in the US, is likely unlawful and may sow discord in the country. 'It is not in the public interest to create circumstances where hundreds of thousands of people will be in the country unlawfully for several months, unable to work legally in their communities or provide for themselves and their families,' Judge Talwani wrote. The judge certified all affected individuals as a separate class, temporarily expanding general protection to those participating in several programs, pending a final ruling in the case. This includes Afghans who cooperated with US forces for 20 years during the war in Afghanistan, Ukrainians who fled after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, and participants in the family reunification program, which allowed migrants from Central and South America to reunite with family members in the US while waiting for a visa. The NYT reports that the court's decision is likely to be appealed. However, lawyers and immigration rights advocates welcomed the move. The lawsuit was filed in response to Trump's January executive order, which prohibited the government from considering immigration applications from migrants from Ukraine and several other countries, who were allowed to enter the US under special programs during the presidency of Joe Biden.

**Colombian Who Self-Deported from US Claims He Didn't Receive Promised $1,000 Incentive**
Julián, a Colombian citizen who lived in the US without proper documentation, voluntarily returned to Colombia through the 'self-deportation' program initiated by President Donald Trump. However, he claims that he did not receive the promised $1,000 incentive, which was part of a program announced by Trump to encourage undocumented migrants to return to their countries of origin. According to Trump, the program would provide a monetary compensation to migrants who returned to their countries through the CBP Home app, as a way to reduce the costs associated with forced deportations. 'This deportation bonus will save American taxpayers billions and billions of dollars', Trump said. 'We will pay each one a certain amount of money and get them an excellent flight back to their place of origin', he added. However, for Julián, the promise was not fulfilled. In an interview with Univisión, he explained that in April, he received emails from US immigration authorities warning him about the consequences of staying in the country. 'They said that if I didn't leave automatically, they would charge me $988 per day', he said. Julián decided to use the CBP Home app to initiate his voluntary return process, fearing operations and sanctions. 'They offered me a flight for May 16. I asked the girl what benefits I would get from self-deportation. She said: 'Apart from the flight, the government is offering a $1,000 economic benefit and the possibility of returning to the US without any problems''. However, when he arrived in Colombia, he did not receive the promised payment. 'I'm waiting to hear if I'll get paid or not. I think $1,000 is a lot of money for anyone', Julián said.

**The Multibillion-Dollar Business Behind Mass Deportations in the US**
A report by The Wall Street Journal revealed that the US government has spent over $13 billion in the last 10 years on private companies that handle the deportation of immigrants. The Trump administration increased spending on these companies by 50% between January and May 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The report analyzes the different expenses incurred by the US government in companies that manage all levels of the deportation process, from detention to food, phone calls, and transportation. The deportation of a migrant exposes the large expenses of the government. The Wall Street Journal followed the story of Venezuelan Andry Blanco Bonilla, who began his deportation process in February 2024 when an ICE agent accused him of being a member of a criminal gang despite having no prior convictions. The analysis covers each place where the migrant was detained and how, in his case, companies benefited economically. The government pays LaSalle Corrections around $17 million per year to operate the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, with a daily rate of $89 per detainee. Management and Training Corp. operates the Bluebonnet Detention Center in Anson, Texas, and has received over $240 million since 2014 for receiving detained migrants. The government spends between $48 and $106 per day per detainee at Bluebonnet, which has a capacity of 1062 inmates. The government has spent over $4 million on food and pre-packaged meals in companies like B&H International and My Own Meals. Blanco needed medication for high blood pressure and insomnia, and ICE made payments to companies related to medicine like Arora Group and Amergis Healthcare Staffing, which received over $24 million since January this year. He also had the opportunity to call his mother, Carmen Bonilla, approximately three times a week on shared phones inside the detention center, with expenses of $678 in phone cabins at a single center in 2023. After being detained for two months, Blanco was released and a deportation order was issued. He was detained again and told his mother that he would first be sent to Oklahoma, but there is no record of this. A few weeks later, he arrived at the El Valle Detention Center in Raymondville, Texas. On March 15, Blanco and 260 others were flown from Texas to the Terrorism Containment Center (Cecot) in El Salvador, accused of being members of gangs without a fair judicial process. Since Trump's second presidency, spending on air travel contracts for deportations has reached $167 million, and the US government pays $6 million per year to encarcerate this type of immigrant, considered a criminal.

**Trump's Deportation Campaign Fuels Billion-Dollar Industry for Private Companies**
The mass deportation campaign promoted by US President Donald Trump has fueled a billion-dollar chain of profits for private companies contracted by the government. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the White House's spending on these companies grew 50% between January and May 2025 compared to the same period last year. In the last decade, federal contracts with this sector have exceeded $13 billion - equivalent to R$ 73.4 billion. The figures involve everything from detention centers to food and medical services provided to detained immigrants. The expectation is that these contracts will increase even more as the Republican government advances in its crusade against immigration. A case in point is that of Venezuelan Andry Blanco Bonilla, 40, whose story illustrates how the system has become a highly profitable business. Blanco was detained in February 2024 on suspicion based on his tattoos, and was transferred to several detention centers, including Prairieland and Bluebonnet, operated by private companies LaSalle Corrections and Management and Training Corp., respectively. During his detention, Blanco received meals from companies like B&H International and My Own Meals, with contracts that have cost over $4 million to the public coffers. Other services, such as hygiene and medical care, are also provided by private corporations, including Arora Group and Amergis Healthcare Staffing, which have received over $24 million since January. Blanco was eventually deported to El Salvador, where he was detained in a maximum-security prison known for its rigorous methods, and the US government pays $6 million annually to the Salvadoran government for his detention.

**Over 40,000 People Deported from US to Mexico in 2025**
Since Donald Trump's return to the presidency of the United States in January 2025, the US immigration policy has had visible consequences in Mexico. According to information shared by Reuters, over 40,000 people have been deported from US territory so far this year. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that 37,000 of those deported are Mexican citizens, while the remaining 5,000 are immigrants from various nationalities. Sheinbaum shared this information during one of her morning conferences. The deported Mexican individuals come from all 32 states in the country, but 80% are from three states: Guerrero, Guanajuato, and Chiapas. The Mexican government has implemented support measures for deported individuals, including the 'México Te Abraza' program and online resources providing information on documentation services, psychological support, and medical care.

**Israel to begin deporting citizen terror convicts paid by Palestinian Authority**
Israel is set to deport citizens convicted of terrorism who are receiving payments from the Palestinian Authority, Defense Minister Israel Katz and Coalition Whip Ofir Katz announced. Four individuals are currently in advanced stages of the deportation process, with hundreds more to follow. The move follows a February 2023 law allowing the revocation of citizenship from convicted terrorists and their deportation. 'Terrorists and terror supporters who are citizens or residents of Israel will receive no reward for their actions,' the defense minister said. Coalition whip Katz called the move 'a historic moment,' adding: 'In the fight against terror, there are no compromises.' The PA practice of paying allowances to those convicted of carrying out terror attacks has been criticized as incentivizing terror, and held up by Israel as a symbol of PA corruption.

**Trump's DHS asks Supreme Court to intervene on deportations**
The Trump administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block a judge's order that requires the government to give people 10 days' notice and an opportunity to object before they are deported to a third country. The emergency request stems from a case before a Massachusetts federal judge, who said the administration violated his earlier order by attempting to send a group of migrants convicted of crimes to South Sudan. U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court that the case involves 'some of the worst of the worst illegal aliens,' who committed heinous crimes that their home countries won't take them back. U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy ruled that the men 'are simply asking to be told they are going to be deported to a new country before they are taken to such a country, and be given an opportunity to explain why such a deportation will likely result in their persecution, torture, and/or death.' The case is among a growing number of instances of judges finding that U.S. officials didn't fully comply with court orders stemming from President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration policies.

The US government announced a unique 'self-deportation' program to encourage irregular immigrants to return to their countries of origin. The initiative, announced by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), offers financial and logistical assistance to those who decide to leave the US voluntarily. According to the DHS, any person who is illegally in the US can request their departure through the CBP Home app and receive a ticket to their country of origin, as well as a $1,000 incentive. The DHS stated, 'Self-deportation is a dignified way to leave the US and will allow irregular immigrants to avoid being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).' The economic reward will be given once the applicant confirms their return through the app.

**Trump Announces 'Self-Deportation' Program with Financial Incentives**
US President Donald Trump announced plans to introduce a new 'self-deportation' program that would offer financial incentives to undocumented immigrants to voluntarily leave the country. According to Trump, the program would provide a 'little money and a plane ticket' to those who participate. The program would also allow migrants to return to the US legally at a later time. 'We're going to give them a scholarship,' Trump said in an interview with Fox Noticias. The program is an extension of the CBP One app, which was previously used to simplify immigration processes, including checking the status of entry documents. Trump stated that if the US government wants them to return, 'we will work with them to bring them back as quickly as possible.'

**White House to Appeal Court Ruling Blocking Revocation of 'Parole Humanitario' Program**
The White House announced that it will appeal a court ruling that blocked the revocation of the 'parole humanitario' program ordered by Trump. The program, established by the Biden administration in 2022 for Venezuelans and expanded in 2023 to Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans, allows citizens of these countries to request a permit to enter the US legally from their country of origin, provided they have a sponsor with legal residence in the US. The program was part of a strategy to reduce irregular border crossings by opening legal entry routes. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had justified its revocation, citing that the program 'does not provide a significant public benefit and has not been necessary to reduce levels of illegal immigration.' However, a federal judge, Talwani, ruled that the government cannot revoke the permits prematurely, and that each beneficiary's permit must be respected until the two-year deadline. The judge stated, 'The Government must respect the authorized period for each beneficiary, as approved in the framework of the established migratory program.' The decision blocks the mass revocation of the program, leaving without effect any measure that would lead to the early deportation of the over 530,000 current beneficiaries. The White House responded by questioning the judge's authority and confirming that it will present an appeal to a higher court, aiming to advance its policy of deportations and reduction of migratory benefits granted during the previous administration.

**White House Criticizes Judge's Ruling on Humanitarian Parole Program**
The White House has criticized the judge who ruled in favor of the humanitarian parole program, which provides legal status to 530,000 Venezuelans, Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Haitians. The program was ordered to be revoked by President Donald Trump, but the judge, Indira Talwani, blocked the move, stating that the program's expiration date should be respected. The White House has announced that it will appeal the decision. The Biden administration had established the program in 2022 for Venezuelans and extended it to Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Haitians in 2023, aiming to provide legal pathways for migration and reduce irregular border crossings. However, the Trump administration plans to revoke the program, which would lead to the deportation of its beneficiaries. María Ramírez, an undocumented immigrant, has been filing her taxes as proof of her contributions to the US, but now feels anxious about doing so, as it may lead to deportation. The IRS and DHS have signed an agreement allowing immigration authorities to access tax information of certain contributors, sparking concerns among activists and lawmakers that it may be a step towards accessing confidential information without a court order. 'This agreement is a complete betrayal of the federal government's decades-long commitment to never use taxpayer information for political purposes,' said Senator Alex Padilla. The DHS plans to send preliminary inquiries to approximately 2 million contributors and eventually seek help to locate 7 million people. 'As all years I did my taxes early, now they know where I work, where I live, it's really very anguishing,' says Ramírez. The agreement has been so controversial that the interim IRS director, Melanie Krause, resigned after the announcement, which she had participated in and reviewed, but turned out to be different from the agreed-upon terms. The alarm is not only among undocumented immigrants, but also among government and state coffers, as these immigrants paid around $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022. 'This revocation of the precedent (of IRS confidentiality) will only generate more fear in our immigrant communities and reduce the likelihood of undocumented people filing their taxes, which could cost thousands of millions in lost tax revenue for states and the federal government,' warned Padilla.

**Federal Judge Considers Blocking Trump Administration's End to Parole Humanitarian Program**
A federal judge in the US is evaluating a lawsuit challenging the government's decision to end the parole humanitarian program, which benefited over 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela during the Joe Biden administration. According to El Tiempo, the judge expressed concern over the government's arguments regarding the treatment of those affected, adding a significant nuance to the discussion on US immigration policy. The judge, Indira Talwani, heard arguments from both sides during a hearing on March 24 in Boston and scheduled a new session in two weeks. The migrants' lawyers are optimistic, hoping the judge will issue a temporary protection order before the next hearing. The Trump administration's legal team defended their authority to modify immigration policy and eliminate the parole humanitarian program (CHNV), but the judge questioned whether this change justifies the indefinite suspension of applications from those who entered legally under this program, which could have a significant impact on the affected immigrants. The parole humanitarian program, established by President Joe Biden in January 2023, allowed up to 30,000 immigrants to enter the US per month under certain conditions, including having a sponsor in the US and passing a background check. The Trump administration argues that this program does not align with their immigration goals and seeks its elimination, which would force beneficiaries to leave the country within 30 days. The decision on whether to block the revocation of the program will be made on April 7, as the case continues in court with the Trump administration.

**CBP HOME: A New Path for Self-Deportation or an Empty Promise?**
The US government has launched the CBP HOME app, a tool designed for undocumented immigrants to report their intention to leave the country or 'self-deport'. The initiative, promoted by President Trump as a 'easy' and 'safe' option for self-deportation, raises questions about its legal implications, effectiveness, and true purpose in the context of immigration laws and deportation statistics. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem claims that the app aims to restore the integrity of the immigration system, offering foreigners the possibility of 'self-deporting' and potentially returning legally in the future. However, experts argue that this promise of possible return is misleading, as self-deportation can still lead to a permanent ban on re-entry. The app requires users to provide personal information, including name, date of entry, and contact details, which raises concerns about data protection and potential misuse. The launch of CBP HOME marks a shift in the administration's immigration policy, prioritizing border control, deportation, and wall expansion. The statistics show a significant decrease in deportations under the Trump administration, with 37,660 deportations in January 2025, compared to 57,000 under the Biden administration. Armando Guzman, a correspondent for Fuerza Informativa Azteca, notes that the government's promise of self-deportation is 'empty' and that the app will be used to deport people, not to provide a safe and easy way out. Jesus Reyes, an immigration lawyer, warns that the app is a way for the government to incentivize people to self-deport, potentially leading to deportation and inadmissibility. The administration's focus on enforcement and deportation, combined with the appointment of a 'border czar' with a history of tough policies, suggests a restrictive future for immigration in the US.

**US Implements Self-Deportation Measure for Undocumented Immigrants**
The US government has announced a new measure of self-deportation that will affect undocumented immigrants. This policy, which will come into effect in 2025, aims to provide a legal pathway for undocumented immigrants to return to their country of origin without facing the consequences of a forced deportation. According to experts, this policy aims to reduce the backlog of immigration courts while offering immigrants a faster and less traumatic alternative to deportation. However, the process may be complicated for those who have lived in the US for many years and have families or jobs in the country. The economic and social implications of this measure could be significant, as many immigrants may not be willing to leave their lives in the US. As the policy is implemented, thousands of undocumented immigrants will face a difficult decision: opt for self-deportation or wait to be processed by immigration authorities. The US government has stated that this program could be beneficial for those who seek to return to their country in a peaceful manner, avoiding legal complications and the possibility of deportation. However, some advocates for immigrant rights have expressed concern about the potential abuses of this system, fearing that authorities may pressure immigrants to opt for self-deportation, even when it is not the best option for them. Additionally, there are concerns about the lack of support and protection for immigrants who decide to return to their countries of origin. The implementation of self-deportation will be voluntary, but immigrants will have to make a difficult decision. Those who choose to return to their country of origin will be able to do so without being formally accused of violating US immigration laws. However, those who do not choose this option and are caught by authorities may face a longer deportation process and the possibility of being detained.

**US Government Plans to Identify and Deport Minor Migrants**
The US government plans to identify and deport hundreds of thousands of minor migrants, according to an ICE concept with four phases. The first planning phase is set to begin on January 27, but the implementation is still unclear. The minors will appear before immigration courts and be deported immediately if a corresponding decision is made. The sought-after individuals will be divided into three groups, but neither the homeland security agency nor the ICE have responded to inquiries so far. The plan has sparked concerns about the treatment of minors and the potential consequences of deportation.

**US Government Plans to Deport Underage Migrants with DNA Tests**
The US government under Donald Trump plans to identify and deport hundreds of thousands of underage migrants in the country. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has developed a four-phase concept to achieve this, which was obtained by Reuters on Sunday. The first phase is scheduled to start on January 27, but the implementation date remains unclear. According to the ICE memo, the migrants will be informed to appear before an immigration court or be deported directly if a corresponding decision has already been made. The migrants will be divided into three groups: those with a 'flight risk', 'danger to public safety', and 'border security'. The relevant homeland security agency and ICE did not respond to a Reuters inquiry.

**$1,000 Reward Proposed for Reporting Undocumented Migrants in the US**
A proposal by Republican Senator David Gregory in Missouri aims to reward individuals with $1,000 for reporting undocumented migrants. According to the proposal, if the information leads to the arrest and detention of an undocumented migrant, the informant will be eligible for a $1,000 reward. However, if the information is true, the arrested person would be charged with 'illegal invasion by an undocumented foreigner' and face life imprisonment without parole, unless federal immigration authorities take custody and deport them. The proposal also creates a 'bounty hunter' program, which would certify individuals to hunt and detain undocumented migrants in Missouri. Gregory explained that it would function as a state immigration and customs control service, responsible for carrying out detentions and deportations. The proposal sparked a heated debate in the Senate, with dozens of people testifying against it, including State Senator Barbara Washington, a Democrat from Kansas City, who argued that it encourages racist reports based on skin color or English proficiency. 'Don't tell me it won't happen because it's already happening,' Washington said, according to the Missouri Independent.
