**European Climate Change Advisory Council Recommends 90-95% Emissions Reduction by 2040**
The European Climate Change Advisory Council recommends that the European Union set a new, ambitious intermediate goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 90-95% by 2040. This is the only value that keeps the EU on a 'solid', 'viable', and 'credible' path to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, as required by the Climate Law. 'We must reduce emissions significantly and quickly. It's the only way to stop and reduce global warming,' said Ottmar Edenhofer, president of the European Climate Change Advisory Council. The council's report, released on Monday, reiterates that the legally binding goal of zero emissions by 2050 can only be realistically achieved with a 90-95% reduction in internal CO2 emissions relative to 1990 levels. This conclusion was reached after analyzing 1,000 possible scenarios of climate impacts and risks caused by increasing greenhouse gas levels. Only five scenarios survived the exhaustive evaluation of compliance with European climate goals and the Paris Agreement targets by 2040, precisely those that predicted a cut above 90% in emissions. According to Edenhofer, the models 'highlight the urgent need for a deep and sustained reduction in emissions and a significant increase in CO2 removal.' The council recommends that the European Commission send a signal to member states to intensify their efforts and establish the 'national emissions reduction target of 90-95% by 2040.' 'The uneven progress between sectors and member states requires a renewed political commitment. What's at stake is the credibility of climate neutrality,' emphasized Edenhofer, when asked about the pressure from European Parliament lawmakers to lower the cut to 85% to avoid compromising the continent's reindustrialization strategy. The scientists consider that defining a more ambitious goal provides greater security and predictability for economic agents, to reduce fossil fuel use and accelerate investment in clean technologies, modernization, and expansion of infrastructure, and electrification. 'The good news is that the EU has made progress in reducing emissions over the past five years, driven by the energy sector transition and the rapid deployment of renewable energies, such as wind and solar. This means that the goal of reducing emissions by at least 55% by 2030 is within reach, and that the EU is largely aligned with the scenarios that support the recommended interval for 2040,' points out Edenhofer. The Advisory Council also opposes the suggestion from MEPs to include international carbon credits in the calculation of the EU's effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 'We discourage the use of international carbon credits to meet the 2040 target, as they risk diverting resources from national investments and may compromise environmental integrity,' says the report published on Monday. In addition to the new 2040 intermediate goal, the panel of experts recommends establishing three separate objectives for the reduction of raw emissions and for temporary and permanent CO2 removals. Two additional recommendations aim at the bet on cooperation and partnerships for promoting climate action beyond EU borders - not to replace but to complement national efforts -; and the reinforcement of the EU's adaptation policy to climate change, namely through the approval of new legal instruments and measurable objectives. 'The coordination and political action at the EU level are not commensurate with the growing scale of climate threats. Therefore, we recommend strengthening the EU's adaptation framework, not only through the Climate Law but also through future legislation aligned with global objectives for preparation, adaptation, and mitigation,' referred Ottmar Edenhofer, recalling that Europe is the continent that records the fastest warming on the planet. 'Climate change is already affecting Europe. Rising temperatures threaten public health and cause avoidable losses of life and economic damage. And all scientific literature consistently shows that limiting global warming produces global social and economic benefits far superior to the costs of mitigation,' observed.

**EU Experts Call for Ambitious Climate Goal of 90-95% Emissions Reduction by 2040**
The European Climate Advisory Council recommends reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 90-95% by 2040, which would also benefit the economy and energy security, according to the experts. The council has reiterated its call for an ambitious climate goal for 2040, which would keep the EU on a credible path to achieving climate neutrality by 2050. If the goal is set too low, it would undermine the EU's long-term competitiveness and energy security, especially in a time of geopolitical uncertainty, the experts warn. The EU currently aims to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990, and the Commission has concluded that this goal is achievable. The EU also aims to become climate-neutral by 2050, but a binding intermediate goal for 2040 is still missing. The Commission had recommended reducing net emissions by at least 90% by 2040 compared to 1990 in 2024, and a draft law is expected in early July. The EU member states and the European Parliament will then negotiate the proposal, which is expected to be contentious. Some in the European Parliament and among the EU member states consider 90% to be too ambitious, and the Commission is expected to introduce more flexibility to achieve the goal, such as recognizing carbon credits from non-EU countries. The Climate Advisory Council advises against international emissions credits, instead recommending that the reduction be achieved through domestic EU measures.

**Are Countries' New Climate Plans Ambitious Enough? What We Know So Far**
The World Resources Institute analyzed the initial submissions of countries' new climate commitments, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), for 2025. The results show that while some countries, such as the U.S., U.K., and Brazil, have made ambitious commitments, many others, including major emitters like the EU and China, have yet to submit their NDCs. The analysis found that the new NDCs submitted so far have made a noticeable but modest dent in the 2035 'emissions gap', with a projected reduction of 1.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) by 2035 compared to 2030. However, this is far from what's needed to keep global warming within safe limits, and many countries, including developed and wealthy economies, have not strengthened their 2030 targets. The analysis also found that some countries, such as the U.K. and Brazil, have set ambitious targets, while others, such as Canada, have made only marginal increases to their targets. The report concludes that much greater ambition and action are needed to narrow the emissions gap and keep global temperature goals within reach.

**EU on Track to Meet 55% Emissions Reduction Goal by 2030**
The European Union is close to achieving its ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. According to the European Commission, the current reduction is at 54%, which is a promising result. This is a significant achievement, especially considering that the EU is one of the regions that is warming the fastest. The consequences of climate change are already being felt, with extreme heatwaves, frequent floods, and wildfires becoming a regular occurrence. However, there is a sense of hope, as many EU member states have taken concrete steps to accelerate the energy transition. The EU has already reduced emissions by 37% since 1990, and in 2023, there was an additional 8% reduction. Some countries, such as Belgium, Estonia, and Poland, are still lagging behind in defining their plans, while others are pushing for a slower pace on environmental regulations due to geopolitical tensions, energy price increases, and protectionism. The European Commission, however, remains committed to its goal and is now aiming for a 90% reduction in emissions by 2040, with some flexibility in the tools used, such as carbon credits.

**EU demands CO2 storage from oil and gas companies**
The European Union has set ambitious climate goals, but without facilities to store carbon dioxide (CO2), these goals are illusory. The EU is now requiring oil and gas companies to ensure the necessary storage facilities by 2030. The EU has published a list of 44 companies, including OMV, Total Energies, and Eni, which must store 50 million tons of CO2 per year by 2030. The EU aims to store at least 250 million tons of CO2 per year by 2040 to achieve its climate goals. The industry has expressed concerns about the feasibility of these targets, citing the high costs of building CCS infrastructure, lack of economic incentives, and regulatory uncertainty. Total Energies estimates that only about half of the target will be achieved by 2030, citing delays in project development and a lack of final investment decisions. The company is, however, continuing to develop its CCS projects, including the 'Northern Lights' project in Norway, which aims to store CO2 from European companies in the North Sea. The EU has promised faster permitting procedures and solid financial support to the industry, but the companies remain skeptical. Environmental organizations, such as Clean Air Taskforce (CATF) and Bellona, welcome the EU's decision, but also emphasize the need for a complete CCS value chain, including a European network of pipelines, railways, and roads to transport CO2 from emitters to storage sites.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**Accelerated Decarbonization Project to be Submitted in 2025: 'Ending Coal-Fired Thermoelectric Plants'**
President Gabriel Boric announced that the accelerated decarbonization project will be submitted to Congress in the second half of 2025. He emphasized that the goal of a carbon-free energy matrix by 2040 is challenging but achievable, and that it will be driven by private investment and economic development. Boric mentioned the possibility of advancing the goal to 2035 or even earlier, depending on institutional conditions. He stated that 'while there are more clean energy projects, we will be able to decarbonize sooner and at the same time reduce the rise in tariffs.' Boric also noted that 'with the collaboration of all sectors, we could not only meet the goal set by President Piñera for 2040, but also advance it to 2035 or earlier, depending on the institutional verification of the conditions.' He concluded by saying that 'with this, we will achieve an unprecedented energy transition at the global level.'

**From Leader to Laggard? U.S. Faces Carbon Capture Slowdown as EU Surges Ahead | OilPrice.com**
The United States, once a leader in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, is facing a slowdown due to policy uncertainty, while Europe is surging ahead with a regulatory-driven approach. The EU's Net-Zero Industry Act requires oil and gas companies to collectively develop and reserve at least 50 million tonnes of annual CO2 storage capacity by 2030, creating a stable environment for investors and reducing risk. This shift in global momentum highlights a changing dynamic in CCS leadership, with Europe positioning itself as a growing center of gravity for CCS innovation. 'This regulatory certainty offers investors a stable environment in which to commit capital, reducing risk and providing a clear roadmap for the long-term development of CCS infrastructure,' according to the article. The U.S. market, on the other hand, faces a potential slowdown due to the lack of stability in the regulatory environment, making it difficult for projects to reach final investment decisions.

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**A grim signal: Atmospheric CO2 soared in 2024**
The global mean concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2024, increasing by 3.75 parts per million (ppm) according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Global Monitoring Laboratory. This brings the annual mean global concentration close to 430 ppm, about 40% more than the pre-industrial level, and enough to heat the planet by about 2.7° Fahrenheit (1.5° Celsius). Climate researchers have noted that the continuing increase of global CO2 emissions means the world will probably not be able to reach the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming to 2.7° Fahrenheit above the pre-industrial level. Zeke Hausfather, a climate researcher at Berkeley Earth, said, 'It's definitely worrying to see such a large jump in 2024.' He attributed the increase to a weakening of the land sink, which absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Even if the growth rate slows again in 2025, Hausfather said, 'the worry is that this year's jump might include [non-El Niño] factors like temperature responses from soils and vegetation that might persist or intensify as the Earth warms.'

Zeke Hausfather said, 'Because we know the magnitude of emissions and the ocean sink does not vary that much year to year, this has to reflect a weakening of the land sink.' James Hansen said, 'Similar increases have occurred with lesser emissions, but stronger El Niños.' He added, 'It’s not all gloom and doom. The airborne fraction of emissions has actually trended downward over the past several decades, so once we begin to reduce emissions, we should be able to get the growth rate of CO2 to decline.'

**B.C. climate news: Merritt gets $60 million from B.C. government to improve flood protection | Renewable energy jumps to new high, powered by China solar boom | At least 28 dead in South Korea wildfires**
The Earth has warmed by 1.3 C since the 1800s, with 2024 being the hottest year on record globally, surpassing the previous record in 2023. The global average temperature in 2024 reached 1.55 C higher than the pre-industrial average, breaching the 1.5 C threshold. The past 10 years (2015-2024) are the 10 warmest years on record. Human activities have increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations by nearly 49% above pre-industrial levels. The world is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement target to keep global temperature from exceeding 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. According to the IPCC, the temperature could increase by as much as 3.6 C this century if carbon dioxide emissions continue on their current path. To keep temperatures from exceeding 1.5 C, emissions must drop 7.6% per year from 2020 to 2030, and to stay below 2 C, emissions must drop 2.7% per year. There is global scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that humans are the cause.

**Record CO2 Concentration Threatens the Climate: A 800,000-Year High**
According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere reached a record high of 420 parts per million in 2023, which is the highest level in the past 800,000 years. This value is 51% higher than the pre-industrial level of 1750. In addition to CO2, record levels of methane (265% of the pre-industrial level) and nitrous oxide (125%) were also recorded. The data shows that the concentration of these gases continued to rise in 2024. The increase in greenhouse gas concentrations led to record temperatures in 2023 and 2024, exacerbated by the transition from La Niña (cooling) to El Niño (warming). Extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones, floods, and droughts, caused mass population displacement, exacerbated the food crisis, and inflicted significant economic damage, as stated by the WMO report. 'The situation is alarming,' said the WMO. 'We must take immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.'

**CO2 Concentration Increases by 3.5 PPM in 2024, Largest Increase in 11 Years**
According to data from the GOSAT satellite, the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere increased by 3.5 parts per million (PPM) in 2024, the largest increase in the past 11 years. The average concentration of CO2 in the entire atmosphere was 421 PPM in 2024, up from 388 PPM in 2014. The increase is believed to be caused by factors such as droughts, forest fires, and the expansion of industrial activities. The GOSAT satellite, launched in 2009, is the world's first satellite capable of observing the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from space. Japan provides the data obtained from GOSAT to the world free of charge, which helps other countries to understand the current state of greenhouse gas emissions.

**CO2 Concentration in Atmosphere Reaches Record High in 2024**
According to Alexander Chernokulsky, deputy director of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, a new record for the annual increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere may be set in 2024. Additionally, the psychological threshold of a 1.5°C temperature increase, set by the Paris Climate Agreement, has been exceeded for the first time. Notably, the only times when a significant decrease in emissions have been observed were during financial crises and the COVID-19 pandemic. Chernokulsky stated, 'Пока усилий человечества по сокращению выбросов недостаточно, заметное снижение наблюдалось только во время финансовых кризисов и пандемии коронавируса.'
