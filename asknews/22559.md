**üî•TikTok Fame Isn‚Äôt Random‚ÄîHere‚Äôs How to Get the Algorithm on Your Side**
To increase your visibility on TikTok, it's not just about luck - you can actually shape how and where your content shows up. The key is to grab attention in the first few seconds, find your niche, and show up with personality. This includes using hashtags like #BookTok or #WomenInSports, grabbing attention early with a hook, and making content that resonates with your audience. Timing also matters, with late night Saturday into early Sunday generally getting the most engagement. Interacting with your audience through comments, stitches, and duets also helps to build community and drive visibility. Additionally, using the right hashtags, playing the audio game with trending sounds, and having fun with your content can also help to increase your views. As TikTok says, 'users are 4x more likely to say it‚Äôs the best platform for community' and '72% of women on the app say it‚Äôs easy to find people who get you'.

**Student Strike Against Cell Phone Ban in Schools Continues**
A second day of student strike against the ban on cell phones in schools is being prepared and could mobilize even more students than the previous one. 'Everyone will strike on Friday, May 23. We'll boycott classes. No students, no school. We'll see what they do!' one can hear in a video shared on TikTok. The strike is in response to a new measure that will ban the use of cell phones in schools starting in the 2025 school year. According to many comments on TikTok, the previous strike on May 9 was not as successful as expected, so students are planning to try again this week. 'This time, we're starting over, but we'll be better organized,' an student said in a video that has been viewed over 2,800 times and liked over 3,100 times. Many online publications are supporting the strike, with students commenting that the ban is 'unfair.' The online petitions are still gaining momentum, with one of them reaching over 62,480 signatures.

**TikTok Returns to US App Stores Amid Uncertainty Over Long-Term Availability**
TikTok has returned to the Google and Apple app stores in the US after being removed in January 2025 following the implementation of a law passed in 2024. However, in an executive order on January 20, Donald Trump stated that no decisions should be made and gave the app a 75-day deadline to be sold to another company. It is still unclear whether TikTok will remain available in the US long-term. The app's ban was due to concerns from US authorities that the Chinese-owned Bytedance, TikTok's parent company, could be monitoring US citizens' data at the behest of the Chinese government. The ban was supported by both Democrats and Republicans, and the law states that if Bytedance does not sell the app by January 19, 2025, TikTok will be banned from the US. The new government, which has changed its stance on the ban, has until April to negotiate the sale of the app, or the platform may be suspended again. However, in a statement, Bytedance said that TikTok is not for sale.

**TikTok Still Not Available in US Despite Trump's Announcement**
Despite Donald Trump's announcement to allow TikTok in the US, the app is still not available on Apple and Google stores. According to Apple, 'In accordance with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries, including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others, will no longer be available for download or update in the App Store for users in the US as of January 19, 2025.' Google Play only warns users that the download of the app is on hold due to 'current US legal requirements.' Trump had signed a decree to suspend the ban on TikTok for 75 days, allowing ByteDance to sell the app. However, Elon Musk's potential acquisition of TikTok has not yet led to the app's availability in the US.

**TikTok Negotiates Agreement to Remain Available in US**
ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, is reportedly negotiating an agreement to keep the app available in the United States. According to Bill Ford, the general director of General Atlantic, a major investor in ByteDance, 'Yes, it's for the benefit of everyone.' Ford stated that the company will continue to work on negotiations, possibly until the end of the week, involving the US and Chinese governments, ByteDance, and its board of directors. He also mentioned that there may be other solutions besides selling the company's assets. Ford attributed the current situation to the lack of a 'real dialogue' with the previous administration, led by former President Joe Biden. The Biden administration had signed a law in April 2024 that allowed for the ban of TikTok in the US, giving ByteDance 270 days to sell the app to an American company. If not, TikTok would be banned in US app stores and internet hosting services. The Federal Appeals Court upheld the law in December, requiring ByteDance to sell its stake in the app by January 19, 2025. However, newly elected President Donald Trump has announced a 90-day delay of the ban, which would take effect after his inauguration. Despite this, TikTok was removed from Apple and Google app stores for US users, and the app stopped working for users who had installed it, even with VPN.

**TikTok Still Not Available in US App Store and Google Play Store**
TikTok is facing a difficult situation in the United States. After the US Supreme Court upheld a law that suspends the use of the app due to security concerns, ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, announced that it would temporarily suspend its services in the US. However, Donald Trump granted a 90-day extension for TikTok to operate in the US, and has proposed that the company be 50% owned by an American entity. Trump has also suggested that Elon Musk buy TikTok. Despite the uncertain future of the app, TikTok is still not available in the US App Store and Google Play Store. According to The Verge, searching for TikTok in the App Store displays a message saying that the app is not available in the user's country or region. Google Play also states that downloads of the app are paused due to current US legal requirements. Apple explains on its support page that it is obligated to follow laws in the jurisdictions where it operates, and that TikTok and other ByteDance apps will no longer be available for download or update in the US App Store after January 19, 2025.

**No, TikTok Isn't Back in the App Store**
TikTok has returned to the app store after President Trump's executive order, but its availability is still uncertain. According to Apple's website, TikTok will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025, due to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. The law states that providers like Oracle, Apple, and Google would be fined for having the app available, not the users, so they have no incentive to get TikTok back into the app store during the 75-day extension. Users can try using the web browser version in the meantime.

**TikTok available to some U.S users**
TikTok has become available to some U.S. users on January 19, 2025, after President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to delay a federal ban on the app. According to TikTok, 'In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service.' The company thanked President Trump for providing clarity and assurance to its service providers, stating that they will face no penalties for providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans. TikTok also expressed its willingness to work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps the app in the United States.

**TikTok Restricted in the US Ahead of Official Ban**
TikTok was restricted in the US on January 18, less than two hours before the official ban took effect. The app displayed a message saying, 'Sorry, TikTok is not available. A US law has been passed that bans TikTok. Unfortunately, this means you can't use the app right now. We're lucky that President Donald Trump has indicated that he will work with us to find a solution that will allow TikTok to work again once he takes office.' Users can still log in to their accounts to download their data. The ban was supported by the US Supreme Court on January 17, which allowed the law to be enforced if ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, did not sell the app. TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, had previously reached out to Elon Musk for mediation in talks with the Trump administration. Trump had previously signed an executive order to ban TikTok, but it was blocked by a court. During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump changed his rhetoric on the platform. On January 17, Trump said he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and TikTok was one of the topics of discussion. The ban was signed into law by President Joe Biden in the spring of 2024, citing national security concerns and the need to protect user data. TikTok filed a lawsuit in May 2024, challenging the constitutionality of the law. ByteDance stated that it cannot and will not sell its US assets. In December 2024, TikTok requested a temporary block on the law while the Supreme Court reviewed the appeal. The US appeals court denied TikTok's request in mid-December 2024. At the end of December 2024, Trump called on the US Supreme Court to delay the ban to try to resolve the situation.

**TikTok to be Closed in the United States on January 19, 2025**
TikTok will be closed in the United States on January 19, 2025, due to a law that requires the Chinese company ByteDance to sell the app to an American company or shut down its operations in the country. The law was approved by the US Senate in April 2024 for national security reasons and to prevent the leakage of data from over 170 million Americans. If ByteDance is unable to revoke the demand, the app will no longer be available in the US, affecting over 170 million users. However, users who have the app installed on their devices will still be able to access it, but it will become increasingly difficult to use as updates will no longer be available. It is unclear whether the decision will also affect Mexico and other countries, but users are waiting for any announcement from ByteDance. As stated by the law, the app will no longer be available in app stores such as App Store and Google Play. 'It's possible that some users may think they will be sanctioned for simply logging in to the platform, but that's not the case,' said a spokesperson. 'Those who continue to use TikTok will still be able to access it, but it will become increasingly difficult to use over time.'

**Will TikTok still be available in the US after January 19?**
The future of TikTok in the United States is uncertain after January 19, when the US Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the app should be banned. If the ban is implemented, the 170 million US users could be affected. However, according to The New York Times, the law passed by Congress last year only prohibits app stores like App Store and Google Play from distributing or publishing TikTok updates. This means that users who already have the app installed can continue to use it, although they will not receive new updates. The app may degrade over time without updates, but some advertisers still trust its use in the US. TikTok may also block access to its videos for US users after January 19 as part of its strategy to comply with the law and avoid further consequences. Users may still be able to access TikTok using a VPN, which can hide their location and bypass restrictions.
