**European stocks fall as Trump proposes 50% tariff on EU imports; says talks with them 'going nowhere' | Invezz**
President Donald Trump has proposed a 50% tariff on goods imported from the European Union, citing a lack of progress in trade talks. Economists warn that such tariffs could trigger stagflation and damage global trade. The proposed tariffs would take effect on June 1, and the European Commission has declined immediate comment, awaiting a scheduled call between EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. The announcement has caused a sharp decline in European stocks, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index down 1.9%. Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee warned that the tariffs could create a 'stagflationary' scenario by increasing production costs and slowing output, all while raising consumer prices. 'That's the Central Bank's worst situation,' he added. The EU was the second-largest buyer of US goods in 2022, importing nearly $351 billion worth of American products.

**Trump Announces 50% Tariff on EU Products, EU Remains Silent**
US President Donald Trump has announced that he will impose a 50% tariff on European Union products starting from June 1, 2025, citing that 'our conversations with them are going nowhere!' Trump made the announcement on his Truth Social profile, stating that 'no tariff will be applied if the product is manufactured in the US'. Trump has accused the EU of creating a commercial deficit with the US, which he considers 'totally unacceptable', due to EU's trade barriers, VAT, 'ridiculous' corporate sanctions, non-monetary trade barriers, monetary manipulations, and 'unjustified' demands against US companies. The European Commission has not commented on the announcement and is waiting for a call between EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. This is not the first time Trump has imposed tariffs on EU products, as he previously announced a 20% tariff in April, which was later suspended for 90 days. The EU has announced its intention to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the US tariffs. 'I want to have a concrete package to discuss', said EU Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, who has expressed her willingness to meet with Trump. 'If I go to the White House, I want to have a package that we can discuss', she added.

**Trump Drops Tariff Bomb, Instantly Craters Stock Futures**
President Donald Trump announced a new trade policy on social media, recommending a 50% tariff on the European Union starting June 1, 2025. Trump stated that the EU's trade barriers and unfair practices have led to a $250,000,000 annual trade deficit with the US, which he deemed 'totally unacceptable.' The news caused a steep drop in major stock futures indices, with the Dow Jones Industrials falling 500 points. This move comes after Trump's recent trade deal with the UK and tariff truce with China, which had calmed markets. However, experts have criticized the new tariff as 'insubstantial' and the market will have three days to react before trading resumes on Tuesday.

**US FTC Launches Investigation into Media Matters Over Alleged Coordination with Advertisers**
The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched an investigation into Media Matters, a non-profit organization, over allegations that it coordinated with other groups to pressure advertisers to boycott X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk. The investigation comes after X filed lawsuits against Media Matters and the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), accusing them of defamation and unlawful coordination. Media Matters had previously published a report claiming that major brands' ads appeared next to extremist content on X, leading to the withdrawal of several advertisers from the platform. X responded by filing lawsuits in Texas and California, accusing Media Matters of damaging the platform's reputation and causing financial losses. Media Matters denied the allegations, describing the lawsuits as an attempt to silence criticism. The FTC investigation focuses on whether Media Matters coordinated with other organizations, such as GARM, to influence advertisers' decisions on spending on X. GARM is an initiative launched by the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) to promote brand safety in digital environments. FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, appointed by former President Donald Trump, emphasized the importance of investigating any unlawful coordination between online platforms, highlighting the need to address advertising boycotts that threaten competition between these platforms. According to a report by EMarketer, X's ad spending is expected to increase in 2025 for the first time since Musk's acquisition in 2022, but it remains lower than pre-acquisition levels.

**Trump Administration Launches Investigation Into Media Matters Amid Musk Lawsuits**
The Trump administration has launched an investigation into Media Matters, a liberal advocacy organization, amid Elon Musk's ongoing lawsuits against the website. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is probing whether Media Matters illegally colluded with advertisers on X, the social media platform Musk acquired in 2023. Media Matters has accused Musk of engaging in 'a vendetta-driven campaign of libel tourism.' The investigation comes as Media Matters continues to defend itself against Musk's defamation lawsuits, which have already proven costly, resulting in the layoff of about a dozen staffers last year. According to The New York Times, the FTC sent a letter to Media Matters stating that it launched a probe into the site as to whether it manipulated an X feed to achieve certain outcomes, as claimed by Musk's platform.

**Trump Says 50 Percent Tariff Will Be Imposed on European Union on June 1**
U.S. President Donald Trump announced on May 23 that a 50 percent tariff will be imposed on the European Union starting on June 1. The tariff will not apply to products built or manufactured in the United States. Trump stated that the EU has been 'very difficult to deal with' and that 'our discussions with them are going nowhere.' Polish Trade Minister Michal Baranowski said that the EU and the U.S. are negotiating, but the fact that statements are made in public does not guarantee action. Trump has been critical of the EU's value-added tax (VAT) and has imposed tariffs on EU goods in the past. EU officials have opposed tariffs, arguing they are economically counterproductive. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said that the union prefers reaching a deal, but does not feel pressured to accept an unfair agreement. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Switzerland and Britain are moving faster in trade negotiations with the U.S. than the EU.

**Trump's 50% Tariff on EU Imports Sparks Concerns of Stagflation and Global Trade Harm**
US President Donald Trump has announced a proposed 50% tariff on imports from the European Union, citing a lack of progress in trade negotiations. This move would be a significant escalation of tensions between Washington and Brussels. Economists warn that the tariff could lead to stagflation and harm global trade. The EU has been a major buyer of US products, importing over $351 billion worth of goods in 2022. A 50% tariff could have a significant impact on transatlantic trade flows and destabilize multinational companies that rely on open trade channels. The Trump administration is currently in talks with over a dozen governments to renegotiate trade agreements before existing tariffs expire in July. However, several foreign officials have expressed concern about Washington's unpredictable demands, highlighting the difficulty of making concessions when tariffs can be reinstated without notice. Trump has long argued that European nations gain an unfair advantage from trade with the US. His promotion of 'reciprocal' tariffs aims to harmonize duty rates, although critics argue that such measures risk sparking full-blown trade wars and compromising global supply chains. As the proposed 50% tariff is set to take effect in less than two weeks, attention is now focused on upcoming talks between US and EU trade officials. The lack of an agreement could widen the gap between two of the world's largest economic blocs. 'Passer à 10 % était déjà le taux de tarif le plus élevé que nous ayons appliqué au monde depuis 90 ans. Passer à 50 % est une toute autre dimension,' said Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve of Chicago, warning of the risks of stagflation. 'C'est la pire situation possible pour la Banque centrale,' he added.

**Trump Announces 50% Tariff on EU Imports, Targets Apple with Mega-Tariffs**
US President Donald Trump has announced that he will impose a 50% tariff on all EU imports starting from June 1, 2025. Trump made the announcement on 'Truth Social', citing 'unfair trade practices' by the EU. He stated, 'The European Union was very difficult to deal with. They have treated the US very unfairly. I think we should impose a 50% tariff on all their cars and other products coming into the United States.' This move comes after the EU proposed abolishing all tariffs on industrial goods, which Trump rejected. The markets reacted immediately, with the DAX losing 400 points and US indices also declining. Brussels plans to retaliate with tariffs on US goods worth up to $100 billion. The consequences for transatlantic economic relations could be severe, with businesses and consumers facing higher prices and supply chain disruptions. Apple is also in the crosshairs, with Trump threatening to impose mega-tariffs on iPhones, potentially up to 25% if they are manufactured in China.

**Trump Announces Plan to Impose 50% Tariff on EU Imports**
US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union, starting from June 1, 2025. Trump stated that the EU has established numerous trade barriers, including a value-added tax, fines for American corporations, non-tariff restrictions, currency manipulation, and 'unjustified lawsuits', resulting in a US trade deficit with the EU of over $250 billion annually. Trump called this 'completely unacceptable'. He emphasized that negotiations with the EU 'are not moving forward', and proposed imposing a 50% tariff on all EU goods, excluding those produced or assembled in the US. Trump said, 'I recommend imposing a direct tariff of 50% on goods from the European Union, starting from June 1, 2025. This tariff will not apply to products manufactured or assembled in the United States.' It is worth noting that EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič is scheduled to have a phone call with his US counterpart, Ambassador James S. Gilmore, on May 23 to assess the progress of tariff negotiations. Trump previously complained on May 12 that the EU is 'worse than China' in terms of bilateral trade prospects. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen expressed doubts about the possibility of quickly reaching a trade agreement with the EU, stating that negotiations are hindered by 'the problem of collective action'.

**Trump Supporter Accused of Insider Trading Before Tariff Exemption Announcement**
A Republican congressman, Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is a supporter of former President Trump, has been accused of buying millions of dollars' worth of stocks just before the announcement of a 90-day tariff exemption. According to the New York Times and Bloomberg, Greene purchased 21 stocks between April 8 and 9, including Amazon, Tesla, Apple, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Blackstone, worth between $21,000 and $315,000. Greene reported the transactions to the House of Representatives, but did not disclose the exact amounts. Trump had announced the 90-day tariff exemption on April 9, and the stock market surged after the announcement. Democrats have called for an investigation into whether Trump's associates engaged in insider trading before the announcement. The New York Times reports that the Manhattan District Attorney, Leticia James, is investigating the possibility of insider trading by Trump administration officials and their associates. However, it is unclear whether this is a full-scale investigation or just an initial inquiry.

**Letitia James reviewing possible insider trading over Trump's tariff pause | Fox News**
New York Attorney General Letitia James is conducting a preliminary review into possible insider trading related to President Donald Trump's April tariff announcement, which triggered a historic stock market rally. Trump had posted on Truth Social, 'BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!' and 'THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.' before announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have raised concerns about possible insider trading and have called for an investigation. James' office has the authority to subpoena witnesses, demand documents, and bring civil or criminal cases without proving intent to defraud. James has a history of challenging Trump in court, having taken on nearly 100 legal challenges against him during his first administration and vowing to continue doing so after his second presidential win. 'We did not expect this result, but we are prepared to respond to this result. And my office has been preparing for several months because we've been here before,' James said following Trump's election win in November 2024.

**US Senators Call for Investigation into Trump's Tariff Exemption Announcement**
US Democratic senators have called for an investigation into whether Donald Trump's team engaged in insider trading before his surprise announcement of a 90-day tariff exemption on September 9. Elizabeth Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, formally requested the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate whether Trump provided information on tariff policies to his wealthy donors or family members. The senators, including Warren, have asked the SEC to investigate whether Trump and his associates broke the law by trading stocks based on inside information before the tariff exemption was announced. This comes after Trump tweeted that it was a 'good time to buy stocks' on the same day he announced the tariff exemption, which led to a 12% surge in the Nasdaq index. The senators have also pointed to a video posted by Trump's communications director, Maggie Martin, which appears to show Trump mentioning his wealthy donors and implying that they made a significant profit from the stock market on the same day. The senators have requested the SEC to investigate whether Trump's associates, including his family, traded stocks based on inside information before the tariff exemption was announced.

**US senators urge insider trading probe into Trump after tariff U-turn sparks market surge**
US senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, have written a letter to the SEC urging an investigation into potential insider trading by Trump and his administration. The senators claim that Trump's announcement of a 90-day suspension of additional tariffs triggered a historic stock market rebound, and that Trump and his family may have had prior knowledge of the tariff pause, allowing them to make stock trades ahead of the announcement. The senators also accuse Trump of market manipulation and insider trading, which could violate the country's security laws. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated, 'Corruption and lawlessness have become a calling card of the Trump administration.' The senators are demanding a probe into the matter, citing concerns over the growing number of ways through which Trump and his family members can monetize the power of the presidency. According to the letter, the SEC should investigate whether the tariff announcements 'enriched administration insiders and friends at the expense of the American public.'

A group of Democratic senators, including Adam Schiff and Mark Kelly, have demanded an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into President Trump's stock trading activities. They claim that Trump's call to buy stocks on April 9, 2025, may have been an insider trading opportunity, as it coincided with a tariff pause announcement that caused a surge in the stock market. The senators alleged that officials and affiliates of Trump may have had advance knowledge of the tariff pause and profited from the market volatility. Schiff stated, 'I am fully cognizant of the fact that the White House is probably the last place to be forthcoming about this or any other corruption in the administration.' The SEC has declined to comment on the matter, and it is unclear whether an investigation will be launched.

**Trump's Tariff Pause Sparks Insider Trading Concerns**
US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause on April 9, but just hours before, he posted on his social media platform Truth Social, saying 'Now is a great time to buy stocks!' and signing off with the initials 'DJT', which some believe may be an insider trading signal. Several senators have called for Congress to investigate Trump for potential insider trading or market manipulation. Trump's post was unusual, as he rarely uses his initials as a signature. The stock price of his media company, which has the ticker symbol 'DJT', surged 22% on April 9 and another 5% on April 10. California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff publicly called for an investigation into potential insider trading by the Trump administration, saying 'Who knew about this before Trump officially announced the tariff pause? Was anyone leaking this information?' House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries also stated that Democrats will launch an investigation to determine if Trump was involved in 'manipulating the stock market'. Representative Steven Horsford questioned whether the tariff pause was related to market manipulation, while US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the tariff pause was 'a long-standing strategy' to provide space for negotiations with allies.

Trump tweeted 'THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!' minutes after the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, and the market rallied shortly after his announcement. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, 'I don't think that it was a coincidence,' and suggested that some members of Congress may have known about the announcement beforehand. AOC and other Democrats have called for House Speaker Mike Johnson to release their trading transactions from April 2-9. Senators Adam Schiff and Ruben Gallego have formally requested an investigation into potential insider trading and federal ethics violations. 'This sequence of events raises grave legal and ethics concerns,' they said. Senator Chris Murphy called the situation 'an enormous scandal' and said, 'This entire White House is one giant grift. Donald Trump and his friends are in power in order to use their access to power to make money. It stinks and we should get to the bottom of it.'

**Trump Accused of Market Manipulation After Tariff Pause Announcement**
US President Donald Trump is being accused of market manipulation after posting a message on his social media platform Truth Social saying 'THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!' just hours before announcing a historic tariff pause, which sent the stock market soaring. The Democrats are calling for an investigation into potential insider trading, while the White House has denied any wrongdoing. Robert Næss, an investment director at Nordea, believes that Trump likely had inside information, but that it would need to be proven that there was unlawful trading to confirm insider trading. 'It is a bad handling of inside information from Trump,' Næss said. 'But it is not insider trading, as long as no one has traded.' Næss pointed out that the New York Stock Exchange is regulated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

**Democrats Seek Probe Into Trump Tariff Announcements As US Markets Sky-Rocket On Wednesday**
President Donald Trump is facing scrutiny over allegations of market manipulation following his recent tariff announcements. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff are calling for a formal investigation into whether Trump's actions were designed to benefit his wealthy donors at the expense of working Americans. Critics argue that Trump's sequence of events, including posting on Truth Social to 'buy' just hours before announcing a 90-day pause on tariffs, could constitute insider trading or market manipulation. Warren and Schiff are pushing for transparency, questioning whether Trump or those close to him profited from advance knowledge of the tariff decision. The White House maintains that Trump's actions were part of his economic strategy, but Democrats remain sceptical, demanding a thorough probe into these allegations. 'The situation has sparked widespread concern among lawmakers and financial experts, with some labelling it a 'pump and dump' scheme.'
