**Famous Psychics Predict Catastrophic Event in 2025**
Four famous psychics, including Baba Vanga, Nostradamus, Athos Salomé, and Nicolas Aujula, have made a chilling prediction that a catastrophic event will occur in 2025. According to Vanga, who is also known as the 'Nostradamus of the Balkans', the event will be a 'fall of humanity' that will devastate the population. Nostradamus, in his book 'Les Prophéties', predicted that the UK will be drawn into a war, stating 'When Europeans see England establish its throne at their feet, there will be cruel wars.' Vanga has also accurately predicted the 9/11 attacks and the death of Princess Diana, as well as a devastating earthquake in Myanmar and Thailand. 'The kingdom will be marked by wars so cruel that internal and external enemies will arise. A great plague from the past returns; no enemy under the sky is more deadly,' Nostradamus wrote.

**King Charles' Canada visit: Throne speech showcases Canada’s 'incredible opportunity' in face of U.S. tensions**
King Charles delivered a historic throne speech in Ottawa, Canada, on May 27, 2025, marking the third time a British monarch has done so. In his speech, he warned that the 'world is a more dangerous and uncertain place than at any point since the Second World War,' and that Canada is facing 'unprecedented' challenges. He praised Canadian values and outlined the Liberals' agenda, while also reaffirming that Canada is well-equipped to tackle the fundamental changes in its economic and security relationship with the United States. King Charles' speech was seen as a 'veiled hit at Trump,' according to constitutional monarchy expert Errol Mendes, who believes the first half of the speech aimed at the state of democracy in the U.S. and put Canada's principles in contrast to 'anti-democratic' trends south of the border. The King's speech also acknowledged the hope for an economic and security agreement with U.S. President Donald Trump. King Charles and Queen Camilla's two-day visit to Canada was significant, with the royal couple attending community events, holding private audiences, and laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The visit was historic, as it was only the third time a British monarch has delivered a throne speech in Canada.

**Canadians welcome King Charles after Trump takeover threats | Borneo Post Online**
King Charles III and Queen Camilla received an enthusiastic welcome from Canadians during their official visit to Canada on May 26, 2025. The visit comes as a response to US President Donald Trump's annexation threats, with Prime Minister Mark Carney saying, 'This historic honour matches the weight of our times.' The royals visited a farmer's market, where they were cheered by thousands of Canadians, and Charles dropped the puck for a street hockey game. Charles will deliver a throne speech outlining the government's priorities, which will be closely watched for any comments on Canada's sovereignty and trade. The visit is seen as a 'momentous and historic occasion' that underscores Canada's identity and sovereignty as a constitutional monarchy. Canadians such as Robert Brown, 64, and Noah Marshall, 24, believe that the visit is a 'subtle form of diplomacy' and a 'once in a lifetime opportunity' to show support for Canada's sovereignty.

**The Powers of London: A Journey Through the Corridors of Power and a Decade of Transformation**
Marco Varvello's new book, 'The Powers of London', explores the symbolic locations of the British capital where the kingdom's future has been shaped. The book narrates the decade that transformed Great Britain, from Brexit to the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, and toward a possible new European phase under the Labour Party. At the heart of the narrative is Keir Starmer, Labour leader and potential future Prime Minister, who has reopened diplomatic channels with Brussels and laid the groundwork for a 'reset' in UK-EU relations. Discussions between London and Brussels have intensified, including new customs agreements, potential UK participation in European programmes, and a partial restoration of freedom of movement for students and workers. Varvello argues that the UK's promise to draw closer to the European Union is not just a strategic issue, but a perspective that directly concerns both Italy and the future of Europe as a whole. The book also reflects on the monarchical transition and the role of the royal family in understanding British identity. As Varvello notes, 'England has never truly stopped looking toward Europe—and now it may do so with renewed awareness.'

**Brits warned migration madness means parts of UK could run out of drinking water**
The UK is facing a drinking water crisis due to record immigration and underinvestment in reservoirs. Shadow Environment Secretary Victoria Atkins blamed Labour for trying to cover up immigration failures, while a Labour source hit back, saying it was the previous Conservative government that let immigration levels skyrocket. Water Minister Emma Hardy has predicted that areas of the country will run out of drinking water by the mid-2030s due to years of underinvestment. Hardy stated, 'Britain is running out of drinking water.' She added, 'We've been in an infrastructure crisis because we haven't built the reservoirs that we need. If we don't take action, we are going to be running out of the drinking water that we need by the mid-2030s.' The government has taken unprecedented action to make reservoir projects nationally significant, allowing for faster planning and construction. Anglian Water is proposing two reservoirs, one in Lincolnshire and one in Cambridgeshire, which would provide enough water for up to 750,000 homes. Water companies across England have committed to bringing nine new reservoirs online by 2050, which would supply an additional 670 million litres of water per day.

**Psychics all warned about one chilling 2025 prophecy**
Four famous psychics, including Baba Vanga, Nostradamus, Athos Salomé, and Nicolas Aujula, have all warned about a chilling event that they say will be taking place in 2025. According to their prophecies, Europe will be rocked by a devastating war, and the UK will be drawn into it. Baba Vanga, who accurately predicted 9/11 and the death of Princess Diana, has forecast that the war will be the start of 'humanity's downfall' that will 'devastate' the population. Nostradamus warned in his book Les Prophéties that the UK will be involved in 'cruel wars' and a 'great pestilence from the past returns, no enemy more deadly under the skies.' Athos Salomé, dubbed the 'Living Nostradamus,' predicted that World War III is imminent and that we are teetering on the edge of it. Nicolas Aujula, a hypnotherapist based in London, agrees that 2025 will be 'a year where there is a lack of compassion in the world' and that we will see 'horrific acts of human evil and violence towards each other.' The prospect of war reaching the UK feels more plausible now than ever before as Vladimir Putin's propagandists have declared that British blood 'must be spilled' in a haunting World War III threat.

**Bond markets are in open revolt. A global reckoning is coming**
The UK government has backed down on the winter fuel allowance, a decision that highlights the difficulty of removing entitlements once granted. This issue is not unique to the UK, as many economies struggle with the demands of the welfare state. The inability to confront harsh realities is concerning, as it may lead to even higher levels of welfare spending. Analysis by the Office for Budget Responsibility suggests that public spending in the UK will rise from 45% to 60% of GDP over the next 50 years, while tax revenues remain static. This could lead to a rapid increase in public debt, reaching 274% of GDP by 2075. Governments worldwide show little appetite to address these pressures due to short electoral cycles.

**Anti-monarchy protest held in London to mark 'Republic Day'**
Anti-monarchy groups gathered in Trafalgar Square, London, to stage a protest on the anniversary of King Charles III's coronation, marking 'Republic Day 2025.' The protest, led by the group Republic, aimed to bring attention to their vision of a 'better, fairer, more democratic Britain.' Protesters held banners and signs with messages such as 'Democracy not monarchy' and 'Not my king,' while a 15-foot dinosaur named Chuck, representing the monarchy, was placed in the square. According to the group, Republic Day is a reminder of the potential for ordinary people to create positive change. 'It is a reminder of what's possible, of the brilliance, ambition and creativity of ordinary people who strive to do an extraordinary thing,' the group said.

**Lisa Nandy says she has changed her mind about abolishing royal family**
Lisa Nandy, a senior Government minister, has changed her mind about abolishing the monarchy. In 2020, during the Labour leadership campaign, she stated she would vote to abolish the monarchy if a ballot was held. However, she has now said that she has changed her mind, citing her close work with the royal family on issues like tackling knife crime and the UK Soft Power Council. Nandy believes that the monarchy, under the Queen and King, has strong public support and that they play a crucial role in delivering benefits to Britain, especially in times of global turmoil. As she stated, 'I think, in principle I believe that people should have the power to decide who rules them. But I think the monarchy under the Queen and under this current King command strong public support.'

**The Role of Monarch in the Political System of the United Kingdom..............................**
The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy, where the monarch, King Charles III, serves as a ceremonial figurehead with limited political power. Despite this, the monarch plays a crucial role in the UK's political system, mainly through constitutional duties, ceremonial functions, and symbolic representation. The monarch retains several constitutional duties, including the royal prerogative, which refers to powers historically held by the monarch but now exercised by government ministers on their behalf. These powers include the declaration of war and signing of treaties, although in practice, these are managed by the Prime Minister and Parliament according to constitutional conventions that prevent the monarch from acting independently.

**‘As international alliances get challenged, the world is keen to see where India stands’**
The BBC World Questions program is coming to Bengaluru, India, on March 4, 2025, to discuss various topics such as economic growth, public services, workers' rights, A.I., and the environment. Jonny Dymond, the program's presenter, said that the program aims to represent the world fairly and that the audience's questions will be a key part of the discussion. He noted that the program has a million moving parts and that the audience's questions will provide a unique perspective on the country's concerns. Dymond also discussed his experience as a royal correspondent for the BBC, where he covered the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the coronation of King Charles III. He noted that the monarchy is not universally loved, but it remains a unifying institution in the UK. Dymond also touched on the growing criticism of the monarchy, particularly regarding its wealth and hereditary status. He noted that while there are complaints about these issues, there is also a lot of misunderstanding about the monarchy's finances and how they are spent. The program will also explore India's role in international relations, particularly in the context of the Ukraine war and the changing dynamics of international alliances. Dymond noted that India's position on these issues is being closely watched and that the program will provide a unique perspective on how Indian leaders think about these issues.

The group describes the monarchy as an 'antiquated relic' and a 'fossil that belongs in the museum.' Republic's chief executive, Graham Smith, said, 'There is growing opposition to the royals, and growing disinterest in them.' He added, 'This is why we're protesting Commonwealth Day on March 10 - to challenge the monarchy here in the UK, and support Commonwealth nations becoming republics.' According to Smith, 'Britain is not a nation of royalists. These continuing protests will keep pushing that message and will embolden a growing movement.'

**David Starkey: ‘I’ve Witnessed the Disintegration of Everything That I Loved in Britain’**
Historian Dr. David Starkey believes that Britain is 'fading into irrelevance' due to its elite's actions. He argues that the monarchy is 'woke' and that the late Queen prioritized the Commonwealth over British interests. Starkey also criticizes the current state of free speech, citing the cancellation of his own career in 2020 after he made comments about slavery. He believes that the world has become 'mad' and that the establishment has imposed censorship through laws and social media. Starkey proposes a 'cultural restoration' to revive British identity and culture, and sees Elon Musk as a 'genuinely world-historic figure' who is trying to avoid the mistakes of the past. He also notes that the monarchy has lost its function and that the Royal family projects a 'drippy cosmopolitanism'.

**Donald Trump could make UK the 51st US state and King Charles 'would not be safe'**
Donald Trump has expressed interest in expanding the United States, and some speculate that he could consider making the UK the 51st US state. According to an AI software, Grok, owned by Elon Musk, a Trump-run UK would likely involve dissolving the monarchy, overhauling the legal and judicial systems, implementing US-style economic policies, cultural and educational reforms, and security and defense integration. However, Grok warns that these actions would face significant opposition and logistical challenges, making this scenario a 'thought experiment' rather than a realistic possibility. 'These actions would meet with tremendous opposition, legal challenges, and would likely be seen as an unconstitutional overreach by both UK citizens and international observers,' Grok said. 'The actual implementation would face countless logistical, cultural, and political obstacles.'

**King Charles III's Health Deteriorates, Prince William Prepares to Assume the Throne**
King Charles III's health is deteriorating, and sources in the UK suggest that his illness is in a terminal stage. Prince William and Kate Middleton have begun a more rigorous process of preparation to assume the leadership of the UK. According to sources close to the royal family, the transition of power could occur as early as 2026. Meanwhile, the heir and his wife have intensified their training in diplomacy, government, and royal protocol, which will allow them to assume their future responsibilities with a solid foundation. King Charles III is experiencing frequent dizziness and episodes of fainting, and his medical team is keeping him under constant supervision. Due to his age and medical history, specialists have noted that aggressive treatment could represent additional risks, complicating the situation further. If Prince William were to ascend to the throne, the line of succession to the British monarchy would undergo significant changes. His eldest son, Prince George, would take the first place as heir, followed by his siblings, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. Prince Harry, despite his distance from the royal family, would remain in the line of succession to the throne. His children, Archie and Lilibet, would also be included in the list, although with little chance of having an active role in the British monarchy.
