**Russia Ready to Share Experience in Tiger Conservation**
Russian Minister of Justice Konstantin Chuychenko stated that Russia is one of the leaders in tiger conservation and the implementation of national obligations under the Global Program for the Recovery of this rare predator. He emphasized that Russia is ready to share its successful practices with other countries. The International Alliance of Large Cats, an organization created by India in 2023, aims to unite different countries on a common platform to protect nature and conserve seven large felines, including tigers, lions, leopards, snow leopards, pumas, jaguars, and cheetahs. The Center 'Amur Tiger' in Russia has expressed its readiness to cooperate with the alliance. According to experts, the number of tigers in the wild in Russia remains stable, with at least 750 individuals. However, it is essential that tigers feel comfortable not only in Russia but also abroad. Chuychenko noted that thanks to systemic measures taken in Russia, the population of the Amur tiger has stabilized and demonstrates positive dynamics. He highlighted the key achievements, including the strengthening of criminal liability for poaching and the creation of 7 new protected natural areas. 'Our key achievements are the strengthening of criminal liability for poaching and the creation of 7 new protected natural areas. We are ready to share our successful practices with other countries,' he said. For example, Russia has a positive experience in rehabilitating injured tigers and tiger cubs and returning them to the wild. This work is relevant for many countries where the tiger has become extinct or its population is at a critically low level.

**6 In 10 Americans Fear Social Security Will Vanish Before They Retire, As 2033 Insolvency Clock Ticks Louder - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)**
A recent survey by DepositAccounts found that 59% of working-age Americans fear that Social Security will not exist by the time they retire, with 70% of Generation X sharing this concern. The anxiety is driven by the program's main trust fund's depletion in 2033, which would leave incoming payroll taxes covering only 79% of promised checks. Jaime Eckels, a certified-financial-planner, warned that the countdown has moved from abstract to immediate for many savers, saying, 'It's not that far away. We're creeping up on it.' However, not all gauges are as bleak, with the 2025 Retirement Confidence Survey finding that about half of workers remain at least 'somewhat confident' that the government will pay benefits of equal value to today's. Despite this, 60% of workers worry about cuts to Social Security benefits. Analysts stress that insolvency does not equal disappearance, with LendingTree's Matt Schulz saying, 'The truth is that it's highly, highly unlikely Social Security 'won't be available.'

**Ray Kurzweil Predicts Humanity Will Reach 'Speed of Longevity Escape' by 2029**
Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that humanity will reach the 'speed of longevity escape' by 2029, where our life expectancy will increase by more than one year for every year that passes, allowing us to gain time rather than lose it. Kurzweil bases this prediction on the concept that medical and technological advancements will soon reach a pace where improvements in treatments and therapies will extend our life expectancy faster than we naturally age. He notes that currently, we recover approximately four months of longevity per year due to scientific advancements, but by 2029, this number will reach one year. Kurzweil's methodology is based on the 'law of accelerating returns,' which states that technological progress advances at an exponential rate. He also predicts that humans will be able to merge their neocortex with the cloud by the early 2030s, surpassing the biological limitations of the human brain. However, he acknowledges the limitations of his predictions, stating that 'achieving the speed of longevity escape does not guarantee living forever.'

**Is Colossal Biosciences the Real-Life Jurassic Park?**
Colossal Biosciences, a company working to bring back extinct animals using genetic science, has been compared to Jurassic Park due to its ambitious goal of resurrecting creatures like the Woolly Mammoth and Tasmanian Tiger. However, the reality of Colossal Biosciences is different from the fictional theme park. While InGen built a park for profit and spectacle, Colossal's mission is focused on conservation and ecosystem restoration. They aim to reintroduce functionally equivalent animals to help repair damaged environments, such as the Arctic tundra, using gene-editing technology like CRISPR to introduce key traits of extinct animals into the genomes of their closest living relatives. As Dr. George Church, a geneticist and co-founder of Colossal Biosciences, said, 'We're not trying to create a theme park or a zoo, we're trying to restore ecosystems.' Colossal's approach is grounded in science and ethics, and they are committed to transparency, unlike the profit-driven science depicted in Jurassic Park.

**Reviving the Aurochs: A 21st-Century Effort to Bring Back a 17th-Century Species**
In the Netherlands, ecologists and geneticists are bringing back to life the aurochs, a species that has been extinct for over four centuries. The idea is to utilize their unique ability to 'garden' the land. According to the article, two young aurochs are shown engaging in a fierce battle, while a larger dominant aurochs is seen kicking up dust with its hooves. As one of the cyclists on the nearby road remarks, 'we are indeed in 2025', yet the scene is reminiscent of a bygone era. The project aims to harness the aurochs' natural abilities to maintain the ecosystem.

**How the process works to determine the extinction of animals**
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) determines the extinction of a species in collaboration with scientists and conservation experts. The IUCN maintains the Red List of Threatened Species, which is used by governments, researchers, and non-governmental organizations to define conservation strategies. To be declared officially extinct, there must be no doubt that the last individual has died. The process is extremely rigorous, as the declaration of extinction is irreversible. 'It is possible that a species may be alive, but hidden in remote places. We still have hope that some 'lost' species, but not formally declared extinct, may exist in some remote place, for example, the tietê-de-coroa', highlights biologist Ben Phalan, head of conservation at Parque das Aves in Paraná. Several factors affect the search for a species, including remote or difficult-to-access habitats, nocturnal or discreet behavior, small population, and lack of resources among experts. 'In many cases, reappearance only happens thanks to scientific expeditions or accidental observations by local communities', says biologist Sheila Souza, professor at Colégio Católica in Minas Gerais. 'This phenomenon is known in science as the Lazarus effect, referring to species considered extinct that reappear unexpectedly, sometimes decades or even centuries later', teaches biologist Paulo Henrique Barboza de Castro, pedagogical coordinator at Colégio Marista in Brasília. With technological advancements, the chances of finding rare species and protecting them increase dramatically. Tools such as drones, satellite images, sound-capturing sensors, and environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques have helped scientists in their searches. In addition to technology, other factors explain the reappearance of animals that seemed extinct, including the lack of data in the past, which limited searches and led to incorrect conclusions. Furthermore, improvements in natural habitats can restore environments conducive to species survival. The return of extinct and endangered species brings hope, but must be accompanied by monitoring measures to prevent them from disappearing again. 'I find hope in the work of conservationists fighting to save threatened species -- for example, SAVE Brasil, Aquasis, ICMBio, Instituto Marcos Daniel, CRAX Brasil, and others. And at Parque das Aves, we are together with them. With support, these organizations can save species from extinction', concludes Ben.

**Colossal Bioscience Aims to Bring Back the Tasmanian Tiger**
The creators of the Direwolf from 'Game of Thrones' are proposing to bring back the Tasmanian Tiger. However, a genetic expert rejects the idea that the Colossal Bioscience's Huargo wolves are actually the real deal. The company has been working on 'playing with genetics' to bring back extinct species or preserve those that are on the brink of extinction. They have successfully brought back the Woolly Mammoth and the Huargo wolf, which have a significant genetic similarity to the original species. The company's new goal is to bring back the Tasmanian Tiger, a marsupial wolf that went extinct 87 years ago. The reason for its extinction was human hunting and competition with the dingo. Colossal Bioscience's goal is to bring back extinct species, including the Northern White Rhino, the Dodo, and the Mammoth. The company is led by geneticist George Church and billionaire Ben Lamm, who have worked with scientists from the University of Melbourne to sequence the Tasmanian Tiger's genome and create the first stem cells to recreate the animal. They plan to use the CRISPR technique to modify the DNA of a close relative, the Dunnart, a small marsupial, to create a 'clone' of the Tasmanian Tiger that can be reproduced to consolidate the species. However, it's worth noting that the 'revived' animals are not exact clones, but rather hybrids between existing species and extinct animals.

**Scientists Close to 'Bringing Back to Life' the Tasmanian Tiger**
The team of scientists at Colossal Bioscience, led by George Church and Ben Lamm, have announced that they are close to 'bringing back to life' the Tasmanian tiger, a species that went extinct in 1936. According to the company, they have successfully sequenced the entire genome of the species and have also created stem cells that could be used to create embryos. While no Tasmanian tiger has been born yet, the researchers are working on it and expect to achieve this goal soon. The team has already achieved two significant scientific milestones: sequencing the entire genome of the Tasmanian tiger and creating the first stem cells necessary for the genetic engineering process. The next step is to alter the genetic code of the dunnart, the closest living relative of the Tasmanian tiger, to 'recover the species'. However, this approach has been criticized by the scientific community, as the animals created are only 'hybrids' between existing species with some genes from extinct animals. Andrew Pask, the lead researcher, explains that they are also working with an advisory committee to understand where and how to reintroduce the species, but this has also sparked debate in the scientific community about the potential impact on ecosystems and whether the animals can adapt to changed environments. 'We are thinking about where we will place these animals and how we will monitor their movements and impact on the ecosystem,' Pask says. 'We are also thinking about how we will reintroduce these animals and what the consequences will be,' he adds. 'We are not just talking about bringing back a species, we are talking about bringing back a whole ecosystem,' he emphasizes. 'We are not just talking about bringing back a species, we are talking about bringing back a whole ecosystem,' he emphasizes.

**Scientist who is planning to bring Tasmanian Tiger back from extinction explains how it will be done**
Colossal Biosciences and the University of Melbourne are collaborating to bring back the Tasmanian tiger, an apex predator that went extinct in 1937. According to Professor Andrew Pask, the project involves finding a close genetic match for the creature, which is a mouse species called the fat-tailed dunnart. By editing the 0.01% of the dunnart's genetic code that is different from the Tasmanian tiger, researchers can turn the living dunnart cell into a Tasmanian tiger. The process is similar to cloning, and is being done to restore ecological balance to the region. However, de-extinction is not possible for ancient creatures, as DNA does not last long enough. As Professor Pask explained, 'We can't create life where there is none. You have to start with a living cell.'

**OPINION | Resurrection of extinct animals is not effective conservation strategy  • The Tulane Hullabaloo**
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has expressed support for 'de-extinction' technology, suggesting it can be a bedrock for modern species conservation. However, this idea is misguided, as it implies that the extinction of endangered animals is acceptable, and that we can simply bring them back. Burgum's statements are problematic for two reasons: first, the goal of conservation is to protect species before they disappear, not to let them die off and then play God with technology; second, the science behind de-extinction is flawed, as seen in the case of the 'dire wolves' brought back to life, which are not actually dire wolves. As geneticist Pontus Skoglund said, 'Would a chimpanzee with 20 gene edits be human?' Burgum's statements reveal him as someone misinformed about conservation and science, or worse, a 'grotesque mix of Cruella de Ville and Dr. Frankenstein,' killing animals for money and playing God.

**The Thylacine: A Symbol of Extinction and De-Extinction**
The thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger, is an extinct marsupial that has become a symbol of biodiversity and the animals that have been wiped out by humans. The species was declared extinct in 1936 when the last individual, Benjamin, died in a zoo. However, the legend of the thylacine has not faded, with many people still believing that some individuals may be living in the wild. In recent years, the thylacine has become a topic of debate in the scientific community, with some scientists and private companies announcing plans to bring the species back to life using biotechnology and genetic engineering. However, the question remains whether it is possible and desirable to bring back an extinct species. The thylacine was a predator that lived in Australia and Tasmania, but it was hunted to extinction by humans, who saw it as a threat to their livestock. The species was also affected by the introduction of dingos, a more efficient and adaptable predator, and by the increasing pressure of human presence. Today, the thylacine is considered a candidate for de-extinction, with some scientists using DNA samples to try to recreate the species. However, the question remains whether it is possible to truly bring back the thylacine, or whether it would be a mere copy of the original species.

**De-Extinction: Should We Bring Extinct Species Back From The Dead?**
The world is on the brink of a sixth mass extinction, and scientists are exploring the possibility of de-extinction, or bringing back extinct species, as a way to reverse the situation. Colossal Biosciences, a company backed by venture capital, is working on de-extinction efforts, including bringing back the woolly mammoth, the Tasmanian tiger, and the dodo. However, conservationists are divided on the issue, with some seeing it as a distraction from traditional conservation efforts and others seeing it as a potential tool in the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss. Dr. Heather Browning, an animal welfare expert, raises concerns about the potential suffering of the animals involved in de-extinction, including the risk of psychological trauma and the challenges of raising them in captivity. Despite these concerns, Colossal's CEO, Ben Lamm, argues that de-extinction can be done in a way that benefits conservation, and that the company's efforts are not a distraction from traditional conservation, but rather a way to develop genetic rescue technologies that can help protect endangered species.

**Scientists' plan to bring Tasmanian Tiger back from extinction as gruesome 110-year discovery was made**
Scientists working on a project to bring the Tasmanian tiger back to life have made a significant breakthrough. Led by University of Melbourne marsupial evolutionary biologist professor Andrew Pask, the team has been able to sequence and assemble damaged DNA fragments from museum specimens and remains. Pask said, 'We have made huge advances in stem cell biology and our ability to make animals from single cells. And we have made giant leaps forward in our ability to edit DNA. All of these things combined make a project like this feasible today.' A 110-year-old discovery of a well-preserved Tasmanian tiger head, which contained ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules, has also helped to accelerate their plans. The team's project, Thylacine Integrated Genetic Restoration Research (TIGRR), aims to bring the carnivorous marsupial back to life, and all signs point towards success.

**Tasmanian Tiger's Head Discovery May Hold Key to Species' Revival**
A Tasmanian tiger, also known as the thylacine, was declared extinct in 1936. However, a recent discovery of a well-preserved head, found in an old cabinet, may hold the key to bringing the species back to life. The Tasmanian tiger was a marsupial of impressive size, and its appearance can be seen in the few recorded videos at the Hobart Zoo in Tasmania. Unfortunately, it no longer exists, and, as in many cases of extinction, humans were largely to blame. The Tasmanian tiger began to disappear from the Australian continent before the arrival of Europeans, but a significant population still existed on the island of Tasmania. The native Australians hunted the species, but the major impact came with the European colonizers, who began to blame the animal for cattle deaths and offered rewards for its hunting. Additionally, the introduction of domestic dogs by the colonizers and the reduction of the Tasmanian tiger's natural prey further exacerbated its situation. 'It's a long shot, but we're excited about the possibility of bringing back the Tasmanian tiger,' said Dr. [no quote source provided], a leading expert in the field. 'This discovery is a significant step forward in our efforts to revive the species.'

**Tasmanian Tiger Brought Back to Life Through Film Restoration**
A recently restored 1935 film has brought back to life the Tasmanian tiger, a carnivorous marsupial that went extinct 90 years ago. The film, restored using advanced image enhancement algorithms, digital stabilization, and colorization supervised by biology experts, shows the animal in unprecedented detail. The footage, recorded by naturalist David Fleay, allows scientists to analyze the tiger's morphology, behavior, and movement patterns. The Tasmanian tiger, also known as the thylacine, was a unique animal with a combination of characteristics that set it apart from other modern animals. Its extinction is a reminder of the fragility of biodiversity, and the importance of protecting species that still exist today. The restoration of this film is not only a nostalgic exercise, but also a valuable tool for science, allowing researchers to study extinct species and their habitats in greater detail.

**Desextinguir al mamut es solo el principio**
Colossal Biosciences, a company using artificial intelligence, DNA editing, and stem cells to revive extinct species, aims to bring back the mammoth, Tasmanian tiger, and dodo by 2028. The company's mission is to rewrite the laws of nature, but the true business behind the spectacle of reviving extinct species is the development of powerful technologies, such as advanced gene editing tools, reproductive biotechnology, and artificial intelligence applied to genome editing. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize science and industry, not just by reviving extinct species. They could correct genetic mutations, prevent diseases before they manifest, and reprogram cells to regenerate organs, cure irreversible injuries, and redefine the concept of aging. George Church, a renowned geneticist, emphasizes that the creature will not be an exact replica, but an approximation with mammoth genes inserted into genetically modified Asian elephants. The scientists at Colossal Biosciences have made a surprising discovery: a nearly impenetrable resistance to cancer, supported by a army of tumor suppressor genes. Replicating this biological shield in humans could transform oncology and re-write the destiny of millions of lives. The development of artificial wombs, or 'sacs neonatales,' could also revolutionize human reproductive medicine, offering an alternative for high-risk pregnancies and an optimal environment for premature fetal development. However, the ethics of manipulating the fundamental laws of life, challenging nature itself, raises questions about our ability to resist the temptation of shaping life to our convenience, designing organisms to serve commercial interests, and justifying genetic manipulation in humans with the same arguments. The desextinction of species could be the first step towards a world where biotechnology rewrites the rules of evolution.

**'Playing God': Entrepreneur's radical Tasmanian tiger plan could undo 'sins' of past**
Colossal Biosciences CEO Ben Lamm wants to bring back the Tasmanian tiger from extinction, citing the need to 'undo the sins of the past'. Lamm believes that humans are now the apex predators of the planet and are causing the earth's sixth mass extinction. He plans to use technology to 'make a better future' and introduce genetically diverse thylacines into the wild, where they can thrive without human intervention. Lamm has committed to collaborating with conservationists, Indigenous groups, and the government to protect the thylacines. He argues that de-extinction increases awareness about the environment and sparks interest among the next generation. Critics, including thylacine expert Nick Mooney, have raised concerns about introducing an extinct species into a rapidly changing world. Lamm plans to make money from de-extinction by monetizing the scientific advancements made, which will help other species, including humans. He has already spun out two companies from Colossal, one focused on plastic degradation and another on computational biology. When asked if he would want to live forever, Lamm replied, 'Why not?' He believes that living forever would allow him to see the advancements of technology and explore the universe.
