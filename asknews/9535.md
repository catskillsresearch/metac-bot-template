**Xi Jinping could save America with a simple ad | Notice**
Matt Robison suggests that Xi Jinping could save America by announcing that China will be the first nation to win a human on Mars within the next ten years. This would spark a new space race and motivate the US to invest in space exploration, potentially leading to a boost in the US economy and a renewed sense of national pride. Robison argues that this kind of competition is exactly what America needs, and that China needs it too. He notes that two-thirds of Americans, including 80% of Republicans, already support the idea of maintaining a technological edge over China in artificial intelligence. Robison concludes that a simple announcement from Xi Jinping could be the kick that America needs to get back on track.

**New AI Tool Predicts Postpartum Depression Risk**
Researchers in the United States have developed a new tool based on artificial intelligence (AI) that can predict, in advance, which people are more likely to develop postpartum depression. The discovery, published this week in the American Journal of Psychiatry and reported by Nature, could revolutionize mental health care in the postnatal period. Postpartum depression is a mental health condition that affects around 17% of people who give birth worldwide. Unlike the 'baby blues', a mild and temporary sadness common in the first days after birth, postpartum depression is more intense and lasting. Symptoms include deep sadness, anxiety, loss of interest in daily activities, and difficulty connecting with the baby. The condition can occur up to a year after birth and affects not only the mother but also the baby's development and family well-being. The research team used data from over 29,000 mothers who gave birth in the United States between 2017 and 2022. The machine learning model was trained with electronic medical records and mental health screening results from that period. The goal is to help hospitals identify, in a preventive manner, which parents and mothers can benefit from emotional support and psychological follow-up shortly after the baby's birth. The system excluded from analysis people who already had a recent history of depression, a group already recognized as high-risk. Thus, the AI showed effectiveness: among those classified as high-risk, 30% developed the condition - a rate three times higher than the overall average of the sample. According to the scientists, the value of the tool lies in its ability to anticipate critical situations and offer support before symptoms worsen. 'If we know that someone is at higher risk, we can try to develop strategies to help prevent depression,' explains psychiatrist Roy Perlis, from Mass General Brigham Hospital in Boston, co-author of the study. Among the suggested actions are specific therapies and stress management techniques.

**Turkey Aims to be First to Send Two Exploration Vehicles to Moon's South Pole**
Turkey aims to be the first country to send two exploration vehicles to the Moon's south pole simultaneously. The 'CHERI' vehicles, developed by ODTÜ ROMER researchers, will land on the Moon's surface in 2028 as part of China's Chang'e-8 mission. They will create a 3D map of the surface using artificial intelligence, despite the harsh conditions. ODTÜ Aviation and Space Engineering Department Professor Dr. Halil Ersin Söken said, 'Currently, there are 5 countries that can send rovers to the Moon. We aim to be the 6th country to successfully complete this mission and the first to operate two rovers simultaneously on the Moon's surface.' Rektor Prof. Dr. Ahmet Yozgatlıgil added, 'This project will enable us to establish Turkey's presence on the Moon's surface in 2028.' Meanwhile, the Turkish government has announced several other initiatives, including the digital transformation of tapu and kadastro processes, which will reduce processing times to seconds. Additionally, the Diyanet has issued a warning that kurban animals sacrificed before the Bayram namazı are invalid. The Turkish Parliament will also convene this week to elect a new Speaker and discuss the 10th Yargı Paketi. Furthermore, the government has introduced a new regulation requiring musicians and instrumentalists to obtain a professional license, and there has been an increase in interest in camping and caravaning ahead of the summer season and Bayram holiday.

**Scientists Create First 3D Model of Human Amniotic Sac, Unlocking Secrets of Early Development**
Researchers at the Francis Crick Institute have created the first 3D model of the human amniotic sac, a crucial step in understanding early human development. The model, called the 'amnioid postgastrulational' (PGA), was developed from human embryonic stem cells exposed to two chemical signals for 48 hours. The cells organized into internal and external layers, similar to those of the human amnios. The PGA model formed a sac-like structure in over 90% of cases, which continued to develop autonomously for three months. The researchers discovered that the amnios, traditionally seen as a protective element, may have a more active role in embryonic development. They found that the GATA3 gene is essential for the growth of amniotic tissue, and its absence hindered the development of the sac. The study also showed that the amniotic sac could send chemical signals that influence embryonic development. This breakthrough opens up new possibilities in regenerative medicine, allowing for the creation of personalized amniotic membranes from a patient's own cells, reducing the need for donations and increasing the effectiveness of cell therapies.

**Experts call for escalation of AI tool to improve health outcomes - THE AUTHORITY NEWS**
Experts in the health sector have called for the escalation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool in other health programs like malaria and Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (RMNCH) to strengthen health initiatives and improve health outcomes. They commended the Institute of Human Virology Nigeria for its ground-breaking impact of the use of AI in the fight against Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV in Nigeria. Dr. Adebobola Bashorun suggested a more centralised government approach to facilitate rapid scale-up and scale-out of the AI solution. Dr. Emmanuel Vincent explained that the AI platform was adopted across 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, reaching over 5,300 healthcare facilities. The platform has driven unprecedented improvements in efficiency, accountability, and coordination of the national TB/HIV response, with 65% reduction in performance standards, 100% compliance, and 11,307 supervision and mentorship engagements tracked. Dr. Jerome Mafeni added that 'This is about building a culture of performance.'

**Bioethics: The Italian Law on Medically Assisted Procreation Under Attack**
The Italian law on medically assisted procreation (PMA) has been subject to intense opposition since its introduction. The law aimed to protect the fundamental values of human life and the family, but the judiciary has been gradually dismantling it. The Corte Costituzionale has issued 12 rulings since 2006, some of which have introduced significant changes. The 2009 ruling (n. 151) allowed for the production of surplus embryos and their freezing, while the 2015 ruling (n. 96) permitted access to assisted reproduction for couples with genetic diseases. The 2015 ruling (n. 229) lifted the ban on eugenic embryo selection, and the 2014 ruling (n. 162) recognized the 'right to a child' as 'incoercible'. The 2025 ruling (n. 68) granted parental status to the 'intentional mother' who consented to the in vitro conception of a child carried and born by her partner. The article argues that the cultural push to prioritize individual will over traditional family values is concerning, and that the complementarity of masculinity and femininity is essential for child growth and care.

**AI in Assisted Reproduction: A 7% Reduction in Conception Time**
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in assisted reproduction has revolutionized the selection of eggs, sperm, and embryos, allowing for a 7% reduction in the time needed to conceive a child, according to a study led by researchers at IVI Valencia. The study, presented at the 11th International Congress IVIRMA, found that applying AI to embryo selection also increases the pregnancy rate by 5% and up to 7% in multiple attempts. 'AI is a reality in assisted reproduction and is giving great results in research and clinical practice,' said Juan Antonio García Velasco, scientific director of the congress and IVIRMA. 'We are talking about distinguishing the spermatozoid with the highest capacity to fertilize the ovocyte and give rise to an embryo, as well as identifying the best quality eggs, which undoubtedly contribute positively to achieving better success rates, reducing time and increasing pregnancy rates.' The AI also shows promising uses in personalizing fertility treatments, providing women with information on the expected number of eggs and the best day to visit the clinic, reducing unnecessary visits. However, beyond AI, the IVIRMA Congress has also presented advances in genetics, stem cell biology, and tissue engineering. Dr. Antonio Capalbo, responsible for genomics at IVIRMA Global Research Alliance, presented a study suggesting that sequencing the complete genome of embryos before implantation could identify not only major chromosomal abnormalities but also subtle variations that may compromise their development and future severe diseases in offspring. 'With current genetic tests (such as trophoblast biopsies), approximately half of the embryos considered normal do not implant in the endometrium, and another 10% end in spontaneous abortion,' Capalbo explained. However, the specialist admitted that more studies are needed to evaluate the impact and how to manage the new genomic information obtained before applying complete genome sequencing of embryos in clinics.

**First Baby Born Using Fully Automated and Digitally Controlled ICSI System**
Conceivable Life Sciences, a biotechnology company, has announced the birth of the first baby conceived using their fully automated and digitally controlled IntraCytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) system. According to an article published in Reproductive Biomedicine Online, the system combines artificial intelligence and robotics to automate over 200 steps necessary for creating embryos for in vitro fertilization (IVF). The workstation automates each of the 23 steps of the standard ICSI procedure. Jacques Cohen, an embryologist at Conceivable, noted that the phases of ICSI can be controlled using artificial intelligence or a remote operator. In this case, the scientists used AI to position the sperm in the injection pipette and direct the microinjection inside the egg. 'The AI system selects the sperm autonomously and immobilizes its central part with precision using a laser ready for injection,' explained Gerardo Mendizabal-Ruiz, chief engineer of the company. The birth reported in the study occurred from a 40-year-old woman who was directed to the treatment with donor eggs at Hope IVF Mexico in Guadalajara, Mexico, after a previous IVF attempt failed, producing only one mature egg and no embryos. In the study cycle, five eggs were assigned to fertilization with automated ICSI and three as controls with standard manual ICSI. The automated system was installed on site, but later remote operators, at the clinic in Guadalajara and in New York, issued commands through a digital interface to perform each of the 23 microinjection steps for each egg, totaling 115 steps. Four of the five eggs injected into the automated system achieved normal fertilization, as did all three in the manual control group. A high-quality embryo that reached the blastocyst stage in culture was generated with the automated system under remote control from New York. When this blastocyst was transferred in a subsequent cycle, a pregnancy was initiated that progressed normally until the birth of a healthy male baby. The treatment was provided under the supervision of the review committee at Hope IVF, a fertility clinic in Guadalajara, as part of a pilot study on various automation processes in the fertility laboratory. As evidence of the interest in using AI in artificial reproduction, Conceivable collected $18 million in a funding round led by Artis Ventures with the participation of several new investors at the beginning of this year. 'It was a great day,' said the woman, 'and I'm grateful for this technology that has given me the opportunity to have a child.'

**New Hope: First Child Born Using Fully Automated AI-Supported IVF Technique**
A team of scientists has announced the birth of the first child using a fully automated artificial intelligence-supported in vitro fertilization (IVF) technique. This breakthrough represents a significant leap in assisted reproduction, where the research team from Conceivable Life Sciences, a company based in New York and Guadalajara, Mexico, successfully automated the microinjection process. Traditionally, microinjection was performed manually by an embryologist using a needle to inject a single sperm into a mature egg. However, with the new technology, artificial intelligence and advanced robots were used to automate all 23 stages of microinjection, eliminating the need for direct human intervention. The new system developed by the research team not only controls the microinjection process but also uses laser beams to accurately guide the selected sperm to the egg, surpassing human capabilities. Dr. Jack Cohen, one of the scientists involved in the experiment, described automation as a 'game-changer' that can increase the accuracy and efficiency of IVF procedures and ensure consistent results. The experiment was conducted on a woman in her 40s who had previously failed a previous attempt at artificial insemination. In this experiment, five eggs were fertilized using the automated system, compared to three eggs fertilized using the traditional method. The results were impressive, with four of the eggs that underwent automated fertilization developing normally, and one embryo formed through automated microinjection was selected from a distance of 2,300 miles. The embryo was then frozen and later transferred to the womb, resulting in the birth of a healthy and normal child. The scientists say that this experiment represents a beginning of a trial phase, but they expect future improvements to increase the speed of procedures, paving the way for increased application of this technology in the future.

**First Baby Born Using Fully Automated ICSI Procedure**
A biotechnology company, Conceivable Life Sciences, has developed a robotic system that can perform all 23 stages of the intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedure in an automated manner. This approach reduces the risk of human error in such procedures. The system uses artificial intelligence to select the healthiest sperm for fertilization based on their appearance, and then injects them into the egg in a laboratory setting. The company tested the system with a childless couple from Mexico, where the man had low sperm motility and the woman had problems producing eggs, and they used donor eggs. The system successfully fertilized four embryos, and one of them led to a healthy baby boy born at 38 weeks. The procedure took around 10 minutes, with the operator controlling it remotely from 3700 km away. The authors of the study note that this approach does not necessarily produce healthier embryos than traditional ICSI, and more research is needed to confirm the results.

**World's First Baby Born Using AI-Assisted IVF Technology**
The first baby in the world has been born using AI-assisted IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) technology. According to reports, the AI system has replaced the traditional manual process of Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) in IVF, where a sperm is directly injected into an egg. The new process uses AI or remote digital control to complete all 23 steps of the ICSI procedure without human intervention. In a fertility clinic in the US, AI technology was used to select the best embryo, and the AI-selected embryo was then implanted into a woman's uterus, resulting in a successful pregnancy and the birth of a healthy baby. AI has helped in selecting the right embryo, which is a challenging task for doctors. The AI algorithm analyzed microscopic images to select the best embryo, which is a difficult task for any doctor to do by eye. The AI technology has also improved the success rate of IVF by scoring the embryo's growth, cell division speed, and other biological signals. This has made the process easier and more efficient. Experts say that IVF is often a costly and exhausting process, but AI can help make it faster and more accurate, saving time and money.

**Weâre All Eugenicists Now**
The author argues that eugenics is no longer a taboo topic, citing the New York Times' article 'Should Human Life be Optimized?' which discussed the use of embryo selection to ensure children get the best genetic start in life. A survey from Harvard Medical School found that 24% of people approve and 13% strongly approve of screening embryos for positive traits such as intelligence. The author also mentions in-vitro gametogenesis, a technology that could increase the chances of having a genius baby or an Olympic gold medalist. The author believes that eugenics improves people, just as selective breeding improves plants and animals, and that it's time for the country to return to common sense. They argue that the fear of eugenics has been driven by the fear of acknowledging genetic differences between races, and that it's time to step out of the 'deliberate ignorance' of the past.

**The Rise of Pronatalists in the US: Selecting Children Based on Genetic Traits**
The Collins family claims to have used a special technology during their in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure to screen their embryos for traits such as intelligence. They stated, 'Research allows us to know our genetic predisposition to IQ, -- they said in 2023 to an undercover reporter. -- We would never choose a child who is less gifted in terms of IQ than we are'. The Collins family is part of the growing movement of 'pronatalists' in the US, who are seeking support from former President Trump. According to the Collins, they used this technology to select embryos with higher IQs, showing a growing trend of selecting children based on genetic traits.

**Artificial Intelligence Revolutionizes IVF Treatment: An Interview with Dr. Seval Taşdemir**
Dr. Seval Taşdemir, a specialist in obstetrics and IVF, discussed the latest developments in IVF treatment, including the use of artificial intelligence in embryo selection, the importance of genetic testing, and the importance of timely medical checks for couples trying to conceive. According to Dr. Taşdemir, artificial intelligence has greatly benefited IVF treatment, allowing for easier selection of embryos with high fertility and healthy genetic makeup. 'We can now more easily select embryos with high fertility and a strong genetic makeup,' she said. Dr. Taşdemir emphasized the importance of genetic testing in ensuring a healthy pregnancy process, stating that 'we now have the ability to analyze the genetic makeup of the embryo and determine whether it is healthy or not.' She also stressed the importance of timely medical checks for couples trying to conceive, saying that 'women tend to become mothers at an older age, but their egg reserves decrease, so we aim to develop 10-15 eggs using the 'pooling' method.'

**Trump's IVF Decree: A New Form of Eugenics?**
US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at improving access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) for Americans. However, the normalization of selecting embryos for IVF based on their genetic heritage could lead to a new form of eugenics. The US has a history of eugenics, including forced sterilization of people deemed 'inferior' and the promotion of 'better babies' and 'fitter families.' The use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in IVF has also raised concerns about the potential for designer babies. A survey found that 28% of Americans would consider having a genetically modified child to increase their child's chances of getting into top universities, and 38% would consider selecting embryos based on their IQ. The IVF industry in the US is a lucrative business, with a market value of $5.28 billion in 2023 and expected to reach $7.24 billion by 2030. However, the facilitation of access to IVF could lead to an increase in the demand for gametes and gestational carriers, exacerbating the risks of commodification and exploitation.
