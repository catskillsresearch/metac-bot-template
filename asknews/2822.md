**Neuralink competitor Paradromics completes first human implant**
Neurotech startup Paradromics has successfully implanted its brain-computer interface (BCI) in a human for the first time. The procedure, which took place at the University of Michigan, demonstrated that the company's system can be safely implanted and record neural activity. Paradromics plans to kick off a clinical trial later this year to study the long-term safety and use of its technology in humans. According to CEO Matt Angle, 'We've shown in sheep that our device is best in class from a data and longevity standpoint, and now we've also shown that it's compatible with humans.' The company's BCI, called the Connexus Brain-Computer Interface, will initially help patients with severe motor impairments such as paralysis speak through a computer. Paradromics has raised nearly $100 million and has a strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia's Neom. 'The last demonstration stuff has been shown, and we're really excited about the clinical trial that's coming up,' Angle said.

**Scientists: Uploading the Human Mind onto a Chip May be Possible within 20 Years**
Scientists believe that it may be possible to 'download' a human being in its entirety onto a chip within the next 20 years. According to Professor Dobromir Rahnev from the Department of Neuroscientific at Georgia Tech, the idea of 'uploading the mind' is becoming a serious concept. In this hypothetical digital existence, one could eat, drive a car, fly, or even travel between galaxies, thanks to a digital simulation of reality. While the idea is still purely theoretical, neuroscientists agree that it is possible, but we are still far from achieving it. The first condition for uploading the mind is the ability to scan the entire brain and create a precise three-dimensional map of the 86 billion neurons and trillions of connections between them. However, scientists have so far only been able to map the brain of a fly and some parts of a mouse's brain. The challenge goes beyond scanning, as it also requires modeling the behavior of each neuron, which changes constantly. No one knows exactly what level of detail is required to accurately simulate the brain: is it at the molecular level or deeper? Perhaps understanding how the brain works will make it easier to find solutions, like building a car from scratch instead of simulating an old one without understanding its components. However, currently, scientists cannot even replace one neuron with an artificial one. Despite the challenges, the rapid pace of technological progress, especially in artificial intelligence and computing, keeps this dream alive. Billionaires who dream of immortality are willing to fund ambitious research. While some estimates suggest that uploading the mind may be possible by 2045, other experts consider these predictions overly optimistic. It is more likely, according to some scientists, that we will not achieve this within the current century, but perhaps within the next 200 years.

**üß†‚ú® Unlock Your Brain's Potential: The Scientific Way to Keep Your Mind Fresh**
To keep your mind sharp and clear, neuroscience offers several proven strategies. These include challenging your brain through learning new things, prioritizing quality sleep (7-9 hours), exercising regularly (a brisk 30-minute walk daily), mastering stress management, eating brain-boosting nutrients (omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, whole grains), staying socially connected, and harnessing the alpha state of mind through flow-state activities. Even dedicating 15-30 minutes a day to learning something new can significantly boost mental agility over time. As Dr. [no specific doctor is mentioned in the article], said, 'Your brain craves challenge.'

**Can the Human Brain be Digitally Transferred? The Future of Mind Uploading**
The idea of uploading human consciousness into a computer and living digitally is a concept that has been explored in science fiction, but it is theoretically possible. This concept is known as 'mind uploading' and would allow individuals to exist in a digital world, even without a physical body. However, the biggest obstacle to this is the human brain. Scientists consider the brain to be the most complex structure in the universe, with approximately 86 billion neurons and trillions of connections. Currently, only the brain of a fly has been fully mapped, and only small sections of a mouse's brain have been detailed. It could take decades to model the human brain at this scale, and even then, simulating how neurons change over time would be a significant challenge. When a person's mind is uploaded into a computer, not only would their thoughts be simulated, but also their senses, such as sight, sound, and touch, would need to be simulated. Without these senses, the mind could experience severe psychological problems, known as 'sensory deprivation,' which could be equivalent to torture over time. Therefore, a successful mind upload would require not only a highly accurate simulation of the brain but also of the environment and senses. Currently, neither computer power nor scientific knowledge has reached this level. While some scientists believe that this technology could be possible by 2045, considering the current pace of brain research, this date may be overly optimistic. Some experts even suggest that it may not be possible until the end of the 22nd century. However, given the rapid progress of technology, the possibility of achieving this goal in the next 200 years is not negligible. Moreover, billions of dollars have already been invested in research to achieve this goal.

**The Pursuit of Perfection: The Rise of Human Enhancement**
The pursuit of a perfect body has become a liquid and subjective aspiration, as described by philosopher Zygmunt Bauman. People are now seeking to improve their bodies through various means, including medication, surgery, and technology. The industry of human enhancement, valued at $125 billion, is growing at a rate of over 10% annually. However, this trend raises concerns about the potential consequences of altering human bodies. Julian Savulescu, an expert in ethics, notes that while these enhancements may be liberating, they can also be depressing and lead to feelings of inadequacy. The article highlights the case of Kim Kardashian, who underwent significant weight loss and body changes, and the growing popularity of cosmetic procedures. The author argues that the pursuit of a perfect body is driven by societal pressure and the desire for status and value. The article also explores the use of technology, such as brain-computer interfaces, to enhance human performance. However, experts warn that these enhancements could lead to social and economic inequalities, and that governments should take action to regulate the industry. The article concludes that the pursuit of a perfect body is a complex issue that raises important ethical questions.

**Researchers develop face 'e-tattoo' to track mental workload in high-stress jobs**
Researchers have developed an electronic tattoo device, or 'e-tattoo,' that can track mental workload in high-stress jobs. The device, which is temporarily attached to the forehead, uses electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) to measure brain waves and eye movements. According to Dr. Nanshu Lu, the senior author of the research, mental workload is a critical factor in human-in-the-loop systems, directly influencing cognitive performance and decision-making. The e-tattoo is a cost-effective and simpler way to track mental workload, and could be used in high-demand, high-stake jobs such as pilots, air traffic controllers, doctors, and emergency dispatchers. Lu said that the device is currently a lab prototype and will need more development before it can be ready for commercialization. 'Before it can be ready for commercialization, it will need more development, such as real-time, on-tattoo mental workload decoding and validation on more people and in more realistic environments,' she said. 'The prototype currently costs $200.'

**Electronic Tattoo Detects Mental Overload in Real-Time**
Researchers in the US have developed an 'electronic tattoo' that can detect mental overload in real-time. The device, called e-tattoo, uses ultra-fine polymer electrodes and machine learning algorithms to detect changes in brain activity, specifically an increase in theta and delta waves and a decrease in alpha and beta waves, as mental load increases. Dr. Lu commented, 'The technology is developing faster than human evolution. Our brain capacity cannot keep up and can easily become overloaded.' The researchers tested the e-tattoo on six participants who completed a memory challenge with increasing difficulty. As mental load increased, participants showed greater activity in theta and delta waves, indicating increased cognitive demand, while alpha and beta activity decreased, signaling mental fatigue. The results suggest that the device can detect when the brain is struggling. The e-tattoo has several advantages, including its ultra-thin design, which makes it compatible with helmets and other accessories, and its low cost, with a price tag of $200 for the chip and battery and $20 for the disposable sensors. However, the device has some limitations, including its inability to be used on hairy areas and its sensitivity to excessive sweat. The researchers plan to expand its applicability, improve ventilation, and enhance prediction models based on artificial intelligence to produce more portable and accurate devices for assessing mental load.

**The Debate on Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness**
A team of scientists at the University of Sussex is exploring how the brain generates conscious experiences in a project that aims to answer one of humanity's oldest questions: what makes us human? The experiment, called Dreamachine, uses a dark room, strobe lights, and intense music to simulate the brain's internal processes. While the goal is not to entertain, but to understand the workings of human consciousness, some experts have raised the possibility that machines, such as AI models like ChatGPT or Gemini, may already be conscious. However, neuroscientist Anil Seth argues that intelligence and consciousness are not necessarily linked, and that machines could replicate this pattern without feeling. The debate highlights the complexity of understanding consciousness, both in humans and machines, and raises new scientific and ethical questions. As philosopher David Chalmers noted, 'the hard problem' of science is how physical processes can generate subjective experiences. The future of AI development is not just about programming, but about understanding what it means to be alive, think, and feel.

**Electronic 'Tattoo' Device Tracks Brain Activity and Detects Mental Overload**
Researchers at Texas University have developed a device that can track brain waves and detect when the mind is overworked or underworked. The 'electronic tattoo' device, as it is called, is worn on the forehead and uses electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor brain activity and eye movements. According to Dr. Nanshu Lu, the lead researcher, 'the mental load varies from person to person' and technology is advancing faster than the human brain can keep up. The device, which is designed to be low-cost and accessible, could be particularly useful in high-stress professions such as air traffic control or medicine, where mental fatigue can have serious consequences. 'We can now track mental overload,' said Luis Sentis, a researcher at Texas University. 'The device is made up of a small battery and thin sensors that are designed to be worn on the back of the ear and conform to the skin. The sensors use EEG to detect brain activity, and the device can track cognitive load in real-time.' The device was tested on participants who were given a series of increasingly difficult memory tasks, and the researchers were able to detect a clear pattern in brain activity as cognitive load increased. 'We developed a computer model that can predict mental load based on these signals, and we were able to distinguish between different levels of cognitive load,' said Sentis. 'The traditional EEG systems cost over $15,000, but our device costs around $200 for the battery and chip, and $20 for the disposable sensor pads. My hope is that we can make the e-tattoo a product that can be worn at home.'

**This $35,000 Computer Runs on Human Brain Cells. Scientists Say It's Not Conscious -- Yet.**
Cortical Labs, an Australian company, has developed the world's first 'biological computer,' called the CL-1, which fuses human brain cells with silicon hardware. The CL-1 is a $35,000 computer that can be used for science and medical research, allowing scientists to test drugs on a 'body in a box' biological computer. According to Brett Kagan, Cortical Labs' Chief Scientific Officer, 'The large majority of drugs for neurological and psychiatric diseases that enter clinical trial testing fail, because there's so much more nuance when it comes to the brain -- but you can actually see that nuance when you test with these tools.' Kagan and his team believe that this technology could replace some animal testing, which is an 'ethically good thing.' However, the development of this technology raises questions about the potential for sentience and the ethics of using biological computers. Suhas Kumar from Sandia National Laboratories notes that the simplicity of this setup means the neurons are simply responding to a stimulus, but the Cortical Labs team argues that Synthetic Biological Intelligence, or SBI, is 'inherently more natural than AI' because it uses materials more akin to the human brain.

**How awesome is the human brain?**
In 2013, researchers in Germany and Japan used the K supercomputer to simulate 1 second of human brain activity. The K supercomputer, which had over 700,000 processor cores and 1.4 million gigabytes of RAM, managed to simulate the interplay of 1.73 billion nerve cells and over 10 trillion synapses, representing just 1% of the human brain's network. The simulation took 40 minutes to complete, highlighting the complexity and power required to model even a small portion of the human brain. As the article notes, 'the mighty computer that takes up a whole building, consumes $400 worth of electricity per hour and needs constant cooling and maintenance managed to simulate 1 second of 'partial' activity of the Jell-O inside your skull in 40 minutes.'

**This nightmarish $35K computer is powered by a lab-grown human brain**
Cortical Labs has developed a biological computer system called CL1, powered by lab-grown human brain cells, which can stay alive for up to six months and is compatible with USB devices. The system, described as the world's first 'code deployable biological computer', is available for pre-order at a price of $35,000. According to Cortical Labs, the neurons are placed in a nutrient solution and receive information from the company's Biological Intelligence Operating System (biOS), which creates a simulated world for the neurons to interact with. CL1 is designed as a high-performance closed loop, where neurons interact with software in real time. According to Brett Kagan, Chief Scientific Officer, a network of 120 CL1 devices could give researchers insight into how genes and proteins affect learning, and the technology can also be used in drug development and disease modeling by simulating neurological processes at the molecular level.

**The Human Brain Faces Significant Challenges and Increasing Information Pressure**
The human brain is facing significant challenges and increasing information pressure. Despite the hype around artificial intelligence, the human brain remains the most efficient computational miracle on earth. It can perform an enormous number of calculations per second, but it only requires a small amount of energy, equivalent to a small light bulb in a refrigerator. The concept of 'brain capital' has emerged, which combines brain health, abilities, and skills. This concept is important for two reasons: first, since the industrial revolution, machines have replaced physical strength and routine mental tasks. A report by the World Economic Forum found that the percentage of activities performed by humans will decrease from 50% to 33% by 2030, meaning that human competitiveness will focus on advanced thinking. Second, with the increase in average life expectancy, government-defined retirement ages are no longer relevant in knowledge-based economies. Brain skills have become long-term investment assets, unlike physical strength, which declines with age. However, 'brain capital' faces significant challenges and increasing pressure. Mental illnesses, addiction, and various neurological disorders have cost the global economy $5 trillion annually. This amount is equivalent to the size of the entire German economy. The situation is expected to worsen, with costs projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030. According to the World Health Organization, depression has become the leading cause of disabilities worldwide, with a 89% increase since 1990. Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia have seen a dramatic increase of 161%. The problem is exacerbated across all age groups, with more people losing healthy years due to declining mental health during working years. Brain power faces another type of pressure. Dan Nixon, an expert in 'attention economics,' explains that our lives have become more distracting than ever, with apps competing for our attention and converting it into profits. The amount of digital data doubles every two years, with 2.5 quintillion bytes of data produced daily. Most of this data is available with a single click. A global study found that the time we spend in front of screens has increased from 9 hours daily in 2012 to 11 hours in 2019, with a two-hour increase in mobile phone use. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the increase. The human brain faces a significant challenge in dealing with the pressure on its attention, according to Thalys Texeira, a former Harvard Business School professor. Research has shown a significant increase in the cost of attracting consumers' attention. For example, the cost of 1,000 TV viewers during a Super Bowl or prime-time event in the US has increased dramatically, especially with the spread of the internet. While spending more time in front of screens may open up new avenues for accessing news, information, and entertainment, excessive exposure to content can lead to negative effects on focus and information processing ability. Dr. Mithu Storoni, author of 'The Efficiency Paradox,' warns that continuous exposure to an endless stream of information and notifications can lead to severe mental fatigue. Scientific research has shown a strong link between excessive information intake and brain health. Studies have found that excessive social media use is linked to increased rates of depression, especially among young people. Prolonged screen time can exacerbate symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The impact of digital technology extends beyond brain capital to the third and most important factor - skills. The irony is that these skills themselves are under significant pressure due to mental fatigue. Digital distractions impede creative thinking, while excessive information leads to burnout and a lack of adaptability. Nixon refers to the phenomenon of 'unconscious phone-grabbing,' where we reach for our phones without a clear reason, driven by a dopamine release from browsing digital content. A comprehensive survey of adult skills by the OECD found that advanced economies have seen a decline in reading and writing skills more than an improvement over the past decade. David Robson, a science writer and author of 'The Intelligence Paradox,' provides an analysis of this phenomenon, saying: 'Studies show that average IQ scores, which rose throughout the 20th century, have begun to decline or stabilize in many countries. Ultimately, the question remains: where are we headed? Despite increased access to information, improved global education levels, and better nutrition, trends in mental health, increasing pressure on attention, and factors that undermine critical thinking are a growing concern. We must recognize that the human brain is a valuable resource that needs continuous strengthening and development to support our well-being, growth, and innovation over the long term, especially in the face of increasing technological influence in our lives and economies.'

**Whole Brain Emulation... Ethicists are Trembling**
Whole Brain Emulation (WBE), also known as 'mind uploading', is a concept where a person's consciousness is uploaded into a computer or robot, allowing their memories, thinking processes, and knowledge to live on. This idea has been proposed in sci-fi novels and by futurists, and with advancements in technology, it's becoming more plausible. However, ethicists are concerned about the implications of WBE, particularly regarding personhood. Mary Midgley, a British philosopher, argued that consciousness defines personhood, but this raises questions about humans who are unconscious, such as those in a vegetative state. The author, an Aquinas follower and Christian, disagrees with Midgley, believing that personhood is not solely defined by consciousness. They argue that brains do not define personhood, and that a robot with their consciousness would not be them. The author concludes that WBE should not raise concerns for those who believe in duality, as it would not be possible to emulate the soul, which is what separates humans from the rest of creation.

**Meta Develops Mind-Controlled Typing Technology**
Meta has developed a technology that allows people to type using their minds, according to MIT Technology Review. Researchers in neuroscience and artificial intelligence have created a system that analyzes brain activity and determines which keyboard keys to press. However, the system weighs 1.5 tons, costs $2 million, and can only operate in a laboratory. 'Understanding the precise architecture or principles of the human brain can be a foundation for developing machine intelligence,' said Jean-Remy King, Meta's research group leader on brain and artificial intelligence. The scanner used in the study collects magnetic signals generated in the brain's cortex when neurons are activated. It must be used in a shielded room because the Earth's magnetic field is three trillion times stronger than the human brain's. The experiment involved 35 volunteers at a research center in Spain, who spent around 20 hours in the scanner typing phrases like 'el procesador ejecuta la instrucci√≥n' (the processor executes the instruction) while their brain signals were transmitted to Meta's deep learning system, Brain2Qwerty. The company emphasizes that the development is intended for fundamental research, not for creating a commercial product.

Meta, the US-based company led by Mark Zuckerberg, has reportedly developed a non-invasive system to read thoughts, as announced in 2017. However, the system is not a wearable cap, but a large, half-ton device that costs two million US dollars and will never leave the lab. The system uses a magnetencephalography (MEG) scanner to detect magnetic signals in the brain, which are then processed by a deep neural network. According to Jean-R√©mi King, leader of the Meta research team 'Brain & AI', the system can accurately determine which letter a trained typist has pressed in 80% of cases. The research was conducted with 35 volunteers at the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language, who spent around 20 hours in the scanner typing sentences while their brain signals were fed into the deep learning system, Brain2Qwerty. While the results are not yet perfect, with an average error rate of around 32%, they are the most accurate to date for typing with the brain using a full keyboard and external signals. The research is focused on understanding the principles of human intelligence, which could help develop more advanced AI that can learn and reason like humans.

**A Candian Scientist Is Trying to Inject Souls in AI, and It Looks Like It Could Work | HackerNoon**
Nirvanic, a Canadian company, is developing AI that aims to achieve consciousness, leveraging quantum mechanics to create intelligence closer to human cognition. The company's founder, Suzanne Gildert, believes that consciousness arises from quantum mechanical processes, which cannot be emulated by traditional computers but might be possible with quantum computers. This theory is shared by other researchers, including Sir Roger Penrose, who introduced his interpretation of quantum mechanics, known as Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR). According to this view, the brain functions as a quantum computer, and consciousness emerges as a result of quantum processes. Nirvanic's goal is to build conscious AI that has an inner, first-person subjective experience of the world and is able to make free-will choices about how to act in the world. This concept is still debated, and there is no universally accepted definition of consciousness. However, the development of conscious AI could lead to a new and potentially far more efficient branch of AI, one that operates in a way much closer to natural intelligence than current approaches.

**Neuralink Implants Brain Chip in First Human, Musk Says**
Elon Musk's Neuralink has implanted its first human brain chip, according to Musk, who stated that the patient is recovering well. The U.S. FDA had given Neuralink clearance to conduct its first human trial last year. The company's PRIME Study is a trial for its wireless brain-computer interface to evaluate the safety of the implant and surgical robot. The study aims to assess the functionality of the interface, which enables people with quadriplegia or paralysis to control devices with their thoughts. Neuralink has faced calls for scrutiny regarding its safety protocols, including a fine for violating U.S. Department of Transportation rules and allegations of securities fraud. The company's technology, called the 'Link', is a device about the size of five stacked coins that is placed inside the human brain through invasive surgery. Neuralink has raised at least $363 million and has over 400 employees, according to data company Pitchbook.
