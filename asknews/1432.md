**The Future of Food: 10 Trends to Watch by 2050**
By 2050, the way we produce, buy, and prepare food will undergo significant transformations. According to predictions, ten main trends will emerge. 1. 'Community meals' will continue to play a central role in our lives, with a focus on shared experiences and emotional connections. 2. The weekly grocery shopping trip will become a thing of the past, replaced by AI-powered meal planning and box delivery services. 3. Clothing will become a source of food production, with wearable technology that can grow food on the go. 4. Urban agriculture will become increasingly integrated into city landscapes, with shared gardens, vertical farming, and community-supported agriculture. 5. Food will be designed to absorb CO2, rather than emit it, with the help of oceanic agriculture and sustainable aquaculture. 6. AI will help reduce food waste by optimizing meal planning and transforming scraps into new dishes using 3D printing. 7. Climate change will lead to the adoption of new crops, such as mangoes and papayas in the Mediterranean, and quinoa and soy in Northern Europe. 8. Ancient crops, such as sorrel and dandelion, will make a comeback, providing a source of biodiversity and resilience. 9. 'Niche' crops, such as teff and fonio, will become more mainstream, providing a source of nutrition and sustainability. 10. Food will become a form of preventive medicine, with AI-powered meal planning and personalized nutrition tailored to individual needs and genetic predispositions. According to Dr. Joseph Poore, 'it's likely that our diet in 2050 will be significantly different from what we have today, although not necessarily in the ways we expect.' Dr. Morgaine Gaye adds, 'the next decade will see significant transformations in our daily habits and food models.'

**2.8 Billion People Worldwide Lack Access to Suitable Housing, UN Report Finds**
According to the United Nations' Habitat Programme annual report for 2024, approximately 2.8 billion people worldwide lack access to suitable housing. Of these, 1.1 billion people live in poor or informal settlements, which is 'the main challenge for sustainable urban development', as stated in the report. Around 90% of the population of these poor settlements live in Africa and Asia, where there is a shortage of housing units of around 170 million. Anna Claudia Robisch, Executive Director of the United Nations' Habitat Programme, said in the report that 'climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters continue to force millions of people to leave their homes in search of safety, stability, and better living conditions.' The report estimates that 318 million people are homeless, equivalent to the population of the United States. Globally, 'one in four people lives in conditions that harm their health, safety, and well-being', according to the United Nations' Habitat Programme report. Only 14% of urban residents and 40% of rural residents have access to clean water, and two in five people do not have access to sanitation services. The report states that 'safe and managed sanitation is a fundamental element of human development and is often used as a measure of progress in reducing poverty, diseases, and premature deaths.' Anna Claudia Robisch called for 'rethinking urban policies, land use, laws, and financing to prioritize housing and basic services as key drivers of climate action and sustainable development.' By 2040, it is expected that 2 billion urban residents will be exposed to significant temperature increases. The United Nations' Habitat Programme member states adopted the programme's strategic plan for 2026-2029, which focuses on access to housing, land, and basic services, such as clean water and sanitation.

**UN-Habitat Reports 2.8 Billion People Worldwide are Inadequately Housed**
According to the United Nations' Habitat agency, 2.8 billion people worldwide are inadequately housed, with 318 million people homeless. The report highlights that 1.1 billion people live in slums or informal settlements, which is the 'principal challenge of sustainable urban development.' Anacláudia Rossbach, executive director of ONU-Habitat, states, 'Climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters continue to displace millions of people, forcing them to leave their homes in search of security, stability, and better living conditions.' The agency reports that 14% of urban residents and 40% of rural residents lack access to clean water, and two out of five people do not have access to sanitation services. Anacláudia Rossbach calls for 'rethinking urban policies, land use, legislation, and financing to prioritize housing and basic services, as they are essential levers for climate action and sustainable development.' By 2040, 2 billion urban residents are expected to face significant temperature increases.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**The world's oceans are suffering from the heat of human pollution**
The world's oceans are suffering from the heat of human pollution, showing alarming signs of stress: heat waves, disappearance of marine life, rising sea levels, decrease in oxygen levels, and acidification caused by the absorption of excess carbon dioxide. These effects put not only the health of the ocean, but the entire planet, at risk. The oceans are absorbing more than 90% of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases, 'the oceans are warming up faster and faster', explains Angelique Melet, oceanographer at the European monitor Mercator Ocean. The IPCC panel of climate experts has said that the rate of ocean warming -- and therefore, its absorption of heat -- has doubled greatly since 1993. The average sea surface temperature reached new records in 2023 and 2024. Despite a brief respite in early 2025, temperatures remain at historically high levels, according to data from the Copernicus climate monitor of the European Union. The Mediterranean has set a new temperature record each of the last three years and is one of the most affected basins, along with the North Atlantic and the Arctic oceans, according to Thibault Guinaldo, of the French research center CEMS. Marine heat waves have doubled in frequency, last longer, are more intense, and affect a wider area, according to the IPCC's special report on the oceans. Warmer seas can make storms more violent, as they feed on heat and evaporated water. The warming of the water can be devastating for species, especially for corals and marine grasslands, which cannot migrate. In the case of corals, it is expected that between 70% and 90% will be lost this century if the world reaches a warming of 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels. Scientists expect that threshold -- the most ambitious goal of the Paris climate agreement -- to be exceeded by the early 2030s or even earlier. Imminent rise The expansion of a liquid or gas as it warms up occupies more space. In the case of the oceans, this thermal expansion is combined with the slow but irreversible melting of polar ice caps and mountain glaciers, causing sea levels to rise. The rate at which global sea levels are rising has doubled in three decades and, if current trends continue, will double again by 2100 to approximately one centimeter per year, according to recent research. Around 230 million people worldwide live less than a meter above sea level, vulnerable to growing threats of flooding and storms. 'Oceanic warming, like sea level rise, has become an unstoppable process', said Melet. 'But if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will reduce the rate and magnitude of damage, and gain time for adaptation'. More acidity, less oxygen The ocean not only stores heat, but has absorbed between 20% and 30% of all human carbon dioxide emissions since the 1980s, according to the IPCC, causing the waters to become more acidic. Acidification weakens corals and makes it difficult for shellfish, crustacean skeletons, and certain types of plankton to calcify. 'Another key indicator is the concentration of oxygen, which, of course, is important for marine life', said Melet. Oxygen loss is due to a complex set of causes, including those related to water warming. Less sea ice The combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice -- frozen ocean water floating on the surface -- fell to a historic low in mid-February. This becomes a vicious circle, as less sea ice allows more solar energy and heat to reach the water, leading to more ice melting. This feeds the phenomenon of 'polar amplification' that makes global warming faster and more intense at the poles, said Guinaldo.

**The Future of Travel: Sustainable and Conscious**
According to the World Tourism Organization (OMT), the tourism industry generates around 10% of the world's wealth. A study by Google and Deloitte in 2024 predicts that this number will grow to 2.4 billion travelers by 2040. The question is whether we can continue to travel without putting the world at risk. Intermundial, a leader in travel insurance and gadgets, proposes a solution: sustainable tourism. The company's new campaign, 'Viaja de manera diferente', invites people to modify their travel habits and make a positive impact on the environment. The key is in small decisions, such as consuming in local businesses, choosing eco-certified accommodations, and avoiding single-use plastics. As Pablo Nemo, a traveler and divulgator, says, 'Travel is also about listening'. The campaign aims to create a network of sustainable tourism agents and travelers who share a transformative vision and understand that taking care of the environment is essential to the travel experience. The goal is to create a more responsible and sustainable tourism industry that measures its impact, not just its numbers.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**NASA Scientists Confirm Earth's Uninhabitability in Less Than 1000 Years**
NASA scientists have confirmed that the Earth will become uninhabitable in less than 1000 years due to ecological threats. The scientific community is divided between those who advocate for immediate ecological measures on Earth and those who focus on interplanetary perspectives. However, the general consensus is that it is necessary to maintain ecological balance on the planet while preparing for long-term human presence in space. NASA recognizes this approach as the most realistic path to preserving civilization. According to Stephen Hawking's 2017 statement, the Earth may become a 'fireball' by 2600 due to overpopulation and resource overconsumption. While the exact date of the catastrophe is impossible to predict, NASA believes that ecological threats related to resource depletion and climate change are real. Research shows that humanity already consumes 1.75 times more resources than the Earth can replenish. By 2050, the planet's population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, further exacerbating the pressure on the environment. NASA scientists emphasize the need to reduce emissions, develop renewable energy, and implement sustainable approaches. At the same time, the agency is developing space programs focused on colonization, including the Artemis mission to return humans to the Moon, Mars exploration, and the Europa Clipper mission to study Jupiter's moon. Private initiatives, such as Breakthrough Starshot, aim to reach the nearest star in less than 20 years. The scientific community is divided between those who advocate for immediate ecological measures on Earth and those who focus on interplanetary perspectives. However, the general consensus is that it is necessary to maintain ecological balance on the planet while preparing for long-term human presence in space.

**By 2080, 90% of global population will live in cities, says urbanist**
According to global urbanist Greg Clark, by 2080, the world's population will have peaked at 10 billion, with nearly 90% living in cities. Clark emphasizes the need for adaptable and sustainable cities to accommodate population growth, and notes that once global numbers start to decline, there will be a need for strategies to redistribute the world population in ways that preserve the planet's well-being. Clark highlights the challenges of urban concentration, including inequality and environmental pollution, and outlines the need for innovation in food, housing, and transport sectors. He expresses optimism about the transport sector, but notes that the housing and food problems will require more ingenuity. Clark also emphasizes the need to reconcile cities with the natural world, and suggests that integrating nature into urban spaces could address many pressing challenges.

**Environmental News of the Week**
Recent environmental news from around the world. The NASA has reported that the average sea level on Earth has risen by 10 cm over the past three decades. The main cause of this rise in 2024 was the expansion of seawater due to heat, according to the NASA. Researchers at the University of Concordia have found that planting a variety of flowers can help improve bee populations in Montreal. Their study, published in Ecological Applications, shows that bees do better when they have access to a diverse range of flower sizes and shapes. In Ukraine, the destruction of the Kakhovka dam during the Russian invasion has caused a devastating flood that has released heavy metals into the environment. A study published in Science warns that these pollutants pose a long-term risk to humans and proposes using 'bioremédiation' to clean them up. The increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could also reduce the number of satellites in orbit around the Earth. A study in Nature Sustainability predicts that by 2100, up to 66% fewer satellites will be able to safely orbit the Earth due to the contraction of the high atmosphere caused by global warming. Finally, researchers at the University of Michigan have found that using clothes dryers can be bad for the environment, emitting 27 million tonnes of CO2 per year in the US. However, they propose a solution: running the dryer at night, outside of peak hours, can reduce emissions by 8%.

**The End of the World in 2026: A Prediction from Harvard Expert**
A 1960 study by Heinz von Foerster, Patricia Mora, and Lawrence Amiot, published in the journal Science, predicted a critical point for humanity: November 13, 2026. The study, titled 'Doomsday: Friday, 13 November, A.D. 2026,' argued that the world's population was growing at an unsustainable rate, and that by 2026, the number of people on the planet would reach a level close to infinity, leading to a crisis of resources and the inability of social systems to sustain themselves. The researchers claimed that even if a stable food supply and the avoidance of natural disasters were achieved, the demographic growth alone could trigger the collapse of societies. The study highlighted overpopulation as the greatest threat to humanity, due to the increasing demand for resources and environmental impact. However, this idea has been questioned over time, as population growth rates have decreased and it is expected that the global population will stabilize in the coming centuries. While the prediction of a collapse in 2026 is viewed with skepticism, the debate on the planet's sustainability remains ongoing. The UN estimates that the global population will reach 11.2 billion by 2100, posing challenges in terms of resources and the environment. Experts recommend focusing on responsible management of the planet and preparing for possible global crises, rather than worrying about apocalyptic scenarios.

**Dire Future Predicted for the World by 2100: Rising Sea Levels, Extreme Weather, and Catastrophic Air Pollution**
A study using Google's ImageFX generator and the latest scientific research predicts a dire future for the world by 2100. Cities will be underwater, and millions of people will die from heat. The main factors will be rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions. If nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these changes will continue for a century. Climate scientist Professor Julian Stoye said, 'The biggest impact that everyone will feel is the rise in sea levels and the change in extreme weather conditions. All of this will be increasing over the century if we do nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.' The IPCC predicts that the global temperature will rise by 2.7°C by 2100 under a medium scenario and by 4.4°C under a worst-case scenario. The number of people living in arid regions will increase by more than double, from 2.3 billion to 5 billion by 2100. The risk of 'sudden droughts' will increase from 32% to 53% in Europe by 2100. Countries like France, already struggling with water scarcity, will likely face devastating droughts. It is predicted that only extreme heat will lead to 5.8 million additional deaths in Europe by 2100. Barcelona will be the most affected city, with 246,000 additional deaths predicted. The melting of ice and rising sea levels will continue as the atmosphere warms over the next 75 years. The study predicts that the global sea level will rise by 1.9 meters by 2100 if CO2 emissions continue to increase. Extreme weather events will become more frequent, with a 47% decrease in summer rainfall in the UK by 2070 and a 35% increase in winter rainfall. The risk of sudden floods will be high in areas where droughts have already weakened the land. Mega-tornadoes will become more common, posing a threat to countries like Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and the southern states of the US. Large-scale forest fires will also become more frequent, with a 50% increase in extreme forest fires by 2100. The World Environment Programme predicts that extreme forest fires will become 50% more frequent by 2100. Air pollution will become catastrophic, with 60,000 additional deaths worldwide by 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100.

**Expert Predicts 'Only Two Years Left Before the End of the World'**
A study by Heinz von Foerster, published in 1960 in the Science journal, predicted that the world would reach a critical point on November 13, 2026, due to an exponential growth of the world population. According to the study, the population growth would lead to a collapse, not due to natural disasters or pandemics, but due to human decisions and actions. The study used a mathematical formula that projected the population would reach near-infinite levels by 2026, even if a constant food supply and natural disasters were avoided. The study warned that the overpopulation could trigger the collapse of social and environmental systems. The true threat is overpopulation, not climate change, and the study attributed the responsibility to humans, not external factors. The research advised that if the population continued to grow at this rate, we would reach an unsustainable threshold where societies could not preserve their stability or sustainable development. Although this prediction is now viewed with skepticism, the dialogue about the limits of human growth remains relevant, and institutions like the UN estimate that the world population could reach 11.2 billion by 2100, raising questions about resource management and environmental protection in a world with a constantly increasing population.

**The True Threat: Overpopulation, Not Climate Change**
A 1960 study by physicist Heinz von Foerster and his team predicted that the world would reach a critical point on November 13, 2026, due to exponential population growth. According to their projections, the growth of the world population would be so significant that humanity would experience a collapse, not due to natural disasters or pandemics, but due to its own decisions and actions. The study, titled 'Doomsday: Friday, 13 November, A.D. 2026', argued that even if a constant food supply and the avoidance of natural disasters were achieved, overpopulation could trigger the collapse of social and environmental systems. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that demographic growth has reached a pace that technological advancements cannot mitigate adequately. As a result, addressing this phenomenon is imperative to ensure a sustainable future. According to the model used, overpopulation will lead to extinction due to resource scarcity and the environmental impact of human activities. The research warned that if the world population continues to grow at this rate, we will reach an unsustainable threshold where societies cannot preserve their stability or sustainable development. Although this prediction is now viewed with skepticism, especially due to the stabilization of population growth rates, the dialogue about the limits of human growth remains relevant. The UN has estimated that the world population could reach 11.2 billion by 2100, raising questions about the management of the planet's resources and environmental protection in a world with a constantly increasing population.

**Humanity's Well-being at Risk Due to Biodiversity Decline**
Human activity has led to a decline in animals and plants across all regions of the world, putting our own well-being at risk through excessive resource exploitation and pollution, warned a comprehensive research on species on Friday. Fish stocks may be depleted by 2048 and more than half of bird and mammal species in Africa may disappear by 2100 unless drastic measures are taken, according to four comprehensive reports released in Medellín. Up to 90% of corals in the Asia-Pacific region will suffer 'severe degradation' by 2050, while in Europe and Central Asia nearly a third of known fish populations and 42% of terrestrial animals and plants are in decline. 'This alarming trend puts at risk economies, livelihoods, food security, and the quality of life of people everywhere,' warned the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Elaborated by almost 600 scientists over three years, the reports highlight that nature provides humans with food, clean water, and energy, and regulates the Earth's climate - practically everything we need to survive and thrive. 'We are undermining our own future well-being,' said IPBES President Robert Watson. 'Biodiversity continues to be lost in all regions of the globe. We are losing species, degrading ecosystems... if we continue to act in this way, we will continue to lose biodiversity at increasing rates.' The IPBES assessment divided the world into four regions: the Americas, Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Central Asia - the entire planet, except Antarctica and open seas. Volunteer scientists examined around 10,000 scientific publications for the most extensive survey of biodiversity since 2005. The conclusions were summarized in four reports approved by the 129 member countries of IPBES in Colombia. They contain guidelines for governments to create more biodiversity-friendly policies in the future. - Mass extinction - For the Americas, the research warned that species populations - already 31% smaller than when the first European colonizers arrived - will have shrunk by about 40% by 2050. It is estimated that around 500,000 square kilometers of African land will be degraded, added. The continent will suffer 'significant' plant losses and its lakes will be 20-30% less productive by 2100. In the European Union, however, only 7% of evaluated marine species had a 'favorable conservation status.' 'If we continue the way we are... the sixth mass extinction, the first caused by humans, will continue,' said Watson to AFP. Scientists say that humanity's voracious consumption of biodiversity has triggered the first mass extinction of species since the dinosaurs disappeared - the sixth on our planet in 500 million years. - Increased demand - In many places, climate changes caused by burning fossil fuels for energy were worsening the loss of biodiversity, according to the reports. 'That's what we have to convey to policymakers: we have to look at climate change and biodiversity together,' said Watson. 'Climate change affects biodiversity, changes in our natural vegetation affect climate change. And both, if we don't do it correctly, will harm many of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals: clean water for all, food security for people, energy security, human security, equity.' There are many obstacles. 'Economic growth will continue. Population growth will continue until 2050, so resource demand will increase,' said the IPBES president. Even in the best scenarios, global warming will continue to contribute to species loss, causing greater ecosystem degradation. But scientists point to possible solutions: creating more protected areas, restoring degraded zones, and rethinking subsidies that promote unsustainable agriculture. Governments, companies, and individuals must consider the impact on biodiversity when making decisions about agriculture, fishing, forestry, mining, or infrastructure development. Different regions will require different solutions, said Watson. 'It's not too late' to stop or even reverse some of the damage, he said. 'We can stop it all? No. We can slow it down significantly? Yes.' IPBES will release a fifth report on the global state of the soil, which is being rapidly degraded through pollution, deforestation, mining, and unsustainable agricultural methods that deplete its nutrients.
