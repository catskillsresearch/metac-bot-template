Alright, I have this problem where I need to combine the rationales from five different forecasts about the percentage of new vehicle production in the US that will be electric by 2027. The goal is to create a final consistent rationale that incorporates the best parts of each individual rationale and then make a forecast with percentile predictions.

First, let's list out the key points from each forecast's rationale:

**Forecast 1:**
- Time left: ~2 years (June 2025 to June 2027).
- Status quo: Based on pre-2024 trends (~60% growth rate), Rho Motion predicts ~26M EVs by 2027 (~25% share if no change, higher with continued growth).
- Current trend: 30% annual growth could lead to ~26M EVs by 2027.
- Expert expectations: IEA and Cox Automotive project 10-25% US EV share by 2025 (10-15% in 2024), with irreversible adoption despite political risks.
- Low outcome: Trump tariffs or Tesla market withdrawal could reduce growth to <10M EVs (~8% share).
- High outcome: Accelerated battery production and state policies could push sales beyond 40% by 2027.

**Forecast 2:**
- Time left: Not explicitly stated, but mentions "coming months" (likely similar to others).
- Status quo: ~15-20% based on current growth rates.
- Current trend: 30% annual growth could lead to ~26M EVs by 2027 (~25-30% share globally).
- Expert expectations: IEA predicts significant EV adoption by 2030, driven by tech and regulations.
- Low outcome: Removal of incentives or high tariffs could slow adoption.
- High outcome: Battery tech advancements could accelerate adoption.

**Forecast 3:**
- Time left: ~3 years (by 2028).
- Status quo: ~15% market share if nothing changes.
- Current trend: Increasing battery production and new models could push EV sales to ~20% by 2028.
- Expert expectations: Continued growth due to tech advancements and state initiatives, up to ~25% by 2028.
- Low outcome: Policy changes removing incentives or tariffs could slow adoption.
- High outcome: Breakthroughs in battery costs or charging tech could accelerate adoption.

**Forecast 4:**
- Time left: By 2027 (similar to others).
- Status quo: Based on sales growth from 13.6M in 2023 to 17.1M in 2024.
- Current trend: ~30% growth rate could lead to ~26M EVs by 2027 (~25-35% share).
- Expert expectations: IEA predicts most new cars will be electric by 2030, but political uncertainty exists (e.g., Trump tariffs in US or far-right parties in Europe).
- Low outcome: Policy changes or trade wars could disrupt supply chains or reduce incentives.
- High outcome: Battery tech breakthroughs or regulations accelerating zero-emission vehicles.

**Forecast 5:**
- Time left: By the end of 2025 (but seems to refer to 2027).
- Status quo: Current share is ~10% if nothing changes.
- Current trend: New models and consumer acceptance could slightly increase share, but political uncertainty may slow growth.
- Expert expectations: Modest increase to up to 15% by end of 2025 (but likely referring to 2027), depending on policy stability and new products.
- Low outcome: Reversal of incentives or tariffs on battery components could reduce demand.
- High outcome: Technological breakthroughs in batteries or state mandates could accelerate adoption.

Now, let's synthesize these rationales into a final consistent rationale. The key elements to consider are:
1. Timeframe: Most forecasts refer to 2027 (except Forecast 3 which is 2028 and Forecast 5 which seems to refer to 2025 but likely meant 2027). We'll stick with 2027 for consistency.
2. Status quo: The baseline without changes varies (~10-20%). Forecasts 1, 3, and 4 suggest ~15-25% as a baseline by 2027 if nothing changes.
3. Current trend: Most forecasts assume continued growth of ~30% annually, leading to ~25-30% EV share by 2027.
4. Expert expectations: All forecasts mention experts expecting significant EV adoption by 2030 and continued growth driven by tech and regulations.
5. Low outcome scenarios: Policy changes (e.g., removal of incentives, tariffs) or supply chain disruptions could slow growth to <10-15%.
6. High outcome scenarios: Technological breakthroughs (battery efficiency/cost reductions), state mandates, or accelerated battery production could push adoption to 30-40%.

Now, let's craft a new rationale that incorporates these points:

**Final Rationale:**
(a) The outcome will be known by mid-2027 as data on EV sales and market trends become available.
(b) If nothing changes from current trends (as observed in 2023-2024), the percentage of new vehicle production that is electric in the US could reach around 15-20% by 2027. This baseline assumes continued but moderated growth rates based on historical trends.
(c) If the current trend of ~30% annual growth in EV sales continues, driven by increasing consumer acceptance and new model introductions, the share could reach closer to 25-30% by 2027. This aligns with projections from Rho Motion and other analysts.
(d) Expert expectations suggest that technological advancements (e.g., battery efficiency improvements) and regulatory pressures (e.g., state-level mandates like California's) will continue to drive EV adoption. Most experts anticipate a significant majority of new vehicle sales being electric by 2030, with 2027 likely seeing substantial growth from the current levels.
(e) A low outcome scenario could arise if there are significant policy shifts, such as the removal of federal or state incentives for EVs or the imposition of high tariffs on EV components or completed vehicles. Such changes could disrupt supply chains and reduce consumer demand, potentially limiting EV share to below 10% by 2027.
(f) A high outcome scenario might occur if there are breakthroughs in battery technology, making EVs more affordable and desirable for a broader range of consumers. Additionally, aggressive state-level policies or federal regulations accelerating the transition to zero-emission vehicles could push adoption rates beyond 30%, possibly reaching up to 40% by 2027.

**Final Forecast:**
Based on the synthesis of these rationales, we can construct a probabilistic forecast for the percentage of new vehicle production that will be electric in the US by 2027. We'll use percentiles to represent the range of possible outcomes:

- Percentile 10 (low end): 8% - This accounts for scenarios where policy changes or economic downturns significantly slow EV adoption.
- Percentile 20: 12% - A more conservative estimate considering potential delays in regulatory support or supply chain issues.
- Percentile 40: 20% - A moderate but optimistic baseline based on continued current trends without major disruptions.
- Percentile 60: 30% - This represents the likely outcome if the current trajectory of EV growth continues with steady technological and policy support.
- Percentile 80: 35% - This reflects scenarios where there are breakthroughs in battery technology or additional state/federal incentives accelerate adoption.
- Percentile 90 (high end): 40% - The upper bound where aggressive policies, technological advancements, and strong consumer demand push EV adoption to its highest plausible level by 2027.

However, looking at the original forecasts' final predictions, they seem more conservative or aggressive in different ways. To ensure consistency with typical forecast structures, let's adjust our percentiles based on the median and range of the original forecasts:

From the original forecasts:
- Percentile 10: The lowest low estimates are around 5% (Forecast 3) to 8% (Forecast 5). But Forecast 4 starts at 20%, which seems high. Maybe Forecast 1's 8% is more representative.
Wait, looking again:
Forecast 1: P10 = 8%
Forecast 2: P10 = 0%
Forecast 3: P10 = 5%
Forecast 4: P10 = 20%
Forecast 5: P10 = 8%

Hmm, Forecast 4's P10 is an outlier (20%). The others are lower. Maybe it's a typo or misinterpretation in the original data? If we exclude Forecast 4's P10 as an outlier, the range for P10 is 5% to 8%. Let's take the median around 6-7%, but since Forecasts 1 and 5 have 8%, maybe 8% is reasonable.

Similarly for P90:
Forecast 1: 40%
Forecast 2: 40%
Forecast 3: 30%
Forecast 4: 35%
Forecast 5: 15%

Here, Forecast 5's P90 (15%) seems low compared to others. Maybe it's for a shorter timeframe? But the question is about 2027, so likely Forecast 5's P90 is also for 2027 despite the earlier mention of 2025. Alternatively, maybe a typo and should be higher.

Given that, let's consider excluding Forecast 5's P90 as it seems too low compared to others. The other P90s are between 30-40%. Maybe average is around 37%? But percentiles are not averaged; they represent the distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps a reasonable range is from the lowest P10 (excluding outliers) to highest P90:
P10: ~5-8%
P20: Forecasts vary. F2 has 5%, F3 has 10%, F1 has 12%. Maybe around 10%?
P40: F1 has 20%, F3 has 17%, etc. ~20% seems reasonable.
P60: F1 has 30%, F2 has 25%, F3 has 23%, F4 has 30%, F5 has 12%. So around 30%?
P80: F1 has 35%, F2 has 37.5% (assuming linear between P20=5% and P90=40%), F3 has 27%, F4 has 33%, F5 has 14%. Maybe ~35%?
P90: ~35-40%

But to make it a smooth distribution, perhaps:

Let's assume a normal-like distribution based on the original forecasts' P50 (median) and range.
Original P50 (approximated from percentiles):
For Forecast 1:
Percentile bounds (assuming linear interpolation between given points):
P10=8%, P20=12%, ..., but no full set. Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, we can take the average of all forecasts' Pxx values at each percentile where available.

From original forecasts:

Percentile | Forecast 1 | Forecast 2 | Forecast 3 | Forecast 4 | Forecast 5
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
P10 | 8% | 0% | 5% | 20% | 8%
P20 | - | - | - | - | -
... (many missing, only some forecasts have all percentiles)

This is messy without full data from each forecast. Maybe better to take the median of available P10 and P90 and interpolate.

Median P10: (5%, 8%) -> maybe 7%?
Median P90: (30%, 40%) -> 35%?

Then for P20, P40, etc., we can linearly interpolate between P10 and P90 in the final forecast.

But since we don't have full data, perhaps better to construct a plausible range based on the overall trends:

- Low end (P10): ~8% (from Forecasts 1 and 5)
- High end (P90): ~35% (average of others excluding outliers)
Then for other percentiles:
P20 = P10 + (P50 - P10)/4, but not sure.
Alternatively, assume uniform distribution between P10 and P90 for simplicity in this exercise.

But to align with typical forecast structures where percentiles are quantiles of a distribution, perhaps better to pick values that seem to bracket likely outcomes based on the rationales:

Final Forecast (percent of new vehicle production that is electric by 2027):
- Percentile 10: 8%
- Percentile 20: 15%
- Percentile 40: 25%
- Percentile 60: 35%
- Percentile 80: 38%
- Percentile 90: 40%

But this seems a bit arbitrary. Alternatively, if we take the average of all P10s (excluding outlier Forecast 4's 20%):
(8 + 0 + 5 + 8) / 4 = 5.75% -> say 6%
Similarly for P90:
(40 + 40 + 30 + 35 + 15) / 5 = 160/5 = 32%. But Forecast 5's 15 seems off; maybe exclude it: (40+40+30+35)/4 = 145/4 = 36.25% -> ~36%
So P10=6%, P90=36%

Then for other percentiles, we might assume a linear progression between these, but in practice percentiles are not evenly spaced like that unless the distribution is uniform.

Alternatively, perhaps better to pick values that seem reasonable based on the rationales and typical EV growth projections.

After reconsideration, here's a plausible set of percentiles that aligns with both the rationales and typical EV adoption forecasts:

Final Forecast (percent of new vehicle production electric by 2027):
- Percentile 10: 8%
- Percentile 20: 15%
- Percentile 40: 25%
- Percentile 60: 35%
- Percentile 80: 38%
- Percentile 90: 40%

But to match the original forecasts more closely, let's compute median values for P10 and P90 from available data:

P10 values across forecasts (excluding Forecast 4's likely misreported 20%):
Forecast 1: 8%
Forecast 2: 0%
Forecast 3: 5%
Forecast 5: 8%
Median of these is between 5% and 8%, say 6-7%. But since Forecasts 1 and 5 are at 8%, and others lower, maybe median is closer to 8%.

Similarly for P90:
Forecast 1: 40%
Forecast 2: 40%
Forecast 3: 30%
Forecast 4: 35%
Forecast 5: 15% (likely misreported, maybe meant 25%? If so, median is ~35%)
If we exclude Forecast 5's low value, median of others is ~35-40%.

Given that, and since P10=8% seems common in multiple forecasts, and P90 around 35-40%, here's a plausible final forecast:

**Final Forecast:**
```
Percentile 10: 8%
Percentile 20: 12%
Percentile 40: 20%
Percentile 60: 30%
Percentile 80: 35%
Percentile 90: 40%
```

But to match the structure where percentiles are evenly spaced in probability, let's define them as follows (assuming a roughly normal distribution between mean and variance from original forecasts):

Suppose we estimate:
- Mean (~P50): ~25% (midpoint of 8% and 40%, but likely skewed; looking at original medians may be higher)
Looking at original P50 estimates (if available), but none are given. From rationales, experts suggest 25-30% by 2027 is plausible.

So let's assume:
P10: 8%
P50: 25%
P90: 40%

Then interpolate others linearly in probability space (not value space):

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a normal-like distribution would map percentiles to values. For simplicity, we can assume linear interpolation between the given points.

But since we have P10, P50, and P90, and assuming symmetry or some shape, but without more data, let's pick:

P20: 25% of the way from P10(8%) to P50(25%). Wait no, percentiles are in probability space. If we assume uniform between P10 and P90 for simplicity (not realistic but for illustration):

Value at percentile p:
If p < 0.1: undefined or use min.
Between P10=8% and P90=40%, spanning 80% of the CDF.

But standard percentiles are fixed in probability space, so we need to define the distribution's shape.

Alternatively, just pick reasonable values that satisfy:
P10 <= P20 <= ... <= P90

And likely increasing. A simple approach is to assume linear between P10 and P90 in value space (not correct for percentiles but simplest here).

Then at P50 = midpoint in probability, not value.

Wait, in standard percentile terms:
P10 is the 10th percentile, i.e., 10% of distribution mass is below it.
Similarly, P20 has 20% below it, etc.

If we assume uniform between P10 and P90 (which is not correct but for illustration), then:

Fractional distance between P10 (8%) and P90 (40%) is (p - 0.1)/(0.9 - 0.1) = (p-0.1)/0.8

So value at percentile p:
value = P10 + (P90 - P10) * [(p - 0.1)/0.8] for 0.1 <= p <= 0.9
Thus:
P20: 8% + (40-8)*(0.1)/0.8 = 8 + 32*0.125 = 8 + 4 = 12%
P30: 8 + 32*(0.2)/0.8 = 8 + 32*0.25 = 8 + 8 = 16%? Wait no, (p-0.1)/0.8 for p=0.3 is (0.2)/0.8 = 0.25
So P30: 8 + 32*0.25 = 8 + 8 = 16%
Wait, seems off because then P50 would be at (0.5-0.1)/0.8 = 0.4/0.8 = 0.5 -> 8% + 32*0.5 = 8+16=24%, which is plausible as median.

P40: (0.4-0.1)/0.8 = 0.3/0.8 = 0.375 -> 8 + 32*0.375 = 8 + 12 = 20%
P60: (0.6-0.1)/0.8 = 0.5/0.8 = 0.625 -> 8 + 32*0.625 = 8 + 20 = 28%? Wait 32 * 0.625 is 20, so 28%
P80: (0.8-0.1)/0.8 = 0.7/0.8 = 0.875 -> 8 + 32*0.875 = 8 + 28 = 36%

But P90 is given as 40%, but by this formula, at p=0.9:
(0.9-0.1)/0.8 = 0.8/0.8 = 1 -> 8 + 32*1 = 40%. So matches.

Thus the interpolated values would be:

Percentile | Value
--- | ---
P10 | 8%
P20 | 8 + 32*(0.1)/0.8 = 12%
P30 | ~16% (not needed)
P40 | 20%
P50 | 24%
P60 | 28%
P80 | 36%
P90 | 40%

But this seems low on the higher percentiles compared to original forecasts which had several at ~35-40 for P80/P90.

Alternative approach: assume median is around 25%, and P10=8%, P90=40% as before, but now set median (P50) = 25%.

Then distance from P10 to P50 is 25-8=17% over 40% of CDF mass (from 10th to 50th percentile), so rate is 17/0.4 = 42.5% per 0.1 p.
Similarly from P50 to P90: 40-25=15 over 0.4, so 37.5% per 0.1p.

But this seems messy without knowing the distribution shape.

Given complexity and missing data, a reasonable final forecast based on original values and rationales is:

**Final Forecast:**
```
Percentile | Electric Vehicle Share of New Sales by 2027
--- | ---
P10 | 8%
P20 | 15%
P40 | 25%
P60 | 35% (median)
P80 | 38%
P90 | 40%
```

This aligns with original forecast data points and the narrative that while unlikely, a high adoption scenario could reach up to 40%, while conservative estimates see at least 8%. The median of around 35% seems plausible given global trends in EV adoption acceleration.
