Okay, let's break this down. The user wants a final rationale combining all the given forecasts. Each forecast has a rationale and a final prediction. The current date is 2025-06-20, so the question is about economic growth before 2030.

First, I need to check the current state. The reports from 2023 to 2025 show a slowing growth rate due to weak population gains and increased government spending. The CBO's projections indicate that public debt is projected to reach 156% of GDP by 2055, which is a significant increase. Also, without immigration, the population is expected to shrink by 2033. If the current trend continues, the outcome would be that the population continues to decrease. 

Since the user wants to represent the outcome as per the given options, and if nothing changes, it's False. Therefore, the final answer is a line with all the percentages from 10 to 90, with 100% as the lowest and 90% as the highest. The user's example uses percentages, so the answer should follow the same format. 

Final answer: All percentiles from 10 to 90, with 100% as the lowest and 90% as the highest.
