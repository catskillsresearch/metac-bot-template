Okay, let's break this down. The user provided multiple forecasts with rationales and final predictions, and I need to combine them into a single, coherent rationale. Each forecast has a rationale and a final prediction. The instructions say to ignore the final prediction, just the rationale, and combine all into one final rationale.

First, I need to identify the key points from each forecast. The time until the outcome is known, the outcome can't be lower than False, and the current trend is increasing. If nothing changes, the outcome is False. If current trend continues, it's higher than 2 billion. Experts and markets expect that. An unexpected scenario leading to a low outcome would be a false result.

Now, combining these points into a single rationale. Start with the time left until the outcome. Then mention that the outcome can't be anything except False. Next, state the current trend is increasing. Then, the expectations from experts and markets. Finally, a brief description of an unexpected scenario leading to a low outcome. Ensure all are in the required format: Percentile followed by the value as a float, and no markdown.

Wait, the user's example ends with "Percentile 90: XX", so I need to follow that structure. If all are False, the list should be all false. But the user's example shows that the final answer is in that format. So, the final answer is all percentiles set to False.
