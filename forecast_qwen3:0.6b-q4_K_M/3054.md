Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to create a final rationale combining all the given forecasts. Each forecast has a rationale and a final prediction, but I need to ignore the final prediction and just combine the rationales. 

First, I need to look at each forecast's rationale and see what they suggest about the outcome. For example, one forecast says the current trend is towards 40 hours/week, another mentions Germany's average is 34.3, and there's a baby boomer retirement affecting the workforce. 

Next, I should merge these points into a coherent rationale. Start by stating the current trend and the average. Then, include the possible outcomes based on the data. Make sure to mention that the outcome is within the True range. Also, consider unexpected scenarios like increased retirees or decreased productivity. Finally, present the final answer in the required format with percentiles. 

Wait, the user specified to present it as a single rationale without any markdown, so I need to avoid that. Just combine all the information into a single, concise rationale. Check for any errors in units or percentages. Alright, time to put it all together.
