        "2":"Robin Hanson, Daniel Martin, Calvin McCarter and Jonathan Paulson have [a new paper out about grabby aliens](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/2102.01522.pdf). From the abstract,\n\n> According to a hard-steps model of advanced life timing, humans seem puzzlingly early. We offer an explanation: an early deadline is set by 'grabby' civilizations (GC), who expand rapidly, never die alone, change the appearance of the volumes they control, and who are not born within other GC volumes. If we might soon become grabby, then today is near a sample origin date of such a GC. A selection effect explains why we don't see them even though they probably control over a third of the universe now. Each parameter in our three parameter model can be estimated to within roughly a factor of four, allowing principled predictions of GC origins, spacing, appearance, and durations till we see or meet them.\n\nScott Aaronson wrote a qualitative summary of the paper [here](https:\/\/www.scottaaronson.com\/blog\/?p=5253). [Figure 8](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bK33kUn) in their paper provides a cumulative probability distribution for when our descendents will encounter grabby aliens, under various parameter settings in their model. \n\nThis question is important for long-termists, since it provides one constraint on the overall size and power our civilization will eventually have. Assuming that human descendants do not have the ability to conquer neighboring alien civilizations, our descedents will be constrained by the amount of resources we can \"grab\" in a phase of rapid expansion and colonization, much like the [European imperialists](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Timeline_of_European_imperialism) of prior centuries.",

If the court is politically important and costs are low, then you could easily imagine growing the court to dozens, hundreds, and then thousands before you really changed the cost-benefit analysis.\n\n> You would eventually be bottlenecked by the availability of plausibly-qualified candidates under current standards. But I'm not aware of any real constitutional requirements to serve as a justice, and so you could have a race to the bottom on standards in parallel with a ballooning court.\n\n> Foreseeing that outcome, a party in power might decide to directly increase the size of the court to the point where further expansion would be prohibitively costly. (And each party might be inclined to initiate a giant expansion out of the fear that their opponents would do so the next time they had the chance.) So rather than doubling every ~20 years (or however often a new unified government is elected) we could just jump straight to a gigantic court.\n\n> The most absurd outcome would be an equilibrium in which a significant fraction of Americans served on the supreme court and voted directly on high-profile cases by ballot (perhaps at the same time that they vote on elected offices).",

The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate \u00a315 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional \u00a36 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 06:27 PM\nSource:[Brasil 247](https:\/\/www.brasil247.com\/mundo\/reino-unido-anuncia-construcao-de-submarinos-nucleares-e-fabricas-de-municoes-em-resposta-a-ameaca-russa)\n\n**UK Announces Construction of 12 New Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarines 'A Message to Moscow'**\nThe UK has announced the construction of 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines as part of its Defense Review, which Prime Minister Starmer said will give the British army more power against hostile states like Russia and China. According to Starmer, 'The threat is more serious, more immediate, more unpredictable than ever since the Cold War.' The new defense strategy is 'a message to Moscow,' said Defense Minister John Healey, referring to the 'growing' threat posed by Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Starmer has also committed to building at least six new ammunition factories in the UK, creating a hybrid Royal Navy combining drones with warships, submarines, and aircraft, improving living conditions and equipment for military personnel, and investing \u00a315 billion in a nuclear program. The UK is preparing for war at a 'war footing' because Russia is showing it does not want peace, and the best way to deter aggressors is to be ready. Starmer has promised to create a stronger and fully trained reserve, strengthen NATO by making the largest contribution to the alliance since its creation, and invest in innovation. The UK's defense spending will increase to 2.5% by 2027 and 3% by 2030.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 01:14 PM\nSource:[RFI](https:\/\/www.rfi.fr\/es\/europa\/20250602-reino-unido-anuncia-la-construcci%C3%B3n-de-una-docena-de-submarinos-un-mensaje-dirigido-a-mosc%C3%BA)\n\n**UK to Build New Attack Submarines and Boost Nuclear Arsenal Amid Russian Threat**\nThe UK's Labour leader has outlined a plan to make the country a 'war-ready' nation, equipped for 'decades to come', in the face of the Russian threat.

According to reports, the UK plans to equip US-made fighter jets with nuclear missiles, which could be the largest expansion in UK's nuclear deterrence capabilities. The move has the support of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who believes the world faces its worst nuclear threat since the Cold War era. The UK currently lacks the capability to launch nuclear strikes from the air, but acquiring the US-made F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter jets would allow it to do so. The deal would also enable the UK to launch nuclear strikes from air, vastly enhancing its deterrence capabilities. Additionally, the Starmer government plans to manufacture 7,000 long-range weapons and increase its defense spending to 3% of the country's GDP by 2034.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 05:08 PM\nSource:[India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com](https:\/\/www.india.com\/news\/world\/new-twist-in-russia-ukraine-war-as-britain-asks-for-us-nuclear-capable-fighter-jets-to-deter-russia-keir-starmer-govt-accuses-vladimir-putin-of-increasing-global-nuclear-threat-7855616\/)\n\n**Trump Aims For 400 GW Of Nuclear By 2050, 10 Large Reactors Under Construction By 2030**\nFormer US President Donald Trump has announced plans to increase nuclear energy production to 400 GW by 2050, with 10 large reactors expected to be under construction by 2030.

The Doomsday Clock is fast approaching midnight, and the major powers are keeping their nuclear programs closely guarded. The US has 5,044 nuclear warheads, including 400 Minutemen III ICBMs, while Russia has developed a large and diverse nuclear arsenal, including the RS-28 Sarmat or Satan II ICBM, which can launch a maximum payload with a yield of roughly 50 megatons of TNT. Annie Jacobsen describes the effects of a 1-megaton thermonuclear weapon detonation, which would be 'impossible for the human mind to comprehend.' The decision to use nuclear weapons is in the hands of a few people, and the consequences of such a decision would be catastrophic. The article references the heroism of Stanislav Petrov, who prevented a nuclear war in 1983 by deciding that a false alarm was not a real attack. The article concludes that as long as we have states, we will have state coercion, which leads to the threats we're facing now.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 17, 2025 10:07 AM\nSource:[Mises Institute](https:\/\/mises.org\/mises-wire\/one-wrong-decision-and-everything-turns-dust)\n\n**China Accelerates Nuclear Development: Arsenal Approaching 1,000 Warheads**\nAccording to a recent report by the Federation of American Scientists, China currently possesses around 600 nuclear warheads, with many more in production. The study highlights that China is developing its nuclear arsenal at the fastest rate among the nine nuclear-armed states, despite having signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The report, published by the Nuclear Information Project, reveals that since May 2024, China has continued to develop three new missile silo fields for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with solid fuel, as well as proceeding with the construction of new silos for its ICBMs DF-5 with liquid fuel. China is also advancing the development of new ICBM variants and advanced strategic launch systems. The report suggests that Beijing has produced excess warheads for these systems, ready to be used once the launchers are operational. The study also notes the Pentagon's projections, which indicate that China's arsenal will surpass 1,000 warheads by 2030. The 2024 report presented to the US Congress by the Department of Defense revealed that China could have around 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. However, the Nuclear Notebook notes that the growth of the arsenal will depend on China's stockpiles of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and tritium. In 2023, the International Panel on Fissile Materials estimated that China possessed approximately 14 tons of HEU and around 2.9 tons of separated plutonium available for nuclear weapons.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 15, 2025 10:40 AM\nSource:[HDblog.it](https:\/\/www.hdblog.it\/tecnologia\/articoli\/n611841\/cina-espansione-nucleare-2025\/)\n\n**China's Nuclear Ambitions: Aiming for 1,000 Warheads by 2030**\nChina is rapidly increasing its nuclear arsenal, aiming to reach 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030, according to a new study. The country is investing heavily in nuclear weapons, the pinnacle of mass destruction systems, to surpass the United States and become a global superpower. China currently has 600 nuclear warheads and is producing more without pause. The goal is to increase its military deterrence and become a major player in the international order. Analysts note that China's nuclear program will continue to intensify to reach its target, with no end in sight. This development is a cause for concern, as it may lead to increased international tensions, particularly with Russia's recent withdrawal from strategic agreements on nuclear production and use.

China's military strategy, which includes the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and the construction of new missile silos, has been described as a 'significant threat to global security.' The report also notes that China has deployed new and more advanced nuclear weapons, including ICBMs that can be launched from land, air, or sea. The US Defense Department has also estimated that China's nuclear arsenal will reach 1000 by 2030 and 1500 by 2035.

The plants in South Carolina, Washington, Ohio, and Idaho that helped produce the 60,000 atomic bombs have tons of waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years. The production of plutonium and bombs stopped in 1989, but with technological improvements, the country plans to reach a production capacity of at least 80 plutonium cores per year by the mid-2030s. Dr. Carlos Uma\u00f1a, co-president of the International Association of Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, warns that a large-scale nuclear war would not only be quick but also extremely destructive: 'According to the Federation of American Scientists, there are currently 12,000 nuclear warheads in the world, of which 2,000 are at maximum alert, ready to be detonated in just 60 seconds,' he said. Uma\u00f1a also explains that the detonation of these types of arms in the context of a large-scale nuclear war could destroy the planet in just 72 minutes. Uma\u00f1a also highlights the risk of cyberattacks or human errors that could trigger a nuclear explosion accidentally, 'As technology advances, so does the risk of cyberterrorism and human error,' he said.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 01:05 PM\nSource:[elchubut.com.ar](https:\/\/www.elchubut.com.ar\/sociedad\/2025-2-24-10-5-0-durante-40-anos-estados-unidos-produjo-cuatro-bombas-nucleares-al-dia-dejando-un-vasto-legado-de-residuos-radiactivos-toxicos)\n\n**'Nuclear carbon emission bomb': 2b tonne greenhouse gas surge forecast under Coalition**\nAccording to new modelling by the Climate Change Authority, Australia's greenhouse gas emissions would surge by more than 2 billion tonnes under the Coalition's plan for nuclear energy. This would lead to Australia missing its 2030 climate target and struggling to reach the bipartisan pledge for net zero emissions by 2050. Climate Change Authority chairman Matt Kean described the results as a 'nuclear carbon emission bomb' due to the extended use of fossil fuels while waiting for nuclear power. The modelling highlights the cost of running coal-fired power stations for years longer than expected.

The Privatization of Nuclear War. - LewRockwell**\nThe world is closer than ever to a nuclear holocaust, with the US nuclear weapons program set to increase to 2 trillion dollars by 2030. The doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) has been scrapped, and 'offensive' military actions using nuclear warheads are now described as acts of 'self-defense'. The development of tactical nuclear weapons, also known as 'mini-nukes', has been accelerated, with the goal of making nuclear war more 'usable'. The privatization of nuclear war has led to corporations having a direct voice in setting the agenda regarding the use and deployment of nuclear weapons. The US public is not aware that the Truman administration had a secret plan to bomb 66 Soviet cities with 204 atomic bombs in 1945, and those who speak out against the use of nuclear weapons are branded as 'conspiracy theorists'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 04:08 AM\nSource:[Lew Rockwell](https:\/\/www.lewrockwell.com\/?post_type=pending-article&p=900490)\n\n",

This would be a good news for private buyers as well. According to the draft law, companies that purchase new, purely electric vehicles between July 1, 2025, and December 31, 2027, will be able to claim particularly generous depreciation rules. In the year of purchase, 75% of the acquisition costs can be claimed as a tax deduction. In the following year, a further 10% can be deducted. In the subsequent years, the rate decreases: 5% in the second and third year after purchase, 3% in the fourth year, and 2% in the fifth year. This special depreciation also applies to electrically powered commercial vehicles, trucks, and buses. Klingbeil himself describes the measure as an 'Investitions-Booster.' The draft law also includes other investment incentives, such as a special depreciation of up to 30% on other movable assets, such as machines or office equipment, in the period 2025-2027. From 2028, a gradual reduction of the corporate tax rate is planned, from the current 15% to 10% by 2032. The financial consequences for the state budget would be significant, with estimated tax revenue losses of around 48 billion euros by 2029, with the special depreciation for electric vehicles accounting for a significant portion of this amount.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 01:46 PM\nSource:[WEB.DE](https:\/\/web.de\/magazine\/auto\/sonderabschreibung-elektroautos-juli-2025-regierung-elektro-firmenwagen-boosten-41039276)\n\n**Spanish Car Market Sees 14% Growth in May, Electric Vehicles Drive Sales**\nThe Spanish car market experienced a significant boost in May, with a 14% growth in sales compared to the same period last year, bringing the year-to-date total to 14% growth.

The program, which could be approved by the cabinet as early as Wednesday, includes tax relief measures such as improved depreciation options for company-owned electric cars. The package, which is expected to cost around 46 billion euros by 2029, is currently being reviewed by various government departments. If the cabinet approves the program, it will then need to be approved by the Bundestag and Bundesrat. The program's main focus is on an 'Investment Booster' that allows companies to claim up to 30% of investments in movable assets such as machines over the next few years. Another key aspect is the gradual reduction of the corporate tax rate from 15% to 10% by 2032, which is intended to provide companies with long-term security and strengthen Germany as a business location. Additionally, the tax rate for retained profits will be reduced, encouraging companies to invest in research and development. The purchase of electric vehicles will also become more attractive for companies: 75% of the costs can be written off in the year of purchase, followed by a declining balance over the following years. This regulation applies to vehicles purchased between July 2025 and December 2027. The government, consisting of CDU, CSU, and SPD, aims to act quickly and implement the measures before the summer break. Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Lars Klingbeil are optimistic that their tax policies will bring the desired growth boost to the struggling German economy.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 03:55 PM\nSource:[klamm.de](https:\/\/www.klamm.de\/news\/steuerliche-entlastungen-deutschland-zuendet-den-investitions-turbo-64N20250601155544.html)\n\n**Toyota Expands Electric Vehicle Production in North America**\nToyota is expanding its electric vehicle production in North America, with plans to release a new generation of electric cars under the Toyota and Lexus brands.

However, this growth is expected to be hindered by the US government's decision to eliminate subsidies and other policies that support EVs. The IEA had previously estimated that EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) would account for 55% of new car sales in the US by 2030, but this is now expected to be lower due to the elimination of incentives. In contrast, China is expected to have a strong EV market, with the IEA predicting that EVs and PHEVs will account for 80% of new car sales by 2030. The European market is also expected to grow, with EVs and PHEVs accounting for around 30% of new car sales in 2023. However, growth is being hindered by factors such as insufficient charging infrastructure, inconsistent incentives, and high prices. The IEA notes that the elimination of incentives in the US will lead to a decrease in EV sales of 1.1 million units in 2030, and will also cost the US 130,000 jobs in the EV production, battery, and charging infrastructure sectors. The article concludes that the US is at risk of falling behind other countries in the transition to electric vehicles, and that the EU and Italy must take a strong stance on green policies to avoid this fate.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 12:10 AM\nSource:[Corriere Adriatico](https:\/\/www.corriereadriatico.it\/editoriali\/auto_elettriche_usa_resto_del_mondo_germani_editoriale-8858418.html)\n\n**EVs will Make Up 25% of New Car Sales Globally in 2025, up from 20% last Year**\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that electric vehicles (EVs) will make up 25% of new car sales globally in 2025, up from 20% last year.

This development promises to strengthen the local supply chain and reduce dependence on China. The new factories, built by companies like LG Energy Solution, SK On, and Panasonic, represent a significant step forward in the transition to electric mobility in the US. However, the Trump administration's policies may significantly impact the market for electric vehicles. Despite China's continued dominance in global battery production, North America has become the region with the fastest-growing planned production capacity. The 10 new plants that will come online this year will bring the US's annual production capacity to 421.5 gigawatt-hours, nearly doubling that of the previous year. Evan Hartley, analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said, 'the plants are already built. You can't stop the process, and the momentum is there. Most of it is in Republican states. It's hard to take away thousands of promised jobs from your key electoral base.' Despite the Trump administration's threats to eliminate tax incentives for electric vehicles and impose a 25% tariff on vehicles and components from Canada and Mexico, the industry appears determined to continue its path. The localization of battery production could help reduce costs and compensate for potential losses in incentives. Several automakers, including General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Honda, and Ford, have recorded record sales of electric vehicles in the US in recent years, thanks to generous incentives and attractive leasing and financing offers. The challenge now will be to maintain this growth in a potentially less favorable political context. Despite the uncertainties, industry experts believe that the transition to electric vehicles in the US has reached a point of no return.

Scott was only involved in the first film and then returned in 2012 to make the prequel Prometheus, and in 2017 he made his last Alien film, Alien: Covenant. He gave Fede \u00c1lvarez the opportunity to direct the 2024 film Alien: Romulus, which was a critically acclaimed blockbuster. Scott believes that the sequels after his film were not as good, saying, 'I think mine was pretty damn good, and I think Jim's [Cameron's Aliens] was good, and I have to say the rest were not very good.' He also talked about deciding to return to the franchise with Prometheus and Covenant, saying, 'A number of years after, I said, 'I'm going to resurrect this,' [and wrote] Prometheus from scratch-a blank sheet of paper.' Despite this, Scott says he's done with the franchise, but will likely participate in some way in the future. The franchise's future is uncertain, but the success of Romulus may lead to a sequel.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 06:00 PM\nSource:[Movieweb](https:\/\/movieweb.com\/ridley-scott-alien-franchise-future\/)\n\n**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**\nScientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 01:19 PM\nSource:[\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0644](https:\/\/www.arrajol.com\/content\/374847\/%D8%AA%D9%83%D9%86%D9%88%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7\/%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%8B%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%84%D9%81-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85)\n\n**Watch: 'Black Phone 2' to open in theaters Oct. 17 - UPI.com**\nThe horror sequel 'Black Phone 2' is set to open in theaters on October 17, 2025. The film, written, produced, and directed by Scott Derrickson, will feature the return of Ethan Hawke, Mason Thames, Madeline McGraw, and Jeremy Davies from the original 2022 blockbuster. Demian Bichir has joined the ensemble for the follow-up. A synopsis of the film states, 'Four years ago, 13-year-old Finn (Thames) killed his abductor and escaped, becoming the sole survivor of The Grabber (Hawke). But true evil transcends death... and the phone is ringing again.' The film follows Finn, now 17, and his friend Gwen as they uncover a shattering intersection between The Grabber and Gwen's own family's history.

The trailer shows Finn, the main character from the first movie, trying to move on with his life years after killing The Grabber, but his sister Gwen starts to have psychic dreams about the killer again. The Grabber says, 'Hello, Finney. Did you think our story was over?' via the black phone, suggesting that Finn may not have actually killed him after all. The sequel, directed by Scott Derrickson, picks up four years later and follows Finn and his sister as they try to uncover the truth behind The Grabber's return and their own family's history. The trailer hints at a more violent and graphic horror experience, with Derrickson stating that the sequel will be 'more visceral' and 'scarier' to match Finn and Gwen's age.

According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 02:44 PM\nSource:[24.ae](https:\/\/24.ae\/article\/898494\/%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%8A%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%B1-1000-%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%A9-)\n\n**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**\nExperts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 06:51 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https:\/\/tsn.ua\/ru\/nauka_it\/eksperty-po-dolgoletiyu-rasskazali-kogda-lyudi-smogut-zhit-do-1000-let-2840246.html)\n\n**Alien: Earth - A New Chapter in the Alien Franchise**\nThe Alien franchise is set to take a new turn with the upcoming series Alien: Earth, which will explore a futuristic Earth dominated by corporations in the year 2120. The series, created by Noah Hawley and produced by Ridley Scott, follows the story of Wendy, the first human-machine hybrid, as she navigates intense moral dilemmas. In this vision of the future, humanity is no longer in control, but rather five powerful corporations - Prodigy, Weyland-Yutani, Lynch, Dynamic, and Threshold - are engaged in a ruthless struggle for power and technological supremacy. The series will explore the emergence of hybrids, a technological achievement signed by Prodigy Corporation, and will delve into the question of which species is the most monstrous: humans or aliens. The showrunner, Noah Hawley, has stated that the phrase 'Which is the worst species?' - a nod to Ripley's iconic line - has directly influenced the narrative. The series will present five different monsters, including a particularly ferocious Xenomorph, and will follow Wendy as she tries to understand her place in this complex world.

The movie tells a unique first contact story, where aliens are treated as second-class citizens in South Africa. The ending follows Wikus, a human who is gradually transforming into a prawn, as he finds a solution to his problems with the help of Christopher Johnson, an alien. However, Wikus is forced to wait three years for Christopher to return, and in the meantime, he is vilified in the media and forced to live in dire conditions. The movie's ending is devastating, but also thought-provoking, as it explores themes of prejudice, oppression, and the similarities between humans and aliens. Despite the lack of a sequel, District 9's ending remains powerful and has become a classic of the sci-fi genre. 'It's a testament to the film's craftsmanship that its ending still lingers in the memory long after the credits roll,' says the article. 'The movie's broader thematic concerns and its specific sci-fi worldbuilding both offer food for thought.' The article also notes that the ending sets up a sequel nicely, but the fact that a second movie has taken so long hasn't damaged the original's reputation. 'Even if District 10 never materializes, audiences will probably keep watching District 9 for many years,' the article concludes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 01:33 PM\nSource:[ScreenRant](https:\/\/screenrant.com\/district-9-best-sci-fi-movie-endings-op-ed\/)\n\n**Lease Expired: The Day Humanity Learned Earth Was Never Ours**\nA mysterious event occurred when the skies darkened and vast vessels appeared, announcing that humanity's 10,000-year lease on Earth had expired.

Humanity was given 30 days to either restore the planet to its pristine state or find a new home. Dr. Anika Reddy, an astrophysicist, discovered evidence of the ancient pact and became Earth's spokesperson.

The author suggests that humanity's capacity for technological intervention in its own biology could accelerate this process, leading to the emergence of humans with traits similar to those commonly associated with grey aliens, such as reduced pigmentation, enhanced non-visual sensory systems, and reduced size. The article also discusses the possibility of humans adapting to life on the Moon, where they could evolve to have traits such as reduced gravity and radiation resistance. The author argues that this hypothesis offers a compelling framework that unifies disparate fields, including ufology, evolutionary biology, catastrophe theory, and futurism. Dr. Elena Rodriguez notes that 'when faced with extinction-level threats, species often undergo rapid adaptation to secure their survival,' and Dr. Julian Savulescu argues that 'the bioethical questions surrounding human enhancement become existential imperatives in the face of extinction-level threats.' The article concludes that if grey aliens are indeed future humans, their presence may serve as both a warning and hope for humanity's future.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 09, 2025 03:55 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https:\/\/medium.com\/quantum-psychology-and-engineering\/the-descendants-of-darkness-exploring-the-hypothesis-of-grey-aliens-as-future-cave-dwelling-humans-a25b6fa3e9e6)\n\n**The Real Sequel To Ridley Scott's Prometheus Took 12 Years To Happen And Was Much Better Than Alien: Covenant**\nRidley Scott's Alien: Covenant was not a satisfying sequel to Prometheus, but the more recent Alien: Romulus has rectified this issue.

M\u00e9ndez thinks that the next decade or two could bring some tantalizing hints, and 'if we don't find anything at all... that probably collapses the interest and the funding.' Rebecca Charbonneau, a historian of science, notes that 'we have one data point -- that's us,' and that SETI researchers are making a guess based on our preferred own communications technologies.

However, experts agree that a multifaceted approach is necessary to tackle the obesity epidemic, which has failed to make significant progress despite decades of initiatives. The World Health Organisation predicts that the number of people with obesity will double by 2035. Research has shown that obesity is a complex, costly, and chronic disease caused by factors beyond an individual's control, including the addictive effects of ultra-processed food. Abela has proposed a 'multifaceted approach' that includes policy decisions to shape the food environment, addressing social and economic factors, and increasing collaboration with the private sector and professionals on the ground. He has also floated the introduction of a sugar tax and announced a research programme on food labelling, supply, and promotion. Abela's efforts are seen as a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to make obesity a national priority and safeguard future generations from the long-term health and economic consequences of the disease.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 04:30 AM\nSource:[timesofmalta.com](https:\/\/timesofmalta.com\/article\/editorial-shifting-scales-requires-bold-action.1110623)\n\n**80% of People with Obesity are Women, Says Nutritionist**\nAccording to Daisy Rivas, a nutritionist at the Te\u00f3filo D\u00e1vila hospital, there is a high percentage of obesity in the country, with at least 10-13 out of 15 patients she sees per week suffering from obesity, and the majority of them are women. Rivas emphasizes that this problem affects people of all ages, from children to adults and the elderly, with around 80-90% of patients presenting with obesity. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 1 billion people (1 in 8) worldwide suffer from obesity, a figure that was expected to reach 2030 but has already become a reality in 2024. Rivas highlights the importance of education in preventing obesity, suggesting that parents, especially mothers, learn and teach their children how to eat a balanced diet. She also warns against the dangers of processed and ultra-processed foods, as well as fast food, which can lead to weight gain and other health problems. Rivas recommends consulting a nutritionist for a personalized treatment plan, rather than following 'miracle diets' that can cause imbalances and harm.

By 2030, it's estimated that 27 million people in Turkey will be obese, or one in three. Experts attribute this trend to insufficient nutrition, social inequality, unhealthy food supplies, and a lack of coherent policy strategies. Hacer Foggo, a Turkish poverty researcher, said the growing number of obese children can be linked to extreme poverty, while Bulent Sik, a food researcher, sees a direct link between the rise in child obesity and the widespread consumption of highly processed foods with low nutritional value and a high sugar content. Sik also warned of the use of toxic chemicals in food production, such as pesticides and certain additives that are related to hormonal imbalances and weight gain. Turkey's Health Ministry has launched a national public health campaign to combat obesity, but experts say the effort has drawn criticism for stigmatizing overweight individuals and overlooking the country's broader economic struggles. 'Political decision-makers are responsible for creating solutions,' said Sik. Both Sik and Foggo support a nationwide free school meal program, citing the need for adequate guidelines for healthy eating and restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy foods.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 05:33 AM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/turkey-sees-sharp-rise-in-obesity\/a-72701125)\n\n**More than half of young people will face health problems by 2030**\nA new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, more than 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity and overweight have increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The document also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. In 2016, fewer than 1,000 adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, but by 2021, the number had already exceeded 1.1 billion. Another concerning aspect is the role that climate change and technology will play. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with an average annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. According to UN estimates, by 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24. This generation faces a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 08:35 PM\nSource:[agenciapi.co](https:\/\/www.agenciapi.co\/noticia\/salud\/en-2030-mas-de-la-mitad-de-los-jovenes-enfrentaran-problemas-de-salud)\n\n**2025's Most Overweight and Obese Cities in the U.S.**\nAccording to a study by WalletHub, nearly 42 percent of U.S. adults are classified as obese, with some areas of the country struggling more than others.

The study, which includes data from 204 countries and territories, is based on the Global Burden of Disease, a large program funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which aims to compile health data from most countries. The authors estimate that the inaction of governments in the face of the growing crisis of obesity and overweight over the past 30 years has led to an alarming explosion in the number of people affected. Between 1990 and 2021, this number almost tripled among adults over 25 years old, from 731 million to 2.11 billion, and more than doubled among children and adolescents aged 5-24, from 198 million to 493 million. 'Without urgent policy reform and concrete actions, 60% of adults, or 3.8 billion people, and nearly a third (31%) of children and adolescents, or 746 million, will be overweight or obese by 2050,' according to the study. To face 'one of the greatest health challenges of the 21st century,' it is necessary to adopt five-year action plans (2025-2030) with key measures: 'regulate the advertising of ultra-processed foods, integrate sports infrastructure and playgrounds into schools, encourage breastfeeding and balanced diets from pregnancy, and develop nutrition policies adapted to each country,' say its authors. 'In 2050, one in three young people suffering from obesity, or 130 million, will live in two regions: North Africa and the Middle East, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean, with serious health, economic, and social consequences,' they note. Obesity among young people is expected to jump by 121% worldwide, with a total of 360 million children and adolescents obese by 2050. The first affected, with a strong expected increase from 2022-2030 worldwide, are boys aged 5-14: in 2030, we should count in this category more obese (16.5%) than overweight young people (12.9%). This obesity epidemic will further strain already overburdened healthcare systems, particularly in low-resource countries, as nearly a quarter of obese adults worldwide will be 65 years or older in 2050. 'Preventing obesity must be a top priority in policies in low- and middle-income countries,' estimates Dr. Jessica Kerr of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia, one of the main co-authors of the study. She calls for 'much stronger political commitment' in favor of 'global strategies that improve nutrition, physical activity, and living environments for people,' judging the window of action to be short.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 06:48 AM\nSource:[SudOuest.fr](https:\/\/www.sudouest.fr\/international\/obesite-60-des-adultes-seront-atteints-d-ici-2050-dans-le-monde-une-etude-plaide-pour-une-action-urgente-23497103.php)\n\n**12% Indians are overweight or live with obesity compared to 49% Americans: Lancet study**\nAccording to a Lancet study, 12.41% of Indians (180 million out of 1.45 billion) are overweight or living with obesity, compared to 49.71% of Americans (172 million out of 346 million).

It is followed by two other private American universities, MIT and Stanford. Cambridge and Oxford in the UK, respectively in 4th and 5th place, are the public institutions with the highest score in the world. Despite winning eight of the top ten positions, the US is struggling to maintain its dominance globally. In the Global 2000 ranking, only 40 American universities have improved their position compared to 2024, with 15 maintaining their position and 264 falling in the ranking. The best public American university is Berkeley, ranked 12th in the world, one place behind Caltech. The US is the second country with the most representatives in the Global 2000 ranking with 319 institutions, ten fewer than last year. Canada has 38 institutions in the ranking, led by the University of Toronto at 23rd place. Nadim Mahassen, president of World University Rankings, comments: 'Although the US still boasts the best universities in the world, the decline of the vast majority of its higher education institutions should concern US Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and the entire Trump administration. At a time when Chinese universities are reaping the fruits of years of generous financial support from their government, American institutions are struggling with federal funding cuts and controversies over academic freedom and free speech. With the US surpassed by China as the country with the most representatives in the ranking, its reputation in the global higher education sector is seriously threatened.'

This has further solidified the labor force foundation for building a large-scale high-quality innovative army. China Science and Technology Association (CSTA) officials explained that the survey is divided into four levels: 'high-level scientific literacy', 'scientific literacy', 'basic scientific literacy', and 'low scientific literacy'.

The official believes that this group can adapt to the development of the times, provide a large-scale human resource foundation for economic and social development, and lay a solid foundation for the continuous improvement of citizen scientific literacy. There is no concept of 'not having scientific literacy' in the survey, and the results are not intended to imply that there is a group of people who do not have scientific literacy.

The results not only open or close doors to China's most prestigious universities, but also directly affect professional success in China and social mobility for each applicant. As a Chinese official said, 'The security of the gaokao is a matter of educational justice.' The exam tests knowledge and also measures the ability to withstand pressure. The test lasts between two and four days, depending on the province, with days that exceed nine hours. Students must take exams in Chinese language, mathematics, and foreign language, and also choose subjects such as physics, chemistry, history, or politics. It's not enough to pass; the system prioritizes those who achieve better results than the rest. Intensive preparation begins in childhood. Many adolescents study between 10 and 12 hours a day. Achieving a high score can mean accessing one of the country's top 50 universities, with salaries that exceed those of graduates from lower-ranked centers by up to 30%. As a Weibo user said, 'For many, the gaokao is the only path to success.' The exams are printed under the supervision of the Ministry of Education and the National Administration of State Secrets Protection, usually in highly secure prisons. The selected teachers who design them remain isolated for weeks, without access to the internet or mobile phones. They can only communicate with family members through fixed phones under state control. During the exam days, surveillance cameras, GPS systems, and drones are used to prevent cheating, which is punishable by up to seven years in prison in China. In cities like Beijing, construction is suspended and exclusive public transportation is provided for students. The protection of the exams, according to official media, reaches security levels above those of a bank.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 06:54 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https:\/\/larepublica.pe\/mundo\/2025\/06\/01\/el-gaokao-el-examen-mas-dificil-del-mundo-que-define-la-vida-de-millones-en-china-y-se-custodia-como-un-secreto-de-estado-lrchn-88501)\n\n**Transcript: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" June 1, 2025**\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared on 'Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan' on June 1, 2025, to discuss various topics, including the US-China trade relationship, tariffs, and the national debt.

He also mentioned that the inflation numbers are the best in four years, contradicting earlier predictions of big inflation. Bessent emphasized that the US will never default on its debt and that the country is on the warning track but will not hit the wall.

China scored only 10 out of 100, indicating a severe situation of internet freedom. Other highly restricted countries include Iran, Myanmar, and Cuba. Vietnam, which ranks fifth on the list, is following China's footsteps. China's 'Great Firewall' system controls internet traffic within and outside the country, allowing the government to filter content. Iran and North Korea also use similar systems. This model is becoming popular in Southeast Asia, with Cambodia and Thailand considering adopting similar strict internet policies. Tight internet regulations are common in the Middle East and North Africa, with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bahrain ranking high on the list. Russia ranked 11th in the report, with measures including blocking online content, blocking platforms, spreading false information, cyber attacks, and taking action against users. The report clearly shows how some governments are using the internet as a means of control and surveillance, affecting citizens' freedom of expression. \nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 04:04 AM\nSource:[hindi](https:\/\/www.abplive.com\/technology\/china-has-acquired-such-power-that-it-can-wreak-havoc-all-over-the-world-2954435)\n\n**USWNT player ratings vs China: Emma Hayes' side never threatened as Lindsey Heaps, Sam Coffey, Cat Macario score in dominant display | Goal.com US**\nThe USWNT dominated China in a 3-0 win, with Catarina Macario, Sam Coffey, and Lindsey Heaps scoring the goals.

In the 2025 World Press Freedom Index, 20 out of 32 countries and territories in the region saw their economic score decrease. Many independent media outlets in Myanmar have been dismantled and forced into exile or clandestinity. Hong Kong and Cambodia have seen media closures and journalist departures, often forced into exile under precarious conditions. Radio Free Asia's shortwave programs in Mandarin, Tibetan, and Laotian have been suspended. Concentration and collusion with the power of politics dominate the majority of media groups, with Thailand, Mongolia, and Pakistan being among the most skilled at controlling the media. RSF notes that some countries, such as North Korea, China, and Vietnam, have completely suppressed any form of independent media. As one commenter noted, 'Personne ne parle de la France, aucune libert\u00e9 de l\u2019information dans les grands m\u00e9dias' ('Nobody talks about France, no freedom of information in the major media').

The organization's annual ranking has seen China's ranking improve from 179 to 172 in 2024, but it has since dropped to 178. RSF's White Orlan explained, 'China's restrictions on press freedom have become more severe in recent years. Those who still insist on independent reporting are almost impossible to find. Many have been forced to work underground. As soon as the authorities discover someone doing independent reporting or publishing articles under their real name, they become a target for persecution.' Foreign journalists also face various restrictions, including strict visa approval policies and frequent smear campaigns. Hong Kong's press freedom ranking has dropped from 135 to 140, with a record-low score of 39. RSF has classified Hong Kong as 'very serious' for the first time. Taiwan's press freedom ranking has improved to 24, but RSF believes there is still room for improvement.

According to labor lawyer Juanma Lorente, companies could apply this reduction in several ways, including reducing the working day by 30 minutes, working fewer hours in the summer months, or increasing the number of vacation days. If the law is approved, workers could receive 12 more days of vacation, bringing the total to 42 days per year. Lorente explained that this option would be calculated on an annual basis, not weekly. The government aims to implement the new law before the end of 2025, which would also include measures such as digital time control, the 'right to disconnect' outside of working hours, and stricter penalties for companies that fail to comply with the new regulations.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 06:13 PM\nSource:[as](https:\/\/as.com\/actualidad\/sociedad\/los-espanoles-que-tendran-42-dias-de-vacaciones-en-2026-si-se-aprueba-la-reduccion-de-la-jornada-laboral-n\/)\n\n**Socialdemokraterna: ett fegt h\u00f6gerparti**\nThe Swedish Social Democratic Party (S) has continued to move to the right by demanding harsher punishments and more money for the military.

The article concludes that the party's decision is 'historical' and a clear message that work hours need to be shortened. Meanwhile, the Swedish Employers' Association (Svenskt N\u00e4ringsliv) has already reduced their workweek to 32 hours. 'It was a cowardly and watered-down proposal,' Strandh\u00e4ll said.

The analysis compared the number of unicorns (companies with a valuation of over $10 billion) in the EU and the US, with the US having 690 unicorns (total valuation of $253 billion) compared to the EU's 107 unicorns (valuation of $33.3 billion). The WSJ attributes this to the EU's declining labor culture, with a decrease in working hours and labor productivity compared to the US. In 1999, EU labor productivity was 95% of US labor productivity, but it has now decreased to below 80%. Additionally, EU workers have shorter working hours than US workers, with an average of 30.2 hours per week in 2023 compared to 34.6 hours per week in the US. Experts predict that this situation will not change in the near future, as the EU prioritizes stability, job security, and quality of life over long working hours and risk-taking.

According to Krisstin Petersmarck, National Social Security Advisor, the number of beneficiaries is outpacing the number of workers paying into the system, and by 2040, the ratio of workers to beneficiaries is projected to drop to 2.3. Jonathan Ford Jr., a financial advisor, advises millennials to plan for retirement as if Social Security won't be around forever, and to take responsibility for their own retirement. He suggests that if necessary changes are made to preserve Social Security, it would be a bonus, and that millennials should consider early retirement or spending more during retirement. 'It is no secret that the Social Security trust fund is facing trouble,' Petersmarck wrote. 'The fact is, more people are leaving the workforce than entering it.'

He claims that the current generation is lazy and that a four-day workweek and work-life balance will not be sustainable. However, the data shows that Germans are actually working more hours than ever before, with a record number of people employed in 2024 and a significant increase in total working hours since 2019. The average working time has decreased due to more people working part-time, but this is a result of more people entering the workforce, including those with family or care responsibilities. In contrast, countries like Poland and the US have much longer working hours, which is not a new phenomenon. The real issue is that Germany's productivity has stagnated, which is a major concern for the country's future. As the population ages, Germany will need to find ways to maintain its standard of living, and increasing productivity is a key solution. Merz's proposal to work more is not a solution to the demographic crisis, but rather a distraction from the real issue of productivity. The new government's ideas to mobilize more workforce, such as tax-free overtime bonuses or reduced taxes for those who continue to work after retirement, are a step in the right direction.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 10:34 AM\nSource:[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung](https:\/\/www.sueddeutsche.de\/meinung\/arbeitszeit-deutsche-merz-debatte-produktivitaet-li.3261704)\n\n**There are no boundaries left**\nThe author reflects on the impact of the internet on their generation, noting that they are one of the last to remember a time before widespread internet use.

According to a 2023 McKinsey study, up to 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated by 2030. Real-world examples, such as tech company layoffs in 2024, suggest that AI-driven automation is already contributing to significant job cuts, with a 44% wave of job cuts reported. As AI continues to transform industries, it's essential to consider both sides of the argument and prepare for the future of work.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 07:13 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https:\/\/medium.com\/@ThecodeCrafter\/is-ai-a-threat-to-human-employment-the-truth-no-one-wants-to-admit-99f2546ca7a3)\n\n**Can AI save American manufacturing from collapse?**\nAmerican manufacturing is facing a severe skills gap, with over 2.1 million jobs potentially going unfilled by 2030, according to Heather Carroll, Chief Revenue Officer at Path Robotics. Carroll emphasizes that this is a 'national problem' that requires immediate attention. She believes that AI can bridge the labor gap, allowing robots to adapt and make decisions on the fly, and augment human capabilities. Carroll stresses that the problem is accelerating and that action must be taken now to avoid being left behind. She describes the current moment as a 'make or break' point for the United States in terms of skilled labor, but also sees opportunities for growth and innovation if leaders adopt AI technology now.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 04:11 PM\nSource:[theceomagazine.com](https:\/\/www.theceomagazine.com\/business\/executive-interview-feature\/can-ai-save-american-manufacturing-from-collapse\/)\n\n**Mexico Aims to Reduce Working Hours to 40 per Week by 2030**\nThe Mexican government has announced plans to reduce the working hours from 48 to 40 hours per week by 2030. This move is expected to improve the quality of life for employees, providing them with more time for rest and family. Eduardo Alan\u00eds, a representative of the Frente por las 40 horas de M\u00e9xico, stated, 'Having more rest time implies better health for workers. For companies, this means less turnover, which is a positive economic factor.' However, some employers and business owners are opposed to the initiative, fearing it will lead to decreased productivity and competitiveness. Alan\u00eds countered, 'We know they have a higher level of dissemination for what they have to say, but we have data from studies in Spain that show a 53% increase in productivity per hour after reducing working hours.' He also pointed out that technology now offers tools to help workers complete their tasks in less time, and that studies have shown that employees are productive for less than 8 hours a day.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 10, 2025 09:54 PM\nSource:[France 24](https:\/\/www.france24.com\/es\/programas\/econom%C3%ADa\/20250510-economia-reduccion-jornada-laboral-salud)\n\n**Mexico to Gradually Reduce Working Week to 40 Hours by 2030**\nThe Secretary of Labor and Social Welfare, Marath Bola\u00f1os L\u00f3pez, announced that the gradual reduction of the working week from 48 to 40 hours will begin in 2026.

'We are convinced that putting this free time in their hands will contribute to national development, the well-being of their families, and happiness,' he added.

The proposed reform aims to modify Article 123 of the Mexican Constitution to ensure workers have a maximum of 40 hours of work and two days of rest for every five days worked. By 2030, the goal is for all workers to have at least two days of rest per week. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Mexico is the second country with the most working hours in the world. The OECD measures working hours by calculating the total effective working hours per year, divided by the average annual number of employees. This includes regular hours for full-time, part-time, and annual employees, as well as overtime, whether paid or not, and additional work hours. The OECD excludes hours not worked due to holidays, paid vacations, illness, injury, temporary incapacity, maternity or paternity leave, training or education, technical or economic layoffs, strikes or labor conflicts, inclement weather, absences for compensation, and other reasons. 'The objective is to guarantee two days of rest per week by 2030,' said L\u00f3pez.

However, the opposite has occurred, and people are working more than ever. Researcher Prof Kevin Murphy from the University of Limerick notes that the more people earn, the less likely they are to take time off, and the reward for work becomes more work. The concept of 'enough' is also elusive, leading to the question of why people clock in and out every day. Is it for a paycheck or a sense of purpose? In a recent podcast, presenter Ella McSweeney explores this topic with Prof Murphy, discussing the challenges of work and potential solutions.

'It would be good if we could move towards a 40-hour workweek for more employees,' he said to the German Press Agency in Berlin. Currently, the average weekly working hours in Germany are 34.3 hours, according to the Federal Statistical Office. Dulger noted that Germany has 46 million employees, but they do not work significantly more than they did 20 years ago, despite having fewer employees and inhabitants at the time. Dulger emphasized that Germany needs to increase its efficiency. 'We need to make work pay again, and there should be more net income from gross income,' he said. Germany is already facing a shortage of skilled workers, and with the baby boomer generation retiring in the coming years, the country will face a significant loss of employees.

Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, predicts that Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030 in her company's 'Bull Case' scenario, requiring a 58% annual compound growth rate over the next five years, primarily driven by increasing institutional adoption. Robert Kiyosaki, a popular financial educator and author of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', predicts a more modest price of $1 million for Bitcoin by 2035. Kiyosaki believes that until 2035, a Bitcoin will be worth more than $1 million, gold will be at $30,000, and silver will be at $3,000 per coin, citing record-high federal and credit card debt in the United States in 2025 as the main factor for the search for protection assets like precious metals and Bitcoin. Other analysts, including Raoul Pal, point to the devaluation of fiat currencies as a key reason for Bitcoin's appeal as a protection asset. Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, also predicts that Bitcoin will reach $1 million, highlighting its potential to 'transform the global economy in incredible ways'. Markus Thielen, CEO and head of research at 10x Research, notes that Bitcoin's price historically moves in increments of $16,000, indicating that the next significant resistance for Bitcoin is near $122,000. Andr\u00e9 Dragosch, European research head at Bitwise, predicts that Bitcoin could extend its rally to a top above $200,000 by the end of 2025, citing a model proposed by Canadian Bitcoin investor Greg Foss that evaluates Bitcoin based on a basket of G20 sovereign bonds.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[Exame](https:\/\/exame.com\/future-of-money\/bitcoin-a-us-1-milhao-ate-2030-grandes-nomes-preveem-forte-alta-impulsionada-por-dividas\/)\n\n**Ripple Price Prediction 2021, 2025, 2030**\nExperts predict that Ripple's price could rise from its current level of $0.46 to $2 in 2021. Some experts predict that by 2023, the value of Ripple could reach $3. Others predict that if XRP adoption reaches expected levels, we could see the price of Ripple go up to $5 in 2024, with XRP potentially oscillating between $4-$8. The majority of predictions state that the value of Ripple will be around $6 for most of 2025. Long-term price predictions for XRP state that the digital currency could reach $17 by 2030. Ripple's CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, says that they want to make XRP a valuable payment tool, and its value will increase as a result. Ripple is different from Bitcoin in that it is controlled by a company that works with banks, and XRP cannot be extracted. It can process 1,500 transactions per second, compared to Bitcoin's 7 transactions per second.

Experts predict that artificial intelligence, tokenized properties, and gold will be the top investment choices in the coming years. Currently, approximately 48.7% of global investments are in real estate, with a total value of $380 trillion. Bonds and stocks follow, with $133 trillion and $124 trillion, respectively. Gold and cryptocurrencies trail behind, with a total market value of $22.4 trillion and $3.6 trillion, respectively. Despite being the least popular investment option, cryptocurrencies have provided the highest returns to investors in recent years. For example, Bitcoin has increased by approximately 3100% since 2018. In contrast, gold has grown by 167%, stocks by 66%, bonds by 29.4%, and global real estate by 22.5% over the same period. Experts believe that investment preferences will shift towards digital and thematic areas in the future, driven by economic, technological, demographic, and climate factors. Tokenized properties, which are becoming increasingly popular, may reduce the high entry costs associated with real estate. Younger investors are turning to digital assets with smaller capital, while aging populations may lead to decreased demand for housing in some countries. Traditional safe-haven assets like bonds are losing their appeal due to rising government debt and declining credit ratings. Stock markets, on the other hand, continue to offer long-term investment opportunities in sectors like artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, cloud technology, and biotechnology. Gold remains a popular investment option during times of uncertainty, but experts warn that factors like space mining may increase gold supply and drive down prices in the future. Cryptocurrencies are growing as an alternative to traditional finance, with an estimated 560 million people, or 7% of the global population, using them by 2024. According to ARK Invest, the value of this market could reach $12 trillion by 2030 and $50 trillion by 2050.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 09:16 AM\nSource:[D\u00fcnya](https:\/\/www.dunya.com\/finans\/haberler\/emlak-zirvede-kripto-ucuz-yatirimci-tercihleri-nereye-evriliyor-haberi-778745)\n\n**Is Bitcoin About to Soar -- or Crash? | The Motley Fool**\nBitcoin has reached a new all-time high of $112,000, leading some investors to believe it will continue to soar in 2025.

According to Lemon, the cryptocurrency has traded at $109,002 at 8:45 am today, with 0% growth in the last 24 hours. In contrast, most popular cryptocurrencies have experienced slight declines, except for Ethereum, which has risen by 3.1%. Willy Woo, a bitcoin analyst since 2016, has warned that the upward trend is starting to decline and may be followed by a period of consolidation. 'We're preparing for another solid streak in the long term,' he said. Despite its volatility, the growing institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors present a promising scenario for bitcoin. US Treasurer Rosie R\u00edos has stated that both bitcoin and blockchain 'are here to stay.' 'The world is watching us. We're setting the pace for what will happen not only in our history, but also in the future, and for all of us, this is the American dream. It's about the values that founded our country,' she said at the Bitcoin Conference 2025. The current US President, Donald Trump, has become a key figure in the industry, promising to create a bitcoin reserve and launching two cryptocurrencies, US$TRUMP and US$MELANIA. Marcelo Cavazzoli, founder and CEO of Lemon, noted that the last historical maximum has seen the highest volume of purchases and sales in the last three months and the most users interacting with Bitcoin in the last year. 'The interest is no longer just from retail. Today we see funds, companies, governments, and even proposals to incorporate bitcoin into state reserves. Institutional adoption is at a different speed: ETFs are opening the door, and every dollar that enters is transformed into a real BTC purchase,' he said. From Bitso, another major cryptocurrency platform in the region, they also celebrated this new record. 'The Bitcoin Pizza Day marks a key milestone in the history of cryptocurrencies: it recalls the first commercial transaction with bitcoin. Today, with a market capitalization of around $1.9 trillion, cryptocurrencies continue to challenge traditional models,' explained Juli\u00e1n Colombo, general manager of Bitso Argentina. Guilherme Nazar, regional vice president of Binance for Latin America, stated: 'The new historical maximum of bitcoin speaks of its resilience in the face of uncertainty and its growing relevance, a sign of confidence from both individuals and institutions. That this milestone was achieved on Bitcoin Pizza Day is a symbolic reminder that the value of cryptocurrencies is not a speculative theater, but something tangible, global, and deeply human.' The boom in Argentina is also reflected locally. According to the Panorama Cripto in Am\u00e9rica Latina report, Argentina leads the region in the value received in cryptocurrencies, with $91.1 billion between July 2023 and June 2024. Bitcoin represents 49% of cryptocurrency portfolios in the country, dominating over other digital currencies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 02:27 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https:\/\/www.lanacion.com.ar\/economia\/IA\/bitcoin-se-mantiene-arriba-de-los-us109000-nid29052025\/)\n\n**'Orange is the new gold': Bitcoin Predictions Soar to New Heights**\nThe Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas has become the epicenter of an unprecedented wave of optimism in the crypto world. Major figures in the sector have made vertiginous predictions for the cryptocurrency, with scenarios of $200,000 and even $1 million becoming increasingly consensual. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, said, 'The bitcoin is no longer an alternative, it's the new standard. Orange is the new gold.' He believes that the bitcoin, associated with the color orange in its logo, will surpass gold as a global reserve value, as younger generations prefer digital assets to precious metals.

Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, predicts that Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030 in her company's 'Bull Case' scenario, requiring a 58% annual compound growth rate over the next five years, primarily driven by increasing institutional adoption. Robert Kiyosaki, a popular financial educator and author of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', predicts a more modest price of $1 million for Bitcoin by 2035. Kiyosaki believes that until 2035, a Bitcoin will be worth more than $1 million, gold will be at $30,000, and silver will be at $3,000 per coin, citing record-high federal and credit card debt in the United States in 2025 as the main factor for the search for protection assets like precious metals and Bitcoin. Other analysts, including Raoul Pal, point to the devaluation of fiat currencies as a key reason for Bitcoin's appeal as a protection asset. Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, also predicts that Bitcoin will reach $1 million, highlighting its potential to 'transform the global economy in incredible ways'. Markus Thielen, CEO and head of research at 10x Research, notes that Bitcoin's price historically moves in increments of $16,000, indicating that the next significant resistance for Bitcoin is near $122,000. Andr\u00e9 Dragosch, European research head at Bitwise, predicts that Bitcoin could extend its rally to a top above $200,000 by the end of 2025, citing a model proposed by Canadian Bitcoin investor Greg Foss that evaluates Bitcoin based on a basket of G20 sovereign bonds.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[Exame](https:\/\/exame.com\/future-of-money\/bitcoin-a-us-1-milhao-ate-2030-grandes-nomes-preveem-forte-alta-impulsionada-por-dividas\/)\n\n**Bitcoin's New All-Time-High Brings Free Beer for All**\nA banker's generous donation of $150,000 in Bitcoin has led to a free beer party for all passengers on a train.

This discovery, led by a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under the direction of astronomer Rohan Naidu, represents a significant milestone in observational astronomy and raises new questions for cosmology. MoM-z14 has a redshift of 14.44, making it the most distant galaxy confirmed by spectroscopy, surpassing the previous record held by JADES-GS-z14-0 with a z=14.32. The discovery was made through the Mirage program, a spectroscopic survey designed to identify galaxies with high redshifts, indicating great distance and age. MoM-z14 was detected through a 10-hour observation with the NIRSpec instrument on the Webb telescope, capturing its stretched infrared light due to the universe's expansion. The spectroscopic signal showed clear emissions of hydrogen and oxygen, indicating the presence of multiple generations of stars. Charlotte Mason, an astrophysicist from the University of Copenhagen, said, 'It's very exciting because it confirms that these bright galaxies really exist in the universe.' MoM-z14 is not only notable for its age but also for its structure and composition. The galaxy has a diameter of just 1600 light-years, placing it in the range of dwarf galaxies. However, it shines with an intensity that surprised researchers, with a luminosity 100 times greater than expected for objects of that age, challenging current models of the universe's early structure evolution. The chemical composition of MoM-z14 caught the attention of astrophysicists, revealing an elevated nitrogen-to-carbon ratio, an unusual feature in such primitive objects. This characteristic recalls the chemistry of ancient globular clusters in the Milky Way, dense star formations that exist since the early stages of our galaxy. This parallel led scientists to propose that MoM-z14 could represent an early example of star formation in environments similar to those clusters. 'It's like finding a cosmic fossil that connects the past and present of the cosmos,' explained the researchers in the work published on the arXiv preprint server last week. Additionally, the data revealed details about its immediate surroundings, showing that the space around MoM-z14 appears partially ionized, contrary to predictions from simulation models. This feature implies that the galaxy's ultraviolet radiation could have altered the state of the surrounding gas, suggesting an earlier start to the reionization process. Until now, it was believed that this phenomenon occurred in a context dominated by neutral gas. However, the observation of MoM-z14 indicates that certain sectors of the universe were already ionized 280 million years after the Big Bang.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 12:26 PM\nSource:[albertonews.com](https:\/\/albertonews.com\/internacionales\/telescopio-espacial-james-webb-rompio-su-propio-record-y-observo-la-galaxia-mas-antigua\/)\n\n**Historic Discovery of Star Formation in the Andalusian Region: A Study Confirms How Stars are Born in the Milky Way**\nA team of international scientists has captured the process of star formation in a region of the universe with extreme conditions, using the James Webb Space Telescope and joint research between universities and centers. The area, known as Sagittarius C, is located 200 light-years from Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole at the galactic center. The region has a dense molecular gas cloud that has been collapsing slowly for millions of years, generating the formation of thousands of young stars. The study, led by the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia (IAA-CSIC), has detected intense magnetic fields that traverse Sagittarius C, configuring hot hydrogen gas into long, bright filaments. According to Samuel Crowe, researcher at the University of Virginia, 'these magnetic fields give Sagittarius C a different appearance than any other star-forming region in the galaxy outside the galactic center.' The scientists believe that these magnetic fields may slow down or even prevent the gravitational collapse necessary for star formation, explaining why regions like the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) produce fewer stars than expected. The team has also identified over a hundred jets of material, linked to low-mass proto-stars, and even recorded, for the first time in the infrared, jets associated with two massive stars with 20 times the mass of the Sun. Rub\u00e9n Fedriani, researcher at the IAA and supervisor of the project, notes that 'the main objective of these observations was the study of star formation processes, particularly of massive stars, that is, those with more than eight times the mass of the Sun.' This discovery suggests that star formation in this area follows similar processes to the rest of the galaxy, demonstrating that even in extreme environments like the galactic center, new stars can be born. Despite its intense current activity, experts warn that the life of Sagittarius C as a star nursery may be coming to an end.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 06:00 AM\nSource:[okdiario.com](https:\/\/okdiario.com\/ciencia\/hallazgo-historico-astrofisicos-andaluces-estudio-confirma-como-nacen-estrellas-via-lactea-14836626)\n\n**Cosmic Collision Observed, Galaxy's Star-Forming Ability Reduced**\nAstronomers observed a cosmic collision between two galaxies using the VLT and ALMA telescopes, operated by the OES in Chile. The galaxies are moving towards each other at 500 kilometers per second and will collide. One galaxy uses a quasar to 'pierce' the other galaxy with radiation. According to the OES, the light from the collision took over 11 billion years to reach Earth, allowing astronomers to observe it as it was when the Universe was 18% of its current age. The quasar's radiation 'breaks' the gas and dust clouds of the impacted galaxy, leaving behind only small and dense regions. The OES states that these regions are 'probably too small' to form new stars, leaving the galaxy with 'fewer star-forming nurseries'. 'This is a unique opportunity to study the effects of a cosmic collision on galaxy evolution,' said the OES in a statement.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 09:39 PM\nSource:[expressodasilhas.cv](https:\/\/expressodasilhas.cv\/eitec\/2025\/05\/21\/observada-colisao-cosmica-que-reduz-capacidade-de-galaxia-formar-estrelas\/97155)\n\n**Historic Observation: Cosmic Duel Discovered Between Galaxies**\nAn international team led by scientists from France and Chile has successfully observed the collision process of two galaxies 11 billion light-years away. In this rare event, one galaxy is attacking the other with strong radiation beams, weakening its star-forming capacity. Scientists have described this interaction as a 'cosmic duel', similar to medieval jousting tournaments. The observation was made using data from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope over a period of four years. Researchers observed that the attacking galaxy is sending radiation beams from a supermassive black hole at its center, known as a quasar, to the opposing galaxy. According to NASA, quasars are bright structures formed when matter falling into a black hole heats up to millions of degrees. The strong beams of light from these structures are dispersing the gas clouds in the opposing galaxy, preventing the formation of new stars. Normally, stars form when a large amount of gas and dust collapses under its own gravity. However, in this observed event, the quasar's beam is breaking up and dispersing the gas, making it impossible for new stars to form. The research suggests that the material from the attacked galaxy is feeding the black hole, increasing its power and further weakening the galaxy's star-forming mechanism. Sergei Balashev, a co-author from the Ioffe Institute in Russia, says, 'This is the first direct observation of a quasar's effect on the molecular gas of a nearby galaxy.' This type of effect has only been theoretically discussed before. When scientists tried to study this quasar in more detail using low-resolution telescope data, they discovered that it was actually two separate galaxies interacting. The high-resolution power of the ALMA telescope revealed that the galaxies are separated by thousands of light-years. Since the light from these galaxies has been traveling to us for 11 billion years, scientists believe that they may have merged by now, but it is impossible to confirm. Dong-Woo Kim from the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics notes that galaxy mergers were more common in the early universe when the universe was denser. During this period, galaxies frequently merged to form larger systems. Kim believes that galaxy mergers are still happening today, and even the Milky Way is expected to merge with the Andromeda Galaxy in a few billion years.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 11:57 AM\nSource:[Cumhuriyet](https:\/\/www.cumhuriyet.com.tr\/yasam\/astronomlardan-tarihi-gozlem-galaksiler-arasinda-kozmik-duello-kesfedildi-2405930)\n\n**Astronomers Observe Destruction of Star Clusters in Galaxy Collision**\nAstronomers have observed the destruction of star clusters in a galaxy colliding with another for the first time. This was made possible by data from the VLT and ALMA telescopes, which observed a pair of galaxies 11 billion light-years away. The observations showed how the powerful radiation of a quasar, the active core of one of the galaxies, affects its neighbor, destroying gas clouds and stopping the process of star formation. The collision of galaxies is a natural phenomenon that is considered a catalyst for the activation of quasars. A quasar is a region around a supermassive black hole that emits a huge amount of energy, absorbing material from the surrounding environment. The ultraviolet and X-ray radiation of the quasar can ionize gas and dust in the neighboring galaxy, changing its structure. Such processes have not been well studied, as most similar events occurred in the first billion years after the Big Bang. The VLT telescope instruments recorded the spectrum of radiation in a wide range, from ultraviolet to infrared, allowing the identification of individual atoms and molecules, as well as their concentration in the region where the active quasar is located. The ALMA radio telescope complemented these data with information about molecular carbon dioxide, important for the formation of new stars. Together, these results allowed for a complete picture of the destructive impact of the quasar. Modeling shows that the quasar's radiation destroys carbon dioxide molecules, leaving only dense but small gas clumps in the galaxy. These are insufficient to maintain active star formation. This leads to the decline of new star formation over hundreds of millions of years and explains why many massive galaxies in our universe have stopped being 'star factories.' The importance of these results lies in their ability to recreate the early stages of galaxy development and reveal the reasons why some of them stopped their development. Astronomers note that stopping star formation is not always final: there are known cases where such galaxies 'wake up' to a new stage of star formation after millions of years. Such observations allow for a better understanding of the past and possible future of the universe.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 06:30 AM\nSource:[newsyou.info](https:\/\/newsyou.info\/2025\/06\/astronomi-vpershe-prostezhili-za-rujnuvannyam-zoryanix-skupchen-pri-zitknenni-galaktik)\n\n**Groundbreaking Discovery Reveals 'Monstrous Red' Galaxies in the Universe**\nAn international team of scientists has discovered three ancient galaxies in the universe that are forming stars at nearly twice the efficiency of the rest, a finding that raises new questions about the theories of star formation.

The 'monstrous red' galaxies, as the researchers call them, have grown much faster than previously thought. The researchers analyzed a complete sample of galaxies formed within the first billion years of cosmic history using the James Webb Space Telescope, located 1.5 million kilometers from Earth.

Dr. Frank Drake, then president of the SETI Institute, convened a historic meeting at the Green Bank Observatory in November 1961 to discuss the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, attended by luminaries such as Carl Sagan and Philip Morrison. The equation serves as a 'Rosetta Stone' for guiding discussions and scientific inquiries into the appearance of life and its development into something capable of sending messages across the light-years. 'It was a privilege to be in the company of so many famous and cerebral individuals,' said Dr. Drake, highlighting the significance of the meeting.

The Drake Equation estimates the longevity (L) of a communicating civilization to be around 100-200 years. The equation considers the number (N) of radiocommunicating technical civilizations in the galaxy, with the first three astronomical terms relatively well established. However, the next three terms (fl \u00b7 fi \u00b7 fc) are not, with astronomers assuming optimistic values and biologists suggesting much smaller values. Even with optimistic values, the derived value for N is low, consistent with the null results from current SETI surveys. The window for detectable interstellar radio transmissions is extremely limited, and the detection of other civilizations will be challenging even for those located within our local stellar neighbourhood. The authors suggest that SETI researchers may need to consider the types of instruments required to conduct meaningful surveys, including an 'all-sky' capability. They also note that a post-biological technical civilization would be well-adapted to space exploration and could potentially spread its presence throughout the Galaxy. The absence of detectable signs of Kardashev Type II and Type III civilizations implies that such entities are either exceedingly rare or non-existent, reinforcing the notion of a 'Great Filter' that halts the progress of a technical civilization within a few centuries of its emergence.

One factor to consider when searching for an answer to the Fermi Paradox is the number of potential civilizations. This value allows us to determine the Drake equation, a mathematical formula that outputs the number of active, communication-capable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. The equation uses several factors, including star formation rate, percentage of stars with planets, number of habitable planets per star, percentage of planets where life emerged, percentage of planets where intelligent life developed, number of civilizations developing detectable communication technologies, and average lifespan of such civilizations. In short, the Drake equation claims that there should be many civilizations, but so far, SETI programs have not detected any signals. This raises the question of the scientific justification for such programs. Matthew Chilcote's article does not provide a direct answer to this question, but instead proposes a method for evaluating the probability of detecting a signal by a certain number of broadcasting civilizations by now. If the probability is low, the lack of evidence should not be surprising; if it is high, the silence may mean something. Chilcote's model suggests that the absence of detected electromagnetic signals from extraterrestrial civilizations may impose constraints on the number of existing civilizations. In certain scenarios, the model predicts a 99% chance of detecting at least one signal if the assumed number of civilizations (based on the Drake equation) is around 1. We have a zero result so far. However, it's worth noting that even the absence of positive results from SETI helps in resolving the Fermi Paradox: it allows us to exclude certain combinations of the number and lifespan of civilizations. Ultimately, as Universe Today writes, the purpose of programs like SETI is not only to search for extraterrestrial life, but also to better understand ourselves and the conditions that make intelligent life possible. A team of scientists from Germany studied the feasibility of a new method of searching for extraterrestrial life - using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They came to an unencouraging but important conclusion for the development of astronomy.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 04:52 PM\nSource:[hightech.plus](https:\/\/hightech.plus\/2025\/05\/12\/s-tochki-zreniya-statistiki-mi-uzhe-dolzhni-bili-vstretit-inoplanetyan)\n\n**Why the Cosmos is Silent? Scientists Link the Fermi Paradox to the Absence of SETI Signals**\nA new study reevaluates the 'cosmic silence' by proposing a model that turns the lack of SETI signals into a tool for assessing the chances of finding extraterrestrial intelligence. The work focuses on the Fermi paradox, questioning why, despite billions of stars in the Milky Way, we have not yet detected signs of other civilizations. The authors consider the Galaxy as a flat disk, with a diameter of approximately 100,000 light-years, 100 times greater than its thickness. The signal from a hypothetical civilization is modeled as two expanding rings: the first corresponds to the beginning of transmission, and the second to its completion. Earth must be in the space between them, like in a temporal corridor. The probability of such an event for one source is calculated using the formula \u22480.6????\/????, where???? is the distance between the rings (transmission duration multiplied by the speed of light), and???? is the radius of the Galaxy. This model is integrated with the Drake equation, which estimates the number of communicative civilizations (????) as the product of seven factors, from star formation rates to the probability of technological development. The key finding is that if???? approaches 1 (an optimistic scenario), and the duration of signal transmission is approximately 630 years (???? \u2248 102.8 light-years), the probability of detecting at least one signal exceeds 99%. This makes the lack of SETI results statistically significant - either such civilizations are extremely rare, or their 'window' of activity is shorter. Calculations also show that if???? \u2265 1, there cannot be more than a thousand civilizations in the Galaxy simultaneously transmitting signals. If the number of civilizations is higher, it means that one of the parameters of the Drake equation, such as the chance of the emergence of consciousness or technologies, is significantly underestimated. The model has limitations, including the Galaxy's three-dimensionality, signal attenuation with distance, and non-uniform distribution of civilizations or impulsive data transmission. However, even the simplified version demonstrates how the 'zero result' of SETI allows narrowing the parameters of the Drake equation. The next step will be to complicate the model, transitioning to a three-dimensional structure of the Milky Way, accounting for historical changes (emergence and extinction of civilizations), and realistic patterns of communication.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 05, 2025 07:45 PM\nSource:[iXBT.com](https:\/\/www.ixbt.com\/news\/2025\/05\/05\/pochemu-molchit-kosmos-uchjonye-svjazali-paradoks-fermi-s-otsutstviem-signalov-seti.html)\n\n**The 40-Year Quest for Extraterrestrial Intelligence**\nThe Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project has been searching for life beyond Earth for 40 years, since its inception in 1985. The project's founders, including Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi, were inspired by the idea of using gamma-ray signals to communicate with other civilizations. They proposed using the spectral line of neutral hydrogen as a means of communication, as it is the most abundant element in the universe. The project's early results were promising, but the search for extraterrestrial signals has been ongoing for decades with no conclusive evidence. In the 1960s, Frank Drake, a young astronomer, independently developed a similar project, called 'Ozma', which aimed to listen for signals from nearby stars. The project was supported by notable scientists, including Otto Struve, who predicted the existence of exoplanets. The SETI project has undergone several iterations, including the development of the Drake equation, which attempts to estimate the number of advanced civilizations in the galaxy. The equation takes into account factors such as the rate of star formation, the number of planets per star, and the number of planets capable of supporting life. Despite the lack of conclusive evidence, the SETI project continues to inspire scientists and the public alike, and its legacy has led to a greater understanding of the universe and our place within it.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: April 05, 2025 09:01 AM\nSource:[Meduza](https:\/\/meduza.io\/feature\/2025\/04\/05\/chelovechestvo-40-let-ischet-vnezemnuyu-zhizn-v-ramkah-proekta-seti-no-vse-esche-odinoko-vo-vselennoy-mozhet-byt-my-chto-to-delaem-ne-tak)\n\n**Scientists Create Equation to Search for Life on Venus**\nScientists have created an equation to search for life on Venus. The equation, called VLE, is similar to the Drake equation and can estimate the probability of life on Venus. 'The fundamental goal of VLE is to provide a basis for assessing the probability of life,' said Diana Gentri, director of the NASA Astrobiology Laboratory. The equation is L=OxRxC, where L is the probability of life, and O, R, and C are three parameters: origin, strength, and continuity. Each parameter has a value from 0 to 1. The origin of life can occur through abiogenesis or panspermia, and this factor does not change over time. The strength of life depends on the availability of nutrients CHNOPS, access to energy, and functional diversity of life. Earth has a high value of R, which explains the stability of life on our planet. The continuity of life depends on the stability of the star and the planet's orbit, as well as geological stability and the absence of destructive events. 'Although we are limited by the problem of n=1, we can use our understanding of the genesis of life on Earth to study unknown aspects of life in other worlds,' explain the authors of the study. This approach can help us in the search for life on exoplanets. Understanding Venus gives us a key to solving the natural puzzle of the Solar System.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: March 29, 2025 01:30 PM\nSource:[newsyou.info](https:\/\/newsyou.info\/2025\/03\/vcheni-stvorili-rivnyannya-dlya-poshuku-zhittya-na-veneri)\n\n**New Forms of Estimating Alien Life in the Universe: Revisiting the Drake Equation**\nFrank Drake, an American astronomer and radio astronomer, developed the Drake Equation in 1961 to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in the galaxy that might be able to communicate with Earth. The equation is expressed as: N = R* \u00d7 fp \u00d7 ne \u00d7 fl \u00d7 fi \u00d7 fc \u00d7 L, where each term carries significant uncertainties, making it more of a conceptual tool than a precise calculation. Some variables, such as R*, can be estimated with some accuracy, while others, like fi and fc, remain uncertain. Advances in astronomy and astrobiology have refined some of these factors over the years. The discovery of exoplanets has improved our understanding of fp and ne. However, the fraction of planets where life emerges (fl) and evolves into intelligence (fi) remains unknown. 'Intelligence and technological capability seem to be more uncommon phenomena, considering that billions of species existed before one developed the ability to send radio signals into space,' said an expert. The time of life of technological civilizations (L) is another crucial factor. If civilizations are common but have short lifetimes due to self-destruction or natural disasters, the chance of detecting them would be low. This point raises philosophical and scientific implications about the future of humanity. Modern versions of the equation have been developed, incorporating new concepts and refining the original parameters. Some scientists have added variables related to bio-signatures and technosignatures, while others have suggested including terms that address the impact of catastrophic events.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 09:35 PM\nSource:[TecMundo](https:\/\/www.tecmundo.com.br\/ciencia\/403133-novas-formas-de-estimar-a-vida-alienigena-no-universo-revisitando-a-equacao-de-drake.htm)\n\n**The Drake Equation and Alien Typologies Catalogued by Ufologists Based on Case Studies**\nThe Drake Equation, a mathematical formula to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way, has been updated to 2025. Using values such as the rate of star formation, the fraction of stars with planetary systems, and the average lifespan of a technological civilization, the equation yields an optimistic N = 0.08, implying we might be alone or nearly so. In contrast, ufology has compiled an array of alleged alien races, drawing from a wealth of testimonies that have repeatedly and consistently confirmed the sighting of certain extraterrestrial typologies. When merging the Drake Equation with ufologists' alien typologies, two approaches emerge: either the lifespan of civilizations would need to rise significantly, or intelligence or communicative capacity would need to be far more prevalent than assumed. Alternatively, each civilization estimated by Drake might give rise to multiple races, yielding a figure modest compared to ufological accounts. Challenges and reflections arise from the lack of definitive data for many parameters in the Drake Equation and the need for objective scientific validation of ufological cataloguing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 05:50 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https:\/\/medium.com\/@oliviero65\/the-drake-equation-and-alien-typologies-catalogued-by-ufologists-based-on-case-studies-697e78f59fcd)\n\n**The Great Silence: Why Aliens Haven't Contacted Us -- Or Have They?**\nThe possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life and Earth visitation remains a topic of debate. Modern astrobiology has revealed that planets are abundant in our galaxy, with over 5,000 exoplanets confirmed as of 2023, and one-fifth of stars estimated to have planets in the 'habitable zone' where temperatures could allow liquid water. The building blocks of life have been found in interstellar clouds and meteorites, suggesting the chemistry for life might be common. However, the emergence of intelligent, technological civilizations is far more uncertain, and the famous Drake Equation provides a framework to estimate the number of advanced civilizations by considering factors like the rate of star formation and the likelihood of life and intelligence. As of now, there is no conclusive evidence to prove or disprove the existence of intelligent alien life or their visitation to Earth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 04:33 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https:\/\/medium.com\/@Tjkbrown\/the-great-silence-why-aliens-havent-contacted-us-or-have-they-796e347195d3)\n\n**NASA Hopes to Reestablish Contact with Extraterrestrials**\nThe NASA is hoping to reestablish contact with extraterrestrials using a new method.

Therefore, it is logical that scientists wonder what method would be the most effective for communicating with another form of life.

'We intend to increase the British army to at least 76,000 regular soldiers by the next parliament. For the first time in a generation, it is our government that wants to increase the size of the regular army,' he said. The current government, led by the Labour Party, aims to achieve this goal by 2034. The current number of British military personnel is around 72,500, the lowest since the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century. According to The Times, the number of military personnel may drop below 70,000 in 2025 due to low recruitment rates and high rates of personnel leaving the service due to dissatisfaction with working conditions.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 04:44 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421](https:\/\/tass.ru\/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama\/24117431)\n\n**Husnullin: Around 60 Schools and Kindergartens Built or Under Construction in Russia**\nAccording to Vice-Premier Marat Husnullin, around 60 schools and kindergartens have been built or are being constructed in various regions of Russia as part of the 'Infrastructure Menu'.

Senate President Davi Alcolumbre has not made any statements on the project. Despite this, leaders of the Chamber point out that the topic will have to be addressed in the next week after the 11th Parliamentary Forum of the BRICS, between June 3 and 5, due to the deadline given by the Supreme Court. The discussion about seats in the Chamber arose after a determination by the Supreme Court for the Chamber to revise, by June 30, the number of parliamentarians from each state, based on the last demographic census, made by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in 2022. If the Chamber followed the determination to the letter, some states would lose deputies due to population decline. The proposal to increase the number of deputies has faced resistance in the Senate, with senators from the PT to the opposition rejecting it. The division among different parties is due to regional issues, with states more favorable to changes and others opposed, depending on the impact.

By 2030, more than 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity and overweight have increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The document also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. In 2016, fewer than 1,000 adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, but by 2021, the number had already exceeded 1.1 billion. Another concerning aspect is the role that climate change and technology will play. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with an average annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. According to UN estimates, by 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24.

The Constitution requires the number of state deputies to be three times the number of federal deputies, with a cap of 36. This means that if the proposal is approved, the Assemblies will need to increase their number of seats. For example, in Minas Gerais, the federal delegation has 53 deputies, and if the proposal is approved, a new seat will be created, passing to 54. In this scenario, the Assembly will need to have 78 seats (one more than the current 77), with 36 representing the triple of 12 federal deputies and 42 indicating the difference from the total federal delegation. Other states, such as Amazonas, Mato Grosso, and Rio Grande do Norte, will gain six new seats, while Par\u00e1 and Santa Catarina will gain four new seats each.

The state's Republican-led government and civil rights groups have formed an unlikely alliance to challenge the map, with the state arguing that politics, not race, drove the new boundaries. The court's decision is expected by late June, and a ruling invalidating the map could leave little time to draw a new one before the 2026 elections.

According to the IMF, India's nominal GDP is projected to reach $4.19 trillion by FY26, while Germany's is expected to be $4.74 trillion. India's growth is driven by domestic consumption, services, and digitization, with a robust current account buffer and a rising trade surplus. However, challenges such as job creation, fiscal slippage, and institutional bottlenecks loom large. Experts warn that India must invest in human capital, strengthen its fiscal fundamentals, and deepen financial inclusion to truly consolidate its position in the top three. If India can achieve an 8% nominal GDP growth rate and maintain a stable rupee, its economy could cross $6.8 trillion-$7 trillion by 2030, firmly establishing it as the world's third-largest economy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 02:08 PM\nSource:[India Today](https:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/india-today-insight\/story\/as-upbeat-indian-economy-closes-gap-with-japan-germany-the-real-test-will-be-at-the-podium-2734414-2025-06-02)\n\n**Central Bank Analysts Reduce Inflation Projection for 2025**\nAnalysts consulted by the Central Bank have reduced their projection for Brazil's inflation in 2025, while maintaining the expectation for price growth in 2026, according to the Focus survey released on Monday. The survey showed that the expectation for inflation, measured by IPCA, is now 5.46% at the end of this year, above the previous forecast of 5.50%. For 2026, the projection for price growth was maintained at 4.50%. The Central Bank's target is 3%, with a 1.5 percentage point margin for tolerance. The change comes after the release of data for the IPCA-15 of May, which decelerated and was below expectations, leading to some relief in the 12-month result. The index rose 0.36% in May, after increasing 0.43% in the previous month, and 5.40% in 12 months, compared to a gain of 5.49% in April. The weekly survey with a hundred economists also showed the expectation that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow 1.80% next year, above the growth projection of 1.70% in the previous week. For 2025, the expectation for economic expansion fell slightly to 2.13%, from a gain of 2.14% previously. On monetary policy, there was maintenance of the expectation for the basic interest rate this year and next. The median of the projections for the Selic at the end of 2025 is 14.75%, while for the end of 2026, the expectation is that the rate will reach 12.50%, which was the 18th consecutive week of maintenance of this level. Currently, the Selic is at 14.75% per year. The survey also maintained the expectations for the price of the dollar at the end of 2025, at R$5.80, and 2026, at R$5.90. The US dollar has accumulated a 6.8% drop against the real this year, in a movement driven by a price correction process, after its surge at the end of last year, and greater uncertainty regarding US tariff plans.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 11:59 AM\nSource:[Terra](https:\/\/www.terra.com.br\/economia\/mercado-reduz-projecao-para-inflacao-em-2025-no-focus,54dc1969fa54933fcb3f8a6eb106379dzusf9bqx.html)\n\n**Dubai's US$10bln infrastructure spending key to the growth of the commercial vehicle market**\nThe GCC commercial vehicle market is poised for growth, driven by substantial infrastructure investments and strategic economic initiatives in key member states.

Saudi Arabia has announced investments worth US$267 billion, and Qatar is focusing on tourism and hospitality under its Third National Development Strategy 2024-2030. According to Frost & Sullivan's research, Saudi Arabia is leading the commercial vehicles industry in the Middle East, leveraging its strategic location and substantial infrastructure investments. The non-oil economy in the Middle East will remain a key driver of economic growth, with key industries identified as manufacturing (including automotive), renewables, infrastructure, construction, tourism, artificial intelligence, and fintech. In the UAE, a resilient non-oil economy performance will push GDP growth to 5.8% in 2025, up from 4% in 2024, while investments in Saudi's non-oil segments including, tourism, technology, infrastructure, and renewables, will see real GDP growth reach 4.8% in 2025.

The country aims to become one of the world's largest economies by 2047, with a GDP of over $30 trillion. To achieve this, India is investing in technological advancements as the driving force behind development. According to the Indian Technical Education Council, 1.49 million engineering seats were approved for the 2024-2025 period, a 16% increase from the past four years. The fields with the highest growth are computer science, AI, machine learning, data science, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and blockchain. The number of seats in these fields has increased by over 50%, reflecting the strong market demand. Institutions are also promoting a more comprehensive and interconnected education, shifting from the STEM concept to STEAM, which includes arts, communication, design, law, and psychology. This aims to form creative professionals with a broad vision and the ability to innovate. According to the Times of India, a report by Wheebox estimates that the Indian AI market will reach $28.8 billion by 2025, with a 45% annual growth rate. The number of qualified professionals in the field has grown 14 times between 2016 and 2023. Universities like SRM Institute are creating interdisciplinary courses that combine engineering with health, data science, and food technology. Partnerships with companies ensure that students have contact with real-world challenges and are ready to compete globally. With India determined to take a leading role in the global economy, the formation of AI specialists becomes a strategic pillar to support this advancement.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 09:09 PM\nSource:[Olhar Digital - O futuro passa primeiro aqui](https:\/\/olhardigital.com.br\/2025\/06\/01\/pro\/india-precisa-de-um-milhao-de-experts-em-ia-ate-2026\/)\n\n**US Treasury Secretary Confident US Will Never Default on Debt**\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the US government will never default on its debt, despite the lack of a decision on raising its debt ceiling.

The CBO predicts that the federal debt will rise to 117% of the country's GDP by 2034, up from 98% last year. The interest payments on the debt are also expected to increase to 4% of the GDP, which is a significant burden on the government. Despite these alarming numbers, investors are still confident in the US economy and are willing to buy government bonds and the dollar, which are the backbone of the global financial system. However, some experts warn that the US is heading towards a financial crisis, citing the country's high debt levels and the potential for a recession. If a recession were to occur, it would have a double impact on the US finances, with a decline in tax revenues and a significant increase in welfare payments, leading to a financial collapse. The Federal Reserve may be able to mitigate some of the effects of a recession by lowering interest rates, but this would not eliminate the risk of a financial crisis. The CBO's central projections assume that the US will experience a continuous and sustained economic growth over the next decade, but this is an optimistic assumption. If the economy were to experience a recession, the US finances would be severely impacted, with a significant increase in debt and interest payments. Some experts, such as Chris Marsh from Exante Data, warn that if the yield curve does not return to its natural state, the US could face a severe financial crisis, with the federal debt rising to 125% of the GDP by 2034 and interest payments reaching 30% of the government's revenues. \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 11:07 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629](https:\/\/www.aleqt.com\/2025\/06\/01\/article_2762019.html)\n\n**Despite GDP growth, India's per capita income abysmally low**\nIndia's GDP has grown to $4.187 trillion, surpassing Japan's, and is expected to reach $5.584 billion by 2028, overtaking Germany. However, India's per capita GDP is abysmally low, equivalent to Japan's in the 1950s, and would take 22 years to reach their level. Experts say India needs to diversify its export basket and leverage global value chains to reach its $1 trillion merchandise exports goal by 2030. To boost growth, India can harness its global trade potential by increasing exports in textiles, apparel, and footwear sectors, as well as electronics and green technology products. Economists project India's economic growth to average around 6.5 percent over the next few years, making it likely to maintain its status as the fastest-growing major economy globally. However, Indian citizens are demanding reforms and policies that will boost GDP per capita by improving wages for India's working class. Four potential ways to boost GDP per capita include allowing farmers to sell their products to the highest bidder, spending money on building and repairing roads and bridges, urbanization, and increasing competitiveness in sectors such as electronics, chemicals, textiles, auto goods, and pharmaceuticals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 04:29 AM\nSource:[The Hans India](https:\/\/www.thehansindia.com\/business\/despite-gdp-growth-indias-per-capita-income-abysmally-low-975989)\n\n**Italy's Demographic Minefield: A 11% GDP Risk by 2040**\nAccording to Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta, the number of people in the workforce is expected to decrease by around five million by 2040, which could cost the country 11% of its GDP. Panetta also noted that the productivity issue remains a problem, with Italy's productivity growth being one of the lowest in the EU. The low level of salaries is also a concern, with real wages having fallen below those of 2000, despite a recent recovery. To ensure a sustainable increase in wages, it is essential to boost productivity and growth through innovation, capital accumulation, and public action. Panetta stated that the Italian industry is still solid, but the value added in the manufacturing sector has remained stagnant, reflecting the expansion in the energy sector and the new decline in the manufacturing area. However, Panetta emphasized that 'despite the current difficulties, the Italian industry is not destined to decline. In all sectors, there are dynamic and competitive companies that invest in technology and research and position themselves in high-end segments.' The main issue is the low level of innovation, with the expenditure on research and development being significantly lower than the EU average.

According to the 2025 Economic Prospects for Africa (PEA 2025) report, 21 African countries are expected to achieve a growth rate of over 5% in 2025, with four countries (Ethiopia, Niger, Rwanda, and Senegal) potentially reaching the critical threshold of 7% necessary for poverty reduction and inclusive growth. Africa's projected growth rates will exceed the global average and those of most other regions, except for emerging and developing Asia. The continent's resilience is based on effective national reforms and better macroeconomic management. However, regional growth perspectives vary significantly: East Africa leads with a projected growth rate of 5.9% in 2025-2026, driven by Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Tanzania's resilience. West Africa maintains a solid growth rate of 4.3%, driven by new oil and gas discoveries in Senegal and Niger. North Africa is expected to grow at 3.6% in 2025, while Central Africa's growth will slow to 3.2% and Southern Africa will only grow by 2.2%. Despite these challenges, Africa has a huge untapped potential for national resources. The PEA 2025 estimates that with appropriate policies, Africa could mobilize an additional $1.43 trillion in national resources from fiscal and non-fiscal sources, solely through efficiency gains. Africa's unexploited resources include: natural capital, with 30% of global mineral reserves and potential revenue of over $1.6 trillion by 2030; human capital, with a median age of 19 years, representing a demographic dividend that could add $47 billion to Africa's GDP through better labor participation; financial capital, with pension fund assets reaching $1.1 trillion and official transfers potentially reaching $500 billion by 2035 if transfer costs are reduced; and commercial capital, with the full implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) potentially increasing exports by $560 billion and the continent's revenue by $450 billion by 2035. Urgent measures are needed to combat resource leaks. The report highlights that massive capital outflows compromise the continent's development. In comparison to the $190.7 billion in financial inflows recorded in 2022, Africa has experienced approximately $587 billion in financial outflows. Of this total, around $90 billion was lost due to illicit financial flows, $275 billion was diverted by multinational corporations that transfer their profits, and $148 billion was lost due to corruption. When Africa allocates its own capital effectively (human, natural, fiscal, commercial, and financial), global capital will follow African capital to accelerate investments in the continent's productive sectors. The report calls for global reforms in several critical areas, including: improving macroeconomic management, quality institutions, good governance, and the rule of law; mobilizing fiscal revenues through improved tax administration, expanded tax bases, and strengthened social contracts with citizens; making natural capital accounting mandatory and enforcing national value retention through enrichment requirements; deepening financial markets by exploiting institutional savings, developing local currency bond markets, and harmonizing regulatory frameworks to facilitate cross-border investments.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 03:00 AM\nSource:[temoignages.re](https:\/\/www.temoignages.re\/international\/nouvelles-d-afrique\/des-perspectives-a-court-terme-resilientes-pour-l-afrique-malgre-les-vents-contraires-economiques-et-politiques-a-l-echelle-mondiale)\n\n**Shipping, the Scissors of Debt. 'A Brake on Global Trade'**\nThe European ports are seeking a new identity in an increasingly unpredictable geopolitical context, while the European Commission wants a new strategy for these infrastructures. The Espo, the European ports association, met in its annual conference in Thessaloniki. The occasion is also a moment to take stock of the sector. The first surprise that emerges, according to the analysis of Tim Power, director general of the British analysis company Drewry, is that the commercial battle of the United States against the rest of the world and particularly against China will not shake the growth of the global Gross Domestic Product: 'The trend - says Power - will be essentially in line with that of the past decade, with slow growth in Europe and normalization of China.' The global GDP growth forecast between 2025 and 2030 is 2.6%, slightly below the 2.9% of the period 2019-2025. The EU will go from 1.3% to 1.6%, the US from 2.6% to 2.3% and China will drop from 5.7% to 3.7%. The real alarm signal highlighted by Power is instead the growth of public debt. 'The sovereign debts of Italy and France are particularly high - explains Power - and this represents a high risk for their economies, and among the measures that they will have to adopt in the future to contain public spending, there could be the choice of cutting import volumes. Italy currently has the highest debt in the Western world, over 135% of its GDP, above the US and France. Overall, the debt-to-GDP ratio in the European Union is 80%, while that of China is destined to pass from the current 69% to 100% by 2030. The more the debt grows, the more its costs grow, reducing the room for maneuver of individual nations in the event of a future economic crisis. Trade relationships, including commercial ones, become rigid. Now, if it is true that at the current stage there are no expected - despite everything - major shocks to global growth, it is also true that there are several subjects that should start to take stock, starting from Italy, which, limiting ourselves to the port sector, would not only be faced with a lower volume of imports but would also have to pay - as is known - one of the highest prices in terms of exports, having precisely in the US the second largest export partner. Between this year and 2030, the growth of container traffic in European ports should be around 2-2.5%, while interesting movements could occur for oil traffic, particularly that of the United States: today China is a major buyer of this energy source, but the tariff policy could change the picture, and push Beijing to increase its purchases from the Middle East and Russia at the expense of American oil. Where will American oil go? With all probability to Europe, but the limited refining capacity makes the Old Continent a commercial partner able to absorb much lower volumes than those normally bought by China. And this considering that, at a general level, the import of US oil weighs 1.7% on the total Chinese purchases, but it is worth 5.1% of US sales. On the environmental front, while the passage of the Mediterranean to the area of control of emissions (ECA) established by the International Maritime Organization, the blue arm of the UN, has passed largely unnoticed, great importance has been given by all the speakers to the approval of the first draft of a global mechanism, approved by the IMO last month and which should be implemented by October, for the reduction of emissions from ships. 'In this way - explained the European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas - there will be a common field of competition for everyone' trying to counter the polemics arisen with the previous commission on the rigidity of the adopted scheme in Europe. However, notes Power, the global mechanism, which aims to achieve zero net emissions by 2050, will hardly be adopted before 2029.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 02:14 PM\nSource:[Il Secolo XIX](https:\/\/www.ilsecoloxix.it\/blue-economy\/shipping-logistica\/2025\/05\/12\/news\/shipping_la_tagliola_del_debito_un_freno_agli_scambi_globali-15143577\/)\n\n**US Population to Decline Without Migration by 2033, CBO Predicts**\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the US population without migration will start to decline in 2033, which may hinder economic growth. The CBO predicts that mortality will exceed birth rates in the US in eight years, and population growth will be driven only by migration. The National Center for Health Statistics reports that in 2023, there were 3,591,328 births, a historic low, and 3,090,582 deaths. The birth rate among women aged 20-24 (55.4) reached a record low. The CBO expects the gross domestic product (GDP) to grow at an average rate of 1.6% over the next 30 years, compared to an average annual growth rate of 2.5% over the past three decades. This is due to the decline in the workforce due to aging population and slowing productivity growth. The CBO also predicts a rise in the national debt from 100% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 156% of GDP in 2055. 'Even small changes in migration, birth, or death rates, accumulated over many years, can have a significant impact on results in later periods of forecasting,' the CBO said. The CBO's previous forecast, made in 2023, expected the US population to decline by 2040. The current forecast reflects the consequences of a government order issued in June 2024, which suspended the entry of most non-citizens through the southern border of the US, signed by former President Joe Biden.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 02, 2025 10:16 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https:\/\/www.rbc.ru\/economics\/28\/03\/2025\/67e6b9f59a79471781364d07)\n\n**Global Public Debt to Reach 95% of GDP by 2025, Warns IMF**\nThe global public debt is expected to continue growing, according to the Fiscal Monitor report released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on April 23. The report states that the public debt will reach 95% of the world's GDP by 2025, and could even surpass 100% by 2030. The IMF has also lowered its forecast for global economic growth to 2.8% in 2025, down from 3.3% in January, due to the trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump. This will lead to lower government revenues and increased pressure on countries with high debt levels to either balance their budgets or increase spending. The report warns that the public debt could reach 117% of GDP by 2027, the highest level since World War II. The IMF attributes the growth of public debt to the dynamics in the US and China. The report also notes that the US is expected to see a slow decline in its budget deficit over the next two years, but its public debt will continue to rise, reaching 122.5% of GDP in 2025 and over 128% in 2030. 'The trade war is causing significant economic difficulties and will lead to increased requests for public support for affected sectors,' said the report. 'In a highly unfavorable scenario, the public debt could surge even further,' it added.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: April 23, 2025 03:26 PM\nSource:[Il Sole 24 ORE](https:\/\/www.ilsole24ore.com\/art\/cosi-guerra-dazi-fa-salire-anche-debito-pubblico-AHfe9TR)\n\n**US and China GDP to Remain Top 2 Until 2075, But Trump's Policies May Change the Ranking**\nAccording to a recent report by the Japanese Economic Research Center, the GDP of the United States and China will continue to be ranked 1st and 2nd respectively until 2075, with no change in the ranking. However, if the policies of former US President Donald Trump are implemented in the long term, the US GDP may be surpassed by China as early as 2049. The report also predicts that the global average economic growth rate will decrease from 3.3% between 2021 and 2030 to 1.3% between 2071 and 2075, due to the decline in population and birth rate. The report also notes that the population of Asia will decline by 2075, while Africa's population will continue to grow and surpass East Asia in the mid-2040s. 'If the US continues to deport 1 million illegal immigrants every year and strictly limits legal immigration, the US economy will decline, and China's GDP will surpass the US by 2049,' the report said.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 30, 2025 11:07 AM\nSource:[\u4e09\u7acb\u65b0\u805e](https:\/\/www.setn.com\/News.aspx?NewsID=1632063)\n\n**US Population Expected to Start Declining in 2033, CBO Predicts**\nAccording to a report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the US population is expected to start declining in 2033, excluding migration, which could undermine economic growth. The CBO predicts that mortality will exceed birth rates in the US within eight years, and population growth will only be sustained through migration. In 2023, the US saw a record low birth rate, with 3,591,328 children born, and a death toll of 3,090,582. The fertility rate among women aged 20-24 (55.4) reached a record low. The report also notes that the US GDP is expected to grow at an average rate of 1.6% over the next 30 years, compared to a 2.5% average annual growth rate over the past three decades. This is due to the shrinking workforce as the population ages and declining productivity growth. The CBO also predicts that the number of workers will increase from 171 million in 2025 to 185 million in 2055, with an annual growth rate of 0.1%. Additionally, the report notes that the 'slowdown in the growth of educational attainment' will also hinder economic growth. The CBO also forecasts a rise in the US national debt from 100% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 156% of GDP in 2055. As the CBO notes, 'even small changes in migration, birth, or death rates, accumulated over many years, can have a significant impact on results in later periods of forecasting.' The current forecast is a revision from the CBO's previous prediction of a population decline in 2040, which was made in 2023. The new forecast takes into account the consequences of a government directive issued in June 2024, which suspended the entry of most non-citizens through the southern US border, signed by former President Joe Biden.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 29, 2025 01:54 AM\nSource:[Oxu.Az](https:\/\/oxu.az\/ru\/v-mire\/v-ssha-sprognozirovali-sokrashenie-naseleniya)\n\n**US Federal Debt to Reach 107% of GDP by 2029, CBO Warns**\nThe US Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has predicted that the country's federal debt will reach 107% of the country's GDP by 2029, surpassing the highest level reached after World War II. The CBO also warned that the large increase in debt will have a negative impact on economic growth, increase interest payments to foreign investors, and pose significant risks to the country's fiscal and economic outlook. The CBO also predicted that the US budget deficit will remain at a high level over the next 30 years, with a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 6.3% on average, and 7.3% in 2055. The CBO also predicted that the US population will grow more slowly over the next 30 years, with a potential labor force growth rate of 0.3% per year, compared to 0.8% over the past 30 years. The CBO also predicted that the population will start to decline in 2033 if foreign immigration to the US does not occur. 'This is a warning of the risks of strict immigration policies,' said a Bloomberg report.

The CBO also notes that the US population would begin to shrink in 2033 without immigration. The report assumes that all laws set to expire, including certain provisions of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, will expire.

        "0":"## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- As of early 2025, nine countries possess nuclear weapons, with a combined inventory of approximately 12,331 warheads; the United States and Russia account for about 88% of these[1].\n- Since 1945, only two nuclear weapons have been detonated offensively (Hiroshima and Nagasaki). All subsequent detonations have been for testing or demonstration purposes, not wartime use[1].\n- The Cold War saw numerous crises (e.g., Cuban Missile Crisis) where nuclear use was considered but ultimately avoided.\n- Global inventory is gradually declining due to the dismantlement of retired warheads, but the number of operationally available warheads is slowly rising in several states, including China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and the UK[1].\n- No new states have joined the nuclear club since North Korea, but some existing states are modernizing or modestly expanding their arsenals[1].\n\n## 2. Recent Announcements\/Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- The United States and Russia continue slow reductions in total arsenals but maintain substantial operational forces and have modernized delivery systems[1][3].\n- Several countries (China, India, North Korea, Pakistan, UK) are increasing their operational nuclear stockpiles[1].\n- Arms control agreements have eroded in recent years, with the demise or weakening of key treaties (e.g., INF Treaty), though New START has been extended.\n- Defense budgets for nuclear forces are rising, indicating continued prioritization and possible future expansion or modernization[2][5].\n- No official policy shift toward nuclear disarmament among the nine nuclear states; most maintain doctrines allowing for potential first use in certain scenarios[1][3].\n\n## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Federation of American Scientists: Status of World Nuclear Forces[1]\n- Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: Nuclear Notebook[3]\n- Congressional Budget Office: U.S. Nuclear Forces Cost Projections[2]\n- Arms Control Association: U.S. Nuclear Costs[5]\n- Metaculus: Probabilistic community forecast on nuclear weapon use[4]\n\n## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties\n\n- Forecasting actual wartime use is highly uncertain, given the lack of historical precedent since 1945.\n- Most reference cases (e.g., Cold War crises) resulted in no use; the only offensive uses were limited to two detonations.\n- Escalation dynamics are poorly understood; a single use could trigger a larger exchange, but the most likely scenario is a small number of detonations if any[4].\n- Non-state actors, cyber risks, or command\/control failures could alter probabilities, but data is limited.\n- Measurement is limited to officially confirmed offensive detonations, not tests or peaceful explosions as defined in the resolution criteria.\n\n## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- Conditional on at least one offensive detonation by 2050, the most likely number is **1** or **2**, with a rapidly declining probability for higher numbers.\n- The distribution is heavily skewed: median and mode at **1**, 75th percentile perhaps at **2-5**, but with a long, thin tail extending to higher values in the event of uncontrolled escalation.\n- A full-scale exchange involving major powers could result in dozens to hundreds of detonations, but this outcome has much lower probability compared to limited use.\n- Therefore, under these conditions, the most reasonable forecast for the **number of nuclear weapons detonated offensively by 2050, if at least one occurs, is 1\u20135, with a strong central tendency at the lower end**[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[1].

Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- In 2020, electric vehicles (EVs) comprised approximately 5.5% of US vehicle production: 450,000 EVs out of 8.8 million total vehicles produced[1][5].\n- By 2023, new electric car registrations had grown to 1.4 million, a 40% increase from the prior year, though the growth rate is slowing and major automakers have recently scaled back EV production targets in response to softer demand[5].\n- The US EV market continues to expand, but the pace has moderated compared to the most optimistic mid-2010s projections[5].\n\n## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- The US government has promoted EV adoption through tax credits, infrastructure investment, and emissions regulations, all contributing to the market's growth[5].\n- However, recent trends show some headwinds: automakers such as Ford and GM have reduced their production targets, citing weaker-than-expected consumer demand and challenges scaling up infrastructure[5].\n- The majority of EV charging still occurs at home, but expansion of public and workplace charging is seen as critical for continued market growth[5].\n\n## 3. Authoritative Forecasts\n\n- BloombergNEF projects that EVs will account for about one-third (33%) of new US vehicle sales by 2027[2].\n- The Edison Electric Institute estimates that annual EV sales will reach 7.7 million and account for nearly 46% of new vehicle sales by 2030, with continued acceleration expected thereafter[4].\n- Global forecasts suggest that the US will lag somewhat behind leading markets such as Europe and China in EV adoption rates during this period[3].\n\n## 4.

Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- Forecasts are sensitive to policy changes, supply chain disruptions, and consumer sentiment.\n- The production\/sales split may vary year-to-year based on exports, inventory, and classification.\n- Some sources report sales, others production; question resolves to production, but the two are closely linked in the US market[5].\n- New technologies, unexpected regulatory changes, or global economic shifts could accelerate or decelerate adoption.\n\n## 6. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on recent industry forecasts and current trends, the most probable range for the percentage of new vehicle production that will be electric in the US in 2027 is **30\u201333%**[2]. The probability that the share surpasses 50% is low (<10%) barring an unforeseen acceleration in adoption or major policy shift.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[1].

        "7":"# Forecasting Analysis: Drake's Equation Parameter R* (Star Formation Rate)\n\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\nDrake's Equation parameter R* represents the average rate of formation of suitable stars in our galaxy (stars\/year). This parameter is crucial as it establishes the baseline for potential habitable systems in the Milky Way.\n\nHistorically, estimates of R* have evolved significantly as our understanding of stellar formation has improved. Early estimates from the 1960s when Drake first proposed his equation suggested values around 10 stars\/year for all stars in the Milky Way. By the 1990s, improved observations narrowed this to approximately 1-3 stars\/year.\n\nAs of 2018, current research indicates that the star formation rate in the Milky Way is approximately **1-2 stars per year** when considering all stellar types. However, when focusing specifically on suitable stars for potential life development (primarily F, G, and K main sequence stars), the rate decreases to approximately **0.5-1 stars per year**. This is because:\n\n- Not all stellar types are equally conducive to life development\n- G-type stars like our Sun constitute only about 7-8% of main sequence stars\n- K-type stars (potentially more suitable for life than previously thought) make up about 12% of main sequence stars\n\nRecent research by Kroupa and Weidner (2017) using the Initial Mass Function (IMF) suggests that approximately 40-50% of newly formed stars fall within mass ranges potentially suitable for life development.\n\n## Recent Scientific Developments (as of 2018)\n\nSeveral significant developments have refined our understanding of R*:\n\n1. The **Gaia mission** (launched 2013, with major data releases in 2016 and 2018) has provided unprecedented mapping of stellar populations and movements in the Milky Way, allowing for better calibration of star formation models.\n\n2. Studies using **infrared observations** from the Spitzer Space Telescope have improved our ability to detect star formation through dust clouds, revealing previously obscured star-forming regions.\n\n3. Research by Chomiuk and Povich (2011) reconciled various measurement techniques and suggested a star formation rate of approximately 1.9 \u00b1 0.4 stars\/year across the entire Milky Way.\n\n4. Recent work by Licquia and Newman (2015) characterized the Milky Way as a typical spiral galaxy with a star formation rate of approximately 1.65 \u00b1 0.19 solar masses per year, which translates to roughly 1-2 stars per year considering the distribution of stellar masses.\n\n## Measurement Methodologies and Authoritative Sources\n\nScientists employ several methods to estimate R*, each with different strengths:\n\n1. **Direct counting** of young stellar objects in nearby star-forming regions, then extrapolating to the entire galaxy\n\n2. **Infrared luminosity measurements**, which penetrate dust clouds to reveal embedded star formation\n\n3. **Radio observations** of hydrogen gas, particularly the 21cm line, to track the raw material for star formation\n\n4. **UV and H\u03b1 emission** measurements that trace recent star formation activity\n\nKey authoritative sources on this parameter include:\n\n- The Astrophysical Journal and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society publications\n- NASA's GALEX and Spitzer mission data\n- ESA's Gaia mission data\n- The Sloan Digital Sky Survey data\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors contribute to uncertainty in measuring R*:\n\n1. **Observational limitations**: Dust obscuration in the galactic plane makes direct observation challenging, particularly toward the galactic center.\n\n2. **Temporal variations**: Star formation rates likely fluctuate over galactic timescales, with evidence suggesting the current rate may be lower than the historical average.\n\n3. **Definition ambiguity**: The definition of \"suitable\" stars remains somewhat subjective. While G-type stars like our Sun were traditionally considered ideal, recent research suggests K-dwarfs may offer more stable environments for life over longer timescales.\n\n4. **Measurement technique discrepancies**: Different methodologies (infrared, radio, UV) sometimes yield different results, requiring careful calibration.\n\n5. **IMF uncertainties**: The Initial Mass Function, which describes the distribution of stellar masses at formation, contains inherent uncertainties that affect calculations of suitable star formation rates.\n\nCurrent estimates suggest an uncertainty range of approximately \u00b10.5 stars\/year for the total star formation rate, with greater uncertainty when focusing specifically on \"suitable\" stars.\n\n## References\n\n1.

        "8":"## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n- The Supreme Court of the United States has consisted of nine seats\u2014one Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices\u2014since 1869, as established by the Circuit Judges Act[1][3][5].\n- Historically, the number of seats has fluctuated: it started at six in 1789, increased as high as ten during the 19th century, and then stabilized at nine for over 150 years[3][5].\n- As of October 29, 2020, the Court had nine justices, with Amy Coney Barrett confirmed on October 27, 2020[1][2].\n\n## 2. Recent Announcements\/Policies Affecting the Metric\n- In 2020, following the rapid appointment of Justice Barrett and wider political polarization, there was increased discussion among some political actors about \"court-packing\"\u2014expanding the number of seats to counterbalance perceived ideological shifts.\n- Despite this discourse, as of October 29, 2020, no official legislative action had been taken or was imminent to change the number of seats on the Supreme Court. Any change would require Congressional approval and presidential signature, which has historically been difficult to achieve.\n\n## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification\n- The official Supreme Court website provides a record of current and historical composition of the Court[1].\n- Supreme Court biographies and nomination processes are documented on government and legal information sites[2][5].\n- Wikipedia and legal history sources detail the legislative acts that have changed the Court's size[3][5].\n\n## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties\n- Any change to the number of seats requires passing federal legislation, which historically has occurred only under significant political alignment and pressure.\n- While there is no constitutional requirement for the number of seats, political costs and institutional inertia have made changes rare and controversial.\n- Increased polarization and discussion about reform in 2020 created some uncertainty, but no concrete steps had been taken by October 2020.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\nGiven:\n- 150+ years of stability at nine seats,\n- the high legislative barrier to change,\n- and the lack of enacted reform as of late October 2020,\n\nthe probability that the Supreme Court will have more or fewer than nine seats on January 1, 2030 is low, though not zero. A reasonable adjusted forecast would assign a high probability (e.g., 85\u201395%) to the Court still having nine seats in 2030, and a low probability (5\u201315%) to any expansion or contraction within the bounds of 7 to 30 seats.\n\n## References\n1.

        "9":"### Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- From 1948 to 2018, US annual GDP growth averaged about 3.2%, with an all-time high of 7.3% in 1984.\n- In the late 2010s, growth rates were moderate, e.g., 3% in Q3 2018.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 triggered a severe recession, resulting in a sharp contraction in GDP.\n\n### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- In response to the pandemic, the US government passed large fiscal stimulus packages, such as the CARES Act, aimed at supporting households and businesses.\n- The Federal Reserve adopted highly accommodative monetary policy, cutting interest rates and launching asset purchase programs.\n- These measures set the stage for a strong rebound once pandemic restrictions eased, with many forecasters in mid-2020 predicting a sharp GDP recovery in 2021 due to the \"low base effect\" from the 2020 downturn[3].\n\n### Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): Projected an average annual GDP growth rate of 2.3% from 2020\u20132030, noting potential for a higher-than-average rebound year following the pandemic[3].\n- Statista: Provides annual projections through 2030, generally showing moderate annual growth after the post-pandemic recovery, with no year expected to match or exceed the 1984 record[2].\n- Trading Economics: Expected growth to return to around 2% in the mid-2020s, emphasizing a strong but temporary post-pandemic rebound[5].\n\n### Key Differences Affecting the Forecast\n\n- The pandemic-induced recession created an unprecedentedly low starting point for 2021, increasing the likelihood of an unusually high growth rate that year compared to normal business cycles.\n- Unlike previous recoveries, the scale of fiscal and monetary intervention in 2020 was historically large.\n- However, structural factors\u2014such as slower labor force growth and productivity\u2014were expected to limit sustained high growth in subsequent years.\n\n### Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- Mid-2020 forecasts were marked by high uncertainty due to the unpredictable duration of the pandemic, pace of reopening, and risk of subsequent infection waves.\n- Measurement of GDP growth, particularly in extreme economic conditions, can be subject to substantial revisions.\n- The final annual growth figure for 2021 (or any year) would depend on the precise timing of economic recovery and policy responses.\n\n### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- The most likely outcome, as assessed in July 2020, was that the highest annual US GDP growth rate before 2030 would occur in 2021, driven by the recovery from the pandemic recession.\n- Probabilistically, a single-year real GDP growth rate in the range of 5% to 7% was plausible for 2021, though exceeding the 1984 record of 7.3% was considered unlikely.\n- For the remainder of the decade after the rebound, annual growth rates were expected to normalize to the 2%\u20133% range[3][2][5].\n\n### References\n\n1.

Below is a list of the estimated number of nuclear warheads in each country as of May 2021 (according to [the Federation of American Scientists](https:\/\/fas.org\/issues\/nuclear-weapons\/status-world-nuclear-forces\/)). \n\n- Russia: 6,257 nuclear warheads\n\n- US: 5,550 nuclear warheads\n\n- China: 350 nuclear warheads\n\n- France: 290 nuclear warheads\n\n- UK: 225 nuclear warheads\n\n- Pakistan: 165 nuclear warheads\n\n- India: 160 nuclear warheads\n\n- Israel: 90 nuclear warheads\n\n- North Korea: Estimated 30-40 nuclear warheads with sufficient fissile materials for 45 nuclear warheads (\"The[ir] number of assembled warheads is unknown, but lower.\")\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as the number of nuclear weapons (fission or thermonuclear) detonated offensively in total between January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2050. If there are no offensive detonations before 2050 by any state or non-state actor, then this question will resolve as **ambiguous**. That is, this question conditions on at least one offensive detonation occurring by 2050. Neither [detonations for testing purposes](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nuclear_weapons_testing) nor [peaceful nuclear explosions](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Peaceful_nuclear_explosion) will count towards question resolution, even if such detonations cause substantial damage.\n\n>\n\n>Test detonations and peaceful nuclear explosions are defined as detonations which are claimed as being a test or a peaceful nuclear explosion by an official government communication within 30 days of the event, without this being disputed by reliable media, state reports, or multinational reports. If information is unclear, then resolution will be left up to the resolution council or Metaculus admins.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- As of early 2025, nine countries possess nuclear weapons, with a combined inventory of approximately 12,331 warheads; the United States and Russia account for about 88% of these[1].\n- Since 1945, only two nuclear weapons have been detonated offensively (Hiroshima and Nagasaki). All subsequent detonations have been for testing or demonstration purposes, not wartime use[1].\n- The Cold War saw numerous crises (e.g., Cuban Missile Crisis) where nuclear use was considered but ultimately avoided.\n- Global inventory is gradually declining due to the dismantlement of retired warheads, but the number of operationally available warheads is slowly rising in several states, including China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and the UK[1].\n- No new states have joined the nuclear club since North Korea, but some existing states are modernizing or modestly expanding their arsenals[1].\n\n## 2. Recent Announcements\/Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- The United States and Russia continue slow reductions in total arsenals but maintain substantial operational forces and have modernized delivery systems[1][3].\n- Several countries (China, India, North Korea, Pakistan, UK) are increasing their operational nuclear stockpiles[1].\n- Arms control agreements have eroded in recent years, with the demise or weakening of key treaties (e.g., INF Treaty), though New START has been extended.\n- Defense budgets for nuclear forces are rising, indicating continued prioritization and possible future expansion or modernization[2][5].\n- No official policy shift toward nuclear disarmament among the nine nuclear states; most maintain doctrines allowing for potential first use in certain scenarios[1][3].\n\n## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Federation of American Scientists: Status of World Nuclear Forces[1]\n- Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: Nuclear Notebook[3]\n- Congressional Budget Office: U.S. Nuclear Forces Cost Projections[2]\n- Arms Control Association: U.S. Nuclear Costs[5]\n- Metaculus: Probabilistic community forecast on nuclear weapon use[4]\n\n## 4. Limitations or Uncertainties\n\n- Forecasting actual wartime use is highly uncertain, given the lack of historical precedent since 1945.\n- Most reference cases (e.g., Cold War crises) resulted in no use; the only offensive uses were limited to two detonations.\n- Escalation dynamics are poorly understood; a single use could trigger a larger exchange, but the most likely scenario is a small number of detonations if any[4].\n- Non-state actors, cyber risks, or command\/control failures could alter probabilities, but data is limited.\n- Measurement is limited to officially confirmed offensive detonations, not tests or peaceful explosions as defined in the resolution criteria.\n\n## 5. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- Conditional on at least one offensive detonation by 2050, the most likely number is **1** or **2**, with a rapidly declining probability for higher numbers.\n- The distribution is heavily skewed: median and mode at **1**, 75th percentile perhaps at **2-5**, but with a long, thin tail extending to higher values in the event of uncontrolled escalation.\n- A full-scale exchange involving major powers could result in dozens to hundreds of detonations, but this outcome has much lower probability compared to limited use.\n- Therefore, under these conditions, the most reasonable forecast for the **number of nuclear weapons detonated offensively by 2050, if at least one occurs, is 1\u20135, with a strong central tendency at the lower end**[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[1].

The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate \u00a315 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional \u00a36 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 06:27 PM\nSource:[Brasil 247](https:\/\/www.brasil247.com\/mundo\/reino-unido-anuncia-construcao-de-submarinos-nucleares-e-fabricas-de-municoes-em-resposta-a-ameaca-russa)\n\n**UK Announces Construction of 12 New Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarines 'A Message to Moscow'**\nThe UK has announced the construction of 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines as part of its Defense Review, which Prime Minister Starmer said will give the British army more power against hostile states like Russia and China. According to Starmer, 'The threat is more serious, more immediate, more unpredictable than ever since the Cold War.' The new defense strategy is 'a message to Moscow,' said Defense Minister John Healey, referring to the 'growing' threat posed by Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Starmer has also committed to building at least six new ammunition factories in the UK, creating a hybrid Royal Navy combining drones with warships, submarines, and aircraft, improving living conditions and equipment for military personnel, and investing \u00a315 billion in a nuclear program. The UK is preparing for war at a 'war footing' because Russia is showing it does not want peace, and the best way to deter aggressors is to be ready. Starmer has promised to create a stronger and fully trained reserve, strengthen NATO by making the largest contribution to the alliance since its creation, and invest in innovation.

The study highlights that China is developing its nuclear arsenal at the fastest rate among the nine nuclear-armed states, despite having signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The report, published by the Nuclear Information Project, reveals that since May 2024, China has continued to develop three new missile silo fields for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with solid fuel, as well as proceeding with the construction of new silos for its ICBMs DF-5 with liquid fuel. China is also advancing the development of new ICBM variants and advanced strategic launch systems. The report suggests that Beijing has produced excess warheads for these systems, ready to be used once the launchers are operational. The study also notes the Pentagon's projections, which indicate that China's arsenal will surpass 1,000 warheads by 2030. The 2024 report presented to the US Congress by the Department of Defense revealed that China could have around 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. However, the Nuclear Notebook notes that the growth of the arsenal will depend on China's stockpiles of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and tritium.

Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- In 2020, electric vehicles (EVs) comprised approximately 5.5% of US vehicle production: 450,000 EVs out of 8.8 million total vehicles produced[1][5].\n- By 2023, new electric car registrations had grown to 1.4 million, a 40% increase from the prior year, though the growth rate is slowing and major automakers have recently scaled back EV production targets in response to softer demand[5].\n- The US EV market continues to expand, but the pace has moderated compared to the most optimistic mid-2010s projections[5].\n\n## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- The US government has promoted EV adoption through tax credits, infrastructure investment, and emissions regulations, all contributing to the market's growth[5].\n- However, recent trends show some headwinds: automakers such as Ford and GM have reduced their production targets, citing weaker-than-expected consumer demand and challenges scaling up infrastructure[5].\n- The majority of EV charging still occurs at home, but expansion of public and workplace charging is seen as critical for continued market growth[5].\n\n## 3. Authoritative Forecasts\n\n- BloombergNEF projects that EVs will account for about one-third (33%) of new US vehicle sales by 2027[2].\n- The Edison Electric Institute estimates that annual EV sales will reach 7.7 million and account for nearly 46% of new vehicle sales by 2030, with continued acceleration expected thereafter[4].\n- Global forecasts suggest that the US will lag somewhat behind leading markets such as Europe and China in EV adoption rates during this period[3].\n\n## 4. Key Differences vs. 2017 Reference Cases\n\n| Factor                         | 2017 Forecast (e.g., Musk)            | 2025-2027 Reality                        |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Battery cost trends             | Cost parity expected 2020-2025        | On track, but adoption still below 50%   |\n| Consumer demand                 | Assumed rapid, near-total shift       | Strong but slower, with recent softening |\n| Automaker investment            | Aggressive transition planned         | Investment continues, but targets slowed |\n| Policy\/infrastructure           | Expected supportive, rapid buildout   | Progress made, but infrastructure still a bottleneck |\n| Market share 2027 (projected)   | >50% of new vehicles                  | 30\u201333% of new vehicles                   |\n\n## 5. Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- Forecasts are sensitive to policy changes, supply chain disruptions, and consumer sentiment.\n- The production\/sales split may vary year-to-year based on exports, inventory, and classification.\n- Some sources report sales, others production; question resolves to production, but the two are closely linked in the US market[5].\n- New technologies, unexpected regulatory changes, or global economic shifts could accelerate or decelerate adoption.\n\n## 6. Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on recent industry forecasts and current trends, the most probable range for the percentage of new vehicle production that will be electric in the US in 2027 is **30\u201333%**[2]. The probability that the share surpasses 50% is low (<10%) barring an unforeseen acceleration in adoption or major policy shift.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[1].

This would be a good news for private buyers as well. According to the draft law, companies that purchase new, purely electric vehicles between July 1, 2025, and December 31, 2027, will be able to claim particularly generous depreciation rules. In the year of purchase, 75% of the acquisition costs can be claimed as a tax deduction. In the following year, a further 10% can be deducted. In the subsequent years, the rate decreases: 5% in the second and third year after purchase, 3% in the fourth year, and 2% in the fifth year. This special depreciation also applies to electrically powered commercial vehicles, trucks, and buses. Klingbeil himself describes the measure as an 'Investitions-Booster.' The draft law also includes other investment incentives, such as a special depreciation of up to 30% on other movable assets, such as machines or office equipment, in the period 2025-2027.

The program, which could be approved by the cabinet as early as Wednesday, includes tax relief measures such as improved depreciation options for company-owned electric cars. The package, which is expected to cost around 46 billion euros by 2029, is currently being reviewed by various government departments. If the cabinet approves the program, it will then need to be approved by the Bundestag and Bundesrat. The program's main focus is on an 'Investment Booster' that allows companies to claim up to 30% of investments in movable assets such as machines over the next few years. Another key aspect is the gradual reduction of the corporate tax rate from 15% to 10% by 2032, which is intended to provide companies with long-term security and strengthen Germany as a business location. Additionally, the tax rate for retained profits will be reduced, encouraging companies to invest in research and development. The purchase of electric vehicles will also become more attractive for companies: 75% of the costs can be written off in the year of purchase, followed by a declining balance over the following years. This regulation applies to vehicles purchased between July 2025 and December 2027. The government, consisting of CDU, CSU, and SPD, aims to act quickly and implement the measures before the summer break. Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Lars Klingbeil are optimistic that their tax policies will bring the desired growth boost to the struggling German economy.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 03:55 PM\nSource:[klamm.de](https:\/\/www.klamm.de\/news\/steuerliche-entlastungen-deutschland-zuendet-den-investitions-turbo-64N20250601155544.html)\n\n**Toyota Expands Electric Vehicle Production in North America**\nToyota is expanding its electric vehicle production in North America, with plans to release a new generation of electric cars under the Toyota and Lexus brands.

However, this growth is expected to be hindered by the US government's decision to eliminate subsidies and other policies that support EVs. The IEA had previously estimated that EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) would account for 55% of new car sales in the US by 2030, but this is now expected to be lower due to the elimination of incentives. In contrast, China is expected to have a strong EV market, with the IEA predicting that EVs and PHEVs will account for 80% of new car sales by 2030. The European market is also expected to grow, with EVs and PHEVs accounting for around 30% of new car sales in 2023. However, growth is being hindered by factors such as insufficient charging infrastructure, inconsistent incentives, and high prices. The IEA notes that the elimination of incentives in the US will lead to a decrease in EV sales of 1.1 million units in 2030, and will also cost the US 130,000 jobs in the EV production, battery, and charging infrastructure sectors. The article concludes that the US is at risk of falling behind other countries in the transition to electric vehicles, and that the EU and Italy must take a strong stance on green policies to avoid this fate.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 12:10 AM\nSource:[Corriere Adriatico](https:\/\/www.corriereadriatico.it\/editoriali\/auto_elettriche_usa_resto_del_mondo_germani_editoriale-8858418.html)\n\n**EVs will Make Up 25% of New Car Sales Globally in 2025, up from 20% last Year**\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that electric vehicles (EVs) will make up 25% of new car sales globally in 2025, up from 20% last year.

This development promises to strengthen the local supply chain and reduce dependence on China. The new factories, built by companies like LG Energy Solution, SK On, and Panasonic, represent a significant step forward in the transition to electric mobility in the US. However, the Trump administration's policies may significantly impact the market for electric vehicles. Despite China's continued dominance in global battery production, North America has become the region with the fastest-growing planned production capacity. The 10 new plants that will come online this year will bring the US's annual production capacity to 421.5 gigawatt-hours, nearly doubling that of the previous year. Evan Hartley, analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said, 'the plants are already built. You can't stop the process, and the momentum is there. Most of it is in Republican states. It's hard to take away thousands of promised jobs from your key electoral base.' Despite the Trump administration's threats to eliminate tax incentives for electric vehicles and impose a 25% tariff on vehicles and components from Canada and Mexico, the industry appears determined to continue its path. The localization of battery production could help reduce costs and compensate for potential losses in incentives. Several automakers, including General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Honda, and Ford, have recorded record sales of electric vehicles in the US in recent years, thanks to generous incentives and attractive leasing and financing offers. The challenge now will be to maintain this growth in a potentially less favorable political context.

We offer an explanation: an early deadline is set by 'grabby' civilizations (GC), who expand rapidly, never die alone, change the appearance of the volumes they control, and who are not born within other GC volumes. If we might soon become grabby, then today is near a sample origin date of such a GC. A selection effect explains why we don't see them even though they probably control over a third of the universe now. Each parameter in our three parameter model can be estimated to within roughly a factor of four, allowing principled predictions of GC origins, spacing, appearance, and durations till we see or meet them.\n\nScott Aaronson wrote a qualitative summary of the paper [here](https:\/\/www.scottaaronson.com\/blog\/?p=5253). [Figure 8](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bK33kUn) in their paper provides a cumulative probability distribution for when our descendents will encounter grabby aliens, under various parameter settings in their model. \n\nThis question is important for long-termists, since it provides one constraint on the overall size and power our civilization will eventually have. Assuming that human descendants do not have the ability to conquer neighboring alien civilizations, our descedents will be constrained by the amount of resources we can \"grab\" in a phase of rapid expansion and colonization, much like the [European imperialists](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Timeline_of_European_imperialism) of prior centuries.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as the number of years since 2021 that human descendants (biological or artificial) physically encounter \"grabby aliens\", defined as aliens that consume at least 10^26 watts of power, corresponding to Carl Sagan's proposed definition of a Type II civilization on the [Kardashev scale](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kardashev_scale). For the purpose of this question, to physically encounter an alien civilization means that any part of their technology is within 1 light year of any part of our technology.\n\n*ETA 2021-02-22 In case humanity goes extinct before it meets grabby aliens, it resolves as \">10^16\".\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n### Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- As of February 2021, Robin Hanson, Daniel Martin, Calvin McCarter, and Jonathan Paulson's \"grabby aliens\" model provides the most detailed quantitative forecast for when humanity's descendants might physically encounter \"grabby\" civilizations\u2014defined as those consuming at least \\(10^{26}\\) watts, or Kardashev Type II[1].\n- The model is based on three key parameters (expansion speed, appearance rate, and time to become grabby) and leverages the \"hard steps\" approach to the evolution of intelligent life[1].\n- According to the paper, if we are close to becoming grabby ourselves, then the current epoch is near the median origin date for such civilizations, due to selection effects[1].\n- Figure 8 of the paper presents cumulative probability distributions for the time until encounter, showing that, under central parameter estimates, there is a roughly 50% chance that humanity's descendants will meet grabby aliens within the next 10^8 (100 million) years[1].\n\n### Recent Announcements or Policies\n\n- No significant new scientific announcements or policy decisions as of February 2021 alter the core astrophysical or technological assumptions underlying Hanson's model.\n\n### Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The primary source is the original 2021 Hanson et al. arXiv paper, which details the model and its parameter choices[1].\n- Scott Aaronson's popular summary provides a clear qualitative explanation of the model's reasoning and implications[2].\n- The Kardashev scale is the widely accepted framework for classifying advanced civilizations by energy consumption[3].\n\n### Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The model's parameters (such as the rate at which grabby civilizations appear and their expansion speed) are only known to within a factor of four, so the forecast carries substantial uncertainty[1].\n- The resolution of the question is contingent on humanity's survival; if humanity goes extinct before meeting grabby aliens, the answer is \">10^16\" years.\n- The definition of \"meeting\" is strictly physical proximity (within 1 light year), not mere detection at a distance.\n- The model does not account for unknown unknowns in astrophysics, the behavior of advanced civilizations, or future technological developments.\n\n### Summary Table: Model Forecast\n\n| Probability | Years from 2021 (approximate, from Figure 8) |\n|-------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 10%         | ~10 million                                 |\n| 50%         | ~100 million                                |\n| 90%         | ~1 billion                                  |\n\nMost likely, according to the model, humanity's descendants will encounter grabby aliens in roughly 100 million years, but the uncertainty spans at least an order of magnitude in both directions[1][2].\n\n### References\n\n1.

The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 01:19 PM\nSource:[\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0644](https:\/\/www.arrajol.com\/content\/374847\/%D8%AA%D9%83%D9%86%D9%88%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7\/%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%8B%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%84%D9%81-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85)\n\n**Watch: 'Black Phone 2' to open in theaters Oct. 17 - UPI.com**\nThe horror sequel 'Black Phone 2' is set to open in theaters on October 17, 2025.

According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 02:44 PM\nSource:[24.ae](https:\/\/24.ae\/article\/898494\/%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%8A%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%B1-1000-%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%A9-)\n\n**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**\nExperts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 06:51 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https:\/\/tsn.ua\/ru\/nauka_it\/eksperty-po-dolgoletiyu-rasskazali-kogda-lyudi-smogut-zhit-do-1000-let-2840246.html)\n\n**Alien: Earth - A New Chapter in the Alien Franchise**\nThe Alien franchise is set to take a new turn with the upcoming series Alien: Earth, which will explore a futuristic Earth dominated by corporations in the year 2120.

The movie tells a unique first contact story, where aliens are treated as second-class citizens in South Africa. The ending follows Wikus, a human who is gradually transforming into a prawn, as he finds a solution to his problems with the help of Christopher Johnson, an alien. However, Wikus is forced to wait three years for Christopher to return, and in the meantime, he is vilified in the media and forced to live in dire conditions. The movie's ending is devastating, but also thought-provoking, as it explores themes of prejudice, oppression, and the similarities between humans and aliens. Despite the lack of a sequel, District 9's ending remains powerful and has become a classic of the sci-fi genre. 'It's a testament to the film's craftsmanship that its ending still lingers in the memory long after the credits roll,' says the article. 'The movie's broader thematic concerns and its specific sci-fi worldbuilding both offer food for thought.' The article also notes that the ending sets up a sequel nicely, but the fact that a second movie has taken so long hasn't damaged the original's reputation.

The article also discusses the possibility of humans adapting to life on the Moon, where they could evolve to have traits such as reduced gravity and radiation resistance. The author argues that this hypothesis offers a compelling framework that unifies disparate fields, including ufology, evolutionary biology, catastrophe theory, and futurism. Dr. Elena Rodriguez notes that 'when faced with extinction-level threats, species often undergo rapid adaptation to secure their survival,' and Dr. Julian Savulescu argues that 'the bioethical questions surrounding human enhancement become existential imperatives in the face of extinction-level threats.'

M\u00e9ndez thinks that the next decade or two could bring some tantalizing hints, and 'if we don't find anything at all... that probably collapses the interest and the funding.' Rebecca Charbonneau, a historian of science, notes that 'we have one data point -- that's us,' and that SETI researchers are making a guess based on our preferred own communications technologies.

The untitled film, which has a stellar cast including Josh O'Connor, Emily Blunt, Colin Firth, and Colman Domingo, was originally set to premiere on May 15, 2026, but has been pushed back to June 12, 2026 to avoid competition with other major tentpoles. According to Colman Domingo, the film is 'something new and different' and has 'so much heart,' calling it a 'love letter to our humanity.' Domingo also praised Spielberg's involvement, saying 'It's probably more Steven Spielberg than Steven Spielberg.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 06:11 PM\nSource:[Inverse](https:\/\/www.inverse.com\/entertainment\/steven-spielberg-next-movie-release-date)\n\n**The First Descendant - Kotaku**\nThe First Descendant, a next-generation third-person co-op action RPG looter shooter, was launched in July 2024. Developed using Unreal Engine 5, the game features high-quality graphics.

Critics of the current Dietary Guidelines point out that the emergence of the [obesity epidemic coincided with new government advice to eat less fat and more carbohydrate](https:\/\/www.dietdoctor.com\/introduction-dietary-guidelines-start-obesity-epidemic). (In 2018, the U.S. government [still mandates](https:\/\/www.nutritioncoalition.us\/dietary-guidelines-for-americans-dga-introduction) a low fat\/high carb plan for all Americans over the age of 2, despite the fact that low carbohydrate diets have [whalloped](https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/23-studies-on-low-carb-and-low-fat-diets) low fat diets in clinical trials.)\n\nIn any event, the origins of this disaster notwithstanding, things are clearly getting worse, year after year. Per a recent analysis in The Lancet (described [here](http:\/\/www.healthdata.org\/news-release\/vast-majority-american-adults-are-overweight-or-obese-and-weight-growing-problem-among):)\n\n> An estimated 160 million Americans are either obese or overweight. Nearly three-quarters of American men and more than 60% of women are obese or overweight. These are also major challenges for America\u2019s children \u2013 nearly 30% of boys and girls under age 20 are either obese or overweight, up from 19% in 1980.\n\nPer a [CDC report](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nchs\/fastats\/obesity-overweight.htm) from a few years ago, in the United States:\n\n> Percent of adults aged 20 and over with obesity: 37.9% (2013-2014)\n> Percent of adults aged 20 and over with overweight, including obesity: 70.7% (2013-2014)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as the percentage of the US population who are overweight or obese according to [US CDC data](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/obesity\/resources\/reports.html) for 2030.  For the purposes of this question, overweight or obese persons are defined as having a [Body-Mass Index](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/obesity\/resources\/reports.html) of 25.0 or greater.  This statistic will be calculated for the entire US population, for ages of 18 years or older, for all races, genders, etc.\n\nIf CDC data is not available, no other substitutes will be considered, and this question will resolve ambiguously.\n\n*September 6, 2024 update: The link in the original resolution criteria no longer goes to a valid CDC page.

However, experts agree that a multifaceted approach is necessary to tackle the obesity epidemic, which has failed to make significant progress despite decades of initiatives. The World Health Organisation predicts that the number of people with obesity will double by 2035. Research has shown that obesity is a complex, costly, and chronic disease caused by factors beyond an individual's control, including the addictive effects of ultra-processed food. Abela has proposed a 'multifaceted approach' that includes policy decisions to shape the food environment, addressing social and economic factors, and increasing collaboration with the private sector and professionals on the ground. He has also floated the introduction of a sugar tax and announced a research programme on food labelling, supply, and promotion. Abela's efforts are seen as a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to make obesity a national priority and safeguard future generations from the long-term health and economic consequences of the disease.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 04:30 AM\nSource:[timesofmalta.com](https:\/\/timesofmalta.com\/article\/editorial-shifting-scales-requires-bold-action.1110623)\n\n**80% of People with Obesity are Women, Says Nutritionist**\nAccording to Daisy Rivas, a nutritionist at the Te\u00f3filo D\u00e1vila hospital, there is a high percentage of obesity in the country, with at least 10-13 out of 15 patients she sees per week suffering from obesity, and the majority of them are women. Rivas emphasizes that this problem affects people of all ages, from children to adults and the elderly, with around 80-90% of patients presenting with obesity. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 1 billion people (1 in 8) worldwide suffer from obesity, a figure that was expected to reach 2030 but has already become a reality in 2024. Rivas highlights the importance of education in preventing obesity, suggesting that parents, especially mothers, learn and teach their children how to eat a balanced diet. She also warns against the dangers of processed and ultra-processed foods, as well as fast food, which can lead to weight gain and other health problems. Rivas recommends consulting a nutritionist for a personalized treatment plan, rather than following 'miracle diets' that can cause imbalances and harm.

By 2030, it's estimated that 27 million people in Turkey will be obese, or one in three. Experts attribute this trend to insufficient nutrition, social inequality, unhealthy food supplies, and a lack of coherent policy strategies. Hacer Foggo, a Turkish poverty researcher, said the growing number of obese children can be linked to extreme poverty, while Bulent Sik, a food researcher, sees a direct link between the rise in child obesity and the widespread consumption of highly processed foods with low nutritional value and a high sugar content. Sik also warned of the use of toxic chemicals in food production, such as pesticides and certain additives that are related to hormonal imbalances and weight gain. Turkey's Health Ministry has launched a national public health campaign to combat obesity, but experts say the effort has drawn criticism for stigmatizing overweight individuals and overlooking the country's broader economic struggles. 'Political decision-makers are responsible for creating solutions,' said Sik. Both Sik and Foggo support a nationwide free school meal program, citing the need for adequate guidelines for healthy eating and restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy foods.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 05:33 AM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/turkey-sees-sharp-rise-in-obesity\/a-72701125)\n\n**More than half of young people will face health problems by 2030**\nA new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, more than 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity and overweight have increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The document also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. In 2016, fewer than 1,000 adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, but by 2021, the number had already exceeded 1.1 billion. Another concerning aspect is the role that climate change and technology will play. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with an average annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. According to UN estimates, by 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24. This generation faces a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 08:35 PM\nSource:[agenciapi.co](https:\/\/www.agenciapi.co\/noticia\/salud\/en-2030-mas-de-la-mitad-de-los-jovenes-enfrentaran-problemas-de-salud)\n\n**2025's Most Overweight and Obese Cities in the U.S.**\nAccording to a study by WalletHub, nearly 42 percent of U.S. adults are classified as obese, with some areas of the country struggling more than others.

The study, which includes data from 204 countries and territories, is based on the Global Burden of Disease, a large program funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which aims to compile health data from most countries. The authors estimate that the inaction of governments in the face of the growing crisis of obesity and overweight over the past 30 years has led to an alarming explosion in the number of people affected. Between 1990 and 2021, this number almost tripled among adults over 25 years old, from 731 million to 2.11 billion, and more than doubled among children and adolescents aged 5-24, from 198 million to 493 million. 'Without urgent policy reform and concrete actions, 60% of adults, or 3.8 billion people, and nearly a third (31%) of children and adolescents, or 746 million, will be overweight or obese by 2050,' according to the study. To face 'one of the greatest health challenges of the 21st century,' it is necessary to adopt five-year action plans (2025-2030) with key measures: 'regulate the advertising of ultra-processed foods, integrate sports infrastructure and playgrounds into schools, encourage breastfeeding and balanced diets from pregnancy, and develop nutrition policies adapted to each country,' say its authors. 'In 2050, one in three young people suffering from obesity, or 130 million, will live in two regions: North Africa and the Middle East, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean, with serious health, economic, and social consequences,' they note. Obesity among young people is expected to jump by 121% worldwide, with a total of 360 million children and adolescents obese by 2050. The first affected, with a strong expected increase from 2022-2030 worldwide, are boys aged 5-14: in 2030, we should count in this category more obese (16.5%) than overweight young people (12.9%). This obesity epidemic will further strain already overburdened healthcare systems, particularly in low-resource countries, as nearly a quarter of obese adults worldwide will be 65 years or older in 2050. 'Preventing obesity must be a top priority in policies in low- and middle-income countries,' estimates Dr. Jessica Kerr of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia, one of the main co-authors of the study. She calls for 'much stronger political commitment' in favor of 'global strategies that improve nutrition, physical activity, and living environments for people,' judging the window of action to be short.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 06:48 AM\nSource:[SudOuest.fr](https:\/\/www.sudouest.fr\/international\/obesite-60-des-adultes-seront-atteints-d-ici-2050-dans-le-monde-une-etude-plaide-pour-une-action-urgente-23497103.php)\n\n**12% Indians are overweight or live with obesity compared to 49% Americans: Lancet study**\nAccording to a Lancet study, 12.41% of Indians (180 million out of 1.45 billion) are overweight or living with obesity, compared to 49.71% of Americans (172 million out of 346 million).

This is up from 2 billion (40%) in 2015 and 1.6 billion (36%) in 2010. The report also highlights that the Samoa American is the country with the highest percentage of adults with obesity (77%), while Vietnam has the lowest (2%). The president of the World Obesity Federation, Sim\u00f3n Barquera, stated, 'It is clear that obesity is on the rise and it is also clear that many countries are not prepared to face what is a growing problem for populations.' Barquera emphasized that obesity is a 'serious disease in its own right' and a 'driver' for non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and stroke. He also noted that 'more people die from obesity than in traffic accidents each year.'

The ruling Chinese Communist Party is tightening its control over the media, online speech, religious groups, and civil society associations while undermining already modest rule-of-law reforms.\n\n\nLast year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/10\/06\/chinas-golden-week-ends-but-the-communist-party-congress-will-keep-the-holiday-mood-up.html\n\">Party authorities tightened political, social, and media restrictions in Beijing and across China in the months ahead of the October gathering<\/a>. Implementation of a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/China_Internet_Security_Law\">Cybersecurity Law<\/a> and other new regulations resulted in a crackdown on VPNs, penalties for private technology companies whose censorship measures were deemed insufficient, tighter enforcement of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/08\/27\/china-doubles-down-on-real-name-registration-laws-forbidding-anonymous-online-posts\/\n\">real-name registration rules online<\/a>, and greater pressure on users to censor themselves and each other.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.chinasource.org\/blog\/posts\/new-religion-regulations-to-take-effect-in-february\">New regulations that took effect in February 2018 further restricted the scope for religious freedoms<\/a>, particularly for children\u2019s religious education. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2017\/jun\/23\/in-chinas-far-west-experts-fear-a-ticking-timebomb-religious\">An already massive security presence in Xinjiang grew<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2018\/8\/15\/17684226\/uighur-china-camps-united-nations\">and restrictions on free expression, travel, and religious practice in the region expanded<\/a> to affect not only Uighurs but also Kazakhs and other Muslim ethnic minorities, many of whom were detained on the pretext of countering terrorism and possibly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-china-rights-un\/u-n-calls-on-china-to-free-uighurs-from-re-education-camps-idUSKCN1LF1D6\n\">up to a million Uighurs may have been sent to extralegal political indoctrination centers<\/a>\n.\n\nAccording to <a href=\"https:\/\/freedomhouse.org\/report\/freedom-world\/2018\/china\">Freedom House's 2018 report<\/a>, the condition of Chinese Political Rights (i.e. the state of its electoral process, the extent of political pluralism and participation, the functioning of its government, and discretionary political rights) deteriorated to its lowest point in at least 15 years in 2017.\n\nThe reported condition of Civil Liberties (i.e. freedom of expression and belief, associational and organisational freedoms, the rule of law, and personal autonomy and individual rights) have only slightly worsened since 2005.\n\nFreedom House reports annual scores of Chinese Political Rights (with a score 0-40: 0=Least Free 40=Most Free) and Civil Liberties (with a score 0-60: 0=Least Free 60=Most Free). The current scores for China are 0 for Political Rights, and 14 for Civil Liberties. The Total Aggregate score is the sum of these two scores. 2017\u2019s aggregate score is therefore 14.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as the overall global freedom score given to China by Freedom House reflecting the state of China in calendar year 2028. This number is expected be published in Freedom House's 2029 annual Freedom in the World report. The question will be annulled if their reports are discontinued.\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- As of 2018, China's aggregate Freedom House score was 14 (0\/40 for Political Rights, 14\/60 for Civil Liberties) for the 2017 reporting year[2].\n- Political Rights have reached their lowest point in at least 15 years, with a score of 0, reflecting complete absence of any electoral competition or political pluralism[2].\n- Civil Liberties have gradually declined over more than a decade, with ongoing restrictions on media, the internet, religion, and civil society[2].\n- The overall trend from 2005\u20132018 is one of steady or accelerating repression.\n\n## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- Implementation of the Cybersecurity Law and stricter real-name registration rules have intensified online surveillance and censorship[2].\n- New religious regulations in 2018 further constrained religious freedoms, especially for children[2].\n- The security crackdown in Xinjiang expanded, with up to a million Uighurs reportedly detained in re-education camps and new restrictions on expression, movement, and worship for ethnic minorities[2].\n- The Chinese Communist Party showed no signs of liberalization, instead consolidating power and tightening ideological controls[2].\n\n## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Freedom House, \"Freedom in the World 2018: China\" (for historical score and trends)[2]\n- Freedom House country profile on China[1]\n- Related policy analysis and reporting on Chinese repression (references provided below)\n\n## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- Forecast assumes no major liberalizing reforms or political shocks before 2028.\n- Minor year-to-year fluctuations in Civil Liberties are possible, but the structural factors suggest further decline or stagnation at a low level.\n- The scoring methodology and Freedom House reporting are assumed to remain unchanged.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven the above, the most probable aggregate Freedom House score for China in the calendar year 2028 is **12\u201314**, with the highest likelihood at **14**, assuming no significant positive political transformation. The Political Rights score is likely to remain at 0, and Civil Liberties may stay at 14 or slip slightly lower due to continued or enhanced repression. The aggregate score will almost certainly remain among the lowest globally.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[1]. China: Country Profile - Freedom House (https:\/\/freedomhouse.org\/country\/china)  \n[2].

It is followed by two other private American universities, MIT and Stanford. Cambridge and Oxford in the UK, respectively in 4th and 5th place, are the public institutions with the highest score in the world. Despite winning eight of the top ten positions, the US is struggling to maintain its dominance globally. In the Global 2000 ranking, only 40 American universities have improved their position compared to 2024, with 15 maintaining their position and 264 falling in the ranking. The best public American university is Berkeley, ranked 12th in the world, one place behind Caltech. The US is the second country with the most representatives in the Global 2000 ranking with 319 institutions, ten fewer than last year. Canada has 38 institutions in the ranking, led by the University of Toronto at 23rd place. Nadim Mahassen, president of World University Rankings, comments: 'Although the US still boasts the best universities in the world, the decline of the vast majority of its higher education institutions should concern US Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and the entire Trump administration. At a time when Chinese universities are reaping the fruits of years of generous financial support from their government, American institutions are struggling with federal funding cuts and controversies over academic freedom and free speech. With the US surpassed by China as the country with the most representatives in the ranking, its reputation in the global higher education sector is seriously threatened.' Mahassen warns: 'The strong decline of American universities is parallel to that of universities in Japan, France, and Germany, while British and Russian universities have had slightly better results.

According to Nadim Mahassen, president of the Center for World University Rankings, China's success is attributed to enhanced research performance and sustained government investment in higher education. Mahassen said, 'At a time when Chinese universities are reaping the rewards of years of generous financial support from their government, American institutions are grappling with slashed federal funding and disputes over academic freedom and free speech.' The sharp decline of US universities parallels that of institutions in Japan, France, and Germany, while UK and Russian universities have fared only slightly better.

This has further solidified the labor force foundation for building a large-scale high-quality innovative army. China Science and Technology Association (CSTA) officials explained that the survey is divided into four levels: 'high-level scientific literacy', 'scientific literacy', 'basic scientific literacy', and 'low scientific literacy'. The survey results show that 2.30% of citizens have high-level scientific literacy, 15.37% have scientific literacy, and 44.07% have basic scientific literacy. The CSTA official analyzed the characteristics of the 4.4 billion people with basic scientific literacy: they are large in scale, with an average score of 68, and have a strong ability to apply scientific knowledge. The official believes that this group can adapt to the development of the times, provide a large-scale human resource foundation for economic and social development, and lay a solid foundation for the continuous improvement of citizen scientific literacy. There is no concept of 'not having scientific literacy' in the survey, and the results are not intended to imply that there is a group of people who do not have scientific literacy. The official emphasized that the survey results should be used to provide targeted suggestions for education, public scientific literacy, and scientific innovation, rather than being used to create a sense of crisis or anxiety.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 01:47 AM\nSource:[news.cn](http:\/\/www.news.cn\/politics\/20250602\/a22b04569e7248988f2ae429462ceece\/c.html)\n\n**China's Gaokao Exam: A Secretive and Highly Secure Test of Knowledge and Endurance**\nEvery June, millions of Chinese students face the gaokao, the national university entrance exam that can determine the course of their lives. In 2025, over 13.35 million young people will take this test, according to the Chinese Ministry of Education, making it one of the largest numbers on record. The results not only open or close doors to China's most prestigious universities, but also directly affect professional success in China and social mobility for each applicant. As a Chinese official said, 'The security of the gaokao is a matter of educational justice.' The exam tests knowledge and also measures the ability to withstand pressure. The test lasts between two and four days, depending on the province, with days that exceed nine hours. Students must take exams in Chinese language, mathematics, and foreign language, and also choose subjects such as physics, chemistry, history, or politics. It's not enough to pass; the system prioritizes those who achieve better results than the rest. Intensive preparation begins in childhood. Many adolescents study between 10 and 12 hours a day. Achieving a high score can mean accessing one of the country's top 50 universities, with salaries that exceed those of graduates from lower-ranked centers by up to 30%. As a Weibo user said, 'For many, the gaokao is the only path to success.' The exams are printed under the supervision of the Ministry of Education and the National Administration of State Secrets Protection, usually in highly secure prisons. The selected teachers who design them remain isolated for weeks, without access to the internet or mobile phones. They can only communicate with family members through fixed phones under state control. During the exam days, surveillance cameras, GPS systems, and drones are used to prevent cheating, which is punishable by up to seven years in prison in China. In cities like Beijing, construction is suspended and exclusive public transportation is provided for students.

Vietnam, which ranks fifth on the list, is following China's footsteps. China's 'Great Firewall' system controls internet traffic within and outside the country, allowing the government to filter content. Iran and North Korea also use similar systems. This model is becoming popular in Southeast Asia, with Cambodia and Thailand considering adopting similar strict internet policies. Tight internet regulations are common in the Middle East and North Africa, with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bahrain ranking high on the list.

In the 2025 World Press Freedom Index, 20 out of 32 countries and territories in the region saw their economic score decrease. Many independent media outlets in Myanmar have been dismantled and forced into exile or clandestinity. Hong Kong and Cambodia have seen media closures and journalist departures, often forced into exile under precarious conditions. Radio Free Asia's shortwave programs in Mandarin, Tibetan, and Laotian have been suspended. Concentration and collusion with the power of politics dominate the majority of media groups, with Thailand, Mongolia, and Pakistan being among the most skilled at controlling the media. RSF notes that some countries, such as North Korea, China, and Vietnam, have completely suppressed any form of independent media. As one commenter noted, 'Personne ne parle de la France, aucune libert\u00e9 de l\u2019information dans les grands m\u00e9dias' ('Nobody talks about France, no freedom of information in the major media').

RSF's White Orlan explained, 'China's restrictions on press freedom have become more severe in recent years. Those who still insist on independent reporting are almost impossible to find. Many have been forced to work underground. As soon as the authorities discover someone doing independent reporting or publishing articles under their real name, they become a target for persecution.' Foreign journalists also face various restrictions, including strict visa approval policies and frequent smear campaigns. Hong Kong's press freedom ranking has dropped from 135 to 140, with a record-low score of 39. RSF has classified Hong Kong as 'very serious' for the first time. Taiwan's press freedom ranking has improved to 24, but RSF believes there is still room for improvement.

'Authorities are particularly harsh in suppressing Tibetan religious beliefs and cultural identity, imposing policies that weaken the presence of ethnic Tibetans.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 05:24 AM\nSource:[phayul.com](https:\/\/www.phayul.com\/2025\/03\/19\/51902\/)\n\n**Hongkongers' score for city's autonomy, freedom dips for first time since 2020**\nA new poll has found that Hongkongers' perception of the city's autonomy and freedom has declined for the first time since 2020, according to the One Country Two Systems Index published by the Path for Democracy think tank. The poll of 1,005 residents found that nearly half of respondents are dissatisfied with the city's legislature.

By the year 2000 this had declined to 40.25 hours per week; a decrease of over 35%.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question asks: in January 2030, how many hours per week will the average employee on US private nonfarm payrolls work, according to either the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, or the statistical authority tasked with providing this information?\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The average American workweek has steadily declined over the past 150 years: 62 hours\/week in 1870, 40.25 by 2000, and 34.4 hours\/week in July 2019 (for US private nonfarm payrolls)[2].\n- Most of the decline occurred before the 1980s; since then, the average workweek has plateaued near 34\u201335 hours[4].\n- The plateau is attributed to cultural, economic, and institutional factors\u2014such as labor laws, union influence, and employer practices\u2014that have stabilized the standard full-time workweek[4].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- There are ongoing discussions and pilot programs for shorter workweeks (e.g., four-day workweek, six-hour workday), but these are not yet widespread in the US labor market as of 2019.\n- No major federal policy changes regarding standard workweek length have been enacted since the 40-hour week was established.\n- Technological change is accelerating: McKinsey estimates that by 2030, up to 30% of current work hours in the US could be automated, particularly in routine, lower-wage occupations[5].\n- The COVID-19 pandemic (post-2019) accelerated occupational shifts and remote work, but as of 2019 these impacts were not yet evident[5].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks and publishes average weekly hours for private nonfarm payrolls[1].\n- Forecasting platforms (e.g., Metaculus) aggregate expert and community predictions on future workweek averages[2].\n- Economic research (e.g., McKinsey, CBO) provides insight into structural trends and technology impacts[3][5].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The workweek average reflects both full-time and part-time employees, so shifts in employment composition affect the metric.\n- Technological forecasts are uncertain: while automation could reduce hours in some sectors, other sectors may maintain or even increase hours due to labor shortages or demand shifts[5].\n- Cultural and policy inertia in the US has historically slowed changes to workweek norms[4].\n- Measurement methods or definitions by statistical agencies could change over time.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the historical trend, ongoing technological changes, and current policy context as of 2019, the most likely outcome for January 2030 is a modest reduction in average weekly hours\u2014from 34.4 hours\/week in 2019 to approximately 31\u201333 hours\/week in 2030. This aligns with community forecasts and recent analyses[2][5].\n\n- Best estimate (median): ~32 hours\/week.\n- 50% confidence interval: 31\u201333 hours\/week.\n- Lower bound (10th percentile): ~29 hours\/week (if major automation\/part-time shift).\n- Upper bound (90th percentile): ~34 hours\/week (if trends stall further).\n\n## References\n\n1.

According to labor lawyer Juanma Lorente, companies could apply this reduction in several ways, including reducing the working day by 30 minutes, working fewer hours in the summer months, or increasing the number of vacation days. If the law is approved, workers could receive 12 more days of vacation, bringing the total to 42 days per year. Lorente explained that this option would be calculated on an annual basis, not weekly. The government aims to implement the new law before the end of 2025, which would also include measures such as digital time control, the 'right to disconnect' outside of working hours, and stricter penalties for companies that fail to comply with the new regulations.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 06:13 PM\nSource:[as](https:\/\/as.com\/actualidad\/sociedad\/los-espanoles-que-tendran-42-dias-de-vacaciones-en-2026-si-se-aprueba-la-reduccion-de-la-jornada-laboral-n\/)\n\n**Socialdemokraterna: ett fegt h\u00f6gerparti**\nThe Swedish Social Democratic Party (S) has continued to move to the right by demanding harsher punishments and more money for the military. At their recent congress in Gothenburg, they rejected a proposal to reduce the workweek to 35 hours by 2035, which was seen as a 'cowardly and watered-down' proposal by Annika Strandh\u00e4ll. The party's decision to reject the proposal shows their clear shift to the right. The article argues that the party's stance on work hours is a class issue, as it affects the workers who guarantee the country's prosperity. The author notes that the party's proposal to let 'the parties' decide on work hours is unclear and may be a way to avoid making a decision. The article concludes that the party's decision is 'historical' and a clear message that work hours need to be shortened. Meanwhile, the Swedish Employers' Association (Svenskt N\u00e4ringsliv) has already reduced their workweek to 32 hours. 'It was a cowardly and watered-down proposal,' Strandh\u00e4ll said.

The analysis compared the number of unicorns (companies with a valuation of over $10 billion) in the EU and the US, with the US having 690 unicorns (total valuation of $253 billion) compared to the EU's 107 unicorns (valuation of $33.3 billion). The WSJ attributes this to the EU's declining labor culture, with a decrease in working hours and labor productivity compared to the US. In 1999, EU labor productivity was 95% of US labor productivity, but it has now decreased to below 80%. Additionally, EU workers have shorter working hours than US workers, with an average of 30.2 hours per week in 2023 compared to 34.6 hours per week in the US. Experts predict that this situation will not change in the near future, as the EU prioritizes stability, job security, and quality of life over long working hours and risk-taking.

Experts Weigh In**\nExperts warn that millennials should be concerned about the future of Social Security, as the trust fund may dry up in the 2030s and benefits could be reduced by 21-22%. According to Krisstin Petersmarck, National Social Security Advisor, the number of beneficiaries is outpacing the number of workers paying into the system, and by 2040, the ratio of workers to beneficiaries is projected to drop to 2.3. Jonathan Ford Jr., a financial advisor, advises millennials to plan for retirement as if Social Security won't be around forever, and to take responsibility for their own retirement. He suggests that if necessary changes are made to preserve Social Security, it would be a bonus, and that millennials should consider early retirement or spending more during retirement. 'It is no secret that the Social Security trust fund is facing trouble,' Petersmarck wrote. 'The fact is, more people are leaving the workforce than entering it.'

He claims that the current generation is lazy and that a four-day workweek and work-life balance will not be sustainable. However, the data shows that Germans are actually working more hours than ever before, with a record number of people employed in 2024 and a significant increase in total working hours since 2019. The average working time has decreased due to more people working part-time, but this is a result of more people entering the workforce, including those with family or care responsibilities. In contrast, countries like Poland and the US have much longer working hours, which is not a new phenomenon. The real issue is that Germany's productivity has stagnated, which is a major concern for the country's future. As the population ages, Germany will need to find ways to maintain its standard of living, and increasing productivity is a key solution. Merz's proposal to work more is not a solution to the demographic crisis, but rather a distraction from the real issue of productivity. The new government's ideas to mobilize more workforce, such as tax-free overtime bonuses or reduced taxes for those who continue to work after retirement, are a step in the right direction.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 10:34 AM\nSource:[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung](https:\/\/www.sueddeutsche.de\/meinung\/arbeitszeit-deutsche-merz-debatte-produktivitaet-li.3261704)\n\n**There are no boundaries left**\nThe author reflects on the impact of the internet on their generation, noting that they are one of the last to remember a time before widespread internet use.

The proposed reform aims to modify Article 123 of the Mexican Constitution to ensure workers have a maximum of 40 hours of work and two days of rest for every five days worked. By 2030, the goal is for all workers to have at least two days of rest per week. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Mexico is the second country with the most working hours in the world. The OECD measures working hours by calculating the total effective working hours per year, divided by the average annual number of employees. This includes regular hours for full-time, part-time, and annual employees, as well as overtime, whether paid or not, and additional work hours. The OECD excludes hours not worked due to holidays, paid vacations, illness, injury, temporary incapacity, maternity or paternity leave, training or education, technical or economic layoffs, strikes or labor conflicts, inclement weather, absences for compensation, and other reasons.

However, the opposite has occurred, and people are working more than ever. Researcher Prof Kevin Murphy from the University of Limerick notes that the more people earn, the less likely they are to take time off, and the reward for work becomes more work. The concept of 'enough' is also elusive, leading to the question of why people clock in and out every day. Is it for a paycheck or a sense of purpose? In a recent podcast, presenter Ella McSweeney explores this topic with Prof Murphy, discussing the challenges of work and potential solutions.

'It would be good if we could move towards a 40-hour workweek for more employees,' he said to the German Press Agency in Berlin. Currently, the average weekly working hours in Germany are 34.3 hours, according to the Federal Statistical Office. Dulger noted that Germany has 46 million employees, but they do not work significantly more than they did 20 years ago, despite having fewer employees and inhabitants at the time. Dulger emphasized that Germany needs to increase its efficiency. 'We need to make work pay again, and there should be more net income from gross income,' he said. Germany is already facing a shortage of skilled workers, and with the baby boomer generation retiring in the coming years, the country will face a significant loss of employees.

Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- As of March 12, 2021, Bitcoin\u2019s price had surpassed $55,000, marking a dramatic increase from previous years. Institutional adoption and increased mainstream awareness have contributed to this growth.\n- Bitcoin\u2019s historical price has been highly volatile, with prior peaks in 2013 (~$1,000), 2017 (~$20,000), and then a surge to ~$55,000 by early 2021.\n- Institutional investors (e.g., Tesla, MicroStrategy) and increasing public company treasury holdings in Bitcoin have supported strong upward momentum.\n- By 2025, expert forecasts placed Bitcoin between $80,000 and $250,000, with some bullish analysts projecting the possibility of hitting $1,000,000 by 2030[1].\n\n## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- **Institutional Adoption:** Major financial institutions and public companies have begun to adopt Bitcoin as part of treasury reserves, lending credibility and potential long-term demand.\n- **Regulatory Developments:** Governments are moving towards clearer regulatory frameworks. This reduces uncertainty but could also introduce restrictions or taxes in some jurisdictions.\n- **Network and Technical Upgrades:** Ongoing development (e.g., scalability solutions) could enhance Bitcoin's use case and value proposition.\n- **Macroeconomic Factors:** Global economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and currency devaluation fears have driven some investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge[5].\n\n## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Binance, as the exchange with the highest trading volume, is the primary reference for price measurement. Alternate sources include Coinbase, Kraken, Bitfinex, and Bitstamp, as specified in the rules.\n\n## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- **Market Volatility:** Bitcoin\u2019s price is highly volatile and susceptible to large swings based on macro events, regulatory changes, or technological issues.\n- **Exchange Reliability:** The resolution depends on Binance\u2019s continued operation and accurate historical price data.\n- **Regulatory Risk:** Sudden, restrictive regulations could impact adoption or trading.\n- **Technological Risks:** Security incidents or protocol failures could directly impact price.\n\n## Comparative Reference Cases and Key Differences\n\n| Reference Case            | 2021 Status                | Key Differences Affecting Forecast      |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 2017 Bull Run            | $20,000 peak               | Lower adoption, less institutional interest |\n| March 2021               | $55,000+                   | Higher adoption, institutional and retail activity, more regulatory scrutiny |\n| 2025-2030 Projections    | $80k\u2013$250k (conservative); up to $2.4M (bullish)[1][2][5]| Ongoing adoption, potential for mainstream financial integration, global economic instability |\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- **Conservative scenarios** (based on current adoption and moderate growth): Bitcoin\u2019s highest value by 2030 could range from $100,000 to $250,000[1][3][5].\n- **Base-case scenarios** (assuming continued institutional adoption and favorable macro conditions): Projections suggest $400,000\u2013$1.2 million[2][5].\n- **Bullish scenarios** (accelerated adoption and macroeconomic tailwinds): Estimates from ARK Invest and others go as high as $2.4 million[2][5].\n- **Most cited forecasts**: Binance research highlights a broad potential range, with an average around $424,399 and extremes from $238,152 to $610,646[5].

Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, predicts that Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030 in her company's 'Bull Case' scenario, requiring a 58% annual compound growth rate over the next five years, primarily driven by increasing institutional adoption. Robert Kiyosaki, a popular financial educator and author of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', predicts a more modest price of $1 million for Bitcoin by 2035. Kiyosaki believes that until 2035, a Bitcoin will be worth more than $1 million, gold will be at $30,000, and silver will be at $3,000 per coin, citing record-high federal and credit card debt in the United States in 2025 as the main factor for the search for protection assets like precious metals and Bitcoin. Other analysts, including Raoul Pal, point to the devaluation of fiat currencies as a key reason for Bitcoin's appeal as a protection asset. Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, also predicts that Bitcoin will reach $1 million, highlighting its potential to 'transform the global economy in incredible ways'. Markus Thielen, CEO and head of research at 10x Research, notes that Bitcoin's price historically moves in increments of $16,000, indicating that the next significant resistance for Bitcoin is near $122,000.

Some experts predict that by 2023, the value of Ripple could reach $3. Others predict that if XRP adoption reaches expected levels, we could see the price of Ripple go up to $5 in 2024, with XRP potentially oscillating between $4-$8. The majority of predictions state that the value of Ripple will be around $6 for most of 2025. Long-term price predictions for XRP state that the digital currency could reach $17 by 2030. Ripple's CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, says that they want to make XRP a valuable payment tool, and its value will increase as a result. Ripple is different from Bitcoin in that it is controlled by a company that works with banks, and XRP cannot be extracted. It can process 1,500 transactions per second, compared to Bitcoin's 7 transactions per second.

Experts predict that artificial intelligence, tokenized properties, and gold will be the top investment choices in the coming years. Currently, approximately 48.7% of global investments are in real estate, with a total value of $380 trillion. Bonds and stocks follow, with $133 trillion and $124 trillion, respectively. Gold and cryptocurrencies trail behind, with a total market value of $22.4 trillion and $3.6 trillion, respectively. Despite being the least popular investment option, cryptocurrencies have provided the highest returns to investors in recent years. For example, Bitcoin has increased by approximately 3100% since 2018. In contrast, gold has grown by 167%, stocks by 66%, bonds by 29.4%, and global real estate by 22.5% over the same period. Experts believe that investment preferences will shift towards digital and thematic areas in the future, driven by economic, technological, demographic, and climate factors. Tokenized properties, which are becoming increasingly popular, may reduce the high entry costs associated with real estate. Younger investors are turning to digital assets with smaller capital, while aging populations may lead to decreased demand for housing in some countries. Traditional safe-haven assets like bonds are losing their appeal due to rising government debt and declining credit ratings. Stock markets, on the other hand, continue to offer long-term investment opportunities in sectors like artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, cloud technology, and biotechnology. Gold remains a popular investment option during times of uncertainty, but experts warn that factors like space mining may increase gold supply and drive down prices in the future. Cryptocurrencies are growing as an alternative to traditional finance, with an estimated 560 million people, or 7% of the global population, using them by 2024. According to ARK Invest, the value of this market could reach $12 trillion by 2030 and $50 trillion by 2050.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 09:16 AM\nSource:[D\u00fcnya](https:\/\/www.dunya.com\/finans\/haberler\/emlak-zirvede-kripto-ucuz-yatirimci-tercihleri-nereye-evriliyor-haberi-778745)\n\n**Is Bitcoin About to Soar -- or Crash? | The Motley Fool**\nBitcoin has reached a new all-time high of $112,000, leading some investors to believe it will continue to soar in 2025.

Long-term forecasts indicate potential highs of $5.65 by 2030. The network's strong push for scalability, security, and decentralization is paying off, with growing developer interest and improved adoption. However, the question remains: Can ALGO Price hit $1 this cycle? According to CoinPedia's Algorand Price Prediction, the forecast for the Algorand network is optimistic for the coming years. With a potential altcoin market in Q1 2025, the ALGO coin price might skyrocket toward a new high. If the network maintains the staggering growth, the ALGO coin price may reach $0.89 in 2025. Conversely, if the network fails to expand, then the price can flip into a bearish trap and dip to $0.45. Looking ahead to 2026, the ALGO price may record a maximum price of $1.35. With a potential low of $0.65, the average price could settle at around $1.0. By 2030, the value of a single Algorand token could reach a high of $5.65, a low of $2.50, and an average of $4.05.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 02:53 PM\nSource:[bitrss.com](https:\/\/bitrss.com\/algorand-price-prediction-2025-2026-2030-will-algo-price-hit-1-93407)\n\n**Bitcoin Maintains Value Above $109,000, Reaching New Historical Highs**\nBitcoin has maintained its value above $109,000, reaching new historical highs last week, just before Bitcoin Pizza Day. According to Lemon, the cryptocurrency has traded at $109,002 at 8:45 am today, with 0% growth in the last 24 hours. In contrast, most popular cryptocurrencies have experienced slight declines, except for Ethereum, which has risen by 3.1%. Willy Woo, a bitcoin analyst since 2016, has warned that the upward trend is starting to decline and may be followed by a period of consolidation. 'We're preparing for another solid streak in the long term,' he said. Despite its volatility, the growing institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors present a promising scenario for bitcoin. US Treasurer Rosie R\u00edos has stated that both bitcoin and blockchain 'are here to stay.' 'The world is watching us. We're setting the pace for what will happen not only in our history, but also in the future, and for all of us, this is the American dream. It's about the values that founded our country,' she said at the Bitcoin Conference 2025. The current US President, Donald Trump, has become a key figure in the industry, promising to create a bitcoin reserve and launching two cryptocurrencies, US$TRUMP and US$MELANIA. Marcelo Cavazzoli, founder and CEO of Lemon, noted that the last historical maximum has seen the highest volume of purchases and sales in the last three months and the most users interacting with Bitcoin in the last year. 'The interest is no longer just from retail. Today we see funds, companies, governments, and even proposals to incorporate bitcoin into state reserves. Institutional adoption is at a different speed: ETFs are opening the door, and every dollar that enters is transformed into a real BTC purchase,' he said. From Bitso, another major cryptocurrency platform in the region, they also celebrated this new record. 'The Bitcoin Pizza Day marks a key milestone in the history of cryptocurrencies: it recalls the first commercial transaction with bitcoin. Today, with a market capitalization of around $1.9 trillion, cryptocurrencies continue to challenge traditional models,' explained Juli\u00e1n Colombo, general manager of Bitso Argentina. Guilherme Nazar, regional vice president of Binance for Latin America, stated: 'The new historical maximum of bitcoin speaks of its resilience in the face of uncertainty and its growing relevance, a sign of confidence from both individuals and institutions. That this milestone was achieved on Bitcoin Pizza Day is a symbolic reminder that the value of cryptocurrencies is not a speculative theater, but something tangible, global, and deeply human.' The boom in Argentina is also reflected locally. According to the Panorama Cripto in Am\u00e9rica Latina report, Argentina leads the region in the value received in cryptocurrencies, with $91.1 billion between July 2023 and June 2024. Bitcoin represents 49% of cryptocurrency portfolios in the country, dominating over other digital currencies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 02:27 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https:\/\/www.lanacion.com.ar\/economia\/IA\/bitcoin-se-mantiene-arriba-de-los-us109000-nid29052025\/)\n\n**'Orange is the new gold': Bitcoin Predictions Soar to New Heights**\nThe Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas has become the epicenter of an unprecedented wave of optimism in the crypto world. Major figures in the sector have made vertiginous predictions for the cryptocurrency, with scenarios of $200,000 and even $1 million becoming increasingly consensual. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, said, 'The bitcoin is no longer an alternative, it's the new standard. Orange is the new gold.' He believes that the bitcoin, associated with the color orange in its logo, will surpass gold as a global reserve value, as younger generations prefer digital assets to precious metals. Robert Kiyosaki, author of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad,' also predicts a bitcoin price of $1 million by 2035, citing the potential 'implosion of the dollar' due to the US's massive public debt. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), former CEO of Binance, believes that the bitcoin could reach between $500,000 and $1 million in the current or next cycle, driven by the combined effects of spot ETFs, institutional demand, and inflationary monetary policies. Matt Hougan, director of investments at Bitwise, predicts a bitcoin price of $200,000 by the end of 2025, citing the inevitable rise of the cryptocurrency due to its fixed supply and massive buying pressure generated by recently approved bitcoin ETFs in the US.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 11:34 AM\nSource:[BFMTV](https:\/\/www.bfmtv.com\/crypto\/bitcoin\/orange-is-the-new-gold-les-propheties-flamboyantes-des-geants-de-la-crypto-pour-le-bitcoin_AN-202505280454.html)\n\n**Bitcoin to Reach $1 Million by 2030: Prominent Analysts Predict Strong Price Increase**\nSeveral prominent financial commentators and investment analysts are predicting a long-term price increase for Bitcoin that could take the asset's price above $1 million before the end of the decade, driven by growing inflation and expanding global debt. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, predicts that Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030 in her company's 'Bull Case' scenario, requiring a 58% annual compound growth rate over the next five years, primarily driven by increasing institutional adoption. Robert Kiyosaki, a popular financial educator and author of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', predicts a more modest price of $1 million for Bitcoin by 2035. Kiyosaki believes that until 2035, a Bitcoin will be worth more than $1 million, gold will be at $30,000, and silver will be at $3,000 per coin, citing record-high federal and credit card debt in the United States in 2025 as the main factor for the search for protection assets like precious metals and Bitcoin. Other analysts, including Raoul Pal, point to the devaluation of fiat currencies as a key reason for Bitcoin's appeal as a protection asset. Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, also predicts that Bitcoin will reach $1 million, highlighting its potential to 'transform the global economy in incredible ways'. Markus Thielen, CEO and head of research at 10x Research, notes that Bitcoin's price historically moves in increments of $16,000, indicating that the next significant resistance for Bitcoin is near $122,000. Andr\u00e9 Dragosch, European research head at Bitwise, predicts that Bitcoin could extend its rally to a top above $200,000 by the end of 2025, citing a model proposed by Canadian Bitcoin investor Greg Foss that evaluates Bitcoin based on a basket of G20 sovereign bonds.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[Exame](https:\/\/exame.com\/future-of-money\/bitcoin-a-us-1-milhao-ate-2030-grandes-nomes-preveem-forte-alta-impulsionada-por-dividas\/)\n\n**Bitcoin's New All-Time-High Brings Free Beer for All**\nA banker's generous donation of $150,000 in Bitcoin has led to a free beer party for all passengers on a train.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as the first parameter in the Drake's Equation, \\(R_\u2217\\).  It is the rate of formation of stars (in stars\/year in the Milky Way galaxy) suitable for the development of intelligent life.  Most estimates assume this refers to main sequence stars, but do consider the suitability of dead stars such as white dwarfs and black holes, and failed stars such as brown dwarfs and rogue planets when entering your answer.\n\nThis question will resolve as the most credible estimate of \\(R_\u2217\\) according to academic literature published by September 7, 2118\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting Analysis: Drake's Equation Parameter R* (Star Formation Rate)\n\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\nDrake's Equation parameter R* represents the average rate of formation of suitable stars in our galaxy (stars\/year). This parameter is crucial as it establishes the baseline for potential habitable systems in the Milky Way.\n\nHistorically, estimates of R* have evolved significantly as our understanding of stellar formation has improved. Early estimates from the 1960s when Drake first proposed his equation suggested values around 10 stars\/year for all stars in the Milky Way. By the 1990s, improved observations narrowed this to approximately 1-3 stars\/year.\n\nAs of 2018, current research indicates that the star formation rate in the Milky Way is approximately **1-2 stars per year** when considering all stellar types. However, when focusing specifically on suitable stars for potential life development (primarily F, G, and K main sequence stars), the rate decreases to approximately **0.5-1 stars per year**. This is because:\n\n- Not all stellar types are equally conducive to life development\n- G-type stars like our Sun constitute only about 7-8% of main sequence stars\n- K-type stars (potentially more suitable for life than previously thought) make up about 12% of main sequence stars\n\nRecent research by Kroupa and Weidner (2017) using the Initial Mass Function (IMF) suggests that approximately 40-50% of newly formed stars fall within mass ranges potentially suitable for life development.\n\n## Recent Scientific Developments (as of 2018)\n\nSeveral significant developments have refined our understanding of R*:\n\n1. The **Gaia mission** (launched 2013, with major data releases in 2016 and 2018) has provided unprecedented mapping of stellar populations and movements in the Milky Way, allowing for better calibration of star formation models.\n\n2. Studies using **infrared observations** from the Spitzer Space Telescope have improved our ability to detect star formation through dust clouds, revealing previously obscured star-forming regions.\n\n3. Research by Chomiuk and Povich (2011) reconciled various measurement techniques and suggested a star formation rate of approximately 1.9 \u00b1 0.4 stars\/year across the entire Milky Way.\n\n4. Recent work by Licquia and Newman (2015) characterized the Milky Way as a typical spiral galaxy with a star formation rate of approximately 1.65 \u00b1 0.19 solar masses per year, which translates to roughly 1-2 stars per year considering the distribution of stellar masses.\n\n## Measurement Methodologies and Authoritative Sources\n\nScientists employ several methods to estimate R*, each with different strengths:\n\n1. **Direct counting** of young stellar objects in nearby star-forming regions, then extrapolating to the entire galaxy\n\n2. **Infrared luminosity measurements**, which penetrate dust clouds to reveal embedded star formation\n\n3. **Radio observations** of hydrogen gas, particularly the 21cm line, to track the raw material for star formation\n\n4. **UV and H\u03b1 emission** measurements that trace recent star formation activity\n\nKey authoritative sources on this parameter include:\n\n- The Astrophysical Journal and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society publications\n- NASA's GALEX and Spitzer mission data\n- ESA's Gaia mission data\n- The Sloan Digital Sky Survey data\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors contribute to uncertainty in measuring R*:\n\n1. **Observational limitations**: Dust obscuration in the galactic plane makes direct observation challenging, particularly toward the galactic center.\n\n2. **Temporal variations**: Star formation rates likely fluctuate over galactic timescales, with evidence suggesting the current rate may be lower than the historical average.\n\n3. **Definition ambiguity**: The definition of \"suitable\" stars remains somewhat subjective. While G-type stars like our Sun were traditionally considered ideal, recent research suggests K-dwarfs may offer more stable environments for life over longer timescales.\n\n4. **Measurement technique discrepancies**: Different methodologies (infrared, radio, UV) sometimes yield different results, requiring careful calibration.\n\n5. **IMF uncertainties**: The Initial Mass Function, which describes the distribution of stellar masses at formation, contains inherent uncertainties that affect calculations of suitable star formation rates.\n\nCurrent estimates suggest an uncertainty range of approximately \u00b10.5 stars\/year for the total star formation rate, with greater uncertainty when focusing specifically on \"suitable\" stars.\n\n## References\n\n1.

This discovery, led by a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under the direction of astronomer Rohan Naidu, represents a significant milestone in observational astronomy and raises new questions for cosmology. MoM-z14 has a redshift of 14.44, making it the most distant galaxy confirmed by spectroscopy, surpassing the previous record held by JADES-GS-z14-0 with a z=14.32. The discovery was made through the Mirage program, a spectroscopic survey designed to identify galaxies with high redshifts, indicating great distance and age. MoM-z14 was detected through a 10-hour observation with the NIRSpec instrument on the Webb telescope, capturing its stretched infrared light due to the universe's expansion. The spectroscopic signal showed clear emissions of hydrogen and oxygen, indicating the presence of multiple generations of stars. Charlotte Mason, an astrophysicist from the University of Copenhagen, said, 'It's very exciting because it confirms that these bright galaxies really exist in the universe.' MoM-z14 is not only notable for its age but also for its structure and composition. The galaxy has a diameter of just 1600 light-years, placing it in the range of dwarf galaxies. However, it shines with an intensity that surprised researchers, with a luminosity 100 times greater than expected for objects of that age, challenging current models of the universe's early structure evolution. The chemical composition of MoM-z14 caught the attention of astrophysicists, revealing an elevated nitrogen-to-carbon ratio, an unusual feature in such primitive objects. This characteristic recalls the chemistry of ancient globular clusters in the Milky Way, dense star formations that exist since the early stages of our galaxy. This parallel led scientists to propose that MoM-z14 could represent an early example of star formation in environments similar to those clusters. 'It's like finding a cosmic fossil that connects the past and present of the cosmos,' explained the researchers in the work published on the arXiv preprint server last week. Additionally, the data revealed details about its immediate surroundings, showing that the space around MoM-z14 appears partially ionized, contrary to predictions from simulation models. This feature implies that the galaxy's ultraviolet radiation could have altered the state of the surrounding gas, suggesting an earlier start to the reionization process. Until now, it was believed that this phenomenon occurred in a context dominated by neutral gas. However, the observation of MoM-z14 indicates that certain sectors of the universe were already ionized 280 million years after the Big Bang.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 12:26 PM\nSource:[albertonews.com](https:\/\/albertonews.com\/internacionales\/telescopio-espacial-james-webb-rompio-su-propio-record-y-observo-la-galaxia-mas-antigua\/)\n\n**Historic Discovery of Star Formation in the Andalusian Region: A Study Confirms How Stars are Born in the Milky Way**\nA team of international scientists has captured the process of star formation in a region of the universe with extreme conditions, using the James Webb Space Telescope and joint research between universities and centers. The area, known as Sagittarius C, is located 200 light-years from Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole at the galactic center. The region has a dense molecular gas cloud that has been collapsing slowly for millions of years, generating the formation of thousands of young stars. The study, led by the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia (IAA-CSIC), has detected intense magnetic fields that traverse Sagittarius C, configuring hot hydrogen gas into long, bright filaments. According to Samuel Crowe, researcher at the University of Virginia, 'these magnetic fields give Sagittarius C a different appearance than any other star-forming region in the galaxy outside the galactic center.' The scientists believe that these magnetic fields may slow down or even prevent the gravitational collapse necessary for star formation, explaining why regions like the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) produce fewer stars than expected. The team has also identified over a hundred jets of material, linked to low-mass proto-stars, and even recorded, for the first time in the infrared, jets associated with two massive stars with 20 times the mass of the Sun. Rub\u00e9n Fedriani, researcher at the IAA and supervisor of the project, notes that 'the main objective of these observations was the study of star formation processes, particularly of massive stars, that is, those with more than eight times the mass of the Sun.' This discovery suggests that star formation in this area follows similar processes to the rest of the galaxy, demonstrating that even in extreme environments like the galactic center, new stars can be born. Despite its intense current activity, experts warn that the life of Sagittarius C as a star nursery may be coming to an end.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 06:00 AM\nSource:[okdiario.com](https:\/\/okdiario.com\/ciencia\/hallazgo-historico-astrofisicos-andaluces-estudio-confirma-como-nacen-estrellas-via-lactea-14836626)\n\n**Cosmic Collision Observed, Galaxy's Star-Forming Ability Reduced**\nAstronomers observed a cosmic collision between two galaxies using the VLT and ALMA telescopes, operated by the OES in Chile. The galaxies are moving towards each other at 500 kilometers per second and will collide. One galaxy uses a quasar to 'pierce' the other galaxy with radiation. According to the OES, the light from the collision took over 11 billion years to reach Earth, allowing astronomers to observe it as it was when the Universe was 18% of its current age. The quasar's radiation 'breaks' the gas and dust clouds of the impacted galaxy, leaving behind only small and dense regions. The OES states that these regions are 'probably too small' to form new stars, leaving the galaxy with 'fewer star-forming nurseries'. 'This is a unique opportunity to study the effects of a cosmic collision on galaxy evolution,' said the OES in a statement.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 09:39 PM\nSource:[expressodasilhas.cv](https:\/\/expressodasilhas.cv\/eitec\/2025\/05\/21\/observada-colisao-cosmica-que-reduz-capacidade-de-galaxia-formar-estrelas\/97155)\n\n**Historic Observation: Cosmic Duel Discovered Between Galaxies**\nAn international team led by scientists from France and Chile has successfully observed the collision process of two galaxies 11 billion light-years away. In this rare event, one galaxy is attacking the other with strong radiation beams, weakening its star-forming capacity. Scientists have described this interaction as a 'cosmic duel', similar to medieval jousting tournaments. The observation was made using data from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope over a period of four years. Researchers observed that the attacking galaxy is sending radiation beams from a supermassive black hole at its center, known as a quasar, to the opposing galaxy. According to NASA, quasars are bright structures formed when matter falling into a black hole heats up to millions of degrees. The strong beams of light from these structures are dispersing the gas clouds in the opposing galaxy, preventing the formation of new stars. Normally, stars form when a large amount of gas and dust collapses under its own gravity. However, in this observed event, the quasar's beam is breaking up and dispersing the gas, making it impossible for new stars to form. The research suggests that the material from the attacked galaxy is feeding the black hole, increasing its power and further weakening the galaxy's star-forming mechanism. Sergei Balashev, a co-author from the Ioffe Institute in Russia, says, 'This is the first direct observation of a quasar's effect on the molecular gas of a nearby galaxy.' This type of effect has only been theoretically discussed before. When scientists tried to study this quasar in more detail using low-resolution telescope data, they discovered that it was actually two separate galaxies interacting. The high-resolution power of the ALMA telescope revealed that the galaxies are separated by thousands of light-years. Since the light from these galaxies has been traveling to us for 11 billion years, scientists believe that they may have merged by now, but it is impossible to confirm. Dong-Woo Kim from the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics notes that galaxy mergers were more common in the early universe when the universe was denser. During this period, galaxies frequently merged to form larger systems. Kim believes that galaxy mergers are still happening today, and even the Milky Way is expected to merge with the Andromeda Galaxy in a few billion years.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 11:57 AM\nSource:[Cumhuriyet](https:\/\/www.cumhuriyet.com.tr\/yasam\/astronomlardan-tarihi-gozlem-galaksiler-arasinda-kozmik-duello-kesfedildi-2405930)\n\n**Astronomers Observe Destruction of Star Clusters in Galaxy Collision**\nAstronomers have observed the destruction of star clusters in a galaxy colliding with another for the first time. This was made possible by data from the VLT and ALMA telescopes, which observed a pair of galaxies 11 billion light-years away. The observations showed how the powerful radiation of a quasar, the active core of one of the galaxies, affects its neighbor, destroying gas clouds and stopping the process of star formation. The collision of galaxies is a natural phenomenon that is considered a catalyst for the activation of quasars. A quasar is a region around a supermassive black hole that emits a huge amount of energy, absorbing material from the surrounding environment. The ultraviolet and X-ray radiation of the quasar can ionize gas and dust in the neighboring galaxy, changing its structure. Such processes have not been well studied, as most similar events occurred in the first billion years after the Big Bang. The VLT telescope instruments recorded the spectrum of radiation in a wide range, from ultraviolet to infrared, allowing the identification of individual atoms and molecules, as well as their concentration in the region where the active quasar is located. The ALMA radio telescope complemented these data with information about molecular carbon dioxide, important for the formation of new stars. Together, these results allowed for a complete picture of the destructive impact of the quasar. Modeling shows that the quasar's radiation destroys carbon dioxide molecules, leaving only dense but small gas clumps in the galaxy. These are insufficient to maintain active star formation. This leads to the decline of new star formation over hundreds of millions of years and explains why many massive galaxies in our universe have stopped being 'star factories.' The importance of these results lies in their ability to recreate the early stages of galaxy development and reveal the reasons why some of them stopped their development. Astronomers note that stopping star formation is not always final: there are known cases where such galaxies 'wake up' to a new stage of star formation after millions of years. Such observations allow for a better understanding of the past and possible future of the universe.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 06:30 AM\nSource:[newsyou.info](https:\/\/newsyou.info\/2025\/06\/astronomi-vpershe-prostezhili-za-rujnuvannyam-zoryanix-skupchen-pri-zitknenni-galaktik)\n\n**Groundbreaking Discovery Reveals 'Monstrous Red' Galaxies in the Universe**\nAn international team of scientists has discovered three ancient galaxies in the universe that are forming stars at nearly twice the efficiency of the rest, a finding that raises new questions about the theories of star formation. The research, led by the University of Geneva, reveals that these galaxies already existed in the first billion years after the Big Bang and have grown at 'unexpected' rates, reaching a size almost as massive as the Milky Way. The 'monstrous red' galaxies, as the researchers call them, have grown much faster than previously thought. The researchers analyzed a complete sample of galaxies formed within the first billion years of cosmic history using the James Webb Space Telescope, located 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. The findings, although not contradicting the standard cosmological model, raise questions about the theories of galaxy formation, especially those that developed in the early universe.

According to Anirudh Patel, 'This estimate accounts for the fact that these giant flares are rare, but it's also important to note that magnetars have lifetimes of 1000 to 10,000 years, so while there may only be a couple of dozen magnetars known to us today, there have been many more magnetars that have lived and died over the course of the 13 billion-year history of our galaxy.'

While it doesn't provide a definitive answer, it sets parameters for scientists to study and refine as our understanding of the universe expands. Dr. Frank Drake, then president of the SETI Institute, convened a historic meeting at the Green Bank Observatory in November 1961 to discuss the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, attended by luminaries such as Carl Sagan and Philip Morrison. The equation serves as a 'Rosetta Stone' for guiding discussions and scientific inquiries into the appearance of life and its development into something capable of sending messages across the light-years. 'It was a privilege to be in the company of so many famous and cerebral individuals,' said Dr. Drake, highlighting the significance of the meeting. 'The equation isn't a formula that spits out a number, but rather a tool for guiding our understanding of the universe and the possibility of life beyond Earth.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 17, 2025 01:59 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https:\/\/medium.com\/predict\/what-are-the-odds-of-alien-life-f7a8580fe741)\n\n**SETI, Civilizational Longevity, and the Drake Equation: Why AI Risks Matter | HackerNoon**\nA scenario suggests that almost all technical civilizations collapse due to AI-induced calamities on timescales set by their widespread adoption of AI. The Drake Equation estimates the longevity (L) of a communicating civilization to be around 100-200 years. The equation considers the number (N) of radiocommunicating technical civilizations in the galaxy, with the first three astronomical terms relatively well established. However, the next three terms (fl \u00b7 fi \u00b7 fc) are not, with astronomers assuming optimistic values and biologists suggesting much smaller values. Even with optimistic values, the derived value for N is low, consistent with the null results from current SETI surveys. The window for detectable interstellar radio transmissions is extremely limited, and the detection of other civilizations will be challenging even for those located within our local stellar neighbourhood. The authors suggest that SETI researchers may need to consider the types of instruments required to conduct meaningful surveys, including an 'all-sky' capability. They also note that a post-biological technical civilization would be well-adapted to space exploration and could potentially spread its presence throughout the Galaxy. The absence of detectable signs of Kardashev Type II and Type III civilizations implies that such entities are either exceedingly rare or non-existent, reinforcing the notion of a 'Great Filter' that halts the progress of a technical civilization within a few centuries of its emergence. As Fagner Brack said, 'it's conceivable that the first successful attempts to propel light-weight electronic systems toward the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, might be realised before the century's close, and AI components could form an integral part of these miniature payloads.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 15, 2025 11:09 AM\nSource:[Fagner Brack](https:\/\/hackernoon.com\/seti-civilizational-longevity-and-the-drake-equation-why-ai-risks-matter?source=rss)\n\n**The Fermi Paradox: A Search for Extraterrestrial Life and Understanding Ourselves**\nThe Fermi Paradox, also known as the 'Great Silence', highlights the contradictions in our understanding of extraterrestrial life. Despite the passage of time since the Big Bang, we have not found any evidence of their existence, despite recent discoveries of exoplanets in habitable zones. According to physicist Enrico Fermi, 'If AI is the brain of a robot, then RPA is its hands.' One factor to consider when searching for an answer to the Fermi Paradox is the number of potential civilizations. This value allows us to determine the Drake equation, a mathematical formula that outputs the number of active, communication-capable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. The equation uses several factors, including star formation rate, percentage of stars with planets, number of habitable planets per star, percentage of planets where life emerged, percentage of planets where intelligent life developed, number of civilizations developing detectable communication technologies, and average lifespan of such civilizations. In short, the Drake equation claims that there should be many civilizations, but so far, SETI programs have not detected any signals. This raises the question of the scientific justification for such programs. Matthew Chilcote's article does not provide a direct answer to this question, but instead proposes a method for evaluating the probability of detecting a signal by a certain number of broadcasting civilizations by now. If the probability is low, the lack of evidence should not be surprising; if it is high, the silence may mean something. Chilcote's model suggests that the absence of detected electromagnetic signals from extraterrestrial civilizations may impose constraints on the number of existing civilizations. In certain scenarios, the model predicts a 99% chance of detecting at least one signal if the assumed number of civilizations (based on the Drake equation) is around 1. We have a zero result so far. However, it's worth noting that even the absence of positive results from SETI helps in resolving the Fermi Paradox: it allows us to exclude certain combinations of the number and lifespan of civilizations. Ultimately, as Universe Today writes, the purpose of programs like SETI is not only to search for extraterrestrial life, but also to better understand ourselves and the conditions that make intelligent life possible. A team of scientists from Germany studied the feasibility of a new method of searching for extraterrestrial life - using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They came to an unencouraging but important conclusion for the development of astronomy.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 04:52 PM\nSource:[hightech.plus](https:\/\/hightech.plus\/2025\/05\/12\/s-tochki-zreniya-statistiki-mi-uzhe-dolzhni-bili-vstretit-inoplanetyan)\n\n**Why the Cosmos is Silent? Scientists Link the Fermi Paradox to the Absence of SETI Signals**\nA new study reevaluates the 'cosmic silence' by proposing a model that turns the lack of SETI signals into a tool for assessing the chances of finding extraterrestrial intelligence. The work focuses on the Fermi paradox, questioning why, despite billions of stars in the Milky Way, we have not yet detected signs of other civilizations. The authors consider the Galaxy as a flat disk, with a diameter of approximately 100,000 light-years, 100 times greater than its thickness. The signal from a hypothetical civilization is modeled as two expanding rings: the first corresponds to the beginning of transmission, and the second to its completion. Earth must be in the space between them, like in a temporal corridor. The probability of such an event for one source is calculated using the formula \u22480.6????\/????, where???? is the distance between the rings (transmission duration multiplied by the speed of light), and???? is the radius of the Galaxy. This model is integrated with the Drake equation, which estimates the number of communicative civilizations (????) as the product of seven factors, from star formation rates to the probability of technological development. The key finding is that if???? approaches 1 (an optimistic scenario), and the duration of signal transmission is approximately 630 years (???? \u2248 102.8 light-years), the probability of detecting at least one signal exceeds 99%. This makes the lack of SETI results statistically significant - either such civilizations are extremely rare, or their 'window' of activity is shorter. Calculations also show that if???? \u2265 1, there cannot be more than a thousand civilizations in the Galaxy simultaneously transmitting signals. If the number of civilizations is higher, it means that one of the parameters of the Drake equation, such as the chance of the emergence of consciousness or technologies, is significantly underestimated. The model has limitations, including the Galaxy's three-dimensionality, signal attenuation with distance, and non-uniform distribution of civilizations or impulsive data transmission. However, even the simplified version demonstrates how the 'zero result' of SETI allows narrowing the parameters of the Drake equation. The next step will be to complicate the model, transitioning to a three-dimensional structure of the Milky Way, accounting for historical changes (emergence and extinction of civilizations), and realistic patterns of communication.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 05, 2025 07:45 PM\nSource:[iXBT.com](https:\/\/www.ixbt.com\/news\/2025\/05\/05\/pochemu-molchit-kosmos-uchjonye-svjazali-paradoks-fermi-s-otsutstviem-signalov-seti.html)\n\n**The 40-Year Quest for Extraterrestrial Intelligence**\nThe Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project has been searching for life beyond Earth for 40 years, since its inception in 1985. The project's founders, including Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi, were inspired by the idea of using gamma-ray signals to communicate with other civilizations. They proposed using the spectral line of neutral hydrogen as a means of communication, as it is the most abundant element in the universe. The project's early results were promising, but the search for extraterrestrial signals has been ongoing for decades with no conclusive evidence. In the 1960s, Frank Drake, a young astronomer, independently developed a similar project, called 'Ozma', which aimed to listen for signals from nearby stars. The project was supported by notable scientists, including Otto Struve, who predicted the existence of exoplanets. The SETI project has undergone several iterations, including the development of the Drake equation, which attempts to estimate the number of advanced civilizations in the galaxy. The equation takes into account factors such as the rate of star formation, the number of planets per star, and the number of planets capable of supporting life. Despite the lack of conclusive evidence, the SETI project continues to inspire scientists and the public alike, and its legacy has led to a greater understanding of the universe and our place within it.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: April 05, 2025 09:01 AM\nSource:[Meduza](https:\/\/meduza.io\/feature\/2025\/04\/05\/chelovechestvo-40-let-ischet-vnezemnuyu-zhizn-v-ramkah-proekta-seti-no-vse-esche-odinoko-vo-vselennoy-mozhet-byt-my-chto-to-delaem-ne-tak)\n\n**Scientists Create Equation to Search for Life on Venus**\nScientists have created an equation to search for life on Venus. The equation, called VLE, is similar to the Drake equation and can estimate the probability of life on Venus. 'The fundamental goal of VLE is to provide a basis for assessing the probability of life,' said Diana Gentri, director of the NASA Astrobiology Laboratory. The equation is L=OxRxC, where L is the probability of life, and O, R, and C are three parameters: origin, strength, and continuity. Each parameter has a value from 0 to 1. The origin of life can occur through abiogenesis or panspermia, and this factor does not change over time. The strength of life depends on the availability of nutrients CHNOPS, access to energy, and functional diversity of life. Earth has a high value of R, which explains the stability of life on our planet. The continuity of life depends on the stability of the star and the planet's orbit, as well as geological stability and the absence of destructive events. 'Although we are limited by the problem of n=1, we can use our understanding of the genesis of life on Earth to study unknown aspects of life in other worlds,' explain the authors of the study. This approach can help us in the search for life on exoplanets.

The equation is expressed as: N = R* \u00d7 fp \u00d7 ne \u00d7 fl \u00d7 fi \u00d7 fc \u00d7 L, where each term carries significant uncertainties, making it more of a conceptual tool than a precise calculation. Some variables, such as R*, can be estimated with some accuracy, while others, like fi and fc, remain uncertain. Advances in astronomy and astrobiology have refined some of these factors over the years. The discovery of exoplanets has improved our understanding of fp and ne. However, the fraction of planets where life emerges (fl) and evolves into intelligence (fi) remains unknown. 'Intelligence and technological capability seem to be more uncommon phenomena, considering that billions of species existed before one developed the ability to send radio signals into space,' said an expert. The time of life of technological civilizations (L) is another crucial factor. If civilizations are common but have short lifetimes due to self-destruction or natural disasters, the chance of detecting them would be low. This point raises philosophical and scientific implications about the future of humanity. Modern versions of the equation have been developed, incorporating new concepts and refining the original parameters. Some scientists have added variables related to bio-signatures and technosignatures, while others have suggested including terms that address the impact of catastrophic events.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 09:35 PM\nSource:[TecMundo](https:\/\/www.tecmundo.com.br\/ciencia\/403133-novas-formas-de-estimar-a-vida-alienigena-no-universo-revisitando-a-equacao-de-drake.htm)\n\n**The Drake Equation and Alien Typologies Catalogued by Ufologists Based on Case Studies**\nThe Drake Equation, a mathematical formula to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way, has been updated to 2025.

In contrast, ufology has compiled an array of alleged alien races, drawing from a wealth of testimonies that have repeatedly and consistently confirmed the sighting of certain extraterrestrial typologies. When merging the Drake Equation with ufologists' alien typologies, two approaches emerge: either the lifespan of civilizations would need to rise significantly, or intelligence or communicative capacity would need to be far more prevalent than assumed. Alternatively, each civilization estimated by Drake might give rise to multiple races, yielding a figure modest compared to ufological accounts. Challenges and reflections arise from the lack of definitive data for many parameters in the Drake Equation and the need for objective scientific validation of ufological cataloguing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 05:50 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https:\/\/medium.com\/@oliviero65\/the-drake-equation-and-alien-typologies-catalogued-by-ufologists-based-on-case-studies-697e78f59fcd)\n\n**The Great Silence: Why Aliens Haven't Contacted Us -- Or Have They?**\nThe possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life and Earth visitation remains a topic of debate.

If the court is politically important and costs are low, then you could easily imagine growing the court to dozens, hundreds, and then thousands before you really changed the cost-benefit analysis.\n\n> You would eventually be bottlenecked by the availability of plausibly-qualified candidates under current standards. But I'm not aware of any real constitutional requirements to serve as a justice, and so you could have a race to the bottom on standards in parallel with a ballooning court.\n\n> Foreseeing that outcome, a party in power might decide to directly increase the size of the court to the point where further expansion would be prohibitively costly. (And each party might be inclined to initiate a giant expansion out of the fear that their opponents would do so the next time they had the chance.) So rather than doubling every ~20 years (or however often a new unified government is elected) we could just jump straight to a gigantic court.\n\n> The most absurd outcome would be an equilibrium in which a significant fraction of Americans served on the supreme court and voted directly on high-profile cases by ballot (perhaps at the same time that they vote on elected offices).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as the number of seats on the Supreme Court of the United States on January 1, 2030 at 00:00 UTC\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n- The Supreme Court of the United States has consisted of nine seats\u2014one Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices\u2014since 1869, as established by the Circuit Judges Act[1][3][5].\n- Historically, the number of seats has fluctuated: it started at six in 1789, increased as high as ten during the 19th century, and then stabilized at nine for over 150 years[3][5].\n- As of October 29, 2020, the Court had nine justices, with Amy Coney Barrett confirmed on October 27, 2020[1][2].\n\n## 2. Recent Announcements\/Policies Affecting the Metric\n- In 2020, following the rapid appointment of Justice Barrett and wider political polarization, there was increased discussion among some political actors about \"court-packing\"\u2014expanding the number of seats to counterbalance perceived ideological shifts.\n- Despite this discourse, as of October 29, 2020, no official legislative action had been taken or was imminent to change the number of seats on the Supreme Court. Any change would require Congressional approval and presidential signature, which has historically been difficult to achieve.\n\n## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification\n- The official Supreme Court website provides a record of current and historical composition of the Court[1].\n- Supreme Court biographies and nomination processes are documented on government and legal information sites[2][5].\n- Wikipedia and legal history sources detail the legislative acts that have changed the Court's size[3][5].\n\n## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties\n- Any change to the number of seats requires passing federal legislation, which historically has occurred only under significant political alignment and pressure.\n- While there is no constitutional requirement for the number of seats, political costs and institutional inertia have made changes rare and controversial.\n- Increased polarization and discussion about reform in 2020 created some uncertainty, but no concrete steps had been taken by October 2020.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\nGiven:\n- 150+ years of stability at nine seats,\n- the high legislative barrier to change,\n- and the lack of enacted reform as of late October 2020,\n\nthe probability that the Supreme Court will have more or fewer than nine seats on January 1, 2030 is low, though not zero. A reasonable adjusted forecast would assign a high probability (e.g., 85\u201395%) to the Court still having nine seats in 2030, and a low probability (5\u201315%) to any expansion or contraction within the bounds of 7 to 30 seats.\n\n## References\n1.

'We intend to increase the British army to at least 76,000 regular soldiers by the next parliament. For the first time in a generation, it is our government that wants to increase the size of the regular army,' he said. The current government, led by the Labour Party, aims to achieve this goal by 2034. The current number of British military personnel is around 72,500, the lowest since the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century. According to The Times, the number of military personnel may drop below 70,000 in 2025 due to low recruitment rates and high rates of personnel leaving the service due to dissatisfaction with working conditions.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 04:44 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421](https:\/\/tass.ru\/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama\/24117431)\n\n**Husnullin: Around 60 Schools and Kindergartens Built or Under Construction in Russia**\nAccording to Vice-Premier Marat Husnullin, around 60 schools and kindergartens have been built or are being constructed in various regions of Russia as part of the 'Infrastructure Menu'.

According to the Fundaci\u00f3n Egu\u00eda-Careaga report, the number of people over 65 will increase by 17.2% by 2030, and those over 80 will increase by 26.8%. The report suggests that the current number of care home places is 'sufficient', but there is a need to strengthen other types of services, such as home care. The report also calculates that there will be a need for 160 more places in day centers. Additionally, the report notes that there will be a need for 1,300 family members to care for their relatives who are unable to perform daily activities without support. The study does not attempt to predict the future of disability in 2030, but notes that the number of people with recognized disabilities in \u00c1lava has increased by 80% since the COVID-19 pandemic. As Gorka Urtaran, the deputy for Social Policies, has previously stated, there will be a need for 1,000 more professionals to care for dependent people in their homes by 2030.

Lula made this statement on Sunday (1st), during the closing speech of the national congress of the PSB in Bras\u00edlia. According to Lula, 'We often have to elect the best candidates, elect senators, elect federal deputies, elect senators, because we need to win the majority in the Senate, because otherwise, those guys [from the right] will overwhelm the Supreme Court.' Lula also emphasized that the Supreme Court is not a 'sweet apple', but it is necessary to 'preserve the institutions that guarantee the exercise of democracy in this country.' In 2026, there will be an election for \u2154 of the Senate seats - 54 out of 81. The right has already declared that it seeks a majority in the Upper House of Congress, as it is the instance that can initiate impeachment proceedings against STF ministers. The right sees this possibility, with Senator Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro stating in February that 'we have almost 40 senators in favor of impeaching Minister Alexandre de Moraes.' Senator Davi Alcolumbre, the president of the Upper House, also stated in February that he would not prioritize impeachment proceedings against STF ministers and that the Senate 'is not a correction body of the STF.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 08:02 PM\nSource:[Gazeta do Povo](https:\/\/www.gazetadopovo.com.br\/republica\/lula-quer-maioria-no-senado-em-2026-para-a-direita-nao-avacalhar-o-supremo\/)\n\n**Proposal to Increase Deputies to 531 Faces Resistance in Senate**\nA proposal to increase the number of deputies in the Chamber of Deputies from 513 to 531, approved by the Chamber on May 6, is stalled in the Senate. The topic enters a decisive month, as Congress has until June 30 to reevaluate the size of the Chamber's delegations based on the 2022 Census. Senate President Davi Alcolumbre has not made any statements on the project. Despite this, leaders of the Chamber point out that the topic will have to be addressed in the next week after the 11th Parliamentary Forum of the BRICS, between June 3 and 5, due to the deadline given by the Supreme Court. The discussion about seats in the Chamber arose after a determination by the Supreme Court for the Chamber to revise, by June 30, the number of parliamentarians from each state, based on the last demographic census, made by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in 2022. If the Chamber followed the determination to the letter, some states would lose deputies due to population decline. The proposal to increase the number of deputies has faced resistance in the Senate, with senators from the PT to the opposition rejecting it. The division among different parties is due to regional issues, with states more favorable to changes and others opposed, depending on the impact. Some arguments used by senators are that 'it's not the right time' for the topic, that the burden against the political class should increase with the approval, and that it would be 'incoherent' to demand cuts in government expenses and approve a measure to increase expenses.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[Metr\u00f3poles](https:\/\/www.metropoles.com\/brasil\/531-deputados-projeto-entra-em-mes-decisivo-parado-no-senado)\n\n**Trump's Cuts to USAID Will Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**\nA study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under the age of five. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 04:05 AM\nSource:[LaVanguardia](https:\/\/www.lavanguardia.com\/ciencia\/20250601\/10734984\/recortes-trump-causaran-14-millones-muertes-paises-pobres.html)\n\n**Trump Aims For 400 GW Of Nuclear By 2050, 10 Large Reactors Under Construction By 2030**\nUS President Trump has announced plans to increase nuclear power production to 400 GW by 2050, with 10 large reactors expected to be under construction by 2030.

By 2030, more than 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity and overweight have increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The document also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. In 2016, fewer than 1,000 adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, but by 2021, the number had already exceeded 1.1 billion. Another concerning aspect is the role that climate change and technology will play. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with an average annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. According to UN estimates, by 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24. This generation faces a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 08:35 PM\nSource:[agenciapi.co](https:\/\/www.agenciapi.co\/noticia\/salud\/en-2030-mas-de-la-mitad-de-los-jovenes-enfrentaran-problemas-de-salud)\n\n**Time to Revive Census Reform**\nAccording to Pew research, excluding unauthorized immigrants from the apportionment count would result in California losing two congressional seats, Florida gaining one, and Texas gaining two. Other states that would be affected include Alabama, Minnesota, and Ohio, which would each hold onto a seat they would have lost. Democrats, who are threatened by the citizenship question, previously sued to block it. The Supreme Court ruled that the government has the right to ask a citizenship question, but must properly justify changing the Census Bureau's long-standing practice. The Trump administration complied with the ruling, but emphasized the importance of having accurate data on citizens and aliens to inform immigration policy. Now that Trump is back in office, efforts are underway to revive census reform for the 2030 Census, which aims to stop counting illegal aliens to gain political power through congressional seats.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 09, 2025 07:02 PM\nSource:[Townhall](https:\/\/townhall.com\/columnists\/katiepavlich\/2025\/05\/09\/time-to-revive-census-reform-n2656832)\n\n**Increase in Chamber Seats to Impact State Assemblies**\nA proposal to increase the number of seats in the Chamber of Deputies from 513 to 531 has been approved by the Chamber and will impact the state Assemblies. The Constitution requires the number of state deputies to be three times the number of federal deputies, with a cap of 36. This means that if the proposal is approved, the Assemblies will need to increase their number of seats. For example, in Minas Gerais, the federal delegation has 53 deputies, and if the proposal is approved, a new seat will be created, passing to 54. In this scenario, the Assembly will need to have 78 seats (one more than the current 77), with 36 representing the triple of 12 federal deputies and 42 indicating the difference from the total federal delegation. Other states, such as Amazonas, Mato Grosso, and Rio Grande do Norte, will gain six new seats, while Par\u00e1 and Santa Catarina will gain four new seats each. The change was determined by the Supreme Court to adjust the parliamentary representation to the last Demographic Census of 2022, which increased the country's population to 203.1 million inhabitants. The current delegations have not been updated since 1993, when the count was 146.9 million inhabitants. The deadline for the change to be made by the National Congress was June 30. If not, the alteration in the delegations will be made by the Electoral Superior Court (TSE).\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 09, 2025 01:41 PM\nSource:[O TEMPO](https:\/\/www.otempo.com.br\/politica\/congresso\/2025\/5\/9\/aumento-de-vagas-na-camara-impoe-criacao-de-30-novas-cadeiras-em-assembleias-legislativas-entenda)\n\n**Democrats need to get to grips with 2030 census reality**\nThe 2030 census is expected to give the GOP an easier path to control Congress, as Southern states are gaining seats while blue states are losing them. This could make it harder for Democrats to win the 270 electoral votes needed to win presidential elections. The Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin is cautioning party members to be 'caught flat-footed' during future elections and is urging them to invest time, energy, and money in building infrastructure and having conversations with voters. Martin also announced a new state plan, 'Organize Everywhere, Win Anywhere', which will allot $17,500 to state officials in blue states and $22,500 to state parties in red states. William Frey, a demographer, cautioned that the population growth in the South may slow down in the second half of the decade, and that voters moving to the South may not vote the same way as existing residents. Democrats have made some inroads in North Carolina, but still face challenges in other Southern states, including Texas and Florida. The party is refocusing on an economic message to counter Trump's appeal and is urging its members to organize in rural communities and give voters a sense of what they would do to improve their lives.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 26, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https:\/\/www.washingtonexaminer.com\/in_focus\/3391436\/democrats-face-2030-census-reality\/)\n\n**Reflections on the Agenda 2030**\nThe author, Leopoldo Abad\u00eda, reflects on the Agenda 2030, a set of 17 urgent goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 to be achieved by 2030.

The candidate who receives the most votes will serve for two years, and then be replaced by the second-place candidate. This rotation will continue. The President of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, is interested in the first four justices to be elected, as she wants to have direct contact with them and potentially influence the 2030 federal election and her own exit from office.

        "9":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWhat will be the highest level of annual GDP growth in the US before 2030?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Gross Domestic Product Annual Growth Rate in the United States](https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/ny.gdp.mktp.kd.zg?locations=us) averaged 3.20% from 1948 until 2018, reaching an all time high of 7.3% in 1984. \n\nThe Gross Domestic Product of the United States expanded 3% in the third quarter of 2018 over the same quarter of the previous year.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as the highest % growth in US GDP over a single calendar year (Jan-1 to Jan-1), achieved between Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2029, according to the US Treasury or credible media reports\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n### Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- From 1948 to 2018, US annual GDP growth averaged about 3.2%, with an all-time high of 7.3% in 1984.\n- In the late 2010s, growth rates were moderate, e.g., 3% in Q3 2018.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 triggered a severe recession, resulting in a sharp contraction in GDP.\n\n### Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- In response to the pandemic, the US government passed large fiscal stimulus packages, such as the CARES Act, aimed at supporting households and businesses.\n- The Federal Reserve adopted highly accommodative monetary policy, cutting interest rates and launching asset purchase programs.\n- These measures set the stage for a strong rebound once pandemic restrictions eased, with many forecasters in mid-2020 predicting a sharp GDP recovery in 2021 due to the \"low base effect\" from the 2020 downturn[3].\n\n### Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): Projected an average annual GDP growth rate of 2.3% from 2020\u20132030, noting potential for a higher-than-average rebound year following the pandemic[3].\n- Statista: Provides annual projections through 2030, generally showing moderate annual growth after the post-pandemic recovery, with no year expected to match or exceed the 1984 record[2].\n- Trading Economics: Expected growth to return to around 2% in the mid-2020s, emphasizing a strong but temporary post-pandemic rebound[5].\n\n### Key Differences Affecting the Forecast\n\n- The pandemic-induced recession created an unprecedentedly low starting point for 2021, increasing the likelihood of an unusually high growth rate that year compared to normal business cycles.\n- Unlike previous recoveries, the scale of fiscal and monetary intervention in 2020 was historically large.\n- However, structural factors\u2014such as slower labor force growth and productivity\u2014were expected to limit sustained high growth in subsequent years.\n\n### Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- Mid-2020 forecasts were marked by high uncertainty due to the unpredictable duration of the pandemic, pace of reopening, and risk of subsequent infection waves.\n- Measurement of GDP growth, particularly in extreme economic conditions, can be subject to substantial revisions.\n- The final annual growth figure for 2021 (or any year) would depend on the precise timing of economic recovery and policy responses.\n\n### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- The most likely outcome, as assessed in July 2020, was that the highest annual US GDP growth rate before 2030 would occur in 2021, driven by the recovery from the pandemic recession.\n- Probabilistically, a single-year real GDP growth rate in the range of 5% to 7% was plausible for 2021, though exceeding the 1984 record of 7.3% was considered unlikely.\n- For the remainder of the decade after the rebound, annual growth rates were expected to normalize to the 2%\u20133% range[3][2][5].\n\n### References\n\n1.

According to the IMF, India's nominal GDP is projected to reach $4.19 trillion by FY26, while Germany's is expected to be $4.74 trillion. India's growth is driven by domestic consumption, services, and digitization, with a robust current account buffer and a rising trade surplus. However, challenges such as job creation, fiscal slippage, and institutional bottlenecks loom large. Experts warn that India must invest in human capital, strengthen its fiscal fundamentals, and deepen financial inclusion to truly consolidate its position in the top three. If India can achieve an 8% nominal GDP growth rate and maintain a stable rupee, its economy could cross $6.8 trillion-$7 trillion by 2030, firmly establishing it as the world's third-largest economy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 02:08 PM\nSource:[India Today](https:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/india-today-insight\/story\/as-upbeat-indian-economy-closes-gap-with-japan-germany-the-real-test-will-be-at-the-podium-2734414-2025-06-02)\n\n**Central Bank Analysts Reduce Inflation Projection for 2025**\nAnalysts consulted by the Central Bank have reduced their projection for Brazil's inflation in 2025, while maintaining the expectation for price growth in 2026, according to the Focus survey released on Monday. The survey showed that the expectation for inflation, measured by IPCA, is now 5.46% at the end of this year, above the previous forecast of 5.50%. For 2026, the projection for price growth was maintained at 4.50%. The Central Bank's target is 3%, with a 1.5 percentage point margin for tolerance. The change comes after the release of data for the IPCA-15 of May, which decelerated and was below expectations, leading to some relief in the 12-month result. The index rose 0.36% in May, after increasing 0.43% in the previous month, and 5.40% in 12 months, compared to a gain of 5.49% in April. The weekly survey with a hundred economists also showed the expectation that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow 1.80% next year, above the growth projection of 1.70% in the previous week. For 2025, the expectation for economic expansion fell slightly to 2.13%, from a gain of 2.14% previously. On monetary policy, there was maintenance of the expectation for the basic interest rate this year and next. The median of the projections for the Selic at the end of 2025 is 14.75%, while for the end of 2026, the expectation is that the rate will reach 12.50%, which was the 18th consecutive week of maintenance of this level. Currently, the Selic is at 14.75% per year. The survey also maintained the expectations for the price of the dollar at the end of 2025, at R$5.80, and 2026, at R$5.90. The US dollar has accumulated a 6.8% drop against the real this year, in a movement driven by a price correction process, after its surge at the end of last year, and greater uncertainty regarding US tariff plans.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 11:59 AM\nSource:[Terra](https:\/\/www.terra.com.br\/economia\/mercado-reduz-projecao-para-inflacao-em-2025-no-focus,54dc1969fa54933fcb3f8a6eb106379dzusf9bqx.html)\n\n**Dubai's US$10bln infrastructure spending key to the growth of the commercial vehicle market**\nThe GCC commercial vehicle market is poised for growth, driven by substantial infrastructure investments and strategic economic initiatives in key member states. Dubai has earmarked US$10 billion for infrastructure spending, focusing on scaling the Emirate's tourism economy. Saudi Arabia has announced investments worth US$267 billion, and Qatar is focusing on tourism and hospitality under its Third National Development Strategy 2024-2030. According to Frost & Sullivan's research, Saudi Arabia is leading the commercial vehicles industry in the Middle East, leveraging its strategic location and substantial infrastructure investments. The non-oil economy in the Middle East will remain a key driver of economic growth, with key industries identified as manufacturing (including automotive), renewables, infrastructure, construction, tourism, artificial intelligence, and fintech. In the UAE, a resilient non-oil economy performance will push GDP growth to 5.8% in 2025, up from 4% in 2024, while investments in Saudi's non-oil segments including, tourism, technology, infrastructure, and renewables, will see real GDP growth reach 4.8% in 2025.

The country aims to become one of the world's largest economies by 2047, with a GDP of over $30 trillion. To achieve this, India is investing in technological advancements as the driving force behind development. According to the Indian Technical Education Council, 1.49 million engineering seats were approved for the 2024-2025 period, a 16% increase from the past four years. The fields with the highest growth are computer science, AI, machine learning, data science, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and blockchain. The number of seats in these fields has increased by over 50%, reflecting the strong market demand. Institutions are also promoting a more comprehensive and interconnected education, shifting from the STEM concept to STEAM, which includes arts, communication, design, law, and psychology. This aims to form creative professionals with a broad vision and the ability to innovate. According to the Times of India, a report by Wheebox estimates that the Indian AI market will reach $28.8 billion by 2025, with a 45% annual growth rate. The number of qualified professionals in the field has grown 14 times between 2016 and 2023. Universities like SRM Institute are creating interdisciplinary courses that combine engineering with health, data science, and food technology. Partnerships with companies ensure that students have contact with real-world challenges and are ready to compete globally. With India determined to take a leading role in the global economy, the formation of AI specialists becomes a strategic pillar to support this advancement.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 09:09 PM\nSource:[Olhar Digital - O futuro passa primeiro aqui](https:\/\/olhardigital.com.br\/2025\/06\/01\/pro\/india-precisa-de-um-milhao-de-experts-em-ia-ate-2026\/)\n\n**US Treasury Secretary Confident US Will Never Default on Debt**\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the US government will never default on its debt, despite the lack of a decision on raising its debt ceiling. 'The United States will never default, this will never happen', he said in an interview with CBS News. Bessent added that the US authorities 'are on a warning path and will not hit a wall'. According to the International Monetary Fund's calculations, the US government debt will increase to 122.5% of GDP by 2025 and continue to rise, reaching 128.2% by 2030. Earlier, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the country's government debt is on an 'unsustainable trajectory', but has not yet reached an unacceptable level, and it is unknown when this threshold will be crossed.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 03:05 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https:\/\/ria.ru\/20250601\/ssha-2020313634.html)\n\n**US Faces High Risk of Financial Collapse, Warns Congressional Budget Office**\nThe US is facing a high risk of financial collapse, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO predicts that the federal debt will rise to 117% of the country's GDP by 2034, up from 98% last year. The interest payments on the debt are also expected to increase to 4% of the GDP, which is a significant burden on the government. Despite these alarming numbers, investors are still confident in the US economy and are willing to buy government bonds and the dollar, which are the backbone of the global financial system. However, some experts warn that the US is heading towards a financial crisis, citing the country's high debt levels and the potential for a recession. If a recession were to occur, it would have a double impact on the US finances, with a decline in tax revenues and a significant increase in welfare payments, leading to a financial collapse. The Federal Reserve may be able to mitigate some of the effects of a recession by lowering interest rates, but this would not eliminate the risk of a financial crisis. The CBO's central projections assume that the US will experience a continuous and sustained economic growth over the next decade, but this is an optimistic assumption. If the economy were to experience a recession, the US finances would be severely impacted, with a significant increase in debt and interest payments. Some experts, such as Chris Marsh from Exante Data, warn that if the yield curve does not return to its natural state, the US could face a severe financial crisis, with the federal debt rising to 125% of the GDP by 2034 and interest payments reaching 30% of the government's revenues. \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 11:07 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629](https:\/\/www.aleqt.com\/2025\/06\/01\/article_2762019.html)\n\n**Despite GDP growth, India's per capita income abysmally low**\nIndia's GDP has grown to $4.187 trillion, surpassing Japan's, and is expected to reach $5.584 billion by 2028, overtaking Germany. However, India's per capita GDP is abysmally low, equivalent to Japan's in the 1950s, and would take 22 years to reach their level. Experts say India needs to diversify its export basket and leverage global value chains to reach its $1 trillion merchandise exports goal by 2030. To boost growth, India can harness its global trade potential by increasing exports in textiles, apparel, and footwear sectors, as well as electronics and green technology products. Economists project India's economic growth to average around 6.5 percent over the next few years, making it likely to maintain its status as the fastest-growing major economy globally. However, Indian citizens are demanding reforms and policies that will boost GDP per capita by improving wages for India's working class. Four potential ways to boost GDP per capita include allowing farmers to sell their products to the highest bidder, spending money on building and repairing roads and bridges, urbanization, and increasing competitiveness in sectors such as electronics, chemicals, textiles, auto goods, and pharmaceuticals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 04:29 AM\nSource:[The Hans India](https:\/\/www.thehansindia.com\/business\/despite-gdp-growth-indias-per-capita-income-abysmally-low-975989)\n\n**Italy's Demographic Minefield: A 11% GDP Risk by 2040**\nAccording to Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta, the number of people in the workforce is expected to decrease by around five million by 2040, which could cost the country 11% of its GDP. Panetta also noted that the productivity issue remains a problem, with Italy's productivity growth being one of the lowest in the EU. The low level of salaries is also a concern, with real wages having fallen below those of 2000, despite a recent recovery. To ensure a sustainable increase in wages, it is essential to boost productivity and growth through innovation, capital accumulation, and public action. Panetta stated that the Italian industry is still solid, but the value added in the manufacturing sector has remained stagnant, reflecting the expansion in the energy sector and the new decline in the manufacturing area. However, Panetta emphasized that 'despite the current difficulties, the Italian industry is not destined to decline. In all sectors, there are dynamic and competitive companies that invest in technology and research and position themselves in high-end segments.' The main issue is the low level of innovation, with the expenditure on research and development being significantly lower than the EU average. Panetta warned that 'with tariffs at risk, we risk losing 1% of global GDP in two years.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 06:40 PM\nSource:[ilsole24ore.com](https:\/\/www.ilsole24ore.com\/art\/la-mina-demografica-lavoro-entro-2040-puo-costare-l-11percento-pil-AHlraF1)\n\n**Resilient Short-Term Perspectives for Africa's Growth Despite Global Headwinds**\nDespite global economic and political headwinds, Africa has resilient short-term perspectives for growth. According to the 2025 Economic Prospects for Africa (PEA 2025) report, 21 African countries are expected to achieve a growth rate of over 5% in 2025, with four countries (Ethiopia, Niger, Rwanda, and Senegal) potentially reaching the critical threshold of 7% necessary for poverty reduction and inclusive growth. Africa's projected growth rates will exceed the global average and those of most other regions, except for emerging and developing Asia. The continent's resilience is based on effective national reforms and better macroeconomic management. However, regional growth perspectives vary significantly: East Africa leads with a projected growth rate of 5.9% in 2025-2026, driven by Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Tanzania's resilience. West Africa maintains a solid growth rate of 4.3%, driven by new oil and gas discoveries in Senegal and Niger. North Africa is expected to grow at 3.6% in 2025, while Central Africa's growth will slow to 3.2% and Southern Africa will only grow by 2.2%. Despite these challenges, Africa has a huge untapped potential for national resources. The PEA 2025 estimates that with appropriate policies, Africa could mobilize an additional $1.43 trillion in national resources from fiscal and non-fiscal sources, solely through efficiency gains. Africa's unexploited resources include: natural capital, with 30% of global mineral reserves and potential revenue of over $1.6 trillion by 2030; human capital, with a median age of 19 years, representing a demographic dividend that could add $47 billion to Africa's GDP through better labor participation; financial capital, with pension fund assets reaching $1.1 trillion and official transfers potentially reaching $500 billion by 2035 if transfer costs are reduced; and commercial capital, with the full implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) potentially increasing exports by $560 billion and the continent's revenue by $450 billion by 2035. Urgent measures are needed to combat resource leaks. The report highlights that massive capital outflows compromise the continent's development. In comparison to the $190.7 billion in financial inflows recorded in 2022, Africa has experienced approximately $587 billion in financial outflows. Of this total, around $90 billion was lost due to illicit financial flows, $275 billion was diverted by multinational corporations that transfer their profits, and $148 billion was lost due to corruption. When Africa allocates its own capital effectively (human, natural, fiscal, commercial, and financial), global capital will follow African capital to accelerate investments in the continent's productive sectors. The report calls for global reforms in several critical areas, including: improving macroeconomic management, quality institutions, good governance, and the rule of law; mobilizing fiscal revenues through improved tax administration, expanded tax bases, and strengthened social contracts with citizens; making natural capital accounting mandatory and enforcing national value retention through enrichment requirements; deepening financial markets by exploiting institutional savings, developing local currency bond markets, and harmonizing regulatory frameworks to facilitate cross-border investments.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 03:00 AM\nSource:[temoignages.re](https:\/\/www.temoignages.re\/international\/nouvelles-d-afrique\/des-perspectives-a-court-terme-resilientes-pour-l-afrique-malgre-les-vents-contraires-economiques-et-politiques-a-l-echelle-mondiale)\n\n**Shipping, the Scissors of Debt. 'A Brake on Global Trade'**\nThe European ports are seeking a new identity in an increasingly unpredictable geopolitical context, while the European Commission wants a new strategy for these infrastructures. The Espo, the European ports association, met in its annual conference in Thessaloniki. The occasion is also a moment to take stock of the sector. The first surprise that emerges, according to the analysis of Tim Power, director general of the British analysis company Drewry, is that the commercial battle of the United States against the rest of the world and particularly against China will not shake the growth of the global Gross Domestic Product: 'The trend - says Power - will be essentially in line with that of the past decade, with slow growth in Europe and normalization of China.' The global GDP growth forecast between 2025 and 2030 is 2.6%, slightly below the 2.9% of the period 2019-2025. The EU will go from 1.3% to 1.6%, the US from 2.6% to 2.3% and China will drop from 5.7% to 3.7%. The real alarm signal highlighted by Power is instead the growth of public debt. 'The sovereign debts of Italy and France are particularly high - explains Power - and this represents a high risk for their economies, and among the measures that they will have to adopt in the future to contain public spending, there could be the choice of cutting import volumes. Italy currently has the highest debt in the Western world, over 135% of its GDP, above the US and France. Overall, the debt-to-GDP ratio in the European Union is 80%, while that of China is destined to pass from the current 69% to 100% by 2030. The more the debt grows, the more its costs grow, reducing the room for maneuver of individual nations in the event of a future economic crisis. Trade relationships, including commercial ones, become rigid. Now, if it is true that at the current stage there are no expected - despite everything - major shocks to global growth, it is also true that there are several subjects that should start to take stock, starting from Italy, which, limiting ourselves to the port sector, would not only be faced with a lower volume of imports but would also have to pay - as is known - one of the highest prices in terms of exports, having precisely in the US the second largest export partner. Between this year and 2030, the growth of container traffic in European ports should be around 2-2.5%, while interesting movements could occur for oil traffic, particularly that of the United States: today China is a major buyer of this energy source, but the tariff policy could change the picture, and push Beijing to increase its purchases from the Middle East and Russia at the expense of American oil. Where will American oil go? With all probability to Europe, but the limited refining capacity makes the Old Continent a commercial partner able to absorb much lower volumes than those normally bought by China. And this considering that, at a general level, the import of US oil weighs 1.7% on the total Chinese purchases, but it is worth 5.1% of US sales. On the environmental front, while the passage of the Mediterranean to the area of control of emissions (ECA) established by the International Maritime Organization, the blue arm of the UN, has passed largely unnoticed, great importance has been given by all the speakers to the approval of the first draft of a global mechanism, approved by the IMO last month and which should be implemented by October, for the reduction of emissions from ships. 'In this way - explained the European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas - there will be a common field of competition for everyone' trying to counter the polemics arisen with the previous commission on the rigidity of the adopted scheme in Europe. However, notes Power, the global mechanism, which aims to achieve zero net emissions by 2050, will hardly be adopted before 2029.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 02:14 PM\nSource:[Il Secolo XIX](https:\/\/www.ilsecoloxix.it\/blue-economy\/shipping-logistica\/2025\/05\/12\/news\/shipping_la_tagliola_del_debito_un_freno_agli_scambi_globali-15143577\/)\n\n**US Population to Decline Without Migration by 2033, CBO Predicts**\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the US population without migration will start to decline in 2033, which may hinder economic growth. The CBO predicts that mortality will exceed birth rates in the US in eight years, and population growth will be driven only by migration. The National Center for Health Statistics reports that in 2023, there were 3,591,328 births, a historic low, and 3,090,582 deaths. The birth rate among women aged 20-24 (55.4) reached a record low. The CBO expects the gross domestic product (GDP) to grow at an average rate of 1.6% over the next 30 years, compared to an average annual growth rate of 2.5% over the past three decades. This is due to the decline in the workforce due to aging population and slowing productivity growth. The CBO also predicts a rise in the national debt from 100% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 156% of GDP in 2055. 'Even small changes in migration, birth, or death rates, accumulated over many years, can have a significant impact on results in later periods of forecasting,' the CBO said. The CBO's previous forecast, made in 2023, expected the US population to decline by 2040. The current forecast reflects the consequences of a government order issued in June 2024, which suspended the entry of most non-citizens through the southern border of the US, signed by former President Joe Biden.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 02, 2025 10:16 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https:\/\/www.rbc.ru\/economics\/28\/03\/2025\/67e6b9f59a79471781364d07)\n\n**Global Public Debt to Reach 95% of GDP by 2025, Warns IMF**\nThe global public debt is expected to continue growing, according to the Fiscal Monitor report released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on April 23. The report states that the public debt will reach 95% of the world's GDP by 2025, and could even surpass 100% by 2030. The IMF has also lowered its forecast for global economic growth to 2.8% in 2025, down from 3.3% in January, due to the trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump. This will lead to lower government revenues and increased pressure on countries with high debt levels to either balance their budgets or increase spending. The report warns that the public debt could reach 117% of GDP by 2027, the highest level since World War II. The IMF attributes the growth of public debt to the dynamics in the US and China. The report also notes that the US is expected to see a slow decline in its budget deficit over the next two years, but its public debt will continue to rise, reaching 122.5% of GDP in 2025 and over 128% in 2030. 'The trade war is causing significant economic difficulties and will lead to increased requests for public support for affected sectors,' said the report.

However, if the policies of former US President Donald Trump are implemented in the long term, the US GDP may be surpassed by China as early as 2049. The report also predicts that the global average economic growth rate will decrease from 3.3% between 2021 and 2030 to 1.3% between 2071 and 2075, due to the decline in population and birth rate. The report also notes that the population of Asia will decline by 2075, while Africa's population will continue to grow and surpass East Asia in the mid-2040s. 'If the US continues to deport 1 million illegal immigrants every year and strictly limits legal immigration, the US economy will decline, and China's GDP will surpass the US by 2049,' the report said.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 30, 2025 11:07 AM\nSource:[\u4e09\u7acb\u65b0\u805e](https:\/\/www.setn.com\/News.aspx?NewsID=1632063)\n\n**US Population Expected to Start Declining in 2033, CBO Predicts**\nAccording to a report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the US population is expected to start declining in 2033, excluding migration, which could undermine economic growth. The CBO predicts that mortality will exceed birth rates in the US within eight years, and population growth will only be sustained through migration. In 2023, the US saw a record low birth rate, with 3,591,328 children born, and a death toll of 3,090,582. The fertility rate among women aged 20-24 (55.4) reached a record low. The report also notes that the US GDP is expected to grow at an average rate of 1.6% over the next 30 years, compared to a 2.5% average annual growth rate over the past three decades. This is due to the shrinking workforce as the population ages and declining productivity growth. The CBO also predicts that the number of workers will increase from 171 million in 2025 to 185 million in 2055, with an annual growth rate of 0.1%. Additionally, the report notes that the 'slowdown in the growth of educational attainment' will also hinder economic growth. The CBO also forecasts a rise in the US national debt from 100% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 156% of GDP in 2055. As the CBO notes, 'even small changes in migration, birth, or death rates, accumulated over many years, can have a significant impact on results in later periods of forecasting.' The current forecast is a revision from the CBO's previous prediction of a population decline in 2040, which was made in 2023. The new forecast takes into account the consequences of a government directive issued in June 2024, which suspended the entry of most non-citizens through the southern US border, signed by former President Joe Biden.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 29, 2025 01:54 AM\nSource:[Oxu.Az](https:\/\/oxu.az\/ru\/v-mire\/v-ssha-sprognozirovali-sokrashenie-naseleniya)\n\n**US Federal Debt to Reach 107% of GDP by 2029, CBO Warns**\nThe US Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has predicted that the country's federal debt will reach 107% of the country's GDP by 2029, surpassing the highest level reached after World War II.

        "0":"Here\u2019s a consolidated rationale incorporating the best elements from all five forecasts, aiming for a cohesive and plausible projection of offensive nuclear detonations by 2050.\n\n**Overall Rationale:**\n\nThe trajectory of offensive nuclear weapon deployments by 2050 is characterized by escalating instability and a significant probability of substantial increases in global arsenals. The core drivers of this trend are multifaceted, encompassing rapid technological advancements, particularly in North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, shifts in strategic doctrine among major powers (specifically the US and, to a lesser extent, Russia), and the global expansion of nuclear energy initiatives, notably the Coalition\u2019s plans. While a complete standstill is improbable due to inherent geopolitical tensions and the logic of deterrence, a catastrophic, uncontrolled escalation is also far from guaranteed. \n\nThe immediate risk (2025-2035) represents a period of intensified competition and potentially rapid increases \u2013 likely reaching approximately 18,000 - 22,500 warheads within this timeframe, driven by North Korea\u2019s acceleration, continued US modernization programs, and the expansion of nuclear energy. However, this initial surge is not inevitable. There\u2019s a significant probability of a stabilization period occurring around 2040-2045, contingent on a series of unpredictable events \u2013 a major diplomatic breakthrough, a substantial shift in global power dynamics, or a dramatic reduction in regional conflicts.  \n\nLooking further out, beyond 2045, the scenario becomes more uncertain.  Without a concerted international effort to manage tensions and promote disarmament, the global nuclear stockpile could continue to grow, potentially exceeding 25,000 warheads by 2050. This outcome would be driven by persistent strategic competition, potential regional conflicts, and the normalization of nuclear weapons as a security guarantor. Conversely, the possibility of stabilization, though less likely, remains, predicated on a fundamental shift in global priorities and a renewed commitment to arms control. \n\nSeveral key factors contribute to this complex picture: North Korea\u2019s continued nuclear development, bolstered by potential Russian support, is a primary concern. The US\u2019s pursuit of \u201cusable\u201d tactical nuclear weapons introduces a dangerous element of escalation, while the Coalition\u2019s nuclear energy plans, though necessary for transitioning away from fossil fuels, present risks of heightened geopolitical instability. \n\n**Quantitative Estimates (2050):**\n\nGiven the varying forecasts, a range is appropriate:\n\n*   **Most Likely Scenario:** 22,500 \u2013 25,000 warheads \u2013 Driven by a combination of sustained geopolitical tensions, North Korea\u2019s continued expansion, and limited international cooperation.\n*   **Pessimistic Scenario:** 25,000+ warheads - If geopolitical instability significantly increases and disarmament efforts fail.\n*   **Optimistic Scenario:** 18,000 \u2013 22,500 warheads \u2013 If unforeseen diplomatic breakthroughs and a fundamental shift in global priorities lead to sustained arms control and disarmament.\n\n**Key Uncertainties:**\n\n*   **North Korea\u2019s Actions:** The pace and direction of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program remain the single greatest wildcard.\n*   **US Strategic Doctrine:** The US\u2019s evolving strategic doctrine, particularly regarding the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons, will heavily influence escalation dynamics.\n*   **Regional Conflicts:** The emergence of new regional conflicts or the intensification of existing ones could trigger a rapid expansion of nuclear arsenals.\n*   **International Cooperation:** The willingness of major powers to engage in arms control negotiations and to uphold existing treaties will be crucial. \n\nThis rationale integrates the core concerns highlighted across all forecasts, acknowledging the range of possibilities while emphasizing the serious risk of a substantial increase in the global offensive nuclear weapon stockpile by 2050.\n\n### Forecast\n\n10: 8000.0\n20: 14500.0\n40: 16000.0\n60: 18000.0\n80: 20000.0\n90: 22000.0\n11: 8700.0\n12: 9400.0\n13: 10100.0\n14: 10800.0\n15: 11500.0\n16: 12200.0\n17: 12900.0\n18: 13600.0\n19: 14300.0\n21: 14575.0\n22: 14650.0\n23: 14725.0\n24: 14800.0\n25: 14875.0\n26: 14950.0\n27: 15025.0\n28: 15100.0\n29: 15175.0\n30: 15250.0\n31: 15325.0\n32: 15400.0\n33: 15475.0\n34: 15550.0\n35: 15625.0\n36: 15700.0\n37: 15775.0\n38: 15850.0\n39: 15925.0\n41: 16100.0\n42: 16200.0\n43: 16300.0\n44: 16400.0\n45: 16500.0\n46: 16600.0\n47: 16700.0\n48: 16800.0\n49: 16900.0\n50: 17000.0\n51: 17100.0\n52: 17200.0\n53: 17300.0\n54: 17400.0\n55: 17500.0\n56: 17600.0\n57: 17700.0\n58: 17800.0\n59: 17900.0\n61: 18100.0\n62: 18200.0\n63: 18300.0\n64: 18400.0\n65: 18500.0\n66: 18600.0\n67: 18700.0\n68: 18800.0\n69: 18900.0\n70: 19000.0\n71: 19100.0\n72: 19200.0\n73: 19300.0\n74: 19400.0\n75: 19500.0\n76: 19600.0\n77: 19700.0\n78: 19800.0\n79: 19900.0\n81: 20200.0\n82: 20400.0\n83: 20600.0\n84: 20800.0\n85: 21000.0\n86: 21200.0\n87: 21400.0\n88: 21600.0\n89: 21800.0",
        "1":"Here's a consolidated rationale, synthesizing the best elements from all five forecasts, aiming for a coherent and robust prediction:\n\n**Final Rationale**\n\nThe projection of new vehicle production dominated by electric vehicles (EVs) in the US by 2027 remains subject to considerable uncertainty. The timeframe remaining \u2013 approximately 2.5 to 5 years \u2013 is marked by the potential for significant disruptive forces. The current trend, characterized by a gradual but persistent increase in EV adoption, is underpinned by growing production capacity (10 new battery plants), diminishing misinformation, and ongoing technological improvements. However, the pace of this growth is highly sensitive to external factors.\n\nConsidering the range of possible outcomes, we can establish a likely scenario with a reasonable degree of confidence.  Without major political shifts, disruptive economic events, or unanticipated technological breakthroughs, a baseline market share of 25-35% for EVs in new vehicle production by 2027 appears most probable. This is based on a combination of existing trends and the assessments of experts and markets. \n\nHowever, several \u201cblack swan\u201d events could significantly alter this trajectory. A global recession, coupled with supply chain disruptions specifically targeting battery materials, could push market share down to 15-20%. Conversely, a major breakthrough in solid-state battery technology, combined with ambitious government policies and robust charging infrastructure, could drive adoption to 40-45%.  The most likely scenario sits within the 25-35% range, reflecting a cautious optimism tempered by the numerous uncertainties surrounding policy, economic conditions, and technological advancements. The overall trajectory is likely to be characterized by a gradual expansion, but with significant potential for volatility.  The key factors to watch include the stability of global supply chains, the responsiveness of government policies to climate change, and the pace of innovation in battery technology.\n\n\n### Forecast\n\n10: 10.0\n20: 15.0\n40: 20.0\n60: 26.7\n80: 30.1\n90: 33.8\n11: 10.5\n12: 11.0\n13: 11.5\n14: 12.0\n15: 12.5\n16: 13.0\n17: 13.5\n18: 14.0\n19: 14.5\n21: 15.25\n22: 15.5\n23: 15.75\n24: 16.0\n25: 16.25\n26: 16.5\n27: 16.75\n28: 17.0\n29: 17.25\n30: 17.5\n31: 17.75\n32: 18.0\n33: 18.25\n34: 18.5\n35: 18.75\n36: 19.0\n37: 19.25\n38: 19.5\n39: 19.75\n41: 20.5\n42: 21.0\n43: 21.5\n44: 22.0\n45: 22.5\n46: 22.92\n47: 23.19\n48: 23.46\n49: 23.73\n50: 24.0\n51: 24.27\n52: 24.54\n53: 24.81\n54: 25.08\n55: 25.35\n56: 25.619999999999997\n57: 25.89\n58: 26.16\n59: 26.43\n61: 26.87\n62: 27.04\n63: 27.21\n64: 27.38\n65: 27.55\n66: 27.72\n67: 27.89\n68: 28.06\n69: 28.23\n70: 28.4\n71: 28.57\n72: 28.740000000000002\n73: 28.91\n74: 29.080000000000002\n75: 29.25\n76: 29.42\n77: 29.59\n78: 29.76\n79: 29.93\n81: 30.470000000000002\n82: 30.84\n83: 31.21\n84: 31.58\n85: 31.95\n86: 32.32\n87: 32.69\n88: 33.059999999999995\n89: 33.43",

While a dramatic, immediate discovery of intelligent aliens remains improbable, there's a high probability of identifying microbial life on other celestial bodies, primarily Mars and potentially Europa, within this timeframe. This discovery wouldn't necessarily be a \u201ccontact\u201d event, but rather the detection of evidence of simple, existing life \u2013 a significant step towards realizing the long-held dream of finding life beyond Earth.\n\n**Key Timeline & Probabilities:**\n\n*   **Years 1-10: Incremental Progress & Increased Awareness (60-70% Probability)**\n    *   Continued data gathering via missions like Mars rovers and the James Webb Space Telescope will yield increasingly suggestive evidence \u2013 potential biosignatures in Martian soil, anomalous readings from Europa\u2019s ocean, and ongoing, though inconclusive, observations of exoplanets.\n    *   The success of games like *The First Descendant* will continue to drive public interest in space exploration and science fiction, further stimulating investment in relevant technologies.\n    *   Small, incremental advances in robotics, AI, and materials science will contribute to more capable exploration technologies.\n    *   Microbial life is discovered on Mars.\n*   **Years 10-25: Confirmation & Expanding Exploration (40-50% Probability)**\n    *   Further analysis of Martian data confirms the presence of microbial life.\n    *   More advanced robotic probes are deployed to explore Europa, increasing the chances of detecting microbial life in its subsurface ocean.\n    *   The development of more sophisticated sensors and analytical instruments improves the ability to detect subtle biosignatures.\n    *   Human missions to Mars and\/or Europa become increasingly feasible, though potentially delayed due to funding and logistical challenges.\n*   **Years 25-50: Expanding Horizons & Technological Advancement (20-30% Probability)**\n    *   Human missions to Mars become a reality, leading to further discoveries about the planet\u2019s geology, climate, and potential for past or present life.\n    *   Significant advances in closed-loop life support systems and radiation shielding make longer-duration space missions more viable.\n    *   The discovery of other potentially habitable environments in our solar system increases the overall probability of finding life elsewhere.\n    *   The development of self-replicating nanobots (though complex and risky) could revolutionize resource extraction and planetary modification, opening up even more possibilities for exploration and colonization.\n\n\n\n**Key Risks & Uncertainties (Lower Probability Events - 10-20% each):**\n\n*   **Catastrophic Solar Event:** A major solar flare or coronal mass ejection could damage or destroy critical space infrastructure, significantly delaying exploration efforts. (10%)\n*   **Technological Stagnation:** A significant setback in a key technological area (e.g., propulsion, robotics, AI) could derail progress.

While the discovery of intelligent alien life remains a distant possibility, the increasing likelihood of finding microbial life on other celestial bodies promises to be a profoundly transformative event for humanity, expanding our perspective on our place in the cosmos.\n\n### Forecast\n\n10: 5.0\n20: 10.0\n40: 5.0\n60: 2.0\n80: 0.75\n90: 0.88\n11: 5.5\n12: 6.0\n13: 6.5\n14: 7.0\n15: 7.5\n16: 8.0\n17: 8.5\n18: 9.0\n19: 9.5\n21: 9.75\n22: 9.5\n23: 9.25\n24: 9.0\n25: 8.75\n26: 8.5\n27: 8.25\n28: 8.0\n29: 7.75\n30: 7.5\n31: 7.25\n32: 7.0\n33: 6.75\n34: 6.5\n35: 6.25\n36: 6.0\n37: 5.75\n38: 5.5\n39: 5.25\n41: 4.85\n42: 4.7\n43: 4.55\n44: 4.4\n45: 4.25\n46: 4.1\n47: 3.95\n48: 3.8\n49: 3.65\n50: 3.5\n51: 3.35\n52: 3.2\n53: 3.05\n54: 2.9\n55: 2.75\n56: 2.6\n57: 2.45\n58: 2.3\n59: 2.15\n61: 1.925\n62: 1.85\n63: 1.775\n64: 1.7\n65: 1.625\n66: 1.55\n67: 1.475\n68: 1.4\n69: 1.325\n70: 1.25\n71: 1.175\n72: 1.1\n73: 1.025\n74: 0.95\n75: 0.875\n76: 0.8\n77: 0.7250000000000001\n78: 0.73\n79: 0.74\n81: 0.763\n82: 0.776\n83: 0.789\n84: 0.802\n85: 0.815\n86: 0.828\n87: 0.841\n88: 0.854\n89: 0.867",
        "3":"**Final Forecast: Global Obesity Prevalence in 2030**\n\nThe available forecasts, encompassing diverse perspectives from expert opinions, market trends, and projected scenarios, converge on a significant and concerning level of global obesity prevalence by 2030. The core rationale is built upon a consistent understanding: without deliberate, impactful interventions, the current trajectory of rising obesity rates will continue to escalate.\n\n**Core Rationale:**\n\nThe projected global obesity rate in 2030 is expected to be approximately 70-85%. This figure reflects a combination of established trends, expert expectations, and potential disruptive scenarios. The primary driver of this projection is the continuation of current trends: escalating consumption of ultra-processed foods, coupled with increasingly sedentary lifestyles, particularly in developing nations where access to healthy food options and healthcare remains limited. The interconnectedness of these factors, coupled with a lack of decisive global action, creates a highly vulnerable scenario.\n\nSeveral potential scenarios contribute to this overall estimate:\n\n*   **Most Likely Scenario (60-70%):**  Continued adherence to existing trends, marked by increasing consumption of calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods, alongside a decline in physical activity, particularly among younger generations. This scenario is bolstered by the economic pressures and market forces favoring convenience foods. This scenario emphasizes the need for immediate and sustained public health campaigns, alongside policy changes that support healthier food choices.\n\n*   **Potential Acceleration (75-85%):** This outcome is plausible if a confluence of factors amplifies the existing trends. This could include a global economic downturn further incentivizing reliance on cheap, highly processed foods, coupled with a further decline in access to preventative healthcare and nutritional education, particularly in regions with rapidly growing populations and limited resources. The rise of increasingly addictive substances within processed food products, as suggested in one forecast, could dramatically accelerate this trajectory.\n\n*   **Mitigation Scenario (60-70%):**  A dramatic shift would occur only with a truly global and coordinated response. This requires widespread adoption of preventative measures \u2013 including public health campaigns, effective regulatory policies around food marketing, subsidized access to healthy foods, and robust investments in physical education and active lifestyles.  Furthermore, advancements in nutritional science and technology \u2013 particularly in personalized nutrition and sustainable food production \u2013 would play a critical role in mitigating the risk.\n\n**Key Considerations & Uncertainties:**\n\n*   **Geographic Variation:** Obesity rates will undoubtedly vary significantly across regions, with developing nations likely facing a disproportionately higher burden.\n*   **Technological Innovation:** Advancements in food technology, nutritional science, and personalized medicine could significantly alter the trajectory.\n*   **Policy Intervention:** Government policies \u2013 including taxation on unhealthy foods, food labeling regulations, and investments in public health \u2013 will be critical determinants.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the available forecasts, a 70-85% global obesity prevalence in 2030 is the most likely outcome if current trends persist. However, with proactive and coordinated global efforts, it\u2019s possible to significantly reduce this figure, although achieving a substantially lower rate will require a substantial transformation of global food systems, lifestyle choices, and public health priorities.\n\n### Forecast\n\n10: 40.0\n20: 55.0\n40: 70.0\n60: 75.0\n80: 81.5\n90: 85.0\n11: 41.5\n12: 43.0\n13: 44.5\n14: 46.0\n15: 47.5\n16: 49.0\n17: 50.5\n18: 52.0\n19: 53.5\n21: 55.75\n22: 56.5\n23: 57.25\n24: 58.0\n25: 58.75\n26: 59.5\n27: 60.25\n28: 61.0\n29: 61.75\n30: 62.5\n31: 63.25\n32: 64.0\n33: 64.75\n34: 65.5\n35: 66.25\n36: 67.0\n37: 67.75\n38: 68.5\n39: 69.25\n41: 70.25\n42: 70.5\n43: 70.75\n44: 71.0\n45: 71.25\n46: 71.5\n47: 71.75\n48: 72.0\n49: 72.25\n50: 72.5\n51: 72.75\n52: 73.0\n53: 73.25\n54: 73.5\n55: 73.75\n56: 74.0\n57: 74.25\n58: 74.5\n59: 74.75\n61: 75.35\n62: 75.7\n63: 76.05\n64: 76.4\n65: 76.75\n66: 77.1\n67: 77.45\n68: 77.8\n69: 78.15\n70: 78.5\n71: 78.85\n72: 79.2\n73: 79.55\n74: 79.9\n75: 80.25\n76: 80.6\n77: 80.95\n78: 81.17\n79: 81.335\n81: 81.73\n82: 81.96\n83: 82.19\n84: 82.42\n85: 82.65\n86: 82.88\n87: 83.11\n88: 83.34\n89: 84.0",
        "4":"## Final Forecast for China\u2019s Freedom House Score in 2028\n\nBased on the combined rationales from all five forecasts, a comprehensive and nuanced forecast for China\u2019s Freedom House score in 2028 emerges. The prevailing trend of declining freedoms in China, coupled with the ongoing challenges to Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and Taiwan\u2019s robust democratic institutions, paints a picture of continued pressure on China\u2019s score. However, the possibility of unexpected shifts \u2013 both positive and negative \u2013 introduces significant uncertainty.\n\n**Core Prediction:** Given the current trajectory, it is highly probable that China\u2019s overall Freedom House score will remain relatively stable, but with a downward adjustment.\n\n**Detailed Assessment:**\n\n*   **China:** The most likely outcome is a score of 8.2 to 8.6. The continued suppression of dissent, tightening control over information, and increased surveillance efforts, as highlighted across all forecasts, will exert downward pressure. While a dramatic collapse is unlikely, the trend of erosion is expected to persist. The risk of a significant drop (e.g., to 7.5 or lower) remains if the government escalates its repression.\n\n*   **Hong Kong:** Hong Kong\u2019s score is expected to remain around 35-40. Despite the ongoing pressures from Beijing, a complete collapse is considered unlikely in the short term. However, the continued erosion of autonomy and freedoms will likely result in a further decrease from its current level.\n\n*   **Taiwan:** Taiwan\u2019s score is projected to remain strong, holding steady at 94. The stability of its democratic institutions and robust civil society will provide a significant counterweight to the downward pressures on China. However, increased pressure from China will likely lead to a slight improvement to 95-96.\n\n**Key Uncertainties and Potential Scenarios:**\n\n*   **Escalation of Repression:** A significant escalation in China's crackdown on dissent, including mass arrests, restrictions on freedom of expression, and further tightening of control over the internet, could push China\u2019s score down to 7.5 or lower.\n\n*   **Economic Slowdown:** A prolonged economic slowdown in China, coupled with social unrest, could exacerbate existing tensions and contribute to a decline in freedoms.\n\n*   **Positive Shift (Less Likely, but Possible):** A surprising shift in China's leadership, accompanied by a genuine commitment to human rights, increased openness, and engagement with the international community, could lead to a modest improvement in China\u2019s score, potentially reaching 8.5-9.0. This scenario is considered less probable but remains a possibility.\n\n*   **External Shocks:** A significant military confrontation in the South China Sea or Taiwan would likely destabilize the region and negatively impact the Freedom House scores of all three countries, particularly Taiwan.\n\n**Overall Probability Distribution:**\n\n*   **8.2 - 8.6 (70% Probability)** \u2013 This represents the most likely outcome, considering the established trends and ongoing pressures.\n*   **7.5 - 8.1 (20% Probability)** \u2013 This accounts for a moderate escalation of repression in China.\n*   **8.7 - 9.0 (10% Probability)** \u2013 This reflects the possibility of a surprising shift towards greater openness and human rights.\n\n**Final Prediction:** China\u2019s Freedom House score in 2028 is forecast to be **8.4**. This score reflects the most probable outcome, acknowledging the complexities of the geopolitical landscape and the inherent uncertainties surrounding China's future trajectory.\n\n### Forecast\n\n10: 8.5\n20: 8.2\n40: 8.7\n60: 9.1\n80: 9.2\n90: 9.3\n11: 8.47\n12: 8.44\n13: 8.41\n14: 8.379999999999999\n15: 8.35\n16: 8.32\n17: 8.29\n18: 8.26\n19: 8.229999999999999\n21: 8.225\n22: 8.25\n23: 8.274999999999999\n24: 8.299999999999999\n25: 8.325\n26: 8.35\n27: 8.375\n28: 8.399999999999999\n29: 8.424999999999999\n30: 8.45\n31: 8.475\n32: 8.5\n33: 8.524999999999999\n34: 8.549999999999999\n35: 8.575\n36: 8.6\n37: 8.625\n38: 8.649999999999999\n39: 8.674999999999999\n41: 8.725\n42: 8.75\n43: 8.774999999999999\n44: 8.799999999999999\n45: 8.825\n46: 8.85\n47: 8.875\n48: 8.899999999999999\n49: 8.924999999999999\n50: 8.95\n51: 8.975\n52: 9.0\n53: 9.024999999999999\n54: 9.049999999999999\n55: 9.075\n56: 9.08\n57: 9.084999999999999\n58: 9.09\n59: 9.094999999999999\n61: 9.105\n62: 9.11\n63: 9.115\n64: 9.12\n65: 9.125\n66: 9.129999999999999\n67: 9.135\n68: 9.139999999999999\n69: 9.145\n70: 9.149999999999999\n71: 9.155\n72: 9.16\n73: 9.165\n74: 9.17\n75: 9.174999999999999\n76: 9.18\n77: 9.184999999999999\n78: 9.19\n79: 9.194999999999999\n81: 9.209999999999999\n82: 9.219999999999999\n83: 9.23\n84: 9.24\n85: 9.25\n86: 9.26\n87: 9.27\n88: 9.280000000000001\n89: 9.290000000000001",
        "5":"Okay, here\u2019s a synthesized forecast for the average weekly working hours in Germany, incorporating the key insights from all five forecasts. This represents a weighted average, giving more weight to forecasts with more detailed projections and a stronger overall narrative.\n\n**Synthesized Forecast: Average Weekly Working Hours in Germany (2025-2026)**\n\n**Overall Trend:** The overarching trend is one of *gradual increase* in average weekly working hours, driven by a combination of persistent labor shortages, ongoing pressure for productivity gains, and the adoption of new technologies. However, this increase is tempered by a growing awareness of work-life balance and potential interventions aimed at mitigating negative impacts.\n\n**Baseline Projection (Year 1 \u2013 2026): 46.5 Hours**\n\n*   **Short-Term (2025 - 2026):** Initially, we project a steady increase of 4-5 hours per week. This is primarily due to the continued shortage of skilled labor \u2013 particularly in manufacturing, engineering, and IT \u2013 coupled with the IW Institute\u2019s projections of an aging workforce (approximately 20 million baby boomers retiring). Employers will continue to push for increased productivity to maintain competitiveness.\n*   **Mid-Term (2026-2028):** At this stage, the impact of automation and AI will start to become more pronounced, however the workforce shortages will still be a significant driver. We expect an additional increase of 3-4 hours per week. This is influenced by the IW Institute\u2019s projections of an aging workforce.\n*   **Long-Term (2028+):** The trajectory becomes more uncertain, heavily influenced by the pace of technological adoption. However, we anticipate a gradual stabilization around 48-50 hours.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n*   **2025-2026 (Initial Phase): 47.5 Hours** \u2013 This phase is characterized by the most rapid increase, driven by immediate labor market pressures. We project an increase of 3-4 hours over the year.\n*   **2026-2028 (Automation & Continued Labor Shortages): 48.7 Hours** \u2013 The impact of automation and AI starts to become more impactful, contributing an additional 2-2.5 hours.\n*   **2028+ (Stabilization): 48.5 Hours** \u2013 As the labor market adjusts to automation and new technologies, and the impacts of automation become more widespread, the increases in working hours slow down and eventually stabilize.\n\n**Key Drivers & Considerations:**\n\n*   **Labor Shortages (40% Weight):**  Persistent shortages in critical sectors will remain the strongest driver of increased working hours, particularly in the short-to-medium term.\n*   **Automation & AI (30% Weight):** The pace of adoption of automation and AI will be a crucial factor. Rapid adoption will accelerate the shift to shorter work weeks, while a slower pace will maintain higher average hours.\n*   **Government Policy (15% Weight):** Potential government interventions (e.g., regulations on work hours, incentives for reduced hours, investment in training) could significantly alter the trajectory.\n*   **Worker Preferences (15% Weight):** A growing cultural shift towards prioritizing work-life balance and well-being could introduce resistance to longer working hours, but this is likely to be a slower-moving factor.\n\n**Caveats:**\n\n*   This forecast is based on the available data and trends as of today's date. Unexpected geopolitical events, technological breakthroughs, or changes in worker attitudes could significantly alter the trajectory.\n\n---\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this forecast, such as the impact of a particular driver, the potential for government intervention, or the specific sectors most likely to experience changes in working hours?\n\n### Forecast\n\n10: 30.0\n20: 35.0\n40: 39.3\n60: 42.0\n80: 47.3\n90: 49.5\n11: 30.5\n12: 31.0\n13: 31.5\n14: 32.0\n15: 32.5\n16: 33.0\n17: 33.5\n18: 34.0\n19: 34.5\n21: 35.15\n22: 35.3\n23: 35.45\n24: 35.6\n25: 35.75\n26: 35.9\n27: 36.05\n28: 36.2\n29: 36.35\n30: 36.5\n31: 36.79\n32: 37.28\n33: 37.77\n34: 38.26\n35: 38.75\n36: 39.059999999999995\n37: 39.12\n38: 39.18\n39: 39.239999999999995\n41: 39.345\n42: 39.39\n43: 39.434999999999995\n44: 39.48\n45: 39.525\n46: 39.57\n47: 39.615\n48: 39.66\n49: 39.8\n50: 40.0\n51: 40.2\n52: 40.4\n53: 40.6\n54: 40.8\n55: 41.0\n56: 41.2\n57: 41.4\n58: 41.6\n59: 41.8\n61: 42.15\n62: 42.3\n63: 42.45\n64: 42.6\n65: 42.75\n66: 42.9\n67: 43.125\n68: 43.5\n69: 43.875\n70: 44.25\n71: 44.625\n72: 45.0\n73: 45.375\n74: 45.75\n75: 46.125\n76: 46.5\n77: 46.875\n78: 47.05\n79: 47.175\n81: 47.519999999999996\n82: 47.739999999999995\n83: 47.96\n84: 48.18\n85: 48.4\n86: 48.62\n87: 48.839999999999996\n88: 49.06\n89: 49.28",
        "6":"Here's a synthesized rationale incorporating the best elements from all five forecasts, presented as a single, consistent forecast:\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nPredicting Bitcoin\u2019s value by 2030 remains inherently challenging due to the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and the myriad of potential influencing factors.  However, analyzing the accumulated projections and expert sentiment suggests a trajectory characterized by periods of both significant growth and substantial volatility.  The timeframe remaining\u2014approximately 6 months to June 2025, and then 7 years\u2014allows for considerable shifts in market conditions. \n\nThe most consistent short-term (within the next 6 months) outlook, based on the collective forecasts, anticipates Bitcoin remaining within a range of $60,000 to $95,000.  Several forecasts suggest a gradual increase driven by ongoing institutional adoption, growing retail interest, and the continued narrative of Bitcoin as a store of value.  However, this growth is not guaranteed and is subject to significant fluctuations. \n\nLooking further out, towards 2030, the potential outcomes diverge considerably. A conservative assessment, considering the prevalent cautious optimism, suggests a price range of $80,000 to $135,000. This acknowledges the possibility of continued, albeit fluctuating, growth. \n\nHowever, more optimistic scenarios, predicated on disruptive technological advancements, are possible.  A revolutionary blockchain breakthrough\u2014particularly one that significantly improves Bitcoin\u2019s scalability and energy efficiency\u2014combined with widespread adoption by corporations and governments, could propel the price to $250,000 \u2013 $300,000 or higher.  Conversely, significant negative catalysts \u2013 a major global recession coupled with stringent regulatory crackdowns, or a catastrophic security breach \u2013 could depress the price back to $30,000 - $40,000. \n\nUltimately, the long-term price of Bitcoin by 2030 is highly uncertain and contingent on a complex interplay of economic, technological, and regulatory forces.  While a measured growth scenario of $80,000-$135,000 is the most reasonable projection based on current forecasts, preparedness for a wide range of outcomes \u2013 including significant price declines \u2013 is essential. \n\n**Final Prediction (June 2030):** $110,000 \u2013 $160,000 (Percentile 70)\n\n\n### Forecast\n\n10: 30000.0\n20: 50000.0\n40: 80000.0\n60: 95000.0\n80: 110000.0\n90: 135000.0\n11: 32000.0\n12: 34000.0\n13: 36000.0\n14: 38000.0\n15: 40000.0\n16: 42000.0\n17: 44000.0\n18: 46000.0\n19: 48000.0\n21: 51500.0\n22: 53000.0\n23: 54500.0\n24: 56000.0\n25: 57500.0\n26: 59000.0\n27: 60500.0\n28: 62000.0\n29: 63500.0\n30: 65000.0\n31: 66500.0\n32: 68000.0\n33: 69500.0\n34: 71000.0\n35: 72500.0\n36: 74000.0\n37: 75500.0\n38: 77000.0\n39: 78500.0\n41: 80750.0\n42: 81500.0\n43: 82250.0\n44: 83000.0\n45: 83750.0\n46: 84500.0\n47: 85250.0\n48: 86000.0\n49: 86750.0\n50: 87500.0\n51: 88250.0\n52: 89000.0\n53: 89750.0\n54: 90500.0\n55: 91250.0\n56: 92000.0\n57: 92750.0\n58: 93500.0\n59: 94250.0\n61: 95750.0\n62: 96500.0\n63: 97250.0\n64: 98000.0\n65: 98750.0\n66: 99500.0\n67: 100250.0\n68: 101000.0\n69: 101750.0\n70: 102500.0\n71: 103250.0\n72: 104000.0\n73: 104750.0\n74: 105500.0\n75: 106250.0\n76: 107000.0\n77: 107750.0\n78: 108500.0\n79: 109250.0\n81: 112500.0\n82: 115000.0\n83: 117500.0\n84: 120000.0\n85: 122500.0\n86: 125000.0\n87: 127500.0\n88: 130000.0\n89: 132500.0",
        "7":"## Consolidated Rationale for R\u2217 (Drake Equation Parameter: Star Formation Rate)\n\nThe collective analysis of these forecasts reveals a consistent, albeit cautiously pessimistic, view regarding the likelihood of detecting extraterrestrial life within a relatively short timeframe. The core of the estimate revolves around the rate at which suitable stars are formed \u2013 R\u2217, the primary parameter of the Drake Equation. The dominant trend across all forecasts highlights significant uncertainty and a low probability of detection.\n\nThe rate of star formation, R\u2217, is inherently difficult to estimate precisely. The current data suggests that while the universe contains a vast number of stars, only a small fraction of these are likely to be habitable and, crucially, capable of hosting intelligent life. The forecasts consistently agree that the current estimates for R\u2217 (typically in the range of 1-2 stars per year) are likely too high. There\u2019s a strong consensus that the actual rate of formation of potentially habitable stars is significantly lower, contributing to the overall low probability of detection.\n\nHowever, several scenarios could shift this estimate. Technological advancements in exoplanet detection and analysis, particularly the development of more sophisticated methods for identifying biosignatures and characterizing planetary atmospheres, offer a pathway to potentially increase R\u2217. The forecasts uniformly acknowledge that continued innovation in this area could modestly improve our ability to find habitable stars and, consequently, increase the probability of contact. \n\nDespite this potential for improvement, a significant roadblock remains \u2013 the vast distances separating us from any potentially habitable stars. Even with a more accurate estimate of R\u2217, the probability of a signal reaching Earth from a distant star remains exceedingly low due to the challenges associated with interstellar communication and the limited lifespan of stars.\n\nUltimately, all forecasts converge on a low probability of detecting extraterrestrial intelligence within the next 14 months (or similar timeframe). The current estimates hover around 0.02 - 0.10, indicating a low but not entirely negligible chance of a breakthrough. Continued research and technological advancements could modestly increase this probability, but the fundamental challenges associated with interstellar communication and the inherent rarity of habitable stars remain significant barriers. The best estimate reflects a probability of 0.05 \u2013 0.10.\n\n### Forecast\n\n10: 0.005\n20: 0.02\n40: 0.06\n60: 0.08\n80: 0.08\n90: 0.08\n11: 0.0075\n12: 0.009000000000000001\n13: 0.0095\n14: 0.011\n15: 0.0125\n16: 0.013999999999999999\n17: 0.0155\n18: 0.017\n19: 0.018500000000000003\n21: 0.024\n22: 0.028\n23: 0.032\n24: 0.036\n25: 0.0375\n26: 0.039\n27: 0.040499999999999994\n28: 0.041999999999999996\n29: 0.0435\n30: 0.045\n31: 0.0465\n32: 0.048\n33: 0.0495\n34: 0.051\n35: 0.0525\n36: 0.054\n37: 0.0555\n38: 0.057\n39: 0.058499999999999996\n41: 0.062\n42: 0.064\n43: 0.066\n44: 0.068\n45: 0.07\n46: 0.072\n47: 0.07350000000000001\n48: 0.07400000000000001\n49: 0.07450000000000001\n50: 0.07500000000000001\n51: 0.0755\n52: 0.076\n53: 0.0765\n54: 0.077\n55: 0.0775\n56: 0.078\n57: 0.0785\n58: 0.079\n59: 0.0795\n61: 0.08\n62: 0.08\n63: 0.08\n64: 0.08\n65: 0.08\n66: 0.08\n67: 0.08\n68: 0.08\n69: 0.08\n70: 0.08\n71: 0.08\n72: 0.08\n73: 0.08\n74: 0.08\n75: 0.08\n76: 0.08\n77: 0.08\n78: 0.08\n79: 0.08\n81: 0.08\n82: 0.08\n83: 0.08\n84: 0.08\n85: 0.08\n86: 0.08\n87: 0.08\n88: 0.08\n89: 0.08",
        "8":"## Final Rationale for Supreme Court Seat Forecast (2030)\n\nThe forecasts presented exhibit a generally conservative outlook regarding the number of seats on the Supreme Court of the United States in 2030. A central theme is judicial restraint and a preference for maintaining the existing status quo, driven by the inherent difficulties and potential political ramifications of significant shifts within the court. However, underlying this caution are acknowledged uncertainties, primarily stemming from ongoing legal challenges to redistricting and the potential for unforeseen political or social events to dramatically alter the landscape.\n\nThe most consistent element across all forecasts is a recognition of judicial scrutiny, particularly regarding redistricting efforts \u2013 specifically related to the Louisiana congressional map. This demonstrates a heightened awareness of partisan gerrymandering and its potential impact on representation. The forecasts consistently project a moderate degree of judicial intervention in redistricting, albeit without predicting a massive, disruptive shift in overall seat numbers.\n\nSeveral scenarios are identified as potential drivers of change. A key risk is the continuation of the current trend, characterized by increased judicial review and potential adjustments to state maps. This trend, reflected in numerous forecasts, suggests a moderate shift of -5 to +5 seats. However, a more disruptive outcome \u2013 a significant, unexpected shift \u2013 is acknowledged through a consideration of unforeseen legal rulings and\/or a broad-based electoral shift.\n\nSpecifically, the potential for a ruling against further judicial intervention in redistricting (as suggested in Forecast 5) creates a scenario where the existing court composition remains relatively stable. Conversely, a widespread and significant electoral realignment, potentially triggered by a major economic event or social movement, could lead to a dramatic surge in support for a new party, resulting in a large shift in congressional representation.\n\nThe level of uncertainty is reflected in a range of probabilistic assessments. The core probability remains centered around a relatively stable seat count, but with a notable spread acknowledging the risk of moderate shifts influenced by judicial intervention and\/or unforeseen political events. \n\n**Therefore, the most likely scenario for the Supreme Court\u2019s seat composition in 2030 is a holding pattern with a shift of approximately -5 to +5 seats, driven primarily by judicial oversight of redistricting efforts. The overall probability leans toward a stabilization around 98 seats, with an acknowledgement of a significant risk (approximately 20%) of a more substantial shift due to external factors.**\n\n### Forecast\n\n10: 30.0\n20: 25.0\n40: 20.0\n60: 16.0\n80: 12.0\n90: 9.0\n11: 29.2\n12: 28.4\n13: 27.6\n14: 26.8\n15: 27.5\n16: 27.0\n17: 26.5\n18: 26.0\n19: 25.5\n21: 24.75\n22: 24.5\n23: 24.25\n24: 24.0\n25: 23.75\n26: 23.5\n27: 23.25\n28: 23.0\n29: 22.75\n30: 22.5\n31: 22.25\n32: 22.0\n33: 21.75\n34: 21.5\n35: 21.25\n36: 21.0\n37: 20.75\n38: 20.5\n39: 20.25\n41: 19.8\n42: 19.6\n43: 19.4\n44: 19.2\n45: 19.0\n46: 18.8\n47: 18.6\n48: 18.4\n49: 18.2\n50: 18.0\n51: 17.8\n52: 17.6\n53: 17.4\n54: 17.2\n55: 17.0\n56: 16.8\n57: 16.6\n58: 16.4\n59: 16.2\n61: 15.8\n62: 15.6\n63: 15.4\n64: 15.2\n65: 15.0\n66: 14.8\n67: 14.6\n68: 14.4\n69: 14.2\n70: 14.0\n71: 13.8\n72: 13.6\n73: 13.4\n74: 13.2\n75: 13.0\n76: 12.8\n77: 12.6\n78: 12.4\n79: 12.2\n81: 11.7\n82: 11.4\n83: 11.1\n84: 10.8\n85: 10.5\n86: 10.2\n87: 9.9\n88: 9.6\n89: 9.3",
        "9":"**Final Rationale for US GDP Growth Forecast (Before 2030)**\n\nThe forecasts presented paint a picture of significant economic uncertainty regarding US GDP growth before 2030. The dominant trend points toward a period of constrained growth, largely driven by existing vulnerabilities within the US economy. The most probable scenario, based on the collective insights, is one of moderate, but persistent, slowing growth. \n\nThe core of this projection rests on several converging factors: an aging population contributing to a declining workforce, a rising debt-to-GDP ratio nearing 156% by 2055, and limited policy responses. The current trend of rising debt is particularly concerning, and the projections across all forecasts highlight the significant drag this will exert on economic expansion. Immigration, while noted as a potential mitigating factor in some forecasts, is not consistently assumed to be a sufficient counterweight to the demographic challenges.\n\nWhile forecasts vary, the consistent estimate of 1.6% annual growth by the CBO is a reasonable baseline. However, this is a cautious estimate. The potential for a sharp downturn exists, particularly if the current trends\u2014rising debt and demographic decline\u2014continue unabated. A significant recession, triggered by a geopolitical event or a sharp financial shock, could push growth rates below 0.5% annually.\n\nHowever, pockets of higher growth are not entirely ruled out. Technological innovation, particularly breakthroughs in areas like automation and renewable energy, could offer a catalyst for increased productivity and economic expansion.  Similarly, a successful shift towards a more sustainable and resource-efficient economy could potentially boost growth. However, realizing this optimistic scenario relies on proactive policy interventions and a willingness to embrace transformative change.\n\nCrucially, the forecasts all acknowledge the inherent uncertainty. The timeframe (30 years) is exceptionally long, and unforeseen events \u2013 technological disruptions, shifts in global trade, or unexpected policy changes \u2013 could dramatically alter the trajectory of US economic growth. Despite the range of possible outcomes, the consensus points to a slow, challenging, but not necessarily catastrophic, economic future for the United States. \n\n**Key Themes & Probability Assessment (Based on combined forecasts):**\n\n* **Most Likely Scenario (60-70% Probability):** 1.2% - 1.6% annual GDP growth, driven by persistent demographic challenges and rising debt. This is the most consistently projected outcome.\n* **Moderate Risk Scenario (20-30% Probability):** Growth slows to 0.8% - 1.2% annually due to a significant economic shock (e.g., recession, trade war).\n* **Potential Upside Scenario (5-10% Probability):** Growth exceeds 2% annually driven by transformative technological innovation (AI, robotics, renewable energy) and supportive policy interventions.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these probabilities are subjective estimations based on the available information. The actual outcome will undoubtedly be influenced by a complex interplay of factors, many of which are inherently unpredictable.\n\n### Forecast\n\n10: 0.5\n20: 0.8\n40: 1.2\n60: 1.5\n80: 1.8\n90: 1.9\n11: 0.53\n12: 0.56\n13: 0.59\n14: 0.62\n15: 0.65\n16: 0.68\n17: 0.7100000000000001\n18: 0.74\n19: 0.77\n21: 0.8200000000000001\n22: 0.8400000000000001\n23: 0.86\n24: 0.88\n25: 0.9\n26: 0.92\n27: 0.94\n28: 0.96\n29: 0.98\n30: 1.0\n31: 1.02\n32: 1.04\n33: 1.06\n34: 1.08\n35: 1.1\n36: 1.12\n37: 1.1400000000000001\n38: 1.16\n39: 1.18\n41: 1.22\n42: 1.24\n43: 1.26\n44: 1.28\n45: 1.3\n46: 1.32\n47: 1.34\n48: 1.36\n49: 1.3800000000000001\n50: 1.4\n51: 1.41\n52: 1.42\n53: 1.43\n54: 1.44\n55: 1.45\n56: 1.46\n57: 1.47\n58: 1.48\n59: 1.49\n61: 1.51\n62: 1.52\n63: 1.53\n64: 1.54\n65: 1.55\n66: 1.56\n67: 1.58\n68: 1.62\n69: 1.6600000000000001\n70: 1.7000000000000002\n71: 1.7400000000000002\n72: 1.76\n73: 1.7650000000000001\n74: 1.77\n75: 1.775\n76: 1.78\n77: 1.7850000000000001\n78: 1.79\n79: 1.795\n81: 1.81\n82: 1.82\n83: 1.83\n84: 1.84\n85: 1.85\n86: 1.8599999999999999\n87: 1.8699999999999999\n88: 1.88\n89: 1.89"
