(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are 41 days between August 21, 2024, and October 1, 2024. The outcome will be resolved at most within this period.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, Ukraine holds territory in Kursk Oblast, with control over dozens of towns and settlements reported as recently as August 13–14, 2024[2][5]. If the front lines and control remain stable, the question will resolve **No** (Ukraine does *not* withdraw before October 1, 2024).

(c) **Scenario leading to a No outcome:**  
Ukrainian forces continue to hold at least some territory in Kursk Oblast through October 1, 2024, with neither DeepStateMap nor ISW showing a complete Russian recapture of the area by that date. Even if the incursion stalls or both sides settle into positional warfare, as long as Ukraine holds any territory, the question resolves No.

(d) **Scenario leading to a Yes outcome:**  
Russian forces recapture all Ukrainian-held territory in Kursk Oblast before October 1, 2024, with either DeepStateMap or ISW updating their maps or reporting to reflect Ukraine’s absence from the region, even briefly. This could result from a concerted Russian counteroffensive, Ukrainian withdrawal (voluntary or forced), or a negotiated pullback.

## Rationale

### Weight of Status Quo

- Ukraine has established control over a substantial area inside Kursk Oblast as of mid-August 2024, with multiple sources confirming the presence of regular Ukrainian units and significant territorial gains[2][5].
- As of the last reporting, the situation had "stabilized," and Ukraine appears to be leveraging its presence for both tactical and diplomatic reasons—using the hold as a bargaining chip and to change the war's narrative[3].
- Ukrainian leadership, including President Zelensky, has publicly emphasized the importance and symbolism of the Kursk incursion[3].

### Russian Counteroffensive Capability

- Russia has begun redirecting more capable units, including elements from Kharkiv and Kherson, into Kursk in response to the incursion[1][4].
- Analysts highlight that Russia retains numerical and logistical advantages in the region and that the operation is “militarily fraught with risk” for Ukraine[3][4].
- The operation risks overextending Ukrainian positions and resources, especially if Russia commits significant reinforcements[3][4].

### Operational Sustainability and Uncertainties

- The advance has slowed, and Ukrainian forces face mounting logistical challenges as Russia consolidates its response[1][3][4].
- However, it is not yet evident that Ukraine is preparing to withdraw or is at imminent risk of collapse in the region. Both sides appear to be settling into a more static front, at least for now[5].
- Ukraine’s willingness to use Kursk territory as negotiation leverage, and the potential for international attention and support, suggest Kyiv may be incentivized to hold out at least until a key moment or shift in the strategic picture[3][5].

### Forecaster’s Perspective

- The world—and especially entrenched front lines—tend to change slowly absent major new factors.
- The current status, with Ukraine holding territory and reinforcing its strategic purpose, suggests the default (status quo) is that withdrawal will not occur before October 1, unless there is a decisive new Russian assault or a strategic decision by Ukraine to pull out.

## Probability Estimate

- Given the stabilization of lines, Ukrainian intent to use its presence for strategic and diplomatic purposes, and no evidence of an imminent collapse, the most likely scenario is continued Ukrainian presence in some part of Kursk Oblast through at least October 1, 2024.
- Russian capabilities for rapid recapture exist, but a major counteroffensive would require time, and there is no indication as of August 21 that it is about to succeed imminently.

**Probability: 75%**  
(Ukraine will **not** withdraw from Kursk Oblast before October 1, 2024)
