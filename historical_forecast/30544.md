(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 1 month (from November 27, 2024, to December 30, 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the latest available data, the Supreme Court's approval rating was 42% as of June 2023, which is just above the 41.0% threshold needed for a "Yes" outcome.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: The Court issues unpopular decisions in the fall 2024 term, causing approval to drop below 41.0%. Post-election tensions, particularly if there are controversial election-related cases, could further erode public confidence in the Court, especially among certain demographic groups.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: The partisan gap continues to narrow as observed after previous elections, with Democratic approval of the Court continuing to recover somewhat. The Court avoids highly controversial decisions in the early part of its 2024-2025 term, and the post-election period brings a normalization of political tensions.

The Supreme Court's approval rating has shown interesting patterns over the past few years. As of June 2023, the Court's approval rating stood at 42%, which is above the 41.0% threshold needed for a "Yes" outcome[1]. This represents a recovery from the low point of 39% following the Dobbs decision in 2022[1].

When forecasting the Court's approval rating for December 30, 2024, it's crucial to consider both the stability and volatility in these numbers. While the net approval rating (approval minus disapproval) has fluctuated dramatically, the actual approval percentage has remained relatively stable between 39-42% in recent years[1]. This suggests a certain resilience in the base level of support for the Court.

The search results don't provide specific approval ratings for 2024, but they do mention significant partisan dynamics that affect the Court's overall standing. Between early 2021 and September 2022, a large partisan gap developed in Court approval, reaching 39 percentage points during the midterm season[1]. Interestingly, this gap narrowed to about 25 points after the midterms, primarily due to a 10-point increase in Democratic approval[1].

This pattern is particularly relevant for our forecast, as December 2024 falls after the presidential election. If the post-2022 midterm pattern repeats, we might see some moderation in partisan views of the Court following the 2024 election, potentially supporting approval ratings at or above 41.0%.

However, we must account for the status quo bias - the tendency for conditions to remain stable unless there are strong forces for change. The Court's approval rating has demonstrated remarkable stability in the 39-42% range despite significant shifts in disapproval rates and net approval[1]. This suggests that barring major new controversies, the approval rating might remain close to where it was last measured.

Without more recent data on the Court's approval rating through 2024, I have to base my forecast primarily on the patterns observed through June 2023. The last measured approval rating (42%) exceeds our threshold, and the historical stability in this measure suggests it might remain above 41.0% absent major disruptions.

Probability: 65%
