(a) Time left until outcome: 4 days (May 6, 2025 to September 10, 2024 - this is actually in the past from our current date)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on available information as of September 4, 2024, the winner has not been announced. According to search results, Jung Kook featuring Latto with "Seven" is the WINNER of the Best K-Pop category[3].

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The current search results indicating Jung Kook as the winner are accurate and official, meaning Lisa's "Rockstar" did not win the Best K-Pop award at the 2024 MTV VMAs.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The search results are incorrect, preliminary, or outdated, and Lisa's "Rockstar" actually won the Best K-Pop award when officially announced at the September 10, 2024 ceremony.

Looking at the available information, there are several key points to consider in my forecast:

First, according to the search results, Jung Kook featuring Latto with "Seven" is explicitly listed as the WINNER for Best K-Pop[3]. This is stated clearly in what appears to be official MTV voting results.

Additionally, while Lisa's "Rockstar" received multiple nominations across different categories (Best Choreography, Best Editing, Best K-Pop, and Best Art Direction)[5], this widespread recognition doesn't necessarily translate to winning in any specific category.

The search results also mention that Stray Kids won their first VMA for Best K-Pop[2], though this might be referring to a different year. However, this creates some conflicting information about who actually won.

Given that today's date (May 6, 2025) is well after the scheduled ceremony (September 10, 2024), the outcome should already be known. The most direct evidence we have points to Jung Kook with "Seven" as the winner.

Considering the status quo information provided in the search results, and giving greatest weight to the explicit statement of Jung Kook as the winner, I must conclude that "Rockstar" by Lisa did not win the Best K-Pop award at the 2024 MTV VMAs.

Probability: 5%
