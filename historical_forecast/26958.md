(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome of this question will be known by October 1, 2024, which is approximately 8 weeks from today (August 7, 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: Currently, YouTube remains accessible in Russia, though with degraded performance due to throttling measures implemented by Russian authorities in July 2024.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Russia continues throttling YouTube but stops short of a complete ban, using the degraded service as leverage to negotiate with Google. YouTube makes some concessions to comply with Russian laws, particularly regarding content removal, allowing the platform to remain technically accessible despite severe limitations.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Following the current trajectory of performance degradation, Russia fully bans YouTube in September 2024 as reported in some sources. This follows the pattern seen with other Western platforms like Facebook and Twitter, with Russian authorities citing YouTube's continued non-compliance with local laws and its "anti-Russian policy."

As a professional forecaster, I recognize that analyzing this question requires balancing the strong signals pointing toward a ban against the tendency for status quo to persist.

The evidence suggesting YouTube will be banned before October 1, 2024, is substantial. Russian authorities have already begun throttling YouTube speeds, with plans to reduce performance by up to 70%[5]. Officials have explicitly warned that "nothing good awaits" YouTube if it doesn't change its policies[5]. Most tellingly, there are reports indicating the Russian government plans to block YouTube by September 2024[4], which falls within our timeframe.

However, I should give significant weight to the status quo. YouTube has remained accessible in Russia despite expectations it would be banned after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It has survived while other major platforms like Facebook and Twitter were blocked. YouTube's position as "the last bastion of free expression" with over 93 million Russian users[3] creates a higher threshold for action than with other platforms.

Several factors suggest Russia might hesitate to implement a full ban:

1. YouTube's massive popularity in Russia (93 million users) makes a ban politically risky
2. Technical challenges in completely blocking such a data-intensive platform
3. The value YouTube provides for Russian content creators and businesses

That said, recent actions demonstrate Russia's increasing willingness to isolate its internet space. The deliberate choice to degrade YouTube during summer vacation periods suggests a strategic approach to minimizing initial backlash[5]. Russian authorities are actively developing domestic alternatives like Rutube and VK Video[5], which typically precedes banning foreign platforms.

The explicit statements about YouTube's future being dependent on its compliance with Russian laws, combined with YouTube's consistent pattern of removing content that violates its own policies rather than bending to government demands, creates a direct collision course.

Given the acceleration of restrictions, official statements about September timing, and Russia's established pattern with other platforms, I believe the probability of a YouTube ban before October 1, 2024, is higher than 50% but still uncertain due to YouTube's unique position and large user base in Russia.

Probability: 65%
