# Time to Outcome, Status Quo, and Unexpected Scenarios

(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** 
The question asks about February 2025 Mediterranean migrant arrivals. Today is May 6, 2025, so the outcome period has already passed. The data should be available now through the UNHCR Mediterranean Refugees/Migrants Data Portal, though there may be some reporting lag.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**
Based on the most recent data provided, if trends from early 2024 continued, we would expect around 12,000-13,000 total arrivals across all Mediterranean routes in February 2025. This combines the approximately 2,150 monthly arrivals on the Central Mediterranean route, 6,050 on the Western African route, and 4,575 on the Eastern Mediterranean route from early 2024.

(c) **Scenario resulting in an unexpected outcome:**
An unexpected surge could have occurred if:
- Sudden escalation of conflicts in source regions (Syria, sub-Saharan Africa)
- Unusually favorable weather conditions across Mediterranean routes in February 2025
- Collapse or significant weakening of border enforcement agreements with transit countries
- Political instability in key North African countries leading to reduced migration control

# Analysis and Rationale

Looking at the available data, there are several important factors to consider for February 2025 arrivals.

## Historical Pattern Analysis

The UNHCR data shows a significant decline in sea arrivals to Italy, with 2024 figures (66,617) being substantially lower than 2023 (157,651)[1]. This represents a 58% decrease year-over-year. The research assistant noted that the Central Mediterranean route saw a sharp decline in early 2024, with only about 2,150 arrivals per month.

February typically sees lower migration numbers due to winter sea conditions, which would likely reduce numbers even further from monthly averages.

## Route Shifts and Overall Trends

While the Central Mediterranean route showed significant decreases, the Eastern Mediterranean route to Greece increased by 27% during 2024, and the Western Africa/Atlantic route to the Canary Islands increased by 16%[5]. This suggests a significant shift in migration patterns rather than an overall decrease.

Total arrivals in Europe declined in 2024 to 199,200, down from 270,700 in 2023[5]. This represents a 26.4% decrease year-over-year.

## Policy Context

The implementation of the New European Migration Pact and increased border enforcement efforts likely continued to suppress overall arrival numbers. The ongoing rightward shift in European politics has maintained pressure for restrictive migration policies.

## February-Specific Considerations

February is historically one of the lowest months for Mediterranean migration due to poor weather conditions. Looking at historical patterns, February numbers tend to be 30-50% below annual monthly averages.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Weighing these factors, and giving appropriate weight to status quo projections while accounting for uncertainty:

**0-10,000:** There is a strong possibility that February 2025 saw very low numbers due to the combination of winter conditions and continued policy restrictions. The sharp decline in Central Mediterranean arrivals throughout 2024, combined with typically low February numbers, makes this a very plausible outcome. However, the increases in Eastern Mediterranean and Western African routes somewhat offset this likelihood.

**10,001-15,000:** This represents a continuation of the combined route numbers from early 2024, adjusting slightly for February's typical seasonal decrease. The research assistant's estimate of around 12,775 monthly arrivals across all routes aligns with this range, and the status quo deserves significant weight.

**15,001-20,000:** This would represent a moderate increase from early 2024 trends. While less likely given the overall downward trend in 2024, route shifts and potential new developments could have pushed numbers into this range.

**20,001 or more:** This would require a significant deviation from 2024 trends, perhaps due to a major geopolitical event or collapse of migration agreements. While possible, this outcome has the lowest probability given available information.

Option_A: 0-10,000: 45%
Option_B: 10,001-15,000: 40%
Option_C: 15,001-20,000: 10%
Option_D: 20,001 or more: 5%
