(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of November 29, 2024, there are just over 32 days remaining until January 1, 2025, when the question will resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If SpaceX continues recent behavior, there will be no new posts on the Updates page before January 1, 2025. The last post was on September 10, 2024, resulting in over two months of inactivity, with no indication of imminent updates.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" occurs if at least one new post appears on the SpaceX Updates page, timestamped after this question closes and before January 1, 2025, or if the Updates page is inaccessible when checked for resolution. This could happen if SpaceX publishes an official recap or announcement, for example, following a major launch, milestone, or organizational update, or if the site experiences downtime at the time of verification.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" occurs if no new post appears on the SpaceX Updates page, and the page remains accessible through the resolution window. This is the default if SpaceX maintains its current posting pattern of infrequent updates and the site remains live.

## Rationale

Recent historical patterns show that SpaceX's Updates page is updated infrequently, even during periods of major activity[1]. Despite a busy launch manifest—21 more launches are targeted before the end of the year, including the high-profile SXM-9 mission on December 5, 2024—recent practice has been to publicize launches and milestones primarily through other channels such as X (formerly Twitter), NASA blogs, and press releases[4]. The last Updates post was over two months ago, and there is no evidence of a policy shift or event likely to prompt a sudden increase in Updates page activity in the next month.

The main risk to the "Yes" outcome is twofold:
- Unpredictable posting: SpaceX could always choose to highlight a significant event, such as a Starship test or a year-end summary.
- Website accessibility: If the Updates page is down at the time of resolution, the outcome is an automatic "No," regardless of actual posting behavior.

Good forecasting practice emphasizes the status quo, particularly when an organization has a stable pattern. Unless a particular event is unusually newsworthy—such as a historic launch or major technical milestone—there is little reason to expect deviation from this established pattern.

## Final Forecast

Given the status quo of infrequent updates, absence of signals for a change, and the modest but real chance of site downtime, the probability that SpaceX fails to make any new posts on its Updates page before January 1, 2025, is moderately high but must be discounted slightly for "No" risk factors.

Probability: 80%
