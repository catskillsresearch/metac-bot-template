(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Tesla is expected to report Q3 2024 deliveries around October 2, 2024, which is approximately two and a half months from now.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current trends persist and there are no significant changes in demand, production, or external conditions, Tesla's Q3 deliveries would likely remain near the Q2 2024 level of 443,956 vehicles.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome (Q3 2024 deliveries ≤ 443,956) occurs if Tesla faces continued or renewed demand softness, inventory constraints, or supply chain/logistics disruptions. This scenario is supported by the fact that Tesla's Q2 2024 deliveries already required drawing down inventory as production lagged behind deliveries, and there are no major new product launches, factory expansions, or strong demand signals for Q3. Historically, Q3 deliveries in 2023 were actually lower than Q2 2023, indicating risk of Q3 softness even after a Q2 rebound[2][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome (Q3 2024 deliveries > 443,956) would require either a substantial increase in demand, improved logistics, or new incentives to boost sales. This could be triggered by deeper price cuts, strategic promotions, or a positive shift in macroeconomic factors that increases EV demand. It might also occur if Tesla manages to ramp up production and convert existing interest (possibly through end-of-quarter pushes) without further depleting inventory.

## Rationale

Recent history shows high quarter-to-quarter volatility in Tesla's deliveries[2]. The Q2 2024 rebound (+57,000 units vs Q1) was notable but partly fueled by inventory drawdown—Q2 deliveries exceeded production by around 33,000 vehicles[2]. Without new product launches, factory ramp-ups, or clear demand catalysts for Q3 2024, repeating or growing upon Q2’s strong performance appears challenging. Analysts express skepticism about demand growth sustaining quarterly delivery gains, especially in a context of ongoing price cuts and margin pressures[5]. 

Historically, Tesla’s Q3 results have sometimes lagged Q2—Q3 2023 saw a drop in deliveries relative to Q2 2023. This seasonal and operational variability, combined with the lack of fresh catalysts, tilts the odds toward the status quo or a mild decline for Q3 2024. Unless there is a material change in demand or Tesla implements aggressive measures to boost sales and production, the most likely outcome is a “No” (deliveries do not exceed Q2).

## Probability Forecast

**Probability: 45%**

(A bit below even odds, slightly favoring "No," reflecting the combination of Q2’s inventory-driven outperformance, lack of new Q3 tailwinds, and historical delivery volatility[2][5].)
