(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be known on September 30, 2024. As today is August 20, 2024, there are about 6 weeks (approximately 1.5 months) remaining.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of July 15, 2024, there were 167 measles cases reported in the United States for 2024. If the recent pace of new case reporting continues—with 46 new cases in about 3 months since April 11—total cases by September 30 would likely fall short of 300.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
No major new outbreaks occur, and the current, relatively slow rise in cases persists. If cases increase at the late spring/summer rate (about 15–16 new cases per month), the number will reach around 200–220 cases by September 30, which is well below 300.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
One or more large outbreaks are seeded, or there is a significant uptick due to international travel or further spread in under-vaccinated communities. If more than 130 cases are added over the next 1.5 months (over 85 cases per month), the total reported cases could surpass 300.

## Rationale

- The current rate of increase is slow. Between April 11 and July 15 (three months), 46 additional cases were reported, averaging about 15 cases/month.
- To reach 300 cases by September 30, an additional 133 cases are needed in 1.5 months, which requires a major acceleration to nearly 90 cases/month—far above the recent trend.
- Historically, large surges can occur if outbreaks spread in undervaccinated groups, but these are rare and often trigger intensive public health interventions that limit spread[1][2].
- The U.S. has already had more outbreaks than in recent years (16 by July)[2], but containment measures and strong routine immunization coverage generally blunt extended exponential spread.
- The majority (69%) of 2024 cases are outbreak-associated, indicating clusters continue, but none have propelled national numbers close to 300 in such a short time frame so far[2].

Given the observed trajectory and historical containment effectiveness, the most likely outcome is that total reported cases by September 30, 2024, will remain under 300.

**Probability: 10%**
