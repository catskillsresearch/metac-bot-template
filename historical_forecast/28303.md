(a) Time until outcome: 10 days (from September 20 to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the most recent data, the national average retail price for regular gasoline is trending downward. If this trend continues without disruption, prices would likely fall below $3.10 by September 30.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Continuing decline in gasoline prices due to post-summer demand reduction, adequate supply, and stable crude oil prices. With no major supply disruptions, prices continue their downward trajectory, falling below the $3.10 threshold by September 30.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: An unexpected supply shock occurs, such as a hurricane affecting Gulf Coast refineries or a geopolitical event disrupting oil markets, causing a rapid increase in prices. Alternatively, a sudden spike in demand or production cuts could push prices above the $3.10 threshold.

The available search results provide several insights into gasoline price trends and forecasts relevant to our question about whether the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will exceed $3.10 on September 30, 2024.

According to the most recent data from April 2024, the national average price of regular gas was $3.62 per gallon, which was $0.02 higher than the same time in 2023[2]. However, more recent reporting from June 2024 indicates that the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) had revised its outlook for retail gasoline prices, projecting an average of $3.42 per gallon for 2024[5].

The search results don't provide a specific forecast for September 30, 2024. However, we can extrapolate from broader energy market forecasts. The EIA's September 2024 Short-Term Energy Outlook suggests that while Brent crude oil prices are expected to rise from $74 per barrel in early September to an average of $82 per barrel by December 2024[1], this doesn't necessarily translate directly to immediate retail gasoline price increases.

It's worth noting that gasoline prices typically decline after the summer driving season ends in September. The EIA's January 2024 forecast expected average U.S. retail gasoline prices to decrease in 2024 due to increased inventories related to expanded refinery capacity[4]. This seasonal pattern, combined with the EIA's generally more moderate price outlook for 2024, suggests downward pressure on prices during September.

The search results also indicate that U.S. crude oil production is expected to reach record levels in both 2024 and 2025, with production forecasted at 13.24 million barrels per day in 2024[5]. Increased domestic production generally helps moderate gasoline prices, all else being equal.

While the Gas (GAS) price prediction table in search result [3] shows an average price of $3.11 for September and $3.35 for October, it's important to note this appears to be referring to a cryptocurrency called GAS, not retail gasoline, so this particular data point isn't relevant to our forecast.

Considering these factors together, the evidence suggests retail gasoline prices may remain relatively stable or trend slightly downward as we approach September 30, 2024. The EIA's forecast of $3.42 per gallon for 2024 provides a reference point, though actual prices on any specific date will be influenced by numerous market factors and can deviate from annual averages.

Given the limited time horizon (10 days until the outcome date), significant price movements would require unexpected market disruptions. The most likely scenario is that prices will continue their normal seasonal declining pattern into late September, potentially pushing the national average below $3.10. However, unforeseen supply disruptions (such as refinery outages or geopolitical events) could still cause price spikes.

Weighing these factors and considering the status quo bias, I assess that there's approximately a 40% probability that the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will be greater than $3.10 on September 30, 2024, according to AAA.

Probability: 40%
