As a professional forecaster interviewing for this position, I'll analyze the likelihood of Democrats having a brokered convention in 2024.

(a) Time until outcome is known: The Democratic virtual roll call vote will occur before the in-person convention that begins on August 19, 2024. Based on the current date (May 6, 2025), this outcome is already determined, but I'll analyze as if forecasting from July 2024 when these search results were current.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: President Biden would secure the nomination on the first ballot with his 99% of pledged delegates.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Biden remains in the race, the virtual roll call proceeds as planned, and his overwhelming delegate advantage allows him to secure the nomination on the first ballot despite concerns about his debate performance.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Following intense pressure after the debate, Biden withdraws before the nomination process is complete. Thousands of delegates become uncommitted, leading to multiple rounds of voting as they realign behind various candidates with no single alternative securing a majority on the first ballot.

Looking at the evidence, several factors strongly suggest a No outcome:

President Biden has secured approximately 99% of the pledged delegates, creating an overwhelming mathematical advantage[3]. For a brokered convention to occur, thousands of delegates who are pledged to Biden would need to simultaneously revolt against him[3]. This level of coordinated defection would be unprecedented in modern political history.

The Democratic Party has implemented a process that further reduces the likelihood of a brokered convention by planning to hold the presidential roll call vote virtually, before the in-person convention begins on August 19[3]. This early, virtual format diminishes the possibility of delegate rebellion or floor fights that might occur in an in-person setting.

As election law expert Derek Muller noted: "I think it's just deeply unlikely that it would result in anyone except Biden. Again, I think it really would take him voluntarily stepping down, for most â€” for any of these serious scenarios to play out realistically."[3]

While there was significant concern following Biden's debate performance, the path to a brokered convention remains extremely narrow. For it to occur, Biden would likely need to voluntarily withdraw, leaving many delegates uncommitted[3]. Even in this scenario, party leaders would likely work to consolidate support behind a single alternative to avoid the divisiveness and chaos of a contested convention[1][2].

The status quo strongly favors a first-ballot nomination. Biden retains control of the party apparatus, has nearly all delegates pledged to him, and the nomination process has been structured to minimize potential disruption. Historical precedent also supports this conclusion - the last Democratic brokered convention occurred in 1952, and parties have generally avoided them due to their potentially damaging effects.

While concerns about Biden's debate performance created some uncertainty, the institutional and procedural barriers to a brokered convention remain formidable. The most plausible path would require Biden's voluntary withdrawal, which appears unlikely based on his public statements and continued support from key Democratic figures.

Probability: 5%
