(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known after April 1, 2025, when Metaculus checks the NUFORC database for reports from March 2025. This means we have less than a month until March ends, and then a few more days until the verification occurs.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the available search results, there's no clear indication of regular pilot UFO reports from South America in the NUFORC database. The status quo appears to be that NUFORC primarily collects and reports UFO sightings from the United States, though they do accept worldwide reports.

(c) No outcome scenario: No South American pilots report UFO sightings to NUFORC during March 2025, or if they do, these reports aren't published on the NUFORC website by April 1, 2025. This could happen because South American pilots may be less familiar with NUFORC, may report to local agencies instead, or simply don't experience any UFO encounters in March.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: A pilot flying in South American airspace observes an unusual aerial phenomenon in March 2025, reports it to NUFORC, and the report is published on their website by April 1, 2025. Given the recent high-profile UFO/UAP reports by pilots shown in the search results, increased awareness might lead to more international pilot reports.

## Analysis of Available Evidence

The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) is indeed a repository for UFO/UAP sightings, describing itself as "the most trustworthy, transparent and respectful organization for UFO/UAP witness and experiencer reporting"[1]. They collect reports through a standardized form that requests specific details about sightings, including date, time, location, and description[2].

Looking at the available search results, I notice several important patterns:

1. **Recent pilot reports**: There is evidence of recent pilot reports in NUFORC's database, including a significant September 17, 2024 report where a Homeland Security flight encountered a "Tic-Tac UAP"[1]. This indicates pilots are actively reporting to NUFORC.

2. **Geographic distribution**: The search results show reports primarily from US locations (Oregon, North Carolina), but there's no specific mention of South American reports[3][5]. The latest update from April 28, 2024, highlights reports from North Carolina and New York, but none from South America[3].

3. **Timeline of reports**: The search results include a range of reports from different time periods, with the most recent ones from January 2025 being from Oregon, USA[5]. There's no indication of any South American reports in recent months.

4. **Current reporting trends**: The recent database update on April 28, 2024, mentioned 396 new reports received since March 13, 2024, suggesting an average of about 8-9 reports per day globally[3].

## Weighing the Probability

Given that today is March 6, 2025, we're looking at the probability of a pilot from South America reporting a UFO sighting to NUFORC during the remaining 25 days of March 2025.

Several factors decrease the likelihood:

1. The search results don't show any recent history of South American pilot reports to NUFORC.
2. Language barriers and regional differences in reporting mechanisms may make South American pilots less likely to report to a US-based organization like NUFORC.
3. There may be local South American equivalents to NUFORC that receive such reports instead.

However, factors that increase the likelihood include:

1. NUFORC has a global reach and accepts worldwide reports.
2. The commercial aviation industry is international, and pilots worldwide may be aware of NUFORC.
3. High-profile pilot reports in recent months (e.g., the September 2024 Homeland Security flight incident) may increase awareness and reporting rates among pilots globally.

Considering the status quo (apparent lack of South American pilot reports in the NUFORC database) as the strongest baseline, but acknowledging that NUFORC does receive worldwide reports and pilot reports specifically, I estimate a relatively low probability of a South American pilot UFO report in March 2025.

Probability: 15%
