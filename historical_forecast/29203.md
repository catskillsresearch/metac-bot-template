(a) Time left until outcome: 2 months and 6 days (from October 25, 2024 to January 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: "No" - China does not announce additional metal export restrictions before January 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario for a "No" outcome: China decides to evaluate the impact of its recent antimony and rare earth export restrictions before implementing additional controls. Diplomatic efforts between China and Western countries reduce tensions, or China focuses on domestic economic challenges rather than escalating trade conflicts.

(d) Scenario for a "Yes" outcome: In response to ongoing Western technology restrictions or as part of its strategic materials policy, China announces export controls on tungsten or other critical metals where it holds significant market share, continuing its pattern of using resource dominance as leverage.

China has established a clear pattern of imposing export restrictions on strategically important metals over the past two years. Based on the search results and available information as of October 25, 2024, China has implemented export controls on several critical metals, including gallium and germanium in 2023, graphite in late 2023, antimony in September 2024, and rare earth technology in October 2024[1][2][3].

This pattern suggests a strategic approach by China to leverage its dominance in critical mineral supply chains. Each of these actions appears calculated, typically coming in response to Western restrictions on technology exports to China or as part of China's broader strategy to protect what it considers national security interests.

Several factors suggest additional restrictions before January 1, 2025 are reasonably likely:

1. **Established pattern**: China has announced new metal export restrictions approximately every 6-8 months since mid-2023, with the most recent being the October 2024 rare earth restrictions[3]. This timing would put another announcement within the window before January 1, 2025.

2. **Strategic leverage**: China has shown willingness to use its dominant position in critical minerals as leverage in geopolitical disputes, particularly in response to Western technology restrictions.

3. **Available targets**: China has significant market control over several other critical metals not yet subject to export restrictions, such as tungsten, which would be logical next targets.

However, several countervailing factors suggest restraint:

1. **Economic considerations**: Export restrictions can harm Chinese producers and the domestic economy, potentially making China hesitant to expand controls too rapidly.

2. **Recent implementation**: With two major restrictions (antimony and rare earths) implemented in just the past two months, China may wait to assess their impact before announcing additional controls.

3. **Diplomatic calculations**: China may be calibrating its response to avoid excessive escalation of trade tensions, particularly during a period of potential transition or change in U.S. policy.

4. **Status quo bias**: Most complex policy decisions, especially those with international implications, tend to move more slowly than analysts predict. The default state is often continuation of current policies rather than rapid changes.

While China has demonstrated a willingness to implement export controls on critical metals, the recent implementation of two significant restrictions (antimony in September and rare earths in October) suggests they might observe the market impact before making additional announcements. The relatively short timeframe remaining (just over 2 months) further reduces the likelihood of another announcement before January 1, 2025.
