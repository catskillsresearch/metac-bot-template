Based on the search results and current information available, I'll provide my analysis for this forecasting question.

(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known by January 1, 2025, which is approximately 7-8 weeks from now (as today is May 6, 2025, according to your date, though I note this appears to be incorrect as we're discussing events from November 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changes, the outcome would be "No" as no appointment has been announced yet for JD Vance's Senate seat.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Governor DeWine chooses someone other than Matt Dolan or Jane Timken, such as Frank LaRose or a candidate with no political experience, which DeWine has indicated he wouldn't rule out. Alternatively, DeWine delays his decision until after January 1, 2025.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Governor DeWine announces either Matt Dolan or Jane Timken as his choice before January 1, 2025, potentially influenced by their prior political experience, existing relationships within the Republican party, or their electoral viability for the 2026 special election.

## Rationale

Looking at the available evidence, there are several factors to consider in this forecast:

Both Matt Dolan and Jane Timken appear to be serious contenders for the appointment. Matt Dolan has explicitly told WOSU that he's seeking the appointment to fill Vance's vacancy, stating "I still have the fire in the belly to serve Ohioans, and I think I can do a good job in the U.S. Senate"[1]. Governor DeWine previously endorsed Dolan in the last U.S. Senate Republican primary, where Dolan finished second to Bernie Moreno[2].

Jane Timken is also frequently mentioned as a potential appointee. She has a good relationship with institutional Republicans like Rob Portman while also appealing to MAGA-aligned conservatives[2]. Her appointment would be historically significant as she would be the first female U.S. Senator in Ohio history[2].

However, Governor DeWine appears to be keeping his options open. While he endorsed Dolan in the previous primary, he's "keeping his cards close on this appointment"[1]. DeWine has also indicated he "wouldn't rule out" appointing someone with no political experience, suggesting he's considering a wide range of candidates[4].

The timeline suggests DeWine will likely make his choice before the end of 2024, as "a resignation before the new class of senators takes office helps a new senator get seniority over the elected ones"[4]. This aligns with our January 1, 2025 deadline.

The status quo currently favors a "No" outcome since no decision has been announced. While both Dolan and Timken are clearly in the running, there appear to be other candidates under consideration as well. Frank LaRose is mentioned in the search results[2], and DeWine's openness to candidates without political experience further expands the field of potential appointees.

It's also worth noting that DeWine seems to be prioritizing someone who could effectively compete in the 2026 special election, which may favor experienced politicians like Dolan or Timken, but could also lead him to consider other factors or candidates.

Weighing all these considerations and giving appropriate weight to the status quo (no announcement yet and multiple candidates in consideration), I believe there is a moderate but not overwhelming probability that either Dolan or Timken will be appointed.

Probability: 65%
