Based on the current date (May 6, 2025), I'll analyze the question about September 2024 Atlantic hurricanes from a retrospective view, as this time period has already passed.

(a) Time until outcome is known: This outcome is already known, as September 2024 has passed (it's now May 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: According to the search results, by late August 2024, there had been five named storms, three hurricanes, and one major hurricane (Beryl, which was a Category 5)[4]. The search results don't specifically state how many major hurricanes occurred in September 2024.

(c) No outcome scenario: Less than or more than exactly 3 major hurricanes formed in September 2024. This could have happened if conditions changed from the forecasted pattern, such as unexpected wind shear developing, Saharan dust inhibiting formation (which was noted as being "remarkably intense" at times)[4], or if most major hurricane activity happened before or after September.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Exactly 3 major hurricanes formed during September 2024. Given the forecasts of an above-normal season with potentially 4 major hurricanes total for the season (per TSR)[3] and the fact that September typically produces over 60% of major hurricanes in a season[4], this was certainly possible.

Looking at the available evidence retrospectively:

The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season was widely predicted to be above-normal by multiple forecasting agencies. NOAA forecasted 17-25 named storms and 8-13 hurricanes for the 2024 season[1]. Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) specifically predicted 4 major hurricanes for the entire 2024 season[3].

September is historically the most active month for major hurricane development, with an average September producing over 60% of a season's major hurricanes according to Fox Weather[4]. This would suggest that if TSR's prediction of 4 major hurricanes was accurate, we might expect about 2-3 of them to occur in September.

However, the search results also indicate that as of late August 2024, activity had been "relatively quiet" and behind the average pace, though the strength of systems had been ahead of schedule with one major hurricane (Beryl) already having occurred[4]. The month was predicted to "start out as quiet as August ended," though warm water temperatures remained favorable for development[4].

The search results don't provide specific data on how many major hurricanes actually occurred in September 2024, which would be available in the National Hurricane Center's Tropical Cyclone Reports[5].

Given the seasonal forecasts predicting 4 major hurricanes total, the historical tendency for September to produce the majority of major hurricanes, but also factoring in the noted quieter-than-expected activity through August, I would estimate the probability of exactly 3 major hurricanes having occurred in September 2024 to be moderate.

Probability: 35%
