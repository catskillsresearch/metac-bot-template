(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known on November 29, 2024, which is 18 days from today (November 11, 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the most recent data available, the total US rig count is 613 rigs as of April 26, 2024, with 506 oil rigs, 105 gas rigs, and 2 miscellaneous rigs (implied from other counts)[5]. This is well above the 585-590 range in question.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The rig count continues its recent downward trend (down 142 rigs or 18.8% year-over-year as of April 2024)[5], potentially driven by further declines in gas prices (which were down 35% in 2024 so far)[5]. Alternatively, the count could increase beyond 590 due to stabilization in oil markets and continued high oil prices (up 16% in 2024)[5], pushing operators to deploy additional rigs.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The downward trend in rig count continues at a measured pace from the April 2024 level of 613, bringing it to the 585-590 range by November 29. This could be driven by continuing industry consolidation, emphasis on capital discipline, and efficiency improvements allowing companies to maintain production with fewer rigs.

As a professional forecaster, I need to assess whether the US drilling rig count will fall within the narrow range of 585-590 on November 29, 2024. This requires careful examination of recent trends and underlying factors.

## Current Situation and Recent Trends

As of April 26, 2024, the total US rig count stood at 613, which includes 506 oil rigs, 105 gas rigs, and 2 miscellaneous rigs (implied)[5]. This represents a significant decline of 142 rigs (18.8%) compared to the same time last year[5]. The April 2024 count is the lowest since February 2022, showing a clear downward trend[5].

In the most recent week reported, the rig count fell by 6, with oil rigs down by 5 and gas rigs down by 1[5]. April 2024 saw the total rig count decline for a second consecutive month, with the oil rig count unchanged and gas rigs falling by 7 for the month[5].

## Historical Context and Industry Dynamics

The oil and gas rig count dropped approximately 20% in 2023 after rising 33% in 2022 and 67% in 2021[5]. This decline occurred despite oil prices rising 16% in 2024 (as of April), following an 11% drop in 2023[5]. Gas prices, meanwhile, fell about 35% in 2024 (as of April), after plunging 44% in 2023[5].

The decline in rig count despite rising oil prices can be attributed to several factors:
- Higher labor and equipment costs due to inflation
- Companies prioritizing debt reduction and shareholder returns over production increases
- Industry consolidation leading to operational efficiencies

## Forecast Considerations

To determine whether the rig count will land in the 585-590 range by November 29, 2024, I need to consider:

1. **Trend projection**: The rig count has been declining steadily, down from 779 in December 2022 to 622 in December 2023[1], and further to 613 by April 2024[5]. If this trend continues at a similar rate, the count could indeed approach the target range by November.

2. **Oil price influence**: Oil prices were up 16% in 2024 as of April[5], which typically supports drilling activity. However, companies have shown restraint in deploying new rigs despite favorable prices, focusing instead on efficiency and returns.

3. **Gas price weakness**: Gas prices were down 35% in 2024 as of April[5], which puts pressure on gas-directed drilling. The gas rig count fell to 105 in April 2024, the lowest since December 2021[5].

4. **Industry consolidation**: Mergers and acquisitions typically lead to rig count reductions as companies eliminate redundancies and focus on the most productive assets.

5. **Seasonal factors**: Winter weather in November could potentially affect rig deployment decisions, though this is typically more impactful for Canadian operations than US operations.

## Status Quo Bias Consideration

The current rig count of 613 (as of April 2024) is 23 rigs above the upper limit of the target range. For the count to fall into the 585-590 range, it would need to decline by 23-28 rigs over approximately seven months. Given that the count fell by 6 in just one week in April[5], this magnitude of decline is certainly possible but not guaranteed.

The industry has shown a tendency toward restraint in deploying new rigs, even with favorable oil prices, suggesting the downward pressure on rig counts may continue. However, the pace of decline has varied considerably, and the industry could stabilize at a level above the target range.

As a forecaster, I recognize that the status quo often persists, and dramatic changes are less common than incremental ones. The current trajectory suggests continued gradual decline, but whether it will land precisely in the 585-590 range involves considerable uncertainty.
