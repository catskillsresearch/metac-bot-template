(a) Time until outcome: The outcome will be known on September 29, 2025, which is approximately 14 months from now.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on current information, Bo Nix appears to be the favorite to start for the Broncos. If nothing changes, the status quo outcome would be Nix starting in Week 4.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Bo Nix struggles significantly in training camp, preseason games, or early regular season games, prompting coach Sean Payton to start either Jarrett Stidham or Zach Wilson instead. Alternatively, Nix could suffer an injury before Week 4 that prevents him from playing.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Bo Nix performs adequately in training camp and preseason, meeting the expectations of a first-round draft pick. Coach Payton follows through on apparent plans to make Nix the starter, and he remains healthy through the first four weeks of the season.

As a professional forecaster, I need to analyze the available information carefully to provide an accurate probability estimate for this question.

The Denver Broncos selected Bo Nix with the 12th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, clearly demonstrating their significant investment in him as their quarterback of the future[1][4]. This high draft position strongly suggests the team intends for him to become their starter, possibly immediately.

Several factors support Nix starting in Week 4:

First, draft capital is a strong predictor of quarterback playing time. The Broncos using the 12th pick on Nix represents substantial organizational commitment. Teams rarely keep first-round quarterbacks, especially those selected in the top half of the draft, on the bench for extended periods unless there's a clear plan for development behind an established starter.

Second, the competition doesn't appear particularly strong. After releasing Russell Wilson, the Broncos' quarterback room includes Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson, neither of whom has established themselves as reliable NFL starters[2][5]. Draft Wire analyst Natalie Miller noted that Nix "projects as the immediate starter in a Denver quarterback room that is lacking in talent outside the likes of Zach Wilson"[2].

Third, expert analysis supports this conclusion. USA Today's Nate Davis went as far as declaring Nix the leader to start this season, noting: "If you need a quarterback to start immediately — as the Broncos basically do — this could be your guy"[2]. Multiple reports indicate that Nix fits what coach Sean Payton is looking for in a quarterback[2].

Fourth, there are already strong signals from the team itself. As of June 2024, sources were claiming "The Denver Broncos have their starting quarterback in Bo Nix"[3], suggesting the decision may already be made internally.

However, several factors create uncertainty:

First, we're forecasting 14 months into the future. Many events could occur between now and September 2025 that would affect this outcome, including injuries, trades, free agent signings, or another draft.

Second, while Nix has experience (starting a record 61 games in college[5]), rookie quarterbacks often struggle with the NFL transition, which could lead to him being benched if he performs poorly early.

Third, coach Sean Payton has a history of being demanding of his quarterbacks, and if Nix doesn't meet expectations, Payton might not hesitate to make a change.

Despite these uncertainties, the weight of evidence strongly favors Nix starting in Week 4:
- His high draft status (12th overall) indicates organizational commitment
- The competition (Stidham and Wilson) has limited starting success
- Expert analysis consistently projects him as the likely starter
- The team has already signaled he will be their starter[3]

As a forecaster, I recognize that the status quo is often persistent. The Broncos have clearly positioned Nix as their presumptive starter, and absent injury or catastrophic performance issues, this is unlikely to change by Week 4 of his rookie season.

Probability: 75%
