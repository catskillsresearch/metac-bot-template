(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of February 27, 2025, there are just over 4 weeks left until April 1, 2025, when the window for an official election announcement closes.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
As of now, the Serbian ruling party (SNS) strongly hints at forming a new government with its existing parliamentary majority rather than calling snap elections[1]. The parliament has not yet confirmed the prime minister's resignation, so the formal process that could result in mandatory elections hasn’t been triggered[1][5]. If this continues, **no general election will be announced before April 1, 2025**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The parliament confirms the resignation but elects a new government within the 30-day deadline, using the current SNS majority. No snap election announcement is made, and the government proceeds without dissolving parliament or calling for new elections[1].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Parliament either fails to elect a new government within 30 days after confirming the resignation or political calculations shift (e.g., the government sees new elections as beneficial for consolidating legitimacy or control, or mass protests escalate). In this case, President Vučić would announce a snap general election before April 1, 2025[1][5].

## Rationale

The dominant signal is the government's preference for stability and using its current majority to form a new cabinet rather than risking snap elections in a period of volatility and opposition boycotts[1]. Most analysts see elections as unlikely and unhelpful for resolving the present crisis, and opposition parties are publicly refusing to participate under current conditions[1]. The government, historically comfortable with snap elections, is now "strongly hinting" at forming a new government instead[1].

However, a wildcard remains: if the parliament fails to elect a new government after confirming the resignation, the constitution obligates a snap election. But as of late February, even the first step—resignation confirmation—has not occurred, and time is short to trigger and exhaust the 30-day countdown before the April 1 deadline[1][5].

President Vučić explicitly kept the door open for elections, but this appears more a negotiating tactic than a probable path, especially given the party's advantages in parliament and the opposition's refusal to participate[1][5].

Given these facts, the **status quo (No announcement)** scenario deserves extra weight, especially as Serbian politics often favor continuity unless forced by procedural or external shocks.

**Probability: 25%**  
The risk of a late forced election announcement exists, but the most likely outcome is that no general election is announced before April 1, 2025, barring an unexpected political development or procedural failure to form a government.
