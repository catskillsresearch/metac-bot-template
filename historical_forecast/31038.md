(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of December 13, 2024, there are 18 calendar days until the close of trading on December 31, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
JPMorgan’s base case, published in October 2024, put their CSI 300 end-2024 target at 3,900–3,970, below the 4,150 threshold[2]. The index experienced a notable rally followed by a pullback and had not reached 4,150 by mid-December. If current conditions persist without major positive shifts, it is likely to close below 4,150.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (CSI 300 closes below 4,150):**  
If economic momentum remains soft, government stimulus is perceived as insufficient or slow to materialize, and global/investor sentiment continues to be muted, the CSI 300 could remain range-bound or drift lower. Persisting concerns about growth, property sector risks, and lackluster earnings would reinforce this scenario, keeping the index well below 4,150[2][4].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (CSI 300 closes at or above 4,150):**  
A decisive, positive market response could be triggered if new, large-scale fiscal or property support measures are announced and implemented effectively within the next two weeks, driving a powerful rally. Renewed foreign and domestic investor inflows, a sudden surge in risk appetite, or a significant positive surprise in economic activity or earnings could propel the index abruptly higher[2][5]. However, such a sharp move would require a rapid and dramatic change in sentiment and conditions.

## Rationale

The most reliable forecasts weigh the status quo heavily, as large, rapid shifts in markets are rare outside of major shocks. Despite aggressive policy support through 2024, the CSI 300 index has faced persistent volatility, with the most recent trend being a pullback following a dramatic rally earlier in the year[3][5]. This pattern is consistent with historical rallies in China that often fade due to weak earnings follow-through and skepticism about the durability of policy-driven gains[2][4].

JPMorgan’s end-2024 outlook—set at 3,900–3,970—suggests that, barring a major upside surprise, the index will likely end the year below 4,150[2]. Their higher range of 4,050–4,150 is not projected until June 2025, further implying that reaching or exceeding 4,150 by December 31, 2024 would be aggressive, though not impossible[2]. While government measures tend to provide a floor to the market, they have not yet been sufficient to drive a sustainable move above the threshold.

Recent government interventions have improved long-term fundamentals and signaled a commitment to stability, but the impact is more likely to be gradual than immediate[5]. Unless extraordinary new measures are unveiled in December and spark a rapid rally, most evidence points to a finish below 4,150.

Probability: **25%**

This reflects a moderate but not negligible chance of an end-of-year rally driven by unexpected policy action or dramatic sentiment shifts, but places substantial weight on the current trend and expert consensus forecasting a lower finish.
