(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 4 months and 18 days (from May 6, 2025 to September 24, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continues his presidential campaign

(c) No outcome scenario: Kennedy maintains sufficient funding, polling strength, and ballot access momentum to justify continuing his campaign through September, positioning himself as a viable alternative to both major party candidates.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Kennedy faces insurmountable ballot access challenges, experiences a significant polling decline, or comes under intense pressure from family and political forces that convince him his candidacy primarily benefits Trump, leading him to suspend his campaign.

Looking at the available information, I need to assess the likelihood that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will suspend his 2024 presidential campaign before September 24, 2024.

## Current Campaign Status and Momentum

As of the most recent information available, Kennedy's independent presidential campaign appears to be actively pursuing ballot access across the United States. His campaign has created a political party called "We the People" to facilitate ballot access in specific states including California, Delaware, Hawaii, Mississippi, and North Carolina[5]. This strategic approach demonstrates a commitment to establishing a viable candidacy.

Kennedy's campaign website indicates a continuing active campaign with messaging focused on "Make America Healthy Again" and positioning himself as a champion who has "defended the interests of the American people by fighting the corporate contamination of our environment and institutions in Washington"[2]. The campaign appears well-organized and continues to solicit donations.

## Polling Performance and Support Base

Kennedy is demonstrating unusually strong polling for a third-party candidate. Recent polling data shows him capturing approximately 9.5% of the national popular vote, which is remarkable for an independent candidate[3]. His support appears to draw relatively equally from both Biden and Trump voters, potentially affecting both major campaigns.

Kennedy's supporters come from diverse political backgrounds - they have previously voted for both Democrats and Republicans and span different demographic and ideological groups[4]. What distinguishes his supporters is their dissatisfaction with both Trump and Biden, suggesting their support is partly a protest vote against the two-party system[4].

## Potential Impact as a Spoiler

Kennedy's campaign has the potential to significantly impact the election outcome, particularly in swing states. Both Democrats and Republicans have expressed concerns that his independent bid could draw enough disaffected voters from their parties to tip the scales in an election that could be decided by narrow margins[4].

North Carolina, a state where Kennedy has pursued ballot access, is particularly notable as it's a swing state that Democrats have won in the past[5]. His presence on the ballot in such competitive states increases his potential influence on the overall election outcome.

## Factors That Could Lead to Campaign Suspension

Several factors might potentially lead Kennedy to suspend his campaign:

1. **Ballot Access Challenges**: If Kennedy's campaign encounters significant obstacles in achieving ballot access in key states, this could diminish the rationale for continuing his campaign. The complex patchwork of state requirements presents a substantial hurdle.

2. **Financial Pressures**: The campaign website mentions campaign debt related to security costs[2]. If financial pressures mount and fundraising becomes difficult, this could force a reassessment of campaign viability.

3. **Declining Poll Numbers**: Historical patterns show that third-party candidates often perform better in polls than on Election Day, with support typically declining as the election approaches[3]. If Kennedy's polling numbers drop substantially, it might prompt a reconsideration.

4. **External Pressure**: As the election draws closer, pressure from family members (many of whom support Biden) or political allies concerned about his spoiler effect could intensify.

## Weighing the Evidence

The status quo strongly favors Kennedy continuing his campaign. His polling numbers are unusually strong for a third-party candidate, and he appears to have established a distinctive political identity that appeals to voters dissatisfied with both major parties. His campaign is actively working on ballot access across multiple states, indicating a serious commitment to seeing the race through.

While historical patterns suggest third-party support often declines as elections approach, Kennedy's current trajectory shows an active campaign with significant support. The campaign website indicates ongoing fundraising and messaging efforts without any signals of potential withdrawal.

Given that Kennedy positioned himself as an independent after initially seeking the Democratic nomination, he appears committed to offering voters an alternative outside the two-party system. His support base - voters who are dissatisfied with both Biden and Trump - gives him a unique constituency that neither major party fully captures.

## Conclusion

Considering all available evidence, the most likely outcome is that Kennedy will continue his campaign past September 24, 2024. While there are potential scenarios that could lead to suspension, the current momentum, polling strength, and campaign activity suggest he intends to remain in the race through the general election. The status quo of an active campaign appears more likely than a campaign suspension, especially given his unique positioning as an alternative to both major candidates.

Probability: 25%
