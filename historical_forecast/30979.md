(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
19 days remain until December 31, 2024, when Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List will be checked.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Based on the latest available figures cited in the question background as of December 11, 2024, Michael Jordan's net worth ($3.5 billion) exceeds Howard Schultz's ($3.4 billion). The status quo outcome is "Yes" if these figures hold[3].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would occur if, on December 31, 2024, Howard Schultz's net worth equals or surpasses Michael Jordan's according to the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List, or if their net worths are tied on that date. This could happen due to:
- Schultz experiencing a significant appreciation in the value of his Starbucks holdings or other assets.
- Jordan's net worth facing a downward revision or market-driven decrease.
- Updated Forbes data showing different valuations or correcting recent estimates.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome occurs if, on December 31, 2024, Michael Jordan's net worth remains above Howard Schultz's by any amount on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List. This is most likely if:
- Both individuals' portfolios perform similarly.
- No major news or revaluation affects their assets.
- The current ($100 million) margin is maintained or increases.

## Rationale

The weight of evidence supports the status quo, where Michael Jordan narrowly leads Howard Schultz in net worth as assessed by Forbes[3]. Jordan's wealth is diversified, primarily driven by lucrative, stable royalty streams from Nike's Jordan Brand, ongoing investment income, and proceeds from major asset sales such as the Charlotte Hornets[4][5]. There have been no recent reports of negative events or financial setbacks for Jordan in 2024[4].

Howard Schultz's wealth is largely tied to Starbucks equity, which may fluctuate day-to-day based on market performance, but there are no indications of a major upswing or catalyst in Schultz's holdings as of the latest data.

It is important to note that Forbes' estimates can shift due to asset price movements, late-year revaluations, or new public disclosures, especially given that some net worth figures differ across sources (ranging for Jordan from $2.6B[1] to $3.5B[3] in recent months). However, all recent credible sources place Jordan's net worth at or above Schultz's, with the most relevant figure for this question being the Forbes Real-Time list near $3.5 billion as of early December[3].

Given the relatively small margin, a surprise change is possible, but the world generally changes slowlyâ€”so the status quo deserves extra weight.

Probability: **65%**  
Jordan is more likely than not to exceed Schultz's net worth on the reference date, but the probability is tempered by the narrow margin and the potential for last-minute revaluations.
