(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
Today is May 6, 2025. The winner was to be announced on April 3, 2025. Therefore, the result should already be known[1][2].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The default prediction would be the investigative series that was officially announced as the winner by the Shorenstein Center at Harvard University. As of March 17, 2025 (last available data prior to the outcome), the winner had not yet been publicly announced, but by now the information should be available.

(c) **Unexpected outcome scenario:**  
An unexpected outcome could involve a tie or procedural error, leading to multiple winners or annulment, but this has not occurred since the inception of the prize and is not indicated anywhere in the provided information. Another possible surprise could have been the selection of an underdog story, or the emergence of new information disqualifying a front-runner, but there is no evidence of this.

**Resolution and Key Evidence:**  
Search result [2] contains a table of "2025 Winners & Finalists" with the line:

This explicitly names "Right to Remain Secret" as the winner for 2025[2]. There is no indication of an annulled or tied outcome.

**Final Probabilities:**  
Given this concrete and official announcement, the probability that any finalist other than "Right to Remain Secret" will be awarded the 2025 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting is effectively 0%.
