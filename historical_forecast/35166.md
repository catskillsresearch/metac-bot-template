(a) Time left until outcome is known: The outcome will be known by March 15, 2025, when the 2025 Six Nations Championship concludes. From today (May 6, 2025), the tournament has already concluded.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the search results, France won the 2025 Six Nations Championship with 21 points, and England finished second with 20 points. The point difference between first and second place is 1 point.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The scenario that would result in a No outcome is exactly what happened. France won the tournament with 21 points, and England came in second with 20 points, resulting in only a 1-point gap between them.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: A Yes outcome would have required France to finish with at least 25 points (assuming England still got 20), or England to finish with 16 or fewer points (assuming France still got 21). This could have happened if France had achieved a Grand Slam (winning all matches, providing a minimum of 23 points) and collected more bonus points, or if England had performed significantly worse by losing additional matches.

According to the search results, the 2025 Six Nations Championship has already concluded, with France winning the tournament with 21 points, while England finished second with 20 points[1][2]. The final standings show that France won 4 matches and lost 1, earning 4 bonus points from tries and 1 bonus point from a close loss[2]. England also won 4 matches and lost 1, but earned 4 bonus points in total (3 from tries and 1 from a close loss)[2].

The point gap between France and England is only 1 point (21 vs. 20), which is significantly less than the 5-point gap specified in the question[1]. Ireland finished third with 19 points, also winning 4 matches but earning fewer bonus points[2].

Neither France nor England achieved a Grand Slam (winning all matches), which would have guaranteed at least 23 points for the winner[2]. Both top teams lost one match, leading to a very tight finish in the tournament.

The search results indicate that the tournament concluded with "Super Saturday" where England beat Wales 68-14, but France secured the championship by defeating Scotland 35-16 in the final match[2]. Ireland had earlier beaten Italy 22-17, but their victory was not enough to claim the title given the results of the other matches[2].

Given that the tournament has already concluded and the final standings are known, the answer is definitive. The difference between the first-place team (France with 21 points) and the second-place team (England with 20 points) is only 1 point, which is less than the 5-point gap required for a "Yes" outcome.
