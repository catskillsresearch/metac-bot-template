(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 25 days remaining until April 7, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current conditions persist—meaning Israel maintains its complete blockade and no humanitarian aid is allowed into Gaza—the outcome will be **No**: the blockade will not be lifted before April 7, 2025[1][2][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Israel continues to use the blockade as leverage to pressure Hamas on hostage releases and political concessions. No major diplomatic breakthrough occurs, and despite mounting international condemnation and humanitarian need, Israel does not resume aid flows before April 7, 2025[2][3][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A significant breakthrough in negotiations (possibly mediated by the US or regional actors) results in Hamas agreeing to release more hostages or otherwise compromise, prompting Israel to resume at least limited humanitarian aid flows into Gaza before April 7, 2025. Alternatively, overwhelming external pressure—such as new UN Security Council action, escalated international sanctions, or severe domestic backlash—forces Israel to relax the blockade temporarily[2][3].

## Rationale

- **Status Quo Heavily Favors “No”:**  
As of March 13, 2025, Israel has implemented the longest total blockade in the history of the Gaza Strip, with all aid deliveries halted since March 2, 2025. There have been no credible reports of an impending policy change. The blockade is directly tied to ongoing hostage negotiations and is intended to extract further concessions from Hamas, rather than to transition to the next ceasefire phase[2][5].
  
- **Diplomatic and Humanitarian Pressure:**  
International condemnation is widespread, with key allies and humanitarian organizations warning of impending famine and accusing Israel of violating international law[2][3][5]. However, past patterns suggest Israel tends to bend only under extreme external or internal pressure, or as part of a negotiated exchange. No such shift is currently underway.

- **Potential for Change:**  
Diplomacy is fluid, especially in high-stakes hostage and conflict scenarios. If negotiations suddenly advance and Hamas agrees to the terms Israel seeks, or if a major humanitarian disaster forces Israel’s hand, limited aid entry could resume.

- **World Changes Slowly:**  
In the absence of sudden, dramatic events, policy inertia dominates. No current indicators suggest either Israeli policy or negotiation dynamics are poised for near-term change[2][3][5].
