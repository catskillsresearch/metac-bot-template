(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** The 2024 Massachusetts general election is on November 5, 2024, so the outcome will be known in less than a week.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:** If Question 4 is not approved, psychedelics remain illegal for possession, cultivation, and use, except as currently allowed under law.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:** The measure is either outpolled by opposition or fails to garner enough support from undecided voters, particularly among older, independent, and Republican voters who historically have higher turnout and are currently more opposed. The large block of undecided voters, faced with the complexity and novelty of the measure, ultimately breaks against it, resulting in a majority voting No[3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:** The undecided voters swing toward approval, influenced by energetic campaigning, national attention, and comparisons to past progressive reforms (like cannabis legalization). Younger voters and Democrats turn out in sufficient numbers to overcome older and more conservative opposition, pushing the Yes side over 50%[3][4].

## Rationale

Recent, high-quality polling (UMass Amherst/WCVB, October 2024) finds Massachusetts voters evenly split: 43% in favor, 43% opposed, and 14% undecided[3]. This is a classic toss-up scenario, but there are several factors that increase the probability of a No outcome:
- The undecided group is large and historically, late-deciding voters often default to the status quo on complex or unfamiliar ballot questions, especially those involving controlled substances or public health concerns.
- Majoritarian support is largely confined to young people, liberals, and Democrats. Opposition is strongest among older voters, independents, Republicans, and parentsâ€”groups that have higher and more reliable turnout in general elections[3].
- The measure is novel, with only Oregon and Colorado having passed similar laws; there is no recent precedent on the East Coast, which may limit voter comfort[2].

On the other hand, proponents have significantly out-fundraised opponents and are leveraging national and local endorsements[4]. Massachusetts voters have a track record of supporting progressive drug policy, notably legalizing recreational marijuana in 2016. However, the current polling does not show a comparable level of support; instead, the electorate appears more cautious or uncertain about psychedelics.

**Given the polling deadlock, the high undecided rate, and the tendency for undecideds to break No on such measures, the status quo outcome (No) deserves extra weight. However, the progressive lean of Massachusetts and strong organizational support suggest a nontrivial chance of passage.**

Probability: **38%**
