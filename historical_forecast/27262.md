(a) **Time Until Outcome Known**  
As of August 19, 2024, there are 23 days left until the end of the prediction window (August 21 to September 11, 2024).

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**  
The most recent severe geomagnetic storm activity occurred prior to the question window—on August 12–13, 2024—with Kp values reaching 8 or higher. Since then, geomagnetic conditions have waned, and as of August 19, there are no forecasts or warnings for more severe geomagnetic storms in the upcoming period[2][3][5]. If the status quo persists—meaning no significant new solar flares or Earth-directed CMEs occur—the outcome would be "No": the strongest Kp between August 21 and September 11 will not exceed 7.

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome**  
No further intense solar activity (e.g., major X-class flare or Earth-directed CME) occurs from regions like AR3697 or other sunspots. Geomagnetic conditions remain quiet to moderate, with Kp values at or below 7 throughout the window. The German Research Center for Geosciences’ official Kp record confirms no Kp values >7 and ≤8 during the specified period.

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome**  
A new, unexpected Earth-directed CME is produced by AR3697 or another active region between August 21 and September 11, resulting in a geomagnetic storm that drives the Kp index above 7 and up to (or just over) 8. This would be confirmed in the official Kp log within the forecast window.

## Rationale

While AR3697 has produced major activity in recent months, the latest severe event (G4 storm with Kp ≥8) peaked before the start of the question window. As of August 19, forecasts indicate a return to quieter geomagnetic conditions, with no active warnings for another major storm in the relevant period[2][3][5]. The probability of another Kp > 7 event in the next three weeks is not zero, as large sunspot regions can become active unpredictably, but current data shows no imminent risk.

Solar maximum is still ongoing, and active regions have surprised forecasters before, but the expert consensus is that the most likely scenario is continued moderate or quiet conditions barring a new active region or major solar event.

Therefore, weighting the status quo more heavily—as experienced forecasters do—the most likely outcome is no Kp > 7 event in the target window.

Probability: 20%
