(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
Approximately 1 month. February 2025 sales data from Argonne National Laboratory is typically published in the third or fourth week of March, so the precise figure will be known in about four weeks.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If the sales share remained at December 2024 levels (the most recent final data point), the outcome would be **10.86%**[5].

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
From May to December 2024, PEV share fluctuated between 9.3% and 10.9%, with a mild upward drift in the last few months:

- October 2024: 9.35%
- November 2024: 10.57%
- December 2024: 10.86%

Assuming a similar monthly increase (about 0.15 to 0.30 percentage points per month), February 2025 could plausibly land between **11.0% and 11.2%**.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
- J.D. Power projects the 2025 *average* EV retail share will hold steady at **9.1%** (focusing only on BEVs, not including PHEVs)[3].
- EV Volumes and Cox Automotive forecasts for total plug-in share (BEV + PHEV) in 2025 range from **10% to 13.5%**, with most sources expecting continued, but moderate, growth[5].
- The steady pace in late 2024 and early 2025, combined with slightly positive market sentiment and ongoing incentives, suggest the February figure will likely be close to, or modestly above, December 2024’s 10.86%[1][5].

(e) **Unexpected low outcome scenario:**  
A sudden, adverse federal policy shift (for example, elimination or suspension of key EV tax credits or the announcement of immediate tariffs on imported EVs or EV batteries), or a major negative event like widespread battery recalls, could cause consumer demand to drop sharply. In that case, PEV share could fall as low as **9.0% to 9.5%**—still above the recent trough, but marking a significant setback.

(f) **Unexpected high outcome scenario:**  
Conversely, an unexpected surge in deliveries (such as a major automaker clearing backlog or releasing a very popular new EV or PHEV model), or an acute short-term gasoline price spike could cause a jump in adoption. In this case, PEV share could temporarily spike as high as **12.5% to 13.0%**, exceeding previous monthly records.
