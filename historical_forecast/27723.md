(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The 2024 MTV VMAs will be held on September 10, 2024, so as of August 28, there are about 13 days remaining until the winner is announced[4][5].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
With no clear front-runner or major leaks, and given historical patterns, the default outcome is that the probability for each nominee is distributed fairly evenly, with perhaps a slight edge to the bigger legacy acts, but no overwhelming favorite. If no strong new signals arise, the status quo is that "Feelslikeimfallinginlove" by Coldplay is *not* the presumptive winner[2][4].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome occurs if one of the other nominees—Bon Jovi, Green Day, Kings of Leon, Lenny Kravitz, or U2—wins the Best Rock award instead of Coldplay. This could be due to higher fan voting, greater MTV support, or industry momentum behind another artist[4].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome would require "Feelslikeimfallinginlove" by Coldplay to receive the most support during voting and be selected by MTV as the winner of Best Rock. This could happen if Coldplay's fan base mobilizes effectively, or if the song resonates strongest with MTV's criteria[1][4].

## Rationale

- **Nominee Field:** The nominees for Best Rock at the 2024 MTV VMAs are all established, high-profile acts: Bon Jovi, Coldplay, Green Day, Kings of Leon, Lenny Kravitz, and U2[2][4].
- **No Clear Favorite:** As of August 28, the voting is open and there is no credible industry buzz, expert prediction, or leak pointing to any single nominee as the likely winner[1][4][5]. 
- **Historical Voting:** The award is determined by a combination of fan votes and MTV's own criteria, which makes outcomes harder to pre-call—fan engagement and MTV's preferences both matter[1][4].
- **Recent Trends:** The Best Rock category tends to reward both classic artists and those with current engagement, but there has not been a pattern of repeat winners or a dominant act in recent years[3][4].
- **Extra Weight for Status Quo:** Given the absence of new evidence or major predictive signals, a good forecaster would lean towards the status quo: the race is open, and Coldplay cannot be confidently forecast as the winner—but neither can any other nominee.

## Probability Estimate

Given the six total nominees and an evenly split field, a pure random baseline would be about 16-17%. Accounting for Coldplay's strong fan base and history (including a win in 2020), but not seeing any decisive signals for or against their chances, a slightly above-baseline probability is justified. However, there is no basis for assigning Coldplay as the frontrunner over the similarly prominent competitors.

**Probability: 18%**
