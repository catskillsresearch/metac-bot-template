(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Today is May 6, 2025. The question resolves based on DOGE's claimed savings as of April 1, 2025. The outcome date has already passed, so the answer depends on the data available from DOGE's public record of savings at or after April 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the most recent update on the official DOGE savings site (last updated May 3, 2025), DOGE claims a total estimated savings of $165 billion[1]. This far exceeds the $150 billion threshold required for a "Yes" outcome. Therefore, if nothing changed from the current claim, the outcome would be "Yes."

(c) **Brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would result if, on April 1, 2025, DOGE did **not** claim $150 billion or more in total estimated savings—either because their claim was below this threshold, or their official reporting was revised downward between now and then (for example, due to corrections, audits, or removal of unsubstantiated claims)[5]. There is some precedent for this, as DOGE has previously backtracked and revised claims downward after outside scrutiny[5].

(d) **Brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome occurs if, on or after April 1, 2025, the Department of Government Efficiency claims total estimated savings of $150 billion or more on its official site[1]. As of May 3, 2025, DOGE is publicly claiming $165 billion in savings, which comfortably clears the required threshold[1].

## Rationale

Given the most recent official update from DOGE—dated May 3, 2025—claims $165 billion in total savings[1], it is highly likely that DOGE was claiming at least $150 billion around April 1, 2025 as well. There is no evidence in the search results of a major, recent downward revision that would bring the figure below $150 billion.

While there is documented history of DOGE backtracking or revising some claims downward[5], these have typically not resulted in large, sudden drops in the headline total. The current number is well above the threshold. Furthermore, all recent public updates and press coverage continue to reference DOGE's very high savings figures, despite questions about some documentation or methodology[5].

Professional forecasters generally assign extra weight to the status quo, especially when the world changes slowly and there is no clear reason to expect a drastic reversal. In this context, the status quo—DOGE's claim of $165 billion in savings as of early May—makes a "Yes" resolution strongly likely.
