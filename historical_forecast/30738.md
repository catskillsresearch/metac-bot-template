(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of December 4, 2024, November 2024’s preliminary NOAA global temperature anomaly has been published. Metaculus Admins may resolve the question imminently—there is no significant time left before outcome determination.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The official NOAA November 2024 Global Land and Ocean Average Temperature Anomaly is reported as **1.34°C**, which **exceeds** the 1.25°C threshold for a “Yes” answer[3]. Thus, if no revisions occur, the outcome is **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
NOAA’s November 2024 global temperature anomaly remains at or above 1.25°C when the resolution page is accessed. This matches the reported preliminary value of 1.34°C[3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
NOAA revises the November 2024 global anomaly **downward** by at least 0.10°C (from 1.34°C to below 1.25°C) before Metaculus checks the result. Such a substantial post-publication adjustment would be highly unusual.

## Rationale

The preliminary NOAA data, which is the official resolution source, states the November 2024 global surface temperature anomaly is 1.34°C above the 20th-century average[3]. This value is well above the 1.25°C threshold. While NOAA’s values are occasionally updated, adjustments of this magnitude—especially after public release—are rare. There is no current indication of data errors, methodological changes, or other extraordinary factors likely to prompt such a downward revision.

Global climate context further reinforces this expectation. All major datasets indicate 2024 is on track to shatter annual warmth records globally due to persistent ocean heat and the lagging influence of a strong El Niño, with only a weak La Niña emerging late in the year[4][5]. The consistent warmth observed throughout 2024 makes a substantial negative revision to the November anomaly improbable.

Historically, preliminary NOAA global temperature anomalies are robust and seldom revised by more than a few hundredths of a degree, not the tenth of a degree required to flip this outcome.

**Status quo outcomes tend to persist, especially in climate records where recent anomalies have been consistently high and measurement methods stable.**

**Probability: 99%**

A “No” outcome is extremely likely, given the reported anomaly (1.34°C) is well above the threshold and changes of the required magnitude almost never occur after the NOAA preliminary report is published[3].
