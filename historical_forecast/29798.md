(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 54 days remaining until January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
If current conditions persist—ModivCare continues ongoing discussions with lenders, maintains liquidity management, and does not encounter an abrupt liquidity crisis—the company will not file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025. The most recent financial updates indicate no imminent bankruptcy filing, and management describes lender discussions as "collaborative and supportive"[1].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
ModivCare successfully negotiates covenant relief with its lenders, stabilizes contract receivable collections, and manages its liquidity without needing to seek bankruptcy protection. Utilization patterns in its core businesses normalize, aligning prepayment rates as the company expects, and the firm enters 2025 without filing for bankruptcy[1].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Negotiations with lenders break down abruptly, new financial pressures emerge (such as a significant delay in receivable collections, loss of major contracts, or macroeconomic shocks), or unanticipated liquidity shortfalls materialize. In this scenario, ModivCare faces immediate covenant breaches or cash needs that cannot be covered through alternative financing, forcing a bankruptcy petition before the end of 2024.

## Rationale

Currently, ModivCare is navigating a period of elevated financial risk, primarily due to its high leverage, revised downward EBITDA guidance, and ongoing need for covenant relief[1][2]. However, the company has not signaled any imminent intent to file for bankruptcy: management is working actively with a "collaborative and supportive" lending group, and ModivCare has taken preparatory steps (e.g., filing a shelf registration to provide capital raising flexibility, though it does not plan to issue equity immediately)[1]. Quantitative models show a heightened probability of bankruptcy within 24 months, but not a certainty or a trigger event before January 1, 2025[2].

While the situation is fluid and subject to change should negotiations fail or liquidity deteriorate unexpectedly, the base rate for large public companies failing within such a short 54-day window—without any public indication of immediate crisis—is relatively low. Good forecasting practice puts extra weight on the status quo, especially given the apparent stability of current lender relationships and the lack of reported covenant breaches.

## Final Forecast

Probability: **18%**

This reflects elevated risk but also the likelihood that ModivCare and its creditors will avoid a formal bankruptcy filing in the next seven weeks, barring a sudden and unforeseen liquidity event[1][2][3].
