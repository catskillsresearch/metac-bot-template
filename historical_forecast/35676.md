(a) **Time Left Until Outcome is Known**  
The FAA’s weekly unruly passenger incident data for the week ending March 23, 2025, will likely be published within a week or so after March 23. Today is May 6, 2025, so the reporting week has already passed. The actual data release may be available now or soon.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed**  
Recent years have shown stabilization in unruly passenger incidents, with annual totals around 2,000–2,100 cases in both 2023 and 2024[4]. The rate of incidents per 10,000 flights, as reported by the FAA through 2023 and into 2024, has typically hovered between 1.5 and 2.0 per 10,000 flights in similar periods, representing a significant decline from the 2021 spike—an 80% reduction from peak[1].

Assuming enforcement policies and travel patterns remain unchanged, and given that early and mid-2024 weekly rates mostly ranged from about 1.6 to 1.9 incidents per 10,000 flights, the most likely outcome for March 2025 is a rate within this established band.

(c) **Scenario for an Unexpected Outcome**  
An unexpected outcome could arise if there is a sudden surge in disruptive behavior—perhaps triggered by a controversial airline policy change, a major news event, or a holiday rush coinciding with that week—pushing the incident rate back above 2.0 per 10,000 flights. Alternatively, a technological solution or heightened enforcement (e.g., on-board security changes, real-time passenger monitoring, or stricter airline actions) could push the number below previously seen lows, possibly under 1.3 per 10,000 flights.

## Probabilities for Each Option

| Option                     | Probability |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| ≤1.3                       | 10%         |
| >1.3 and <1.7              | 35%         |
| ≥1.7 and ≤2.0              | 45%         |
| >2.0                       | 10%         |

- The plurality is placed on the 1.7–2.0 range, reflecting the most common recent weekly reporting rates under a stable policy and travel environment, with a moderate allocation to the slightly lower (1.3–1.7) band in case of slow continued decline.
- The tails (≤1.3 and >2.0) are given small but real probabilities to acknowledge uncertainty and the possibility of surprises in either direction.
