(a) Time left until outcome is known: I have approximately 54 days until October 1, 2024, when the outcome of this question will be determined.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No publicly available, domain-general LLM has achieved gold medal performance on the IMO. The current best achievement is a specialized AI system (AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2) from Google DeepMind that achieved silver medal status with 28 points in the 2024 IMO, just one point below the gold medal threshold of 29 points.

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: No major AI lab releases or announces a publicly available, domain-general LLM capable of achieving the gold medal threshold on IMO problems before October 1. The mathematical reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs continue to improve incrementally but fail to bridge the gap between current performance and the sophisticated reasoning required for gold medal IMO performance in this short timeframe.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: A leading AI lab announces a breakthrough in mathematical reasoning capabilities for their publicly available LLM, demonstrating that it can achieve 29+ points on the 2024 IMO problems while maintaining domain-generality. This could come from an unexpected rapid improvement in models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet (which has shown strong performance on other math benchmarks) or a new version of GPT released before the October deadline.

## Rationale

When forecasting this question, I need to consider several key factors that influence the likelihood of a publicly available LLM achieving gold medal status on the IMO before October 1, 2024.

**Current Performance Gap**

The state-of-the-art in AI mathematical reasoning was demonstrated by Google DeepMind's specialized system, which achieved a silver medal with 28 points in the 2024 IMO[1]. This system combined AlphaProof (which solved algebra and number theory problems) and AlphaGeometry 2 (which handled geometry problems). Notably, this specialized system:

- Solved four out of six problems with perfect scores
- Successfully tackled the hardest problem in the competition (solved by only five human contestants)
- Remained stumped by two combinatorics problems

However, this system is not a publicly available, domain-general LLM as required by the question criteria. It represents a specialized, purpose-built system for mathematical reasoning.

**Performance of Current General-Purpose LLMs**

General-purpose LLMs have shown significant improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks, but still lag behind specialized systems:

- On the MATH benchmark, frontier models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet have reached nearly 97% performance, approaching human expert level[2]
- However, on the more challenging AIME 2024 benchmark (which is still below IMO difficulty), earlier versions of general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4 scored only 1/30, while Claude and Gemini scored 2/30[2]

The gap between specialized and general-purpose systems on IMO-level problems remains substantial.

**Time Constraints**

With only 54 days remaining until the October 1 deadline, there is very limited time for:
1. Developing a significantly improved LLM with the required mathematical reasoning capabilities
2. Making such a model publicly available
3. Testing and verifying its performance on IMO problems
4. Announcing these results through credible channels

The typical development and release cycle for major LLM updates often takes months, making this timeline extremely tight.

**Technical Challenges**

Several technical hurdles stand in the way of achieving the required performance:

1. **Mathematical Reasoning Gap**: The IMO represents the pinnacle of pre-collegiate mathematical problem-solving, requiring deep conceptual understanding, creativity, and formal proof construction—areas where general-purpose LLMs still struggle.

2. **Domain-Generality Trade-off**: The requirement that the system maintain general capabilities while achieving specialized mathematical performance presents a difficult balance, as specialized systems like AlphaProof can focus their architecture and training entirely on mathematical reasoning.

3. **Verification Process**: For a valid resolution, the model would need to be tested on all six IMO problems, with proper time constraints and input/output formats matching those given to human participants.

**Status Quo Inertia**

As a professional forecaster, I recognize the importance of anchoring to the status quo when appropriate. The current status quo is that no publicly available, domain-general LLM has demonstrated gold medal IMO performance. While AI progress can be rapid, the specific constraints of this question—requiring both public availability and domain-generality within a very short timeframe—make deviation from the status quo less likely.

The strongest evidence for a potential "Yes" outcome is the near-miss by DeepMind's specialized system, which came just one point short of gold medal performance[1]. However, translating this specialized capability into a general-purpose, publicly available LLM within the remaining timeframe would represent an unusually rapid advance.
