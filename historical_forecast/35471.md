(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
The outcome will be known at the close of the last trading day of March 2025. As of February 28, 2025, this is roughly one month away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If the S&P 500 does not move meaningfully in March, it will close at the same value as the end of February 2025. Therefore, the default status quo probability should be weighted toward “no significant change”—historically, the S&P 500 is *somewhat* more likely to rise in a given month, but the difference is not dramatic, especially after a strong run-up and at elevated valuations.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (S&P 500 closes lower in March):**  
This could occur if there is a market correction driven by high valuations, negative surprises on inflation (“slugflation”) or economic growth, hawkish signals or surprises from the Federal Reserve, geopolitical shocks, or weaker-than-expected corporate earnings reports. Skeptical analysts currently highlight the risks of a pullback, citing that valuations are well above historical averages and that January may have marked a high for the year[3]. Forecasts that show a lower range for April 2025 than March (e.g., LiteFinance) also hint at the possibility of a topping market[4].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (S&P 500 closes higher in March):**  
The index could rise on the back of continued positive economic data, stable inflation, strong corporate earnings, and ongoing market optimism, as reflected in various 2025 year-end targets from major Wall Street institutions, almost all of which are bullish[1][2]. Long-term forecasts and March-specific price targets suggest a general upward trend is expected to persist, at least in the near term[2][4].

## Rationale and Forecast

Major Wall Street strategists have broadly positive forecasts for 2025, expecting the S&P 500 to climb further over the year, with targets up to 6,500 or more by December[1][2][4]. March-specific forecasts range from about 5,853 to 6,077[4]. However, these are month-end ranges, and most are above current values.

Counterpoints include warnings about stretched valuations, muted reward/risk, and the possibility that the market peaked in January, particularly in large-cap tech[3]. One veteran manager notes that upside may be only 5% for the year, with a downside risk of up to -15% if negative shocks appear[3].

Historically, the S&P 500 rises in about 60% of months, with the probability somewhat higher during bullish multi-year periods, but the margin is not overwhelming.

Given all information as of end February 2025:
- The prevailing outlook is positive, but conviction is not universal.
- The market is at elevated valuations and sensitivity to negative news is higher.
- Short-term (one-month) moves are much more stochastic than annual forecasts, and high macro uncertainty remains.
- The most direct, recent March 2025 forecast (LiteFinance) sees continued strength in March, with a possible pullback afterward[4].

**Weighting the status quo appropriately, and considering the balance of current forecasts, economic conditions, valuation risks, and historical frequency:**

Probability: **62%**
