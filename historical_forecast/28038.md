(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of September 12, 2024, there are about 18 days remaining until the final count of September 2024 major Atlantic hurricanes is known (the question resolves based on NHC data as of October 1, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of September 12, 2024, no major Atlantic hurricanes have been observed in September. If the current pattern of limited activity and inhibitory environmental conditions persist through the month, the outcome would be "zero major hurricanes" for September.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The most direct path to a No outcome is that either zero major hurricanes form during September, or that two or more major hurricanes develop. The former is more plausible given the slow start to the season, suppressed tropical activity through early September, and continued inhibiting factors like dry air, Saharan dust, and wind shear[5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome (exactly one major hurricane in September) would require that, despite the recent lull, only a single storm reaches Category 3 or higher at any point during September. This could happen if just one system finds a brief window with improved atmospheric and oceanic conditions — for example, if the suppression from Saharan dust and wind shear diminishes, allowing one strong storm to organize, but broader conditions remain unfavorable for additional major hurricanes.

## Rationale

The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season was widely forecast to be above average, with 3–6 major hurricanes predicted by AccuWeather and 4 by Tropical Storm Risk for the whole season[1][3]. However, these forecasts are seasonal and not month-specific, and, critically, have been adjusted downward as of early September due to the persistent lack of activity and continued limiting environmental factors[5].

August and early September — typically the ramp-up to the season’s peak — have seen notably suppressed activity, with 2024 marking the first time in 27 years that Labor Day weekend had no named storms in the Atlantic basin[5]. The presence of dry air, Saharan dust, wind shear, and cooler eastern Atlantic waters are continuing to dampen Atlantic cyclone potential despite underlying La Niña conditions[5]. While La Niña would normally support higher activity, these competing factors are at least temporarily dominant.

With nearly two-thirds of September remaining, it remains possible for a major hurricane to form — September is climatologically the single most active hurricane month. Conditions can change rapidly, and even in a suppressed year, a single favorable period or a break in inhibitory conditions can yield a major hurricane. However, for the specific outcome of "exactly one" major hurricane, the most likely failure mode is zero, given the slow start. Less likely, but still plausible, is a late-month atmospheric shift yielding a rapid-fire sequence of storms that could produce two or more major hurricanes.

Given the current status (no major September major hurricanes as of September 12), the environmental suppression, and the seasonal adjustments made by forecasting agencies, the probability that exactly one major hurricane will occur in September is *less than the climatological norm*, but not vanishingly small.
