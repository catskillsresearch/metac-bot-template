(a) Time until outcome is known: The question's outcome will be determined by whether Warsaw, Poland's temperature reaches 70°F (21.1°C) between now (May 6, 2025) and April 1, 2025. Since we are already past April 1, 2025 (it's May 6, 2025), the time period for this question has already elapsed.

(b) Status quo outcome: Since the date range specified in the question (from question launch to April 1, 2025) has already passed, and there's no indication in the search results that Warsaw reached 70°F during that period, the status quo outcome appears to be "No."

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Warsaw maintained its typical March temperatures, with highs remaining in the 40s°F (around 6-7°C), consistent with historical weather patterns for this time of year. No unusual warm spells occurred to push temperatures near the 70°F threshold.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: An extremely unusual warm weather event would have needed to occur, bringing temperatures approximately 25-30°F above normal March temperatures in Warsaw. This would have required an exceptional weather anomaly, perhaps related to climate change or an unprecedented warm air mass moving across Poland.

As a professional forecaster, I need to approach this question analytically based on the historical data provided. The search results indicate that March temperatures in Warsaw typically range between 33°F and 44°F (1°C to 7°C)[4]. Historical averages show March high temperatures around 6.8°C (44.2°F)[3]. 

The question asks whether Warsaw reached 70°F (approximately 21.1°C) between the question launch and April 1, 2025. Given that today is May 6, 2025, this period has already passed. 

When making forecasts, I must consider that weather patterns generally follow historical trends with occasional deviations. The data shows that March temperatures in Warsaw typically remain well below the 70°F threshold, with high temperatures usually around 44°F (6.8°C)[3]. This represents a gap of approximately 26°F from the threshold in question.

While climate change could potentially cause gradual warming, a jump of 26°F above normal would be extremely unusual. Additionally, the search results provide no indication of any exceptional warm spell occurring in Warsaw during March 2025.

Considering all available information and giving appropriate weight to the status quo (that Warsaw's March temperatures typically remain well below 70°F), and the fact that we are now past the resolution date with no indication of such an extreme temperature event having occurred, I must conclude that it is extremely unlikely that the temperature reached 70°F in Warsaw before April 1, 2025.
