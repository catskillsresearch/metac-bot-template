(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 7 days (from October 29, 2024 to November 5, 2024, Election Day)

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Republicans currently hold a narrow majority in the House of Representatives, while the presidential race appears to slightly favor Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Democrats win enough competitive House districts to flip control of the chamber while Harris maintains her polling advantage and wins the presidency. Alternatively, Trump wins the presidency but Democrats gain control of the House.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Trump overcomes his slight polling deficit by performing better than expected in key swing states, while Republicans maintain their narrow House majority by successfully defending vulnerable districts.

Based on the search results and current political landscape, I'll provide my professional forecast on whether Republicans will win both the White House and the House of Representatives in the 2024 US elections.

The presidential race appears highly competitive but with a slight edge toward former President Donald Trump according to citizen forecasting data. According to search results, Trump is viewed as the expected winner by 50% of respondents compared to Biden's 38%, showing a 10-point lead in expectations[4]. However, it's important to note that these are from April 2024 when Biden was still the Democratic nominee. The search results don't provide updated forecasts with Harris as the nominee.

For the House of Representatives, the search results don't provide specific forecasting data on which party is favored to maintain or gain control after the 2024 elections. 

When forecasting the likelihood of Republicans winning both the White House and House, I need to consider:

1. **Presidential Race**: The forecasts from political science models suggest a tight race. Some models favor Trump while others favor the Democratic candidate[1]. Prediction markets like Polymarket show Biden with a 55% chance to win the popular vote[5], but this doesn't necessarily translate to an Electoral College victory. Again, these predictions predate Harris becoming the nominee.

2. **House of Representatives**: The search results don't provide clear forecasts for House control. Republicans currently hold the majority, but we don't have sufficient information on whether they're expected to maintain this control.

3. **Joint Probability**: For Republicans to win both, they need to win each individual contest. If we assume the presidential race is roughly 50-50 (based on the "almost evenly split" forecasts[1]), and without clear information on House control, we must consider the status quo and historical trends.

The status quo suggests Republicans have a path to maintaining House control since they currently hold the majority. However, midterm elections often favor the party not in the White House, and this pattern could potentially reverse in a presidential election year.

Given that the outcomes of these races are not entirely independent (there can be coattail effects where a strong presidential performance helps down-ballot candidates), and considering the limited and somewhat outdated information available, I estimate:

Probability: 40%

This reflects that while Republicans have pathways to winning both chambers, the evidence suggests a tight race where either or both contests could go to Democrats. The status quo advantage in the House is partially offset by the uncertainty in the presidential race, and the joint probability must be lower than either individual probability. Without more recent and comprehensive forecasting data, maintaining appropriate uncertainty is essential in this forecast.
