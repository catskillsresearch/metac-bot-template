(a) **Time left until outcome:**  
As of October 31, 2024, the general election is five days away—results should be known by the night of November 5 or early November 6, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Anthony D'Esposito, the Republican incumbent, narrowly won in 2022 and currently holds the seat. If trends and conditions from the previous cycle held steady, D'Esposito would be slightly favored to retain the seat[1][4]. However, the district is Democratic-leaning, and political dynamics can shift quickly in competitive seats like NY-4[1][2].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome occurs if Laura Gillen, the Democratic challenger, defeats D'Esposito. Given a recent poll indicating a double-digit lead for Gillen and the district’s underlying Democratic registration advantage, this could materialize if Democratic turnout is strong, Gillen effectively capitalizes on local and national issues, and negative coverage or controversies weaken support for D'Esposito[2][4][5].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" outcome requires Anthony D'Esposito to hold off Gillen and win re-election. This could occur if D'Esposito leverages his incumbency, mobilizes Republican and swing voters, and benefits from any late shifts in public opinion—especially if the national environment tilts red or D'Esposito is successful in framing key campaign issues (crime, immigration) to appeal broadly in a politically divided district[1][2][4].

## Rationale

This district is among the most closely watched in the country, with national implications for control of the House. D'Esposito's initial victory was narrow (51.8%-48.2%)[1][4], and he represents a seat that Joe Biden won in 2020, marking him as a vulnerable Republican. The district is majority Democrat by registration, and analysts consider NY-4 the "best Democratic House target in the country"[1].

A significant new poll as of late October shows Gillen leading by double digits[5]. While poll margins can be volatile and subject to error or late movement, this is a notable data point in a district where any Democratic surge could be decisive. Furthermore, D'Esposito faces local controversies and a strong, well-funded challenger[2][5]. That said, incumbency, Republican focus on crime/immigration, and possible splitting of ticket voters could still carry him to victory, especially if the national Republican turnout is strong[2][4].

Given all available evidence, the polling trend, the district’s baseline Democratic tilt, and the highly competitive nature of the race, the probability of D'Esposito being re-elected is meaningfully less than 50% at this time, though not negligible—late-breaking shifts, turnout dynamics, or polling error could still make a difference.
