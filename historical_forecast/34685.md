(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
As of February 6, 2025, there are three days until Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025, when this question will resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, multiple major news outlets (CBS, Associated Press, TMZ, Sports Business Journal) are reporting, based on White House and other sources, that President Donald Trump is set to attend Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans[1][2][3][4][5]. If nothing changes, and these plans proceed as reported, the status quo is a "Yes" outcome.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Trump cancels his appearance at the last minute due to security concerns, unexpected events (such as health, domestic or international crises), or logistical complications. Alternatively, he might be present in New Orleans or engage in Super Bowl-related events but not physically enter the stadium grounds during the game, thus failing to meet the specific resolution criteria.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Trump follows through on the reported plans, arrives at Caesars Superdome, and is confirmed by public reports to be within the stadium grounds at any point during Super Bowl LIX. This would fulfill the resolution criteria and yield a "Yes" outcome.

### Rationale

Strong, multi-source reporting indicates that Trump is expected to attend, with confirmations from White House officials and national news outlets[1][2][4][5]. He has been actively attending major sporting events in recent months, reinforcing the plausibility of his plans[3]. 

However, presidential schedules are subject to late changes due to security, health, or political developments. Although these are low-frequency events, they are relevant because a last-minute cancellation would not be unprecedented for security reasons, especially at a high-profile event like the Super Bowl. 

Despite these small risks, good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo when plans are public and widely confirmed. There are no current reports of plans being reversed or credible signals of cancellation as of February 6, 2025.
