(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
Approximately three weeks remain until the end of February 2025, at which point the final monthly return for the EGX 30 can be calculated.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The EGX 30 index started February 2025 with strong momentum, continuing a bullish trend from 2024 where it gained 68% in local currency terms[4]. The first week of February saw further gains (EGX 40 up 0.93%), with no evidence of negative shocks or policy changes to disrupt the market’s trajectory[2]. If this trend continues, the most probable outcome is a positive monthly return, with a moderate likelihood of the return falling in the ‘≥0% and <5%’ or potentially ‘Greater than 5%’ range, given recent volatility and sustained bullish sentiment.

(c) **Scenario resulting in an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected negative return (less than 0%) could result from a sudden macroeconomic shock, such as a sharp currency devaluation, significant political upheaval, or an external event impacting investor sentiment. Since no such event has occurred in early February and Egypt’s equity market fundamentals appear stable, this is considered less likely but remains possible given the region’s historical volatility.

## Outlook and Rationale

Recent history and analyst coverage suggest strong momentum in Egyptian equities due to favorable economic growth, high dividend yields, and persistent investor optimism[1][4]. Equity market forecasts for Egypt in 2025 remain bullish, with no major risks or reversals signaled as of the first week of February[2][3][4]. However, markets can be unpredictable, particularly in emerging economies, and it is prudent to maintain some probability on less likely negative scenarios.

## Final Probabilities

Option | Probability
--- | ---
Less than -5% | 5%
≥-5% and <0% | 10%
≥0% and <5% | 45%
Greater than 5% | 40%

**Summary:**  
Available evidence strongly favors another positive month for the EGX 30, with the higher odds split between returns in the 0–5% and 5%+ ranges, reflecting both the prevailing bullish trend and the potential for emerging market volatility[2][4]. A negative return outcome is not impossible but appears unlikely absent new negative developments.
