(a) Time left until outcome: 18 days (from November 11, 2024, to November 29, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changed, the total US rig count would remain at 585, which would result in a "No" outcome to the question.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Oil prices increase slightly in late November due to heightened winter demand, prompting a few operators to activate additional drilling rigs. This pushes the total rig count to 588-590, keeping it above the 585 threshold.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Several operators decommission rigs as they complete planned drilling programs before year-end, and others delay new drilling projects until 2025 budgets are finalized. This causes the total rig count to drop to 580-583, falling below the 585 threshold.

Based on the available data, I need to forecast whether the US active drilling rig count will fall below 585 by November 29, 2024. The current situation shows that as of November 8, 2024, the total US rig count stands at exactly 585, unchanged for three consecutive weeks[4]. This represents the decision threshold for our question.

Looking at broader trends, the rig count has been on a downward trajectory compared to last year, with the current count being 5% (31 rigs) lower than the same period in 2023[4]. The oil rig count has held steady at 479 while gas rigs have remained at 102[4].

Historical context is important here. The rig count dropped approximately 20% in 2023, following increases in the previous two years[4]. This decline has been attributed to lower oil and gas prices, increased operational costs due to inflation, and a strategic shift by energy companies toward debt reduction and shareholder returns rather than production expansion[4].

The most recent data from May 2, 2025 (which appears to be a forward date in the search results) indicated a decline to 584 rigs from 587 the previous week[5]. While this data point is from a future date relative to our current reference date (November 11, 2024), it suggests a continuation of the slight downward trend.

The status quo baseline is important. With the count exactly at 585 for three consecutive weeks, there's notable stability in the short term. However, the longer-term trend shows gradual decline. Energy companies appear to be maintaining cautious capital discipline, which suggests limited appetite for expanding drilling operations.

Several factors could influence the rig count in the coming weeks:
- Seasonal factors: Late November typically sees some operational adjustments before winter
- Budget considerations: Companies may delay new projects until 2025 budgets are approved
- Oil price movements: Any significant price shifts could alter drilling economics
- Completion of existing drilling programs: Some currently active rigs may complete their scheduled work

Given the recent stability at exactly 585 rigs, even a small decrease of just one rig would put the count below the threshold. The historical downward trend, combined with the typical year-end operational adjustments, suggests a slightly higher likelihood of a decrease than an increase by November 29.

While the status quo deserves significant weight, the context of a multi-year downward trend, coupled with typical year-end operational patterns, suggests a modest probability that the count will dip below 585 in the next few weeks.

Probability: 65%
