(a) Time left until outcome: 26 days. The outcome will be known after December 31, 2024, when the complete December 2024 weather data for Miami International Airport becomes available.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on historical averages, Miami typically experiences about 6 days of rain in December, which would result in a "Yes" outcome if this pattern continues.

(c) Scenario for "No" outcome: La Niña conditions intensify as predicted, creating significantly drier than normal conditions across South Florida. The current abnormally dry status worsens, resulting in only 3-4 days with measurable rainfall at Miami International Airport during December 2024.

(d) Scenario for "Yes" outcome: Despite the La Niña forecast, Miami experiences its typical December weather pattern with 6 rainy days, or a few strong weather systems move through the area bringing clustered rain events that reach or exceed the 5-day threshold.

My forecast for whether Miami will have at least 5 days of rain in December 2024:

Miami typically experiences about 6 days with some rainfall in December, with average monthly precipitation of 43-55mm[2][5]. This historical pattern would suggest a high likelihood of reaching the 5-day threshold. However, several important factors suggest a departure from normal conditions this year.

The National Weather Service's 2024-2025 Winter/Dry Season Outlook, released on November 18, 2024, specifically forecasts "warmer and drier than normal conditions this winter and dry season" for South Florida[3]. This outlook is based on the expected return of La Niña conditions, which are "most likely to emerge by December, and is expected to persist through March 2025"[3]. The NWS expresses "moderate to high confidence in below normal precipitation" for the region[3].

The current abnormally dry conditions in Miami-Dade County also suggest that the area is already experiencing below-normal precipitation patterns. This existing dryness, combined with the La Niña forecast, creates compounding factors likely to reduce rainfall frequency.

When examining historical analogues of La Niña Decembers in South Florida, they typically result in suppressed rainfall. The confidence level from the NWS in this drier pattern is described as "moderate to high," indicating significant meteorological consensus behind this forecast[3].

However, I must acknowledge that seasonal forecasts have uncertainty, and Miami is located in a coastal subtropical environment where isolated shower activity can still occur despite broader dry patterns. December also marks the beginning of the expected La Niña influence, so its full effects may not be immediately apparent.

Weighing these factors together, while the historical average would suggest 6 rainy days, the strong seasonal outlook for below-normal precipitation and current drought conditions suggest a higher probability of Miami experiencing fewer than 5 days of rain in December 2024.

Probability: 40%
