(a) Time until outcome: 38 days (from May 6, 2025 to October 1, 2024, which is in the past - this appears to be a mistake in the date format)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No confirmed Clade I mpox infections in Zambia

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Zambia's robust surveillance system and preventive measures successfully prevent or detect any potential cases early. Geographic barriers or limited cross-border movement with heavily affected regions help contain the spread. The country maintains its mpox-free status through September 2024.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Zambia confirms its first Clade I mpox case due to cross-border transmission from neighboring DRC or other affected countries. The rapid regional spread continues, overwhelming surveillance systems in bordering nations and allowing the virus to circulate undetected before confirmation.

As a professional forecaster, I need to assess the probability of Zambia confirming a Clade I mpox infection before October 1, 2024, based on the available evidence.

The current situation shows that as of August 19, 2024, Zambia has not reported any confirmed mpox cases[2]. This establishes our baseline - the status quo is that Zambia remains mpox-free despite regional outbreaks.

## Regional Context and Spread Patterns

The mpox outbreak in Africa has intensified significantly in 2024, with over 17,000 suspected cases reported this year alone[2][5]. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remains the epicenter, accounting for the vast majority of cases and about 87% of deaths[2]. 

What's particularly concerning is the recent geographic expansion of Clade I mpox to countries that previously hadn't reported cases:

- Burundi, Uganda, Rwanda, and Kenya reported their first mpox cases only in late July 2024[3]
- By early August 2024, confirmed cases were reported in at least five countries neighboring the DRC: Burundi (61 confirmed), Central African Republic (35 confirmed), Congo (19 confirmed), Rwanda (4 confirmed), and Uganda (2 confirmed)[3]

This rapid spread within just weeks demonstrates the virus's current transmission momentum in the region.

## Zambia's Specific Risk Factors

Several factors increase Zambia's risk of importing Clade I mpox:

1. Geographic proximity: Zambia shares a border with the DRC, the epicenter of the outbreak
2. The rapid timeline of regional spread: Multiple neighboring countries confirmed their first cases in just the last few weeks of July 2024[3]
3. The apparent ease of cross-border transmission based on recent patterns

## Protective Factors

Counterbalancing these risks are Zambia's protective measures:

1. The Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI) has implemented "a robust surveillance system that is actively monitoring potential Mpox cases in communities and healthcare facilities"[2]
2. The system is described as "swiftly identifying and responding to any suspected cases"[2]
3. Zambia is on "high alert" following the WHO's PHEIC declaration[2]

## Forecasting Considerations

When forecasting, I need to consider several additional factors:

- The time window is relatively short (approximately 38 days from the latest data point to October 1)
- The status quo favors a "No" outcome, as Zambia has maintained its mpox-free status so far
- However, the regional trend strongly suggests continued geographic expansion
- Detection capabilities may vary, potentially causing delays between actual cases and confirmations

As a professional forecaster, I recognize that while the status quo should be given significant weight, the rapidly evolving regional situation presents a substantial risk of change. The timeline of spread to other neighboring countries suggests that Zambia faces a genuine risk of confirming cases before October 1.

Balancing these factors, I assess there is a meaningful but not overwhelming probability that Zambia will confirm its first Clade I mpox case before October 1, 2024.

Probability: 35%
