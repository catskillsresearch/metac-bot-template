I'll now analyze the government shutdown forecast question for March 2025 based on the information available.

(a) Time left until outcome known: Approximately 24 days from today (May 6, 2025) until we will know the full answer looking back at March 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the search results, a continuing resolution was passed through March 14, 2025, and then another continuing resolution was passed on March 14, 2025, extending government funding through the end of the fiscal year (September 30, 2025). Therefore, the status quo outcome was 0 days of shutdown in March 2025.

(c) Scenario for unexpected outcome: An unexpected outcome could have occurred if the final continuing resolution on March 14 had failed to pass. Given the narrow margin in the House (217-213), even a small shift in votes could have prevented passage. If the bill had failed, the government would have shut down from March 15 through potentially the end of March, resulting in 16-17 days of shutdown in March.

Based on the search results, I can now provide my forecast analysis:

The search results clearly indicate that on March 14, 2025, both chambers of Congress passed a continuing resolution to extend government funding through the end of the fiscal year (September 30, 2025)[2]. The Senate passed this final continuing resolution by a vote of 54 to 46, while the House passed the measure by a narrow margin of 217 to 213[2]. President Trump signed the funding bill into law on March 15, 2025[2].

This information strongly indicates that there was no government shutdown in March 2025. The government was funded through March 14 by the previous continuing resolution signed in December 2024[3], and then the new continuing resolution was passed and signed just in time to prevent any lapse in funding.

While there was significant uncertainty leading up to the March 14 deadline, with sources from February 2025 indicating "no clear path to final FY25 agreement"[5], the legislative process ultimately succeeded in avoiding a shutdown. The narrow margin in the House vote (217-213) does suggest that the outcome was not certain until the final vote.

Looking at historical patterns, government shutdowns have occurred when funding deadlines are missed, but last-minute agreements to avoid shutdowns are also common. In this case, despite political tensions mentioned in the Politico article referenced in the query and the chaos created by a briefly-issued Executive Order in late January 2025[5], Congress managed to pass the necessary legislation to maintain government operations.

Given the evidence that the funding bill was signed into law on March 15, 2025, and there is no indication in any of the search results that a shutdown occurred at any point in March 2025, I can confidently conclude that there were 0 days of government shutdown in March 2025.

My final probabilities for the options:

0: 99%
1: 0.2%
2: 0.2%
3-4: 0.2%
5-7: 0.2%
8 or more: 0.2%
