(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of May 6, 2025, the ERA5 daily global surface air temperature for April 1, 2025, has likely been measured but not yet published as a finalized value in Copernicus's Climate Pulse. Typically, such data is released with a lag of weeks to a couple of months, so the result should become available within the next 1–2 months.

(b) **The outcome if nothing changed:**  
If temperatures held steady at recent February 2025 levels, the global average surface air temperature for April 1, 2025, would match the February 2025 value:  
- 13.36 °C (absolute), which is 1.59 °C above pre-industrial levels for that month[5].  
However, climatologically, April is typically warmer than February due to the seasonal cycle, so the actual value would be somewhat higher unless offset by other factors.

(c) **The outcome if the current trend continued:**  
From September 2023 to February 2025, most months saw global temperatures substantially above 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels, with sustained warming driven by above-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans[5].  
Seasonal forecasts for March–June 2025 predict a high probability of above-normal temperatures for nearly all regions globally, with oceanic warmth persisting despite ENSO-neutral conditions[1][2].  
If this trend persists, the global surface air temperature for April 1, 2025, would likely fall in the 13.4–14.0 °C range (absolute), corresponding to an anomaly of 1.5–1.7 °C above pre-industrial levels[5][1].

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
- The WMO and Copernicus Climate Service forecasts anticipate continued record or near-record warmth globally through spring 2025, driven by residual oceanic heat and no new cooling drivers[1][2].
- NOAA’s projections assign a significant probability (7.1%) to 2025 being the warmest year on record, with strong odds that April continues the streak of above-normal monthly values.
- The consensus is that global temperatures in early 2025 will remain within or above the range observed in late 2024 and early 2025, given persistent oceanic warmth and no strong La Niña event materializing.

(e) **A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:**  
A sudden, extreme volcanic eruption (VEI 6+) in March 2025 could inject vast clouds of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere, reflecting sunlight globally and causing a sharp, short-term drop in surface air temperatures on April 1, 2025.

(f) **A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:**  
A record-breaking early spring ocean marine heatwave, especially in the Atlantic or Indian Oceans, could further amplify air temperature globally. An abrupt, unanticipated surge in warming (e.g., due to a previously unmodeled positive feedback or a data artifact) could push April 1, 2025, to a new all-time daily record.
