(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of September 10, 2024, there are 20 days remaining before the October 1, 2024 deadline.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If no new post is made on the SpaceX Updates page by October 1, 2024, the outcome will be **No**.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Despite major missions occurring (such as Polaris Dawn or Crew-9), SpaceX does not publish any new post on its official Updates page, either due to a delayed update, internal communications decision, or a technical issue (e.g., the Updates page being offline when checked for resolution).

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
SpaceX publishes a new post on its Updates page between now and September 30, 2024, covering one or more of the following high-profile events: the Polaris Dawn mission (scheduled to launch around September 10, 2024), the NASA Crew-9 mission (no earlier than September 24, 2024), or other significant launches, in line with the company's usual practice of highlighting major milestones.

## Rationale

SpaceX regularly updates its official Updates page to highlight major programmatic events, particularly crewed missions and unique commercial achievements[1]. Recent history shows a strong correlation between high-profile missions and the posting of updates, although these are not strictly routine or guaranteed for every event.

Two major triggers are present:
- **Polaris Dawn**: Given its unique commercial spacewalk and historic high orbit, this mission represents a significant milestone likely to warrant an official update[3][4].
- **NASA’s Crew-9**: Routine for SpaceX to highlight crew launches; Crew-9, scheduled for late September, fits the profile for a featured update[2].

While there is always uncertainty—SpaceX may delay or skip updates, and there is a very low risk that the official page could be inaccessible at the resolution time—historical trends and current scheduling strongly favor at least one Update being posted in the window. The fact that the previous post was dated August 12, and multiple significant milestones are imminent, materially increases the likelihood of a new post.

However, good forecasting does not treat new information as a certainty. The status quo bias and occasional unpredictability in update timing mean a small residual chance of "No," especially if there are mission delays, SpaceX changes its communication schedule, or an unexpected technical/web issue arises.
