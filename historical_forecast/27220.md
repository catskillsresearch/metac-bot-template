(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**   
As of August 14, 2024, there are 48 days until October 1, 2024, when the question will resolve.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, Ukrainian forces have a confirmed presence at least five miles inside Russian territory, specifically within Kursk Oblast[2][3][4]. There are no credible reports or visual confirmations of Ukrainian regular forces holding territory at least five miles deep into any other Russian oblast as of now. If nothing changes, the outcome would be: Ukraine holds at least five miles into Kursk Oblast, but not into any other oblast—thus, the answer is "No."

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Ukraine maintains or marginally adjusts its positions in Kursk Oblast alone, but does not mount or sustain a comparable deep advance (≥5 miles) into any other Russian oblast visible on the ISW map by October 1, 2024. Russian countermeasures, logistical limits, or international considerations prevent expansion of the operation beyond Kursk. This is the current trajectory[1][2][4].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Ukraine achieves and sustains a comparable cross-border offensive (≥5 miles deep) into another Russian region—most likely Belgorod or Bryansk oblasts—alongside maintaining the Kursk advance, with such gains explicitly shown on the ISW map (and not subsequently reversed or lost by October 1, 2024). This would reflect either opportunistic exploitation of Russian defensive weaknesses, a significant shift in Ukrainian strategy, or a breakdown in Russian border defense across multiple sectors. There are currently no confirmed indications of this scenario developing, though Russian authorities have included these regions in their counterterrorism zone, suggesting at least a perceived risk[1].

## Rationale

The **status quo**—that only Kursk Oblast is deeply penetrated and held by Ukrainian forces—remains the likeliest outcome as of mid-August 2024. The shock and scale of the Kursk offensive mark a major escalation and demonstrate Ukraine’s evolving capabilities, yet there is as yet no verified evidence of similar Ukrainian advances into other Russian oblasts[2][3][4].

Russian responses, including the declaration of a counterterrorism operation covering Belgorod and Bryansk oblasts, suggest concerns about potential further incursions, but this has not yet materialized in the form of confirmed Ukrainian territorial control in those regions[1].

Expanding and holding additional five-mile-deep advances into further oblasts would require significant additional resources, successful exploitation of Russian weaknesses, and time—all under the pressure of Russian reinforcements and uncertain international reaction. The operation in Kursk was a major surprise, but military and political inertia tends to favor incremental rather than dramatic changes. Thus, barring unforeseen breakthroughs or repeated collapses in Russian defense, **the most likely path is that Ukraine will consolidate its gains in Kursk without replicating them elsewhere by October 1**.
