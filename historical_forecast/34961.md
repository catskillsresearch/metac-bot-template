(a) Time left until outcome: 47 days (from May 6, 2025 until March 31, 2025 - this is actually in the past based on today's date)

(b) Status quo outcome: The current price as of May 6, 2025 is around $199.30 to $200.28 according to the search results, which is hovering very close to the $200 threshold.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Continuing bearish sentiment coupled with the current technical indicators (below 50-day and 200-day moving averages, low RSI, Fear index) push the stock below $200 even briefly during intraday trading before March 31, 2025.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Apple stock maintains support at the $200 level despite negative sentiment, perhaps due to broader market strength or positive company developments that offset the China and AI challenges.

Given that the question is asking about whether Apple stock continuously remained above $200 through March 31, 2025, and today's date is May 6, 2025, I'll analyze the historical data provided to determine what actually happened.

Based on the search results, as of May 6, 2025, Apple's current price is cited as $199.30 in one source[1] and $200.28 in another source[2]. The discrepancy suggests the stock is fluctuating around the $200 mark. The technical indicators show that the stock is in a bearish trend with a Fear & Greed Index of 39 (Fear) and trading below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages[1].

The data indicates that Apple stock has recently experienced some downward pressure. According to the first search result, the current sentiment is bearish, with a 14-day RSI of 33.06, suggesting the stock is approaching oversold territory[1]. The stock has been volatile with a 6.25% price volatility over the last 30 days, though it did have 67% green days during that period[1].

Looking at the forecasts, one prediction suggested that Apple's value would drop by -2.84% to reach $194.71 per share by June 4, 2025[1], which would put it below the $200 threshold. This suggests that the stock may have already dipped below $200 at some point before the current date.

Given that the current price is showing as $199.30 in one source[1], which is below the $200 threshold, it appears that the stock has already broken below the $200 mark. Even if we take the slightly higher price of $200.28 from the second source[2], the bearish indicators and downward forecast suggest that the stock has likely traded below $200 at some point during the period in question.

The question specifically states that if the price is ever below $200.00 (including as an intraday low) before March 31, 2025, the question resolves as "No." Given the current technical indicators and the fact that one source already shows the price below $200, it is highly probable that Apple stock did not continuously remain above $200 through March 31, 2025.

Probability: 5%
