(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Is Known:**  
There are 9 days remaining until July 21, 2024.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changed:**  
As of July 5, 2024, the BSE SENSEX was trading at approximately 80,050, which is significantly higher than the questioned range of greater than 75,000 and less than or equal to 77,000[3]. If the current trend continues, the SENSEX would close above 77,000—outside the specified range.

(c) **Scenario for a No Outcome:**  
The SENSEX closes above 77,000 or at or below 75,000 on July 21. Given its current levels, the most likely "No" scenario is continued bullish or stable markets, with the index remaining above 77,000.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes Outcome:**  
The SENSEX would need to experience a sharp, rapid correction of about 3,000-5,000 points (approximately 4-6%) to fall into the 75,000-77,000 band in just over a week. This would likely require a significant negative catalyst, such as a major global market selloff, severe policy-related disappointment, large-scale foreign investor outflows, or a pronounced negative surprise in India’s Q1 corporate earnings.

## Rationale

- **Current Trend:** The SENSEX is not only above the upper bound of the target range but also showing continued positive momentum, with technical indicators in early July suggesting bullish sentiment and no imminent signs of a large downturn[2][3].
- **Support Levels:** Recent technical analysis placed major market support above the 77,000 mark, making a drop to the questioned range less likely unless driven by a substantial negative shock[4].
- **Market Volatility:** While Indian markets can be volatile, a 4-6% correction within a week without a clear catalyst is rare, especially when investor sentiment, sector momentum, and foreign investment flows remain positive or stable[2][3].
- **Event Risk:** The only plausible path to a "Yes" is a sudden adverse event—such as unexpectedly bad macroeconomic data, policy gridlock fears intensifying, or a global risk-off scenario—but as of the latest data, such risks appear contained.

Given the strong upward trend, technical supports above 77,000, and absence of clear catalysts for a large rapid drop, the likelihood that the SENSEX will close greater than 75,000 and less than or equal to 77,000 on July 21, 2024 is very low.

**Probability: 4%**
