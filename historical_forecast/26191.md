(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
As of July 16, 2024, there are 37 days until August 22, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
President Joe Biden remains the Democratic candidate, does not release his delegates, does not endorse another candidate, and does not resign the presidency. Therefore, the question resolves as **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Biden continues to publicly and privately assert he will remain in the race, withstands pressure from Democratic lawmakers and party elites, avoids any major new health issue or scandal, and is formally nominated—either via a virtual roll call or at the Democratic National Convention—without taking any of the four specified actions. He does not officially announce withdrawal, release delegates, endorse a replacement, or leave the presidency.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Biden or his campaign formally announces before August 22, 2024, that he will not seek or accept the nomination; or he officially releases his delegates via a campaign statement; or he endorses another person to be the Democratic nominee; or he ceases to be president. This could be triggered by a tipping point in party pressure, further health revelations, or a catastrophic campaign development.

## Rationale

- **Weight of the Status Quo:**  
Presidents and major party nominees in U.S. history almost never withdraw this late in the cycle, especially after public vows to stay in the race. Biden has been adamant in rejecting calls to exit, telling Congress and the public he is "firmly committed to staying in this race" and has repeatedly said he is "not going anywhere" and will "beat Trump"[3][4]. The White House and campaign leadership have reinforced this, and there is currently no public indication Biden is reconsidering, despite pressure and poor polling.

- **Mounting Pressure and Party Dynamics:**  
The number of Democratic lawmakers calling for Biden to leave has grown[5], and recent polling shows most Democratic voters now favor a different nominee. Nonetheless, the party’s top leaders (Pelosi, Schumer, Obama) have largely continued to support his candidacy, and there is no clear consensus on an alternative. The DNC is considering an early virtual roll call to solidify Biden's nomination, a sign the party infrastructure is still aligned behind him for now.

- **Risks, Uncertainties, and Wildcards:**  
If the trend of Democratic defections accelerates, or if new health or stamina revelations emerge, the probability of Biden withdrawing increases. However, absent a dramatic escalation—such as a mass coordinated public revolt by party leadership, a critical health event, or Biden himself reconsidering his stance—the default expectation is that he will not take any of the actions that would trigger a Yes resolution before August 22.

- **Historical Precedent:**  
There are virtually no modern examples of a major party presumptive nominee stepping aside this late in the process, especially after being formally nominated or with the convention so close. The 1968 LBJ case—and the Eagleton VP switch—came much earlier in the cycle and under different circumstances.

## Final Answer

Probability: **25%**

This reflects that while the probability of Biden withdrawing or triggering any of the specified Yes criteria has increased substantially due to post-debate developments, polling, and cracks within the party, the status quo, institutional inertia, lack of a clear replacement, and Biden’s personal resolve still make withdrawal relatively unlikely. However, the risk is no longer negligible and could rise further if party sentiment shifts decisively or Biden’s health suddenly deteriorates.
