(a) Time left until outcome is known: 1 month and 15 days (from today, May 6, 2025, until April 1, 2025 - this is already in the past)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No agreement has been signed as of the latest information available (February 2025).

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Negotiations continue to face delays due to political instability in Syria, regional opposition from Greece and the Greek Cypriot administration, or technical disagreements over specific maritime boundaries. The process extends beyond April 1, 2025, as Turkey waits for a fully permanent government to be established in Syria.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Turkey and Syria expedite negotiations following the establishment of stable authority in Damascus. Both countries prioritize the agreement as a cornerstone of their renewed relationship, leading to a signing ceremony before April 1, 2025, to capitalize on mutual interests in energy exploration and regional positioning.

Based on the available information, I need to assess whether Turkey and Syria announced the signing of a maritime demarcation agreement before April 1, 2025. As a professional forecaster, I must analyze the evidence systematically.

The question asks about an event that would have occurred between February 14, 2025 (the date of the latest available information) and April 1, 2025. Since today's date is May 6, 2025, this is a past event, but the search results only provide information up to February 2025.

From the search results, I can determine several key points:

1. As of February 2025, Turkey and Syria were in talks about a potential maritime demarcation agreement, but no agreement had been signed yet[1][2].

2. Turkish Transport Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu specifically stated that while such an agreement was "on their agenda," it was contingent on "an authority first being established" in Syria[2][5]. This suggests that Turkey was waiting for greater political stability in Syria before finalizing any agreement.

3. Following the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime, Syria was under an interim administration as of December 2024/early 2025[2][5]. The Turkish officials emphasized that negotiations would proceed "when the time is right"[5].

4. Both countries showed interest in the agreement as it would enable "oil and hydrocarbon exploration" and potentially lead to broader cooperation in trade, energy, and defense[1][2][5].

5. Turkey was actively working on improving relations with Syria across multiple domains, including providing electricity and resuming banking relations[4].

Given this information, several factors weigh against an agreement being signed before April 1, 2025:

- The explicit statements from Turkish officials about waiting for proper authority to be established in Syria
- The relatively short timeframe (approximately 1.5 months) between the latest information and the April 1 deadline
- The complexity of maritime delimitation negotiations, which typically take considerable time

Factors suggesting an agreement might have been signed:

- The strong mutual interest in such an agreement
- The precedent of Turkey's swift agreement with Libya in 2019
- The active diplomatic engagement between the countries

Giving extra weight to the status quo, and considering that international agreements of this nature typically take considerable time to negotiate, draft, and formalize, especially with a country undergoing political transition, it seems unlikely that Turkey and Syria would have finalized and announced such an agreement in the short window between February and April 2025.

Probability: 20%
