(a) The time left until the outcome is known: 68 days (from May 6, 2025 to September 30, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Hawaiian Electric Company has not filed for bankruptcy yet, and appears to be actively working to avoid it.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: The reported $4 billion settlement is finalized before September 30, 2024, allowing Hawaiian Electric to resolve its wildfire liabilities without filing for bankruptcy. The settlement, combined with other financing mechanisms like the "bankruptcy remote" special purpose entity, provides sufficient financial stability to weather the crisis.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: The tentative $4 billion settlement talks collapse, leaving Hawaiian Electric with unmanageable wildfire liabilities exceeding $4.9 billion. With legislative bailout efforts having failed and access to credit severely constrained, the company determines bankruptcy is the only viable option to continue operations while resolving claims.

Based on the available information, I assess that Hawaiian Electric Company is facing severe financial challenges but appears to have a potential path to avoid bankruptcy. The company is actively pursuing strategies to remain solvent, with the most promising being the reported $4 billion settlement that could resolve its wildfire liabilities.

Several factors suggest bankruptcy is a significant risk:

1. The company has admitted that its downed powerlines initially caused the Maui fires, creating substantial legal exposure.
2. HECO's estimated liabilities exceed $4.9 billion, far surpassing its insurance coverage and equity base.
3. The company has lost access to commercial paper and unsecured financing markets, with credit ratings under negative watch.
4. Legislative efforts to bail out the company have failed, removing a potential safety net.
5. HECO is implementing strategies often used by distressed companies, such as creating "bankruptcy remote" entities for accounts receivable.

However, there are also significant factors pointing toward the company avoiding bankruptcy:

1. As of July 2024, a tentative $4 billion settlement was reportedly in progress, which caused HECO's stock to rise 30%.
2. Company leadership has explicitly stated their goal is to avoid bankruptcy.
3. HECO provides 95% of Hawaii's electrical coverage, creating strong incentives for state and federal authorities to find alternatives to bankruptcy.
4. The Hawaii Public Utilities Commission has approved a $190 million resilience program, showing some regulatory support.
5. Unlike PG&E's case, where wildfire liabilities were estimated at over $20 billion, HECO's potential exposure, while substantial, may be more manageable with the right settlement.

The status quo indicates the company has not filed for bankruptcy and is actively working on alternatives. Given the reported settlement discussions and the strong incentives to avoid bankruptcy (both for the company and the state of Hawaii), there appears to be a viable path forward that doesn't involve bankruptcy before September 30, 2024.

However, if settlement talks collapse or prove insufficient, bankruptcy remains a distinct possibility given the magnitude of the financial challenges. The company's creation of bankruptcy-remote structures suggests they are preparing for all contingencies.
