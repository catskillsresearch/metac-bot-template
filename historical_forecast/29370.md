(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 6 days
(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Oregon currently uses traditional winner-take-all voting for federal and state elections
(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: Voters are persuaded by concerns about implementation costs, lack of infrastructure, and complexity of the new system. County clerks' opposition resonates with voters who prefer the familiarity of the current system, and the measure fails to gain majority support.
(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The strong legislative support, endorsements from prominent organizations, and positive experiences in jurisdictions already using RCV convince voters that this is a beneficial electoral reform. Voters are persuaded by arguments that RCV ensures majority winners and promotes more civil campaigns.

As a professional forecaster, I need to carefully analyze the available information about Oregon Measure 117 to determine the likelihood of its passage in the upcoming election.

## Current Support and Opposition

Measure 117 would implement ranked choice voting (RCV) for federal and statewide races in Oregon by 2028[1][4]. The measure has significant institutional backing, having been referred to voters by the 2023 Oregon Legislature with strong support - 35 yea votes in the House and 17 yea votes in the Senate[3]. This legislative support suggests the measure has substantial political backing.

The measure has also garnered endorsements from influential organizations including:
- League of Women Voters of Oregon
- Oregon American Civil Liberties Union
- Various labor unions[5]

However, there is notable opposition from:
- Some Republican lawmakers concerned about complexity and potential for errors
- County clerks worried about infrastructure and funding
- The Equal Vote Coalition[1]

## Contextual Factors

Several jurisdictions in Oregon have already adopted or are implementing RCV:
- Corvallis and Benton County currently use it
- Portland voters passed it for mayor and city council elections
- Multnomah County will begin using it in 2026[1][5]

This suggests growing familiarity with RCV among Oregon voters, which may reduce resistance based on unfamiliarity. Additionally, more than 50 jurisdictions across the United States already use RCV, including entire states like Maine and Alaska[5].

## Implementation Considerations

If approved, the measure would not take effect until 2028, providing a four-year implementation period[5]. This extended timeline might mitigate some voter concerns about rushed implementation.

The estimated financial impact is approximately $0.9 million during the 2023-25 biennium for initial implementation steps[3]. While this is a significant cost, it's relatively modest for a statewide voting system change.

## Status Quo Bias and Uncertainty

As a forecaster, I must account for status quo bias - voters often prefer the familiar to the new. Voting systems are fundamental to democracy, and changes to them can face resistance simply due to unfamiliarity. However, the local adoption of RCV in parts of Oregon may somewhat counter this bias.

Key uncertainties include:
- Voter education: Will voters understand RCV sufficiently to support it?
- Partisan divide: Will the apparent partisan split on the measure influence voter decisions?
- Implementation concerns: Will fears about infrastructure and funding sway voters?

## Forecast Rationale

Looking at the legislative support, organizational endorsements, and existing RCV implementations in Oregon, there are strong factors favoring passage. The measure passed with substantial legislative majorities, suggesting broad political support.

However, I must weigh this against the natural resistance to changing fundamental democratic processes. The concerns raised by county clerks about infrastructure and funding represent legitimate implementation challenges that could resonate with voters.

The partisan dimension is also significant - with most Republican lawmakers opposing the measure. In a closely divided electorate, this could affect outcomes depending on turnout patterns.

Taking all these factors into account, while also acknowledging that changes to voting systems often face significant resistance, I assess that Measure 117 has a slightly better than even chance of passage, but with substantial uncertainty given the fundamental nature of the proposed change.

Probability: 55%
