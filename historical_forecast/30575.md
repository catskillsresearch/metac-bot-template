(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
The outcome will be determined after December 31, 2024, when reliable data from both weather stations are available. As of November 29, 2024, this is a little over one month away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, Chicago tends to record lower absolute minimum temperatures in December than Anchorage. This has held true in most recent years, including 2017, where Chicago was colder. However, the exceptions (such as December 2022, when Anchorage was colder) prove that this outcome is not guaranteed.

(c) **Scenario for No outcome (Chicago colder):**  
Chicago experiences an Arctic outbreak or polar vortex event, resulting in a brief but intense cold snap with temperatures plunging to -5°F, -10°F, or lower at Midway Airport. Meanwhile, Anchorage, although cold, avoids a major cold air event and bottoms out around 0°F to -5°F.

(d) **Scenario for Yes outcome (Anchorage colder):**  
Anchorage experiences a significant cold snap resembling the one in early 2024, with lows potentially below -10°F or even -20°F at Ted Stevens International[1][3][5], while Chicago's December remains relatively mild, with minimum temperatures only dropping to the single digits or just below zero.

## Rationale

- Anchorage is capable of experiencing extreme cold, as shown by the **-21°F at the Airport in February 2024**[1][3]. However, **Anchorage's minimum December temperatures at the airport station are often above -10°F** in recent years, with colder readings often recorded at other stations (not used for this question)[5].
- Chicago, despite being farther south, is susceptible to intense cold outbreaks when Arctic air moves south, especially during polar vortex disruptions. In several recent Decembers, Chicago has recorded lower monthly minimums than Anchorage. For instance, Chicago reached -9°F in December 2022, while Anchorage reached -12°F, but in other years, Chicago was the colder city.
- The most likely (status quo) outcome is that **Chicago will record a lower December minimum** due to its greater vulnerability to sudden, severe Arctic fronts. While Anchorage can get very cold, its coastal location and prevailing weather patterns often moderate temperatures compared to interior Alaska.
- Recent climate patterns (including an "El Niño" winter in 2023–2024) have brought significant variability, but Anchorage’s coldest monthly minimums at the airport station still struggle to beat Chicago’s extremes unless Anchorage experiences an exceptional cold snap.

## Probability Estimate

Given that:
- The status quo favors Chicago being colder in December.
- Exceptional cold is possible for Anchorage but requires a rare, intense event at the specific airport station.
- The climate in 2024 so far has produced some notable cold but not record-shattering at Anchorage airport[1][3][5].

**Probability: 30%**

There is about a 30% chance that Anchorage’s airport will record a lower minimum temperature than Chicago’s Midway Airport in December 2024, meaning the more likely outcome is still that Chicago will be colder.
