I'll analyze the question about registered Syrian refugees in Turkey by March 1, 2025, based on the information provided.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
The outcome will be known when UNHCR data is accessed on or after March 1, 2025. As of today (May 6, 2025), this data is already available, as we're past the resolution date.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
Based on the search results, the last confirmed figure was around 3.47 million registered Syrian refugees in Turkey at the end of 2023.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
The search results indicate there has been a gradual decline in registered Syrian refugee numbers, with UNHCR verifying over 34,000 spontaneous returns to Syria in just the first eight months of 2024. This suggests a continuing downward trend.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
According to UNHCR's 2025 planning, spontaneous returns to Syria were expected to continue throughout 2025, indicating a continued gradual decrease in the refugee population in Turkey. However, Turkey still remains a major host country with significant numbers of Syrian refugees.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An acceleration in the voluntary repatriation program or a major policy shift by the Turkish government facilitating returns could have resulted in a sharper decline in registered refugee numbers. Additionally, if there had been significant improvements in the security situation in Syria, this might have encouraged more returns.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A renewed escalation of conflict in Syria, particularly in areas bordering Turkey, could have triggered new refugee movements into Turkey. Additionally, if Turkey had implemented new registration initiatives to document previously unregistered Syrians in urban areas (similar to the registration effort mentioned in 2013), the official numbers could have increased.

Based on the information available, I estimate the following distribution for the number of registered Syrian refugees in Turkey on March 1, 2025:

Percentile 10: 3.32 million
Percentile 20: 3.36 million
Percentile 40: 3.40 million
Percentile 60: 3.43 million
Percentile 80: 3.45 million
Percentile 90: 3.47 million
