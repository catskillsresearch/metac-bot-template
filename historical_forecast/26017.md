(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**  
The observation window runs from July 1, 2024, through September 30, 2024. As of today (July 11, 2024), there are approximately 81 days remaining until the outcome is resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**  
As of July 11, 2024, there are no Starship launches confirmed to occur in the July–September window on any of the authoritative public launch manifests[1][2][3][4]. If this situation persists, the outcome will be “No”—no Starship launch will reach 160 km in the window.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**  
Several plausible scenarios would lead to a “No” outcome:
- No Starship launches occur at all between July 1 and September 30, 2024.  
- More than one Starship launch occurs and at least two reach the 160 km threshold.  
- A launch is attempted but does not reach 160 km due to failure before that altitude.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**  
A “Yes” would result only if:
- Exactly one Starship launch occurs in the window, and  
- That launch reaches at least 160 km altitude,  
- No other Starship launches reach or exceed 160 km in this period.

## Rationale & Probability Assessment

SpaceX has an ambitious cadence for Starship but a historical pattern of schedule slips and regulatory delays. As of July 11, 2024:
- There are no confirmed Starship launches between July 1 and September 30 listed on SpaceX’s official launch page or major flight tracking sites[1][2][3][4].
- Starship Flight 4 was targeted for June, and while additional flights in 2024 remain an aspiration, none are on the books for the relevant window as of now[5].
- SpaceX sometimes announces launches on shorter notice, but regulatory approval and testing requirements mean a launch is unlikely to be added and executed within a short timeframe, especially for a program with Starship’s complexity and oversight.

Given these facts, the **status quo strongly favors “No launch”** within the window—this aligns with the usual slow pace of program changes and public schedule updates. Even if a launch were scheduled late in the window, it could easily slip beyond September due to regulation, weather, or technical readiness.

A “Yes” outcome requires a very specific combination:
- Only one successful launch (no more, no less),
- That launch reaching or exceeding 160 km.

Given historical cadence, technical, and regulatory constraints, this is unlikely.

**Probability: 20%**

- The majority likelihood is “No”—either zero launches or more than one—given the absence of scheduled Starship flights and SpaceX’s developmental history.
- Assigning a modest probability (20%) to “Yes” accounts for SpaceX’s capacity for rapid schedule changes and surprise launches, but the base rate of such developments is low given all prior evidence and the absence of official scheduling[1][2][3][4].
