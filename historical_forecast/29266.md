(a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**  
Approximately 2 months and 4 days remain until January 1, 2025.

(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed.**  
If nothing changes—meaning no new announcement is posted on Revolut’s official News & Media page before January 1, 2025—the outcome will be **No**.

(c) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.**  
Revolut continues to work on its stablecoin project or explore expansion in crypto offerings, but does not post an official announcement regarding launching its own stablecoin on its News & Media page before the deadline. Media leaks, regulatory hurdles, or strategy shifts delay or prevent any official communication.

(d) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.**  
Revolut finalizes its stablecoin project and, before the end of 2024, publishes an official announcement on its News & Media site explicitly stating it is launching its own stablecoin. This satisfies the strict resolution criteria.

## Rationale

The status quo strongly favors a **No** outcome. As of October 28, 2024, there is no official announcement on Revolut’s News & Media page regarding a stablecoin launch. While several credible industry reports and leaks suggest Revolut is actively developing a stablecoin and may be “quite far along” in the process, none of these sources meet the criteria for resolution—only an official announcement on Revolut’s specified site counts[1][2][4].

Most major product launches or strategic moves by a regulated fintech like Revolut are preceded by formal regulatory filings, gradual customer or investor briefings, and typically announced after final compliance checks. The remaining two months are a short window for a first-ever stablecoin announcement, especially in a regulatory climate that demands caution and preparation. The likelihood that a project already subject to leaks and speculation suddenly becomes the subject of an official public launch before year-end is possible, but not the base case.

The main factors that could accelerate a “Yes” outcome would be a regulatory green light or competitive necessity (e.g., a rival releases a high-impact stablecoin). However, there is no evidence of such an impending competitive deadline or regulatory breakthrough as of late October. Revolut’s public statements remain cautious, only referencing the intention to “further grow” its crypto offerings, not to specifically launch a stablecoin[4].

Given historic trends—where new products from large fintechs tend to lag leaks by several months to a year, and considering the strict requirement for an official announcement on the specific News & Media site—an announcement before January 1, 2025, appears less likely than not, though not impossible.
