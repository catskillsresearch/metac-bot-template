(a) The time left until the outcome is known is 26 days (from May 6, 2025, to January 1, 2025).

(b) The status quo outcome is "No" - as of now, only one executive order has been signed after Election Day (November 5, 2024), specifically on November 21, 2024, regarding a New Jersey transit union dispute.

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome: President Biden maintains his recent pattern of limited executive order issuance (0-1 per month as seen in several months of 2024), possibly focusing on transition activities rather than new policy initiatives through executive action.

(d) A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: President Biden issues at least two more executive orders in December 2024, potentially to secure policy legacies before leaving office, address emerging crises, or implement priorities that haven't made it through legislative channels.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the likelihood of President Biden signing at least two more executive orders before January 1, 2025.

Looking at historical patterns, Biden's executive order activity has varied throughout his presidency. While he issued 25 orders in his first month in office, his monthly average has settled to approximately 37 per year, the third-lowest among recent presidents[5]. The current count stands at 143 executive orders total, with only one issued in November 2024.

December has historically been a moderately active month for Biden's executive orders:
- December 2021: 6 orders
- December 2022: 2 orders 
- December 2023: 3 orders

This suggests an average of about 3-4 executive orders each December, which would be sufficient to reach the threshold if the pattern continues. However, 2024 has shown decreased executive order activity, with Biden issuing zero orders in January, May, August, and October[5].

It's also worth noting that presidents sometimes increase executive order activity in their final months to cement their policy legacies. However, this is balanced against the fact that Biden has already been relatively restrained with executive orders compared to his predecessor, and there's no clear indication of planned increases.

The most reliable predictor may be recent behavior: Biden issued only one executive order in November 2024, continuing a pattern of limited executive action in the latter part of 2024. Without specific information about planned executive orders, the status quo suggests we should expect similar restraint in December.

Given the historical December patterns versus the recent slowdown in executive order activity, and considering the lack of announced plans for significant executive actions, I estimate there's about a 40% chance that Biden will sign at least two more executive orders before January 1, 2025, which would bring the total to three or more after Election Day.

Probability: 40%
