(a) Time until outcome: 20 days (from today, March 12, 2025, until after April 1, 2025, when Metaculus will access the leaderboard)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the most recent information available, Alibaba's Qwen2.5-Max has surpassed previous leaders, including models from OpenAI and DeepSeek, suggesting that an OpenAI model is currently not in the #1 position.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: Alibaba continues to invest heavily in improving Qwen2.5-Max and maintains its lead over OpenAI models throughout March. Additionally, other competitors like DeepSeek release updated versions that perform exceptionally well in the Arena's pairwise comparisons, further pushing OpenAI out of the top spot.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: OpenAI releases a significant update to its GPT-4o model before the end of March 2025, incorporating new capabilities that dramatically improve its performance in user evaluations. This allows it to regain the #1 position (or tie for it) just before the Q1 assessment deadline.

As a professional forecaster, I need to carefully analyze the available evidence to determine the likelihood of an OpenAI model being ranked #1 on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of Q1 2025.

## Current Landscape Analysis

The search results indicate that as of recent updates (early March 2025), Alibaba's Qwen2.5-Max has made significant strides and surpassed established models including DeepSeek's V3[2]. This suggests that OpenAI models are no longer in the sole #1 position they held in December 2024, when ChatGPT-4o-latest was tied for first place.

The Chatbot Arena uses a dynamic Elo rating system based on pairwise comparisons where users evaluate two anonymous models side-by-side[2]. This methodology means rankings can shift quickly if users consistently prefer one model over another in direct comparisons.

## Historical Performance Considerations

OpenAI has historically maintained strong positions on the leaderboard. However, the LLM landscape is described as "highly competitive, with new models constantly challenging the status quo"[2]. This indicates that maintaining the top position is increasingly difficult as competitors rapidly improve their models.

## Forecasting Community Insights

The Metaculus prediction from January 31, 2025, suggests a community forecast that OpenAI's leading model (referred to as "o3") would maintain approximately a 19.2 Elo point lead over the next best competitor by April 5, 2025[5]. However, this prediction shows significant uncertainty, with the 25%-75% confidence interval ranging from -4.7 to >30 points. This wide range indicates substantial disagreement among forecasters about OpenAI's continued dominance.

## Timing and Competitive Dynamics

With only 20 days remaining until the outcome determination, we need to consider both momentum and potential for change:

1. **Momentum**: Recent reports indicate Alibaba's Qwen2.5-Max has gained significant ground and potentially overtaken previous leaders[2].

2. **Potential for change**: OpenAI could release a substantial update to GPT-4o before April 1, which could quickly alter the rankings.

## Status Quo Bias Adjustment

As noted in the instructions, good forecasters typically give extra weight to status quo outcomes since dramatic changes tend to be less common than continuity. The most recent information indicates that OpenAI is likely no longer in the #1 position, having been surpassed by Alibaba's Qwen2.5-Max[2].

While OpenAI could certainly regain the top position with a significant update, the short timeframe (20 days) makes this less likely without a major, already-planned release. Additionally, competitors are clearly demonstrating their ability to challenge and sometimes exceed OpenAI's capabilities.

## Final Assessment

Considering the recent advancement of Alibaba's model, the dynamic nature of the leaderboard, the short timeframe remaining, and applying appropriate weight to the status quo, I believe an OpenAI model is unlikely to be ranked #1 (or tied for #1) on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of Q1 2025.

Probability: 35%
