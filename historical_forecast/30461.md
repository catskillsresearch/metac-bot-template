(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) for November 2024 will be published on or shortly after December 12, 2024. As of November 25, 2024, about 2-3 weeks remain until the actual outcome is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Based on Zillow's most recent public projections and reported data, Baltimore, MD's home prices are forecast to decline year-over-year in November 2024. Specifically, Zillow projected a -2.9% change in the ZHVI from November 2023 to November 2024[1]. Other sources corroborate a flat or slightly negative outlook, with one forecasting a 0.1% decrease by November 2024[4]. Therefore, if market trends remain as forecast, the outcome will be **No**—the year-over-year increase will not reach 2.0%.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If the Baltimore metro housing market continues on its current trajectory—marked by softening demand, increased inventory, and no significant policy interventions or sudden positive shocks—then home values will either decline or remain flat, resulting in less than a 2.0% year-over-year increase per Zillow's reported ZHVI[1][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
To achieve a year-over-year increase of at least 2.0%, Baltimore's home prices would need to reverse current negative or flat trends. This could occur if, for example, there was a sudden surge in buyer demand, a sharp drop in interest rates, a change in inventory constraints, or a major economic event favorably impacting housing. As of the current data and reporting, no such developments have been observed or projected[1][2][4].

## Rationale

- **Zillow's January 2024 forecast projected a -2.9% year-over-year change for Baltimore's ZHVI by November 2024[1].**
- Other up-to-date forecasts for Maryland and Baltimore specifically showed at best near-flat movement, with a 0.1% decline by November 2024[4].
- Recent market commentary (as of November 2024) highlights a cooling national housing market and a trend toward "neutral" or "buyers" market conditions, making a sharp local rebound highly improbable[2].
- There have been no reported shocks, policy announcements, or economic changes that would plausibly drive a turnaround sufficient to yield a 2%+ YoY increase for Baltimore.
- Data from October 2024 for major metros showed Baltimore among markets not experiencing price highs, consistent with a stagnating or declining price pattern[5].

Given the heavy weight of the status quo—slow-moving changes in real estate, recent negative trend projections, and an absence of any upside catalyst—the probability Baltimore's ZHVI shows ≥2.0% YoY growth for November 2024 is extremely low.

**Probability: 2%**
