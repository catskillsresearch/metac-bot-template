Based on the available evidence, I need to assess whether Prince Tom Iseghohi will win the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election in Nigeria.

(a) Time until outcome is known: 2 days, as the election is scheduled for September 21, 2024, and today is May 6, 2025. However, the election and its results are now in the past.

(b) Status quo outcome: Prince Tom Iseghohi did not win the election, as he withdrew from the race before election day.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The scenario that led to a No outcome has already occurred - Iseghohi withdrew from the gubernatorial race on September 16, 2024, and endorsed the APC candidate Monday Okpebholo.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: For a Yes outcome to have occurred, Iseghohi would have needed to remain in the race, not withdraw his candidacy, and then secure enough votes to win the election despite competing against candidates from larger parties like APC and PDP.

## Analysis of Prince Tom Iseghohi's Electoral Prospects

Prince Tom Iseghohi's journey in the 2024 Edo gubernatorial election was relatively short-lived. After initially securing the Action Alliance (AA) ticket in April 2024, following his departure from the Labour Party due to what he cited as "lack of transparency and monetisation of the process," Iseghohi positioned himself as a contender in what was described as a "four-horse race"[1].

During this period, there were some positive indicators for his campaign. The National Chairman of AA, Chief Kenneth Udeze, noted that Iseghohi had helped grow the party from "one of the smallest in Edo State to the fourth largest and fastest growing party in the state in four weeks"[1]. This suggested some momentum for his campaign.

However, the most critical development occurred shortly before the election. On September 16, 2024, just five days before the scheduled election, Prince Tom Iseghohi withdrew from the gubernatorial race entirely[5]. Not only did he withdraw, but he also pledged support for the APC's candidate, Monday Okpebholo, promising to mobilize 65,000 people to vote for the APC[5].

## Contextual Factors

Several contextual factors are worth noting:

1. Historical precedent: Since 1999, only two political parties—PDP and APC—have produced governors in Edo State[3]. This historical pattern already placed Iseghohi at a disadvantage as an AA candidate.

2. Iseghohi's own assessment: In an interview, Iseghohi himself acknowledged that only seven political parties could realistically produce the next governor of Edo state, and after eliminating Labour Party, PDP, and APC from his considerations, he was in conversation with one of the remaining parties[4]. This suggests he recognized the challenges facing his candidacy.

3. Timing of withdrawal: The withdrawal occurred very close to the election date, leaving essentially no time for any reversal or re-entry into the race.

## Conclusion

Given the definitive evidence that Prince Tom Iseghohi withdrew from the race and endorsed another candidate just days before the election, there is no realistic scenario in which he could have won the September 21, 2024 Edo gubernatorial election. His withdrawal from the race removes any possibility of him becoming governor through this election.

While earlier reports in April 2024 positioned him as a potential contender, the most recent information before the election clearly indicates he was no longer in the race. The status quo outcome (that he did not win) is the only reasonable conclusion based on the available evidence.

Probability: 0%
