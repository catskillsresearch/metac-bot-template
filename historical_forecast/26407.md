(a) Time left until outcome: 69 days (from today, May 6, 2025, until September 30, 2024 - which has already passed)

(b) Status quo outcome: No - Russia did not initiate a second formal mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, continuing to rely on crypto-mobilization instead.

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: Russia maintained its crypto-mobilization strategy through September 30, 2024, successfully generating enough troops (though of lower quality) to sustain operations without resorting to politically unpopular formal mobilization.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: Russia's casualty rates exceeded crypto-mobilization replacement capabilities, forcing the Kremlin to announce a second formal mobilization despite political concerns, which was reported by ISW before September 30, 2024.

Based on the search results provided, there is no indication that Russia initiated a second formal mobilization before September 30, 2024. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) consistently reported that Russia was relying on "crypto-mobilization" efforts rather than formal mobilization to sustain its military operations in Ukraine.

The ISW assessment from May 3, 2024, explicitly states: "ISW continues to assess that the Kremlin will rely on crypto-mobilization efforts and remains unlikely to conduct another unpopular wave of partial mobilization"[5]. This assessment was made just a few months before the September 30, 2024 deadline, indicating that ISW did not anticipate a formal mobilization before that date.

Similarly, the June 6, 2024 assessment indicates that Russia would likely fall short of its immediate and near-term force generation goals, even with intensified crypto-mobilization efforts[4]. This suggests Russia was continuing with its crypto-mobilization strategy rather than resorting to formal mobilization.

The search results consistently show that Russia's strategy was to avoid another wave of partial mobilization due to its unpopularity. The March 21, 2024 assessment notes that "Russia's ongoing crypto-mobilization efforts have proven capable of sustaining Russia's current offensive efforts in Ukraine despite heavy losses"[3], indicating that the Kremlin believed it could maintain adequate force levels without formal mobilization.

While Russia was planning summer 2024 offensive operations, the ISW assessments suggest these were being conducted with troops generated through crypto-mobilization rather than through a new formal mobilization wave[5]. The Russian military was attempting to maintain its operational tempo by "rapidly deploying low quality troops to frontline units"[1] rather than through formally mobilized reserves.

The status quo has significant weight in this assessment. Given the ISW's consistent reporting on Russia's reliance on crypto-mobilization and explicit statements about the Kremlin's reluctance to conduct another formal mobilization, combined with the absence of any reports indicating a change in this strategy, it is highly likely that Russia did not initiate a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024.
