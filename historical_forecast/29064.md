(a) Time until outcome: Approximately 6 months. The outcome will be determined after the November 2024 election when actual vote tallies are compared to the October 17, 2024 RCP polling average.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the 2016 and 2020 elections, Trump has historically outperformed his polls by 1.8 to 2.7 percentage points. If this pattern continues, Trump would outperform the current -1.583 pp spread, resulting in a polling bias that is likely not less than -2.0 pp (meaning a "No" outcome).

(c) Scenario for "No" outcome: Trump continues to outperform his polling as he did in 2016 and 2020. The "shy Trump voter" effect remains present, with Trump supporters being undercounted in polls. The final election results show Trump performing better than his October polling indicated, resulting in a polling bias closer to 0 or even positive (e.g., -1.0 pp or higher).

(d) Scenario for "Yes" outcome: The 2022 midterm pattern repeats, where polls showed a pro-Republican bias. Trump underperforms relative to his polling, perhaps due to improved polling methodologies, changes in voter sentiment after October 17, or higher-than-expected Democratic turnout. The final election results show Harris performing better than polling indicated, resulting in a polling bias more negative than -2.0 pp.

As I consider this forecast, I recognize that historical patterns provide conflicting evidence. Trump outperformed his polls in both 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, with a polling bias of approximately +1.8 to +2.7 percentage points in his favor[1]. If this pattern were to continue, the polling bias would likely not be less than -2.0 pp.

However, there are several factors that complicate this simple extrapolation:

First, the 2022 midterm elections showed the opposite trend, with polls overestimating Republican performance by an average of 3.7 percentage points in key states[1]. If 2024 follows the 2022 pattern instead of the 2016/2020 pattern, we could indeed see a polling bias less than -2.0 pp.

Second, polling bias has shown inconsistency across election cycles over the past 20 years[5]. Bias in one cycle has not reliably predicted bias in subsequent cycles, with inversions occurring frequently between consecutive elections. This inconsistency suggests caution in assuming 2024 will follow the 2016/2020 pattern.

Third, pollsters have been working to improve their methodologies since 2020. After the 2016 election, many polling firms adopted education-based weighting to better capture Trump's support among less-educated voters[4]. These continuing methodological improvements may reduce the historical bias.

The status quo based on presidential elections suggests Trump will outperform his polling again, which would result in a polling bias that is not less than -2.0 pp. Given that presidential elections may be more comparable than midterms for this question, and considering that the pattern held across both 2016 and 2020, I place significant weight on this outcome.

However, the evidence from 2022 and the historical inconsistency of polling bias across cycles creates substantial uncertainty. The fact that polling bias has frequently reversed direction between consecutive election cycles[5] means we should not be overly confident in the continuation of the 2016/2020 pattern.
