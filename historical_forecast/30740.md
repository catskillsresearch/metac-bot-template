(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The EIA gasoline price for the week of December 9, 2024, will be published on Monday, December 9, 2024. As today is December 4, 2024, there are approximately 5 days until the outcome is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Recent EIA and industry forecasts expect the national average retail price of regular gasoline to decline in the latter part of 2024, averaging around $3.38 for the year and falling to about $3.40 by the end of 2024[1][2][4]. As of the latest data (April 2024), the average price was $3.62 per gallon, but both EIA and GasBuddy expect a downward trend into December[3][4]. Thus, if no significant market disruptions occur, the likely outcome is that the average price will remain above $3.080.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome (≤ $3.080):**  
A "No" outcome would occur if gasoline prices experience a sharp, sustained drop in the next week, driven by factors such as:
- Unexpected increases in refinery capacity or output beyond current forecasts.
- A sudden and sharp decline in global crude oil prices due to major oversupply, economic downturn, or policy changes.
- Dramatic reductions in consumer demand, possibly from unseasonably mild weather, a new COVID-19 wave reducing travel, or economic contraction.

However, current forecasts for the end of 2024 suggest prices will be closer to $3.38–$3.40, which is notably above the $3.080 threshold[2][4]. There is no indication of an imminent, large-scale drop of over 30 cents per gallon in the immediate term.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (> $3.080):**  
A "Yes" outcome is favored under the status quo and most reasonable scenarios, including:
- Gasoline prices remaining generally stable or declining slowly as forecasted, with the average still well above $3.080.
- Minor fluctuations due to regional or seasonal factors, but not enough to drive the national average below the threshold.
- No major positive supply shocks or collapses in demand in the days leading up to December 9.

**Rationale:**  
- EIA and GasBuddy forecasts for the end of 2024 place the national average around $3.38–$3.40[2][4], substantially above $3.080.
- The path from $3.62 (April 2024) to below $3.08 by early December would require a much more rapid decline than is currently projected. Gasoline prices are known for seasonal volatility, but winter typically sees less sharp drops unless under extraordinary circumstances.
- Although gasoline prices sometimes change quickly, there are no market signals or news indicating a collapse of this magnitude in the next week.
- Historical data and expert consensus both suggest prices will remain above the threshold in question.

**Probability: 90%**  
It is highly likely that the U.S. national average retail price of regular gasoline for the week of December 9, 2024, will be greater than $3.080[1][2][4].
