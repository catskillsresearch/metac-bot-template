(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of March 20, 2025, there are 12 days remaining until April 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Mahmoud Khalil remains in ICE detention in Louisiana under a federal court order that blocks his deportation unless authorized by the court. His deportation is legally barred absent a new court order, and multiple ongoing legal challenges by his legal team (including the ACLU and NYCLU) are active[1][3][5].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
The federal court’s order preventing Khalil’s deportation remains in effect, and no new court order permitting removal is issued. Legal proceedings (including the habeas petition and constitutional claims) extend beyond April 1, 2025, with ICE unable to act pending judicial resolution[1][3][5]. Khalil therefore remains in ICE custody past April 1, and is not deported before the question's resolution date.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A rapid judicial decision is made allowing deportation—such as the court vacating its prior protective order or issuing a new order authorizing ICE to proceed. Alternatively, the government succeeds on an emergency motion or finds a procedural path to lawfully deport Khalil before April 1, resulting in his involuntary removal from U.S. territory[1][3][5].

## Rationale

The status quo, reflecting the most recent and authoritative reporting, is that Mahmoud Khalil is protected by a federal court order explicitly blocking his deportation absent further judicial decision[5]. His legal team’s habeas petition and constitutional claims introduce significant complications, likely resulting in a lengthy process. Cases involving lawful permanent residents—particularly those raising First Amendment and due process arguments—tend to progress slowly through the courts, as judges require time to consider constitutional challenges[3][5].

ICE cannot lawfully deport Khalil without a clear court order, and the hearing scheduled for March 12, 2025, does not appear, based on available reports, to have resulted in any order authorizing his deportation as of March 20[1][3][5]. If no major developments occur within the next 12 days, it is very likely the court’s ban on deportation will remain in force, and Khalil will stay in U.S. custody past April 1.

The “Yes” scenario, requiring swift judicial reversal or new facts, seems unlikely in such a high-profile case with multiple civil rights organizations involved and public scrutiny. Even with political will, the legal process (including appeals and new motions) generally takes longer than 12 days, especially with constitutional issues at stake.

Given the heavy weight that good forecasters place on the status quo and the significant legal protections currently in place, the probability that Mahmoud Khalil will be deported before April 1, 2025, is very low.

**Probability: 5%**
