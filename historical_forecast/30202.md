(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 6 weeks remaining until January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
As of November 18, 2024, the CDC has not confirmed any cases of Marburg virus disease (MVD) in a US resident[2]. If current trends continue, the outcome will be **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
No US resident contracts Marburg virus or, if they do, is diagnosed and confirmed by the CDC before January 1, 2025. The outbreak in Rwanda remains contained, with minimal or no international spread, and there are no travel-related importations resulting in CDC confirmation of a US resident case. The CDC continues to assess the risk as extremely low and issues updates or advisories, but no formal confirmation of a US case occurs[2][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A US resident either travels to Rwanda (or another outbreak area), is exposed to Marburg virus, returns to the United States, develops symptoms, and receives laboratory confirmation of Marburg virus disease as per CDC protocols. The CDC then publicly confirms this case—via a press release, Health Alert Network advisory, or a website update—before January 1, 2025, thus resolving the question as **Yes**[2].

## Rationale

Outbreaks of Marburg virus outside Africa are exceptionally rare, and, to date, the CDC has never confirmed a US case imported from abroad. As of mid-November 2024, all confirmed cases remain confined to Rwanda, with the CDC explicitly stating there are no US cases and the risk is low[2][4]. The CDC’s standard procedures include reporting confirmed cases promptly and publicly, and there are no credible signals of a pending US case.

For a US case to be confirmed, several unlikely events must align within the next 6 weeks:  
- A US resident must be exposed and infected in Rwanda (or a secondary country experiencing spread).
- The individual must return to the US, develop symptoms, seek care, be diagnosed, and undergo confirmatory CDC testing.
- The timing must allow for CDC confirmation and public announcement before January 1, 2025.

While not impossible, importations of rare hemorrhagic fevers like Marburg are vanishingly uncommon, especially in the absence of broader community or international spread or increased travel volume. Ongoing CDC messaging continues to categorize the risk to the US as extremely low, and there is no indication of accelerating risk.

Good forecasters give strong weight to the status quo in the absence of new or suggestive developments. Given stringent US protocols, current risk assessments, and disease containment geography, the baseline "No" remains highly likely unless there is a dramatic change in the outbreak dynamics.
