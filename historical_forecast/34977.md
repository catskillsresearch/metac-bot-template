(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 53 days (from February 13, 2025 to April 1, 2025)

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: No new tariffs imposed on Denmark before April 1, 2025.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: The US continues to make threats but does not officially announce or implement any new tariffs on Denmark before April 1, 2025, focusing instead on other trade priorities or using the threat of tariffs as leverage in negotiations with Denmark regarding Greenland.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The US rapidly escalates its demands regarding Greenland, officially announces new tariffs specifically targeting Denmark's major exports (pharmaceuticals, machinery, medical equipment), and implements these tariffs before April 1, 2025, as part of a pressure campaign.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the probability that the United States will impose new tariffs on Denmark before April 1, 2025. Looking at the current state of affairs and historical context, several key factors emerge.

President-elect Trump has explicitly threatened to "tariff Denmark at a very high level" if it does not cooperate with his bid to purchase Greenland[2]. These threats were made in January 2025, creating a backdrop of tension. However, threats alone do not satisfy the resolution criteria - we need an official announcement and implementation of tariffs.

The historical context suggests this is primarily a negotiating tactic rather than an immediate policy action. Trump has previously threatened tariffs against various countries without following through immediately. For Denmark specifically, the stakes involve Greenland, which Trump views as having strategic importance, claiming "we need it for national security"[2].

Looking at Denmark's exports to the US, any tariffs would affect approximately $12 billion in annual imports, primarily consisting of pharmaceuticals, machinery, nuclear reactor components, medical apparatus, and other specialized industrial goods[1]. The complex and specialized nature of these imports suggests potential self-harm to the US if tariffs were imposed, as the search results note: "The harm to the United States from higher American tariffs might be greater than the harm to Denmark"[1].

When considering the timeframe, we have less than two months remaining before the April 1 deadline. While the US administration has the authority to impose tariffs quickly, the typical process involves regulatory announcements, public comment periods, and implementation phases that often extend beyond a few weeks. There is no indication in the search results that this process has been initiated for Denmark.

Additionally, the status quo is powerful. Trade relationships tend to be sticky, and disrupting established supply chains, especially for specialized products like pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, carries significant economic and political costs.

The search results also indicate that Trump has threatened tariffs against multiple countries including Canada, Mexico, and the EU[2], suggesting Denmark may not be the immediate priority for tariff action. With limited political capital and administrative bandwidth in the early months of a new administration, targeting Denmark specifically before April 1 seems less probable than pursuing broader trade initiatives or focusing on larger trading partners.

Probability: 25%
