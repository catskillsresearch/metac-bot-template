(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The question covers up to September 30, 2024. As of July 17, 2024, there are approximately 2.5 months (about 75 days) remaining until the outcome window closes.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No nuclear weapon has been detonated as an act of war between January 1, 2020 and July 17, 2024. If current trends persist and no extraordinary escalation occurs, the outcome will be No—a nuclear weapon will not have been used as an act of war by September 30, 2024.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
All major nuclear powers exercise continued restraint despite ongoing conflicts and nuclear posturing. The Russia-Ukraine war remains conventional, with no tactical or strategic nuclear use. North Korea refrains from crossing the nuclear threshold despite provocations or military skirmishes. In the Middle East and other volatile regions, crises remain below the nuclear escalation threshold.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A major escalation in Ukraine—such as a sudden, dramatic shift in military advantage or a perceived existential threat to Russian leadership—could prompt Russia to use a tactical nuclear weapon. Alternatively, North Korea could use a nuclear device in a military confrontation on the Korean Peninsula, or an unexpected crisis could trigger a first-use scenario by another nuclear state. These would be publicly reported and recognized as acts of war.

## Rationale

The historical record strongly favors the status quo: since 1945, despite numerous high-stakes crises and multiple states acquiring nuclear weapons, no nuclear weapons have been used in warfare. Deterrence, the fear of catastrophic escalation, and international norms have so far prevailed.

Current 2024 trends do show elevated risk:  
- The number of operational warheads is growing, several states are advancing their capabilities, and nuclear threats are a more frequent element of statecraft than a decade ago[4][2].
- The Russia-Ukraine conflict, enhanced North Korean missile activity, and heightened tensions in several regions are legitimate concerns for increased nuclear risk[4][2].
- Notably, expert estimates of the probability of nuclear use—even in times of acute tension—tend to vary widely and are often criticized for being speculative and not robustly grounded in evidence[5]. High estimates (10-25%) likely overstate the risk for the near term, according to most careful analysts[5].

However, there is still a lack of concrete evidence suggesting that any state is imminently preparing to cross the nuclear threshold before September 30, 2024. Most risk factors remain latent threats, and adversaries continue to be deterred by the potential consequences of nuclear use.

Given that history changes slowly, and there are only 2.5 months remaining in the forecast window, good forecasting practice is to heavily weight the status quo (no use), while acknowledging a nonzero and possibly elevated risk compared to previous years.

## Final Answer

Probability: **3%**

This reflects a very low, but nonzero, probability of a nuclear weapon being detonated as an act of war by September 30, 2024—higher than the long-term base rate, but still unlikely in the remaining time frame given the absence of immediate triggers or indications of imminent use[4][2][5].
