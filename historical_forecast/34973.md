(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 1.5 months (from May 6, 2025, to April 1, 2025 - which has already passed)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: China continues to harass Philippine vessels near Second Thomas Shoal using coast guard and maritime militia but does not deploy military personnel that would trigger official accusations from the US or Philippine government.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: China maintains its existing approach of pressuring the Philippines through "gray zone" tactics, harassment, and blockades without crossing the red line of deploying military personnel at the shoal, allowing both sides to avoid direct military confrontation.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Escalating tensions from incidents like those in August 2024 lead China to deploy PLA Navy or other military personnel directly at Second Thomas Shoal, prompting formal accusations from the US or Philippine government about Chinese military seizure of the feature.

Based on the search results provided, I can analyze whether China seized control of Second Thomas Shoal before April 1, 2025. The question specifically resolves as "Yes" if the US or Philippine government accused China of deploying military personnel at the shoal without Philippine consent before that date.

The search results show ongoing tensions in the South China Sea throughout 2024 and early 2025, but there is no indication that China seized control of Second Thomas Shoal by deploying military personnel there. Instead, the evidence points to continued use of harassment tactics and "gray zone" operations:

In January 2025, China publicly reiterated that it has "no intention of occupying Second Thomas Shoal" but only hopes the feature can be "restored to its natural state"[2]. This suggests China was maintaining its long-standing position rather than escalating to military occupation.

The most recent significant military activity mentioned in the search results was China's "combat readiness patrols" around Scarborough Shoal (not Second Thomas Shoal) in late December 2024[3]. While this demonstrated China's military capabilities in the region, it did not constitute deployment of military personnel at Second Thomas Shoal.

As of February 2025, Second Thomas Shoal remained "the biggest flashpoint in the China-Philippines dispute"[4], indicating that while tensions were high, no dramatic change in the status quo had occurred. The Philippines was still maintaining its presence on the BRP Sierra Madre.

The search results describe a July 2024 agreement between China and the Philippines to reduce tensions at Second Thomas Shoal, with one resupply mission conducted under this agreement on July 27, 2024[1]. Though there were disagreements about the terms and subsequent incidents that cast doubt on the agreement's longevity, this diplomatic approach suggests both sides were seeking to manage tensions rather than escalate to military confrontation.

The most reliable indicator is the absence of any reported accusations from the US or Philippine governments about Chinese military personnel being deployed at Second Thomas Shoal - which would be the specific criterion for resolving this question as "Yes."

Given the long-standing pattern of China using coast guard and maritime militia vessels rather than overt military personnel at the shoal, and the evidence that both sides were engaging in diplomacy despite tensions, the status quo appears to have continued through early 2025. The search results provide no evidence of a fundamental change in this approach or any accusations meeting the resolution criteria.
