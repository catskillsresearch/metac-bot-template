(a) Time left until outcome: 6 days (Election Day is November 5, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: Recreational marijuana remains illegal in Florida while medical marijuana continues to be legal under the 2016 amendment.

(c) No outcome scenario: Amendment 3 fails to reach the required 60% threshold due to strong opposition from Governor DeSantis and conservative voters, concerns about the amendment creating a "drug cartel" for existing medical marijuana businesses, and low turnout among younger, pro-legalization voters.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Amendment 3 exceeds the 60% threshold thanks to broad bipartisan support including endorsement from former President Trump, continuation of the strong support shown for medical marijuana in 2016, and alignment with national trends showing 70% of Americans favor some form of legalization.

Florida's Amendment 3 presents an interesting forecasting challenge given the competing factors at play. Let me analyze this systematically.

The 60% supermajority threshold is a significant hurdle that requires substantial cross-partisan support. This is notably higher than a simple majority requirement and means the amendment needs strong support across different demographic groups[2][3]. Looking at historical precedent, Florida voters approved medical marijuana in 2016 with 71% support, well above the required threshold, indicating potentially strong baseline support for cannabis reform[2].

National trends show increasing support for marijuana legalization, with approximately 70% of Americans now favoring legalization in some form according to PEW Research[2]. This suggests broad societal acceptance that crosses partisan lines. Additionally, 24 states have already legalized recreational marijuana, showing this is increasingly becoming a mainstream position[2][3].

Political endorsements are mixed. Former President Trump has explicitly endorsed Amendment 3, stating "As a Floridian, I will be voting YES on Amendment 3 this November"[4]. This is significant as Trump maintains substantial influence with Republican voters in Florida. However, Governor Ron DeSantis strongly opposes the amendment, characterizing it as creating "a drug cartel" in the state constitution, which could sway conservative voters[4].

The structure of the amendment has created some division even among pro-marijuana advocates. Unlike previous proposals that included home-growing provisions, Amendment 3 favors existing medical marijuana businesses, which has drawn criticism from some legalization supporters[4]. This could potentially reduce support from some who might otherwise vote yes.

Voter turnout will be a crucial factor. Presidential election years typically see higher turnout, which could benefit the amendment if younger voters (who tend to support legalization at higher rates) participate in large numbers.

The absence of recent polling specific to Amendment 3 in the search results makes this forecast more uncertain. However, considering the historical support for medical marijuana in Florida, the national trends toward legalization, and the bipartisan nature of some support (including Trump's endorsement), there appears to be a path to reaching the 60% threshold.

That said, I must acknowledge the status quo tends to persist, and the 60% requirement is a high bar. Governor DeSantis's opposition and concerns about the amendment's structure could mobilize significant opposition.

Probability: 65%
