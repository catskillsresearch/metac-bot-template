(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of July 19, 2024, there are just over 10 weeks (approximately 73 days) remaining until September 30, 2024, the end of the forecasting window.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No large-scale riot as defined (50+ deaths, 10,000+ arrests, or $1B+ in damages within a 100km radius and 14 days) would occur. Incidents of civil unrest or even significant violence may happen, but events meeting these extreme thresholds have historically been rare in the US, even in periods of heightened tension and polarization[1][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
The political climate remains tense—especially around the Republican and Democratic national conventions and ongoing legal proceedings involving high-profile political figures—but protest activity and any outbreaks of violence are contained by law enforcement and do not escalate to mass casualty events or widespread destruction at the scale defined. Arrests and property damage remain elevated but well below the thresholds. No single event surpasses 50 deaths, 10,000 arrests, or $1 billion in damages within the defined area and time[4][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A significant political or legal flashpoint (e.g., an unexpected verdict or act of violence at a major convention) triggers widespread, rapid escalation of unrest in a major city. The violence escalates over several days, overwhelming law enforcement response, resulting in dozens of fatalities, mass arrests exceeding 10,000, or property damages confirmed above $1 billion—matching or surpassing the scale of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Such an outcome would likely involve either a high-profile political event devolving into sustained chaos or a coordinated extremist attack that provokes an extreme response[1][4].

## Rationale

Historical precedent strongly favors the status quo: while serious civil unrest and even deadly violence have occurred (notably 1992 LA and, to a lesser extent, January 6, 2021), events exceeding the very high thresholds described are exceedingly rare. The period from mid-July to end-September 2024 does include risk factors—especially the national conventions and ongoing legal proceedings—which may increase the incidence and severity of protest activity[4][5]. Security agencies are on high alert. However, expert analysis stresses that while some violence is "almost certain," the leap to a large-scale riot as defined (especially 50+ fatalities or $1B in damages in a short period and a small area) is much less likely[1].

Potential triggers exist, and the situation is highly dynamic. Yet, short of an extraordinary escalation—such as a highly provocative event coinciding with large, emotionally charged gatherings—the systems in place and historical patterns suggest the most probable outcome is a continuation of increased but manageable unrest, not a catastrophic event matching the outlined criteria.
