Based on the current trial status and available information, I'll assess the likelihood of Daniel Penny being convicted before January 1, 2025.

(a) Time left until outcome: 26 days (from May 6, 2025, which appears to be an error in the date provided - using December 6, 2024 as the reference point)

(b) Status quo outcome: Jury deliberations are ongoing without a verdict yet reached

(c) No outcome scenario: The jury deliberations continue past December 31, 2024, or the jury acquits Penny of all charges, or there's a hung jury requiring a new trial

(d) Yes outcome scenario: The jury reaches a guilty verdict on either manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide charges within the next 26 days

Looking at the current situation, I need to determine the probability that Daniel Penny will be convicted before January 1, 2025. The search results show that as of December 3, 2024, the jury had begun deliberations in Penny's trial regarding the death of Jordan Neely.

The trial involves serious charges - manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide - related to Penny's use of a chokehold on Jordan Neely in May 2023. Penny, a 26-year-old former Marine, has pleaded not guilty to these charges[2].

The jury began deliberations on December 3, 2024, after closing arguments were presented the day before[2]. The judge provided instructions that if the jury finds Penny guilty of manslaughter, they needn't consider the criminally negligent homicide charge[2].

The timeline is tight - with less than a month remaining until January 1, 2025. Jury deliberations can vary greatly in duration, especially in complex and high-profile cases like this one. Some factors to consider:

1. The trial has been ongoing for about a month with substantial testimony[2].
2. The case involves complex considerations of self-defense versus excessive force.
3. The medical cause of death is contested between prosecution and defense.
4. The defense has expressed confidence in an acquittal[4].

Based on the status quo, there are three main possibilities:
- The jury reaches a guilty verdict before January 1, 2025
- The jury acquits Penny before January 1, 2025
- The jury continues deliberations into 2025 or becomes deadlocked

Given the complexity of the case and the holiday season approaching (which could potentially slow court proceedings), there's a significant chance deliberations could extend beyond December 31, 2024. Additionally, the defense appears confident in their case, suggesting they believe acquittal is likely.

The prosecution needs to convince the jury beyond reasonable doubt that Penny acted recklessly and used excessive force. The defense is arguing that Penny was protecting other passengers and did not intend to harm Neely, and they've presented alternative theories for the cause of death.

Putting extra weight on the status quo, which is ongoing deliberations without a verdict, and considering the relatively short timeframe remaining in 2024, I assess that there is a moderate-to-low probability of a conviction before January 1, 2025.

Probability: 35%
