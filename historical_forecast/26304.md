(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are roughly 2.5 months until October 1, 2024. This is the window in which William Ruto could potentially cease to be President for the forecast’s purposes.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
William Ruto remains President of Kenya. He has survived significant protests, remains in control of government, is carrying out international functions such as attending a US state visit, and is still officially recognized by credible sources as the President of Kenya[2][4][5].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Ruto weathers the protests and political crisis, retains his office, and continues to be recognized as Kenya's President through at least October 1, 2024. Cabinet reshuffles, resignations (such as the police chief’s), and policy adjustments suffice to maintain his grip on power[1][5]. Legal and constitutional removal mechanisms (resignation, impeachment, incapacitation, or overthrow) either are not initiated or do not succeed within the timeframe.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Ruto ceases to be President for any reason—voluntary resignation (perhaps in the face of overwhelming protest), formal ouster (through impeachment or other constitutional means), incapacitation, a coup, or any other circumstance leading to a transition of power noted by credible sources, with someone else taking over for more than 30 days or permanently.

## Rationale

Kenya’s political landscape is experiencing rare and intense volatility. The sacking of almost the entire cabinet, resignation of the police chief, and persistent, sometimes deadly, protests calling for Ruto’s resignation do mark an unprecedented level of public and institutional pressure[1][5]. The protests have united unusually broad sections of the population, and Ruto’s legitimacy suffered notable blows.

However, the status quo bias is strong:  
- No formal impeachment or removal process has started.
- Ruto maintains international support and continues to perform the core functions of office[2][4][5].
- Kenya’s constitutional process for removing a president is lengthy, and time is short until October 1, 2024.
- Even major crises and mass protests rarely result in a sitting president’s ouster outside of coups, and there is no clear indication yet of a military rebellion or rapid parliamentary action.

Unless there is a rapid escalation such as a military intervention, parliamentary impeachment, or Ruto’s sudden voluntary resignation, the most likely outcome is that he will remain President by October 1, 2024.

## Final Answer

**Probability: 85%**  
William Ruto is likely to remain President of Kenya through October 1, 2024, given the resilient status quo and the practical, procedural, and political obstacles to his removal or resignation in the short time remaining[1][5].
