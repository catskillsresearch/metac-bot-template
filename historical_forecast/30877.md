(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Less than one month remains until Tesla’s Q4 2024 delivery numbers are reported—specifically, the outcome should be public on or around January 2, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
In Q3 2024, Tesla delivered 462,890 vehicles. Historically, Tesla often delivers more vehicles in Q4 than Q3, as seen in 2023 (Q4: 484,507 vs. Q3: 435,059)[1][3]. Q4 is typically Tesla's strongest quarter each year. Management guidance and analyst forecasts for Q4 2024 suggest a higher delivery figure (near 515,000), but if nothing changed beyond prior quarter trends, deliveries would be similar to, or slightly above, Q3’s number.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Tesla reports 462,890 or fewer deliveries for Q4 2024. This could happen if:
- Production constraints or supply chain problems arise late in the quarter.
- Discounts and early sales efforts in Q4 prove insufficient to boost demand.
- Macroeconomic pressures, such as higher interest rates or waning consumer demand, depress EV purchases.
- Intensified competition, particularly from BYD and other automakers, further erodes Tesla's sales momentum.
- Delays or issues at Gigafactories slow output unexpectedly.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Tesla reports more than 462,890 deliveries for Q4 2024. This outcome is likely if:
- The early and aggressive discounting Tesla started in Q4 successfully accelerates sales[5].
- Tesla’s production network avoids major disruptions, allowing it to capitalize on increased Q4 demand[2].
- Year-end seasonal effects and Tesla’s historical push make Q4 once again the strongest quarter.
- Tesla meets its internal targets (management forecasts 515,000 for Q4 2024)[5], necessary to achieve its full-year growth guidance.

## Rationale

Tesla's guidance, as of their Q3 2024 update, is for near-record Q4 deliveries—specifically, about 515,000 vehicles[5]. This is supported by their need to beat 2023 full-year deliveries, as well as a historical pattern of Q4 outperformance. The company's implementation of discounts early in the quarter, rather than their usual end-of-quarter tactic, signals an aggressive push to ensure a strong finish[5]. Tesla's global production network remains robust, with no reported factory shutdowns or major supply chain issues as of early December 2024[2].

However, risks remain. Deliveries through the first nine months of 2024 slightly lag 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds and global EV competition are stronger now than a year ago, potentially blunting the impact of seasonal trends[1][3][5]. The CEO's comments and external analyst consensus also point to a moderation in Tesla’s yearly growth rate[3], but even a modest increase in Q4 will clear the bar for a “Yes” outcome.

As a forecaster, I place significant weight on the historical pattern (Q4 outperforms Q3 for Tesla), the company's explicit Q4 delivery guidance (515,000), and their early discounting and operational signals. Downside risks are real but would require meaningful negative surprises not currently evident.

**Probability: 85%**
