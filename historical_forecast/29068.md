(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be known after the 2024 general election results are finalized and the national popular vote is determined and compared to the RCP national polling average from October 17, 2024. Given the current date is October 22, 2024, this is approximately 2-3 weeks away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Historically, RCP's national polling average has underestimated Trump’s share of the vote by 1.8 points in 2016 and 2.7 points in 2020[1]. However, in the 2022 midterms, polling bias almost disappeared at the national level, with RCP's aggregate being just 0.3 points off from the final result[1]. If the 2022 pattern repeats, the polling bias would not exceed 1.0 percentage points.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If the final national popular vote spread between Harris and Trump is within 0.58 points of the RCP average (i.e., the real result is Harris over Trump by more than -2.583 pp or less than -0.583 pp), then the calculated polling bias for Trump will be 1.0 pp or less. This could happen if polling methodologies continue to improve and capture the electorate more accurately, as was the case in the 2022 midterms, where the national polling error was negligible[1][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If, as in 2016 and 2020, Trump outperforms his polling average by more than 1.0 percentage points—meaning the final actual vote spread is significantly tighter than the RCP average (for example, Harris wins the popular vote by less than -2.583 points or Trump wins outright)—the polling bias for Trump will be greater than 1.0 percentage points. This outcome would reflect a repeat of previous cycles where polls systematically underestimated Trump[1].

## Rationale

Historically, RCP’s national polling averages have underestimated Trump’s performance by more than 1.0 percentage points in presidential elections: 1.8 points in 2016 and 2.7 points in 2020[1]. However, the 2022 midterms were notably different; the national polling bias shrank to just 0.3 points, suggesting recent polling may have improved or that the error is less predictable than before[1][5]. There is also no clear trend that polling bias persists in the same direction from election to election—past cycles show reversals or minimal bias, and experts caution that “bias in the polls in one election cycle has not been predictive of bias in the polls in subsequent cycles”[5].

Given this, while history suggests underestimation of Trump could persist, the most recent evidence (from 2022 and from expert analysis) puts significant weight on the possibility that the bias will be smaller in 2024. Good forecasters should consider the status quo—meaning the most recent cycle's pattern—more heavily, as sudden, large systemic shifts are uncommon without clear cause.

## Final Answer

Probability: 40%  
There is a plausible chance (>1 in 3) that RCP’s polling bias for Trump will be greater than 1.0 percentage points in 2024, based on historical precedent from 2016 and 2020. However, the much smaller bias in 2022 and lack of a persistent, predictable pattern across cycles makes a repeat of a large bias less likely than not[1][5]. Thus, less than even odds are warranted, with the balance tilting toward “No.”
