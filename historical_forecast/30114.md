(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The Game Awards ceremony is scheduled for December 12, 2024, which is 27 days from November 15, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Astro Bot is the current frontrunner for Game of the Year, widely acclaimed with a Metacritic score of 94 and a broad player base. If the present dynamics continue, it would likely be the winner, or at least remain a leading contender[3][4].

(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Astro Bot is nominated, but the jury votes for a different title, most likely Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth (another critical and commercial success, currently viewed as a "lock" for nomination and a possible favorite), or another surprise late-year release that gains momentum[1][2]. This could happen if recency bias fades, or if another nominee rallies more passion among voters.

(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Astro Bot maintains its frontrunner position through the voting period, leveraging its critical acclaim, accessibility, and nostalgia. It secures the most votes from the jury and is announced as the Game of the Year winner at The Game Awards 2024[3][4].

## Rationale

Astro Bot is positioned as a strong GOTY 2024 candidate by every major metric: critical praise, commercial performance (1.5 million units sold), and cultural appeal as a charming, universally accessible platformer[4]. Industry analysts and critics frequently cite it as a "near-lock" for nomination and a favorite to win[2][3]. Its Metacritic score of 94 matches or exceeds almost all competition, and the game's broad appeal gives it an edge in a voting system influenced by popularity and accessibility[3].

However, precedent at The Game Awards historically favors action, RPG, or highly cinematic games. No 3D mascot platformer has won before, and Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth is seen as a formidable rival—a genre favorite with built-in nostalgia and franchise recognition[1][2]. Late releases such as Lego Horizon Adventures could complicate the field, but traditionally late arrivals struggle to match the established frontrunners' momentum[2].

Astro Bot's main vulnerabilities:
- The genre has never won before at this show.
- Recency bias may fade as the ceremony approaches.
- Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth or another major title could unite more critical/jury support.
- PlayStation exclusivity, while often helpful, could limit reach compared to multiplatform blockbusters.

Given the current status, historical voting patterns, and the strength of competition, a slight edge should remain with the status quo frontrunner—Astro Bot[3]. But caution is warranted due to the unpredictable nature of juried awards and the strength of its competitors.
