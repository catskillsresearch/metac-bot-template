(a) **Time left until outcome:**  
About two weeks (the outcome is determined as of April 1, 2025; today is May 6, 2025, so the outcome is already knowable in principle but not yet resolved by the question's criteria).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the most recent available data (late March 2025), Keir Starmer's favorability among Britons is 32% with a substantial 60% unfavorable[1]. We do not have any public March 2025 approval ratings for Shiguru Ishiba, but historically, Japanese Prime Ministers tend to have higher approval ratings than their UK counterparts, as Japan's prime ministers often start with a "honeymoon" period and rarely dip as low as the 30% range unless facing major scandals or crises. Absent extraordinary events, the status quo favors the Japanese PM posting a higher approval rating than Starmer.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
The typical case: Shiguru Ishiba maintains an approval rating above 32%—even with possible modest declines—while Starmer, despite his recent improvement, does not rise above the mid-30% range due to persistent high disapproval and structural headwinds in the UK public sphere. Morning Consult's March/April tracker reflects these trends, showing Ishiba leading.

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Keir Starmer continues his upward momentum, perhaps gaining a further boost from unexpected domestic or international events, pushing his Morning Consult approval rating above 35–40%. Meanwhile, Ishiba faces an abrupt scandal or policy crisis that erodes his support, causing his approval to plummet below that of Starmer by April 1. This requires multiple unusual developments.

## Rationale

- **Status quo bias:** The world, and especially leader approval ratings, tend to change gradually. Starmer's approval has ticked up from 26% in February to 32% in March according to YouGov[1][2], a notable but not seismic jump.
- **Trend analysis:** Although Starmer is improving, he is still underwater (60% negative)[1] and his improvements have not yet brought him to a position of strength by international standards.
- **Comparative baseline:** Japanese prime ministers (especially new ones) commonly have approval ratings well above 30–35% in their early months unless facing extraordinary unpopularity. Without evidence of Ishiba's numbers collapsing, he is likely ahead.
- **Data limitations:** The precise Morning Consult numbers for both leaders on April 1, 2025, are not currently available, but all indirect evidence—including historical patterns and Starmer's still-negative net favorability—suggests Ishiba is favored to have a higher rating.

## Final Probability Estimate

**Probability: 15%**

This reflects a modest chance for upside surprise by Starmer or a sudden crisis for Ishiba, but is weighted heavily toward the status quo where the Japanese PM posts a higher approval rating than Starmer as of April 1, 2025.
