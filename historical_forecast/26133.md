(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 3 months (from May 2025 to the resolution date of September 30, 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Benjamin Netanyahu remains Prime Minister of Israel through September 30, 2024.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Netanyahu could be forced to resign due to mounting political pressure related to the ICC arrest warrant issued in November 2024, or due to a collapse of his governing coalition following criticism of his handling of the Gaza conflict.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Netanyahu maintains his political resilience despite challenges, leverages his experience and political connections to maintain his governing coalition, and continues serving as Prime Minister through the specified period.

Based on the search results and the current political situation, I'll now provide my forecast analysis regarding whether Benjamin Netanyahu will remain Prime Minister of Israel through September 30, 2024.

The search results indicate that Netanyahu is still serving as Prime Minister of Israel, with recent statements from May 2024 showing him actively engaged in his role[1][3]. As one of the most politically resilient figures in Israeli history, Netanyahu has demonstrated remarkable ability to maintain power through various challenges.

The most significant recent development is that the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu on November 21, 2024[2]. This warrant alleges that Netanyahu is "responsible for the war crimes of starvation as a method of warfare and of intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts from at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024."[2]

However, this warrant was issued in November 2024, which is after the September 30, 2024 deadline specified in the question. Therefore, any direct political consequences from this arrest warrant would not affect the outcome of this forecast.

The search results also indicate that Netanyahu has maintained reasonable public support. A Channel 12 survey from May 30, 2024, found that Netanyahu had overtaken Benny Gantz and was once again respondents' preferred choice for prime minister[4]. This suggests that despite the criticism his government has faced regarding the October 7, 2023 attacks, he still maintains sufficient political capital to continue in his position.

Given the status quo and the principle that political situations tend to persist in the absence of major disruptive events, several factors support Netanyahu remaining in power through September 30, 2024:

1. His demonstrated political resilience over many years
2. Recent polling showing continued public support[4]
3. The absence of any concrete information in the search results indicating an imminent change in leadership
4. His continued active engagement in his role as Prime Minister as recently as May 2024[1][3]

While Israeli politics can be volatile and coalition governments unstable, there is no specific evidence in the search results pointing to an imminent collapse of Netanyahu's government before the September 30, 2024 deadline. The criticism regarding the October 7 attacks has been ongoing since late 2023, yet Netanyahu has maintained his position through May 2024.

The most likely scenario for Netanyahu not remaining Prime Minister would be if political pressure related to his handling of the Gaza conflict reaches a tipping point, leading to either a successful no-confidence vote or a collapse of his governing coalition. However, given his political survival skills demonstrated over decades and the current polling data[4], such an outcome appears less likely than the status quo continuing.

Probability: 75%
