I'll provide my assessment of whether Bausch Health will file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, following the interview format requested.

(a) Time left until outcome: There are about 7 months remaining until January 1, 2025, from the current date of May 6, 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changes, Bausch Health would not file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, based on their explicit denial of bankruptcy considerations in July 2024.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Bausch Health successfully manages its debt obligations coming due in 2025, possibly through refinancing, debt restructuring, or improved operational performance. The company continues to operate normally, addressing its financial challenges without resorting to bankruptcy protection.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Bausch Health faces insurmountable financial pressure from its debt maturity profile, particularly the "foreboding walls in 2025-28" mentioned in search results. Unable to refinance or restructure its obligations, the company files for bankruptcy protection before the end of 2024 to address its financial situation.

## Rationale for Bankruptcy Risk Assessment

Bausch Health's bankruptcy risk requires careful analysis of several key factors that would influence such a significant corporate decision before January 1, 2025.

The company explicitly denied bankruptcy considerations in July 2024, stating that rumors about considering "bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any kind" were unsubstantiated, and emphasized "it is not" considering such options[1][2]. This strong public denial suggests the company was not actively planning bankruptcy proceedings at that time.

However, there are concerning financial indicators. Fitch Ratings affirmed Bausch Health's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'CCC' in September 2024, which indicates substantial credit risk[3]. This rating level suggests financial vulnerability, though not immediate default.

The company's debt maturity profile raises significant concerns. Search results indicate "a large amount of debt maturing in 2025 and even more in 2027-2028"[4]. Additionally, analysis suggests "little chance of BHC limping through its maturity calendar given foreboding walls in 2025-28"[5]. This maturity wall represents a substantial challenge that could potentially trigger bankruptcy considerations.

A CreditSights case study from September 2023 suggested that the separation of Bausch's eye health business (B+L) "would significantly increase the probability of a medium-term bankruptcy filing by BHC"[5]. Whether this separation has progressed and how it has affected the company's financial stability is crucial to the bankruptcy risk assessment.

The company experienced volatile stock performance in July 2024, with shares falling to a near-20-year low before partially recovering after addressing the bankruptcy rumors[2]. This market reaction suggests investors perceive significant financial vulnerability.

## Analysis of Timing and Probability

Given the current date of May 6, 2025, we need to assess whether Bausch Health would have filed for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025 (which is now in the past). Since the search results only extend to September 2024, I don't have definitive information about what actually happened between September 2024 and January 1, 2025.

Looking at the information available until September 2024:

1. The company had explicitly denied bankruptcy rumors.
2. Fitch maintained a CCC rating, indicating substantial risk but not imminent default.
3. The company faced significant debt maturities in 2025, creating potential pressure.
4. The separation of B+L, if completed, could have increased bankruptcy risk.

Considering these factors and giving weight to the status quo outcome (that companies typically try to avoid bankruptcy through various financial maneuvers), and without specific information indicating the company actually filed for bankruptcy between September 2024 and January 1, 2025, I must balance the serious financial concerns against the company's stated position and typical corporate behavior.

Probability: 35%
