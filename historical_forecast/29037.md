(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 2 months and 10 days (from October 22, 2024, to January 1, 2025)

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: The current IBM pay-as-you-go price remains at or above $96 USD per minute, resulting in a "No" outcome.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: IBM maintains its current pricing structure through the end of 2024, focusing instead on technological advancements and expanded capacity without passing cost savings to consumers until later in their roadmap.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: IBM announces a price reduction before January 1, 2025, possibly as part of a year-end strategy to increase adoption or in response to competitive pressures in the quantum computing market.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the likelihood that IBM will lower its pay-as-you-go quantum computing prices below $96 USD per minute before January 1, 2025.

The quantum computing industry is currently in a research and development phase, with high costs associated with maintaining and operating quantum hardware. As of 2023 and early 2024, quantum computing services, including IBM's, remain expensive with high per-minute costs for access[1]. The search results indicate that full quantum computing systems from providers like IBM are sold for tens of millions of dollars as part of full-service contracts over several years.

Looking at IBM's roadmap, they have significant technological advancements planned for 2024 and 2025. In 2024, they plan to introduce the 462-qubit "Flamingo" processor with quantum communication capabilities, and by 2025, they aim to introduce the "Kookaburra" processor with 1,386 qubits[2]. These developments suggest IBM is heavily investing in scaling and improving their quantum technology, but there's no direct indication this will translate to immediate price reductions.

Industry experts predict that quantum computing costs will decrease over time as technology matures and competition increases[1]. However, these reductions are expected to be gradual, and there's no specific timeline mentioned for when significant price drops might occur. The CTO of the CIA noted that the quantum industry is still very early, and unit costs remain high as we're still in the research and development stage[1].

IBM's recent expansion of its quantum data center in Poughkeepsie suggests a focus on increasing capacity and accessibility, but the announcement doesn't specifically mention pricing changes. Their roadmap emphasizes removing "the main boundaries in the way of scaling quantum processors" by 2025, which could eventually lead to cost reductions, but this appears to be a longer-term goal rather than something imminent[2].

The status quo bias is particularly relevant here. Without specific announcements or clear market pressures forcing an immediate price reduction, the most likely outcome is that IBM will maintain its current pricing through the end of 2024. Quantum computing remains a specialized and expensive technology, and dramatic price cuts typically don't occur without either significant competitive pressure or major technological breakthroughs that drastically reduce operating costs.

Given the relative proximity of the January 1, 2025 deadline (just over 2 months away), the lack of any announced price reductions, and IBM's focus on technological development rather than price competition, it seems unlikely that IBM will lower its pay-as-you-go quantum computing prices below $96 USD per minute before January 1, 2025.

Probability: 15%
