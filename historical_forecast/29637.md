(a) Time left until outcome: 55 days (from today, November 6, 2024, until January 1, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: Yes - the ICC has already issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu on November 21, 2024
(c) Scenario for No outcome: If the information about the ICC warrant were incorrect or fabricated, or if the warrant were to be withdrawn before January 1, 2025
(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The status quo remains unchanged, with the ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu issued on November 21, 2024 remaining in effect

Based on the search results provided, I can offer a comprehensive analysis of whether the International Criminal Court will bring charges against Benjamin Netanyahu before 2025.

According to the information available, the ICC has already issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu on November 21, 2024. This is clearly stated in multiple reliable sources, including the ICC's own website and reports from established international policy organizations like Chatham House.

The ICC Prosecutor, Karim Khan, initially filed applications for arrest warrants on May 20, 2024, targeting several individuals including Netanyahu[1]. The charges against Netanyahu include serious allegations: war crimes of starvation as a method of warfare, intentionally directing attacks against civilian populations, and crimes against humanity including murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts[2]. These alleged crimes occurred during the period from at least October 8, 2023, until at least May 20, 2024[2].

On November 21, 2024, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I formally issued the arrest warrant against Netanyahu, along with warrants for other individuals including Hamas leaders[3]. This action constitutes "bringing charges" against Netanyahu according to the ICC's procedures under the Rome Statute. The issuance of an arrest warrant is one of the specific criteria mentioned in the question that would qualify for a "Yes" resolution, alongside indictments or summons.

It's worth noting several contextual factors:

1. While the warrant has been issued, actual prosecution depends on Netanyahu being in custody, which is unlikely in the near term as Israel is not a member state of the ICC.

2. The charges resulted from a process that began with South Africa's referral of Israel to the ICC in November 2023, as mentioned in the background information.

3. The ICC has asserted jurisdiction over the Gaza conflict despite Israel not being a party to the Rome Statute, based on Palestine's accession to the treaty.

The timeline of events shows a clear progression from the initial application for warrants in May 2024 to their issuance in November 2024, all within the timeframe specified for this question (before January 1, 2025).

Given that the arrest warrant has already been issued as of November 21, 2024, and this constitutes "bringing charges" under the criteria specified in the question, the outcome has already been determined.

Probability: 100%
