(a) Time until outcome: 6 days (from July 9 to July 15, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the most recent data available (July 9, 2024), Trump's lead over Biden in FiveThirtyEight's national polling average is approximately 2.4 percentage points. This falls within the criteria for a "Yes" outcome (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3).

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: Either Trump's lead decreases to 2 points or less (perhaps due to a strong Biden campaign announcement, positive economic news benefiting the incumbent, or Trump making a significant gaffe), or Trump's lead increases to more than 3 points (possibly due to additional Democratic representatives calling for Biden to step aside, new polls showing further erosion in Biden's support, or another negative news cycle for the administration).

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: The current political dynamics and voter sentiment remain relatively stable over the next week, with no major campaign developments that significantly shift public opinion. New polls continue to show results consistent with the current trend, maintaining Trump's lead in the 2.1-3.0 point range.

## Rationale

The core question is whether Trump's lead over Biden in FiveThirtyEight's national polling average will be between 2.1 and 3.0 percentage points (inclusive on the upper bound) on July 15, 2024.

As of July 9, 2024, Trump's lead is approximately 2.4 percentage points according to FiveThirtyEight[1]. This represents a significant increase from the +0.2 lead he held on June 27 (debate day), demonstrating how quickly these numbers can change following a major campaign event.

Looking at recent trends, Trump's lead appears to have stabilized in the low-to-mid 2-point range. The polling average shows a substantial post-debate shift that has now settled somewhat, suggesting that the immediate impact of Biden's debate performance may have been largely incorporated into the polling average.

It's important to note that polling averages tend to change slowly in the absence of major events. FiveThirtyEight's methodology accounts for poll recency, sample size, methodology and house effects[1], which creates a smoothing effect that prevents wild day-to-day swings. Given that we're only looking 6 days into the future and no major campaign events are currently scheduled in this window, there's a significant probability that the status quo will persist.

However, the political environment remains volatile. Several factors could push Trump's lead outside the 2.1-3.0 range:

1. Additional prominent Democrats could call for Biden to withdraw, potentially further eroding his support.
2. The Biden campaign could launch effective counter-messaging that helps recover some lost ground.
3. New high-quality polls could be released showing either a narrower or wider gap than current polls suggest.
4. An unexpected campaign development or news story could shift public perception.

Given that we're in a post-debate period where opinions are still being formed and the full polling impact may not yet be captured, there remains a substantial chance of movement in either direction. The polling average is a lagging indicator that depends on when new polls are conducted and released.

We should put considerable weight on the status quo outcome since polling averages tend to change incrementally rather than dramatically over short periods without major intervening events. The current 2.4-point lead falls comfortably within the target range, not precariously close to either boundary.

However, given the volatility of the current political environment and the relatively narrow range specified (just 0.9 percentage points), there is still a significant probability that Trump's lead could move outside this range within a week.

Probability: 65%
