(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
About 6 weeks remain until September 24, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. remains an active independent candidate, with no indication of campaign suspension as of August 12, 2024. He continues to campaign, fundraise, poll at a significant level, and maintain ballot access[1][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Kennedy continues to campaign actively, does not make any official announcement of suspension or termination, and remains on ballots past September 24. He maintains his messaging, logistics, and funding without interruption. No permanent or campaign-ending event occurs before the deadline.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Kennedy or his campaign makes an official announcement of suspension or termination before September 24, due to dramatic unforeseen developments such as a severe health issue, catastrophic financial/legal setback, or a strategic move (for example, to throw support to another candidate). Alternatively, credible reporting reveals a permanent cessation of campaign activities before the deadline.

## Rationale

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. remains publicly committed to his presidential campaign as of August 12, 2024. In recent interviews and press conferences, he has explicitly stated his intent to remain in the race, described his campaign as "viable," and pointed to surges in volunteer and financial support, especially following changes in the Democratic field[5]. He has achieved substantial ballot access and continues to poll at levels unprecedented for independent candidates in recent decades[1][2][5].

Media reports acknowledge that Kennedy faces challenges and less momentum than earlier in the cycle, particularly after changes on the Democratic ticket, but there is no credible reporting or campaign statement suggesting he is contemplating withdrawal or suspension[5]. His robust fundraising, continued ballot qualification efforts, and active campaign infrastructure further reinforce the status quo scenario[1][2][5].

While all campaigns are subject to unforeseen risks—such as scandal, health crisis, or a radical political realignment—there is currently no evidence of such factors in play. The absence of credible rumors, reporting, or signals from the candidate or close advisers about an impending suspension further strengthens the base rate expectation that Kennedy will remain a candidate through at least September 24.

Good forecasters give extra weight to the status quo, especially when reinforced by clear statements, ongoing campaign infrastructure, and financial resources.

## Final Forecast

**Probability: 94%**

Kennedy will *not* suspend his presidential campaign before September 24, 2024. There is a low (but non-zero) risk of dropout due to unforeseen or compelling developments, but all available evidence points toward continued candidacy through the forecast window[1][2][5].
