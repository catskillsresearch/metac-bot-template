(a) Time until outcome: Approximately 7 days until Election Day on November 5, 2024, with results likely to be known within 1-2 days after that.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on current polling, Donald Trump appears positioned to outperform Rick Scott in Florida, with Trump leading Harris by 8 points while Scott leads Mucarsel-Powell by 4 points in the most recent polling.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: A surge in Democratic turnout specifically targeting the Senate race could boost Mucarsel-Powell while not affecting Harris as much. Additionally, moderate Republicans might split their tickets, supporting Scott for Senate while either not voting for president or choosing Harris, narrowing Trump's margin below Scott's.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Trump's strong appeal among NPA voters (53% vs. 43% for Harris) and Hispanic voters continues to exceed Scott's performance in these demographics. Republican voter enthusiasm remains higher for Trump than for down-ballot candidates, leading to Trump receiving more votes than Scott.

## Analysis

The polls consistently show Donald Trump with a larger margin over Kamala Harris than Rick Scott has over Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in Florida's 2024 races. The most recent Emerson College/Hill poll from October 23rd shows Trump ahead by 8 percentage points (52%-44%), while Scott leads by only 4 points (48%-44%)[4]. This pattern is consistent with earlier polling from September showing Trump +5 and Scott +1[5].

Several factors support Trump outperforming Scott:

**Polling Consistency**: Multiple polls from different organizations show Trump with a more substantial lead than Scott. The Florida Chamber statewide poll from October 24th confirms both candidates are leading, with each showing double-digit advantages among Hispanic voters and NPAs[1]. However, the specific margins consistently favor Trump.

**Independent Voter Support**: Trump holds a significant 10-point advantage among NPA voters (53%-43%) according to the August Florida Chamber poll[2]. These swing voters are critical in determining the final margins, and Trump's stronger position with them suggests he's likely to receive more votes than Scott.

**Historical Context**: Trump won Florida by 3 points in 2020, and current polling indicates he may improve on that performance with leads ranging from 5-8 points. Meanwhile, Scott appears to be in a more competitive race.

**Ticket Splitting Evidence**: There are "varying degrees of ticket splitting in these statewide polls"[5], which suggests some voters may support different parties for different races. Currently, this splitting appears to favor Scott's opponent relatively more than Trump's, which would further widen the gap between Trump and Scott's vote shares.

There are some mitigating factors to consider:

**Polling Fluctuation**: Polls represent a snapshot in time, and margins can shift in the final days of a campaign. Scott's race has shown more volatility than Trump's, with his lead ranging from 1 to 4 points in recent polls.

**Undecided Voters**: The Emerson College poll notes 3% of voters remain undecided in the presidential race[4]. A last-minute break toward Harris could narrow Trump's margin.

However, the status quo strongly suggests Trump will outperform Scott. The consistent polling advantage, Trump's stronger position with key demographics, and the historical pattern of presidential candidates often outperforming down-ballot candidates all point toward Trump receiving more votes than Scott in Florida.
