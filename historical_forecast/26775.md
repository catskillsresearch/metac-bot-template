As I analyze this forecasting question about the 2024 Grand Chess Tour winner, I'll begin by establishing the key timeline and scenarios.

(a) Time until outcome: Based on the search results, the remaining tournaments in the 2024 Grand Chess Tour are the Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz (August 10-17, 2024) and the Sinquefield Cup (August 17-31, 2024)[4]. The final outcome will be known by the end of August 2024, which is approximately 4 months from today (May 6, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changes, Fabiano Caruana (22.25 points), Alireza Firouzja (17.58 points), or Praggnanandhaa (16.25 points) would win the 2024 Grand Chess Tour, as they currently hold the top three positions. Caruana has a substantial lead of 4.67 points over Firouzja and 6 points over Praggnanandhaa.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Caruana maintains his strong performance in the remaining two tournaments, securing enough points to maintain his lead. Alternatively, either Firouzja or Praggnanandhaa performs exceptionally well while Caruana falters, allowing one of them to overtake him. Gukesh, who recently won the Candidates Tournament and became the World Chess Championship challenger[3], could also make a strong push in the remaining tournaments.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: One of the other five full tour participants (Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Wesley So, Ian Nepomniachtchi, Anish Giri, or Nodirbek Abdusattorov) performs exceptionally well in both remaining tournaments while the current top four underperform. This would require a significant points swing, especially considering Caruana's substantial lead.

## Analysis and Rationale

### Current Standings and Points Distribution

The Grand Chess Tour consists of five tournaments: three Rapid & Blitz events and two Classical events. Three tournaments have already been completed, including the Superbet Poland Rapid & Blitz, which was won by Magnus Carlsen (who is not a full tour participant but a wildcard)[4]. The remaining tournaments include one Rapid & Blitz event and one Classical event.

The points distribution for the Grand Chess Tour typically awards more points for Classical events compared to Rapid & Blitz events. While the exact point allocations aren't specified in the search results, this structure means there are still substantial points available in the remaining tournaments.

### Mathematical Possibility

Given that two tournaments remain, including one higher-valued Classical event, there is mathematically still room for significant movement in the standings. However, Caruana's 22.25 points represent a substantial lead that would be difficult to overcome.

The other tour participants (besides the top three and Gukesh) would need to win or place highly in both remaining tournaments while hoping the current leaders perform poorly. This is a tall order, especially considering the caliber of players like Caruana and Firouzja.

### Historical Precedent and Player Form

Historically, dramatic comebacks in chess tours are rare unless the points gap is relatively small. Caruana's 4.67-point lead over second place is significant in this context.

Additionally, we must consider recent form. Gukesh recently won the Candidates Tournament (April 2024)[3], demonstrating exceptional play and making him the youngest ever World Chess Championship challenger. This suggests he could be a strong contender in the remaining GCT events, potentially challenging the current top three.

The other tour participants (Vachier-Lagrave, So, Nepomniachtchi, Giri, and Abdusattorov) are all elite players capable of winning individual tournaments, but overcoming the current point gap would require exceptional performances and help from the leaders.

### Status Quo Bias Consideration

As noted in the prompt, good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. The status quo here suggests one of the current top three players will win the tour, with Caruana having the best position.

While upsets are always possible in chess, especially in rapid and blitz formats where variance is higher, the substantial lead held by the top players makes a dramatic shift in the overall standings less likely.

## Conclusion

Considering all factors, I believe there is a relatively low probability that someone other than Caruana, Firouzja, Praggnanandhaa, or Gukesh will win the 2024 Grand Chess Tour. The current standings, historical precedent, and remaining tournament structure all favor the status quo outcome.

The most likely challengers from outside this group would be Nepomniachtchi or So, both former elite players who could potentially make a surge. However, they would need to not only perform exceptionally well themselves but also benefit from poor performances by all four named players.

Probability: 15%
