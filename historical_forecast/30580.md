(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
Tesla is expected to report Q4 2024 delivery figures around January 2, 2025, which is about 1 month from today (November 29, 2024).

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If Q4 2024 follows the most recent trend (Q2 and Q3 2024), Tesla's deliveries remain below the record set in Q4 2023 (484,507 vehicles). The latest quarter, Q3 2024, saw deliveries of approximately 463,000 vehicles[5], which is still short of the year-ago Q4 record.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Tesla delivers 484,507 vehicles or fewer in Q4 2024. This outcome would likely result if demand remains tepid, macroeconomic headwinds persist, or production constraints/competition limit Tesla’s ability to ramp up output beyond recent levels. Even a slight quarter-over-quarter improvement from Q3 2024 would not be enough unless it exceeds the Q4 2023 record[1][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Tesla delivers more than 484,507 vehicles in Q4 2024. This could occur if aggressive sales incentives and early-quarter discounts drive a surge in orders, recent production capacity improvements at major factories are realized, and market conditions are favorable. Tesla’s public prediction of a “record Q4” and proactive sales strategies suggest the company is aiming for, and perhaps expects, a new all-time high[5].

## Rationale

- **Trend and Baseline:**  
Tesla’s deliveries peaked at 484,507 in Q4 2023, then dropped in Q1 2024 (386,810), and have been recovering but not yet returning to the record. Q2 2024 was 443,956, and Q3 2024 reached about 463,000[5], still below the target for a “Yes.”

- **Tesla’s Own Guidance:**  
Earlier in 2024, Tesla management guided for “notably lower” vehicle volume growth in 2024 compared to 2023, citing a transition period and a lull between major product cycles[3]. This signaled caution and a lower base expectation.

- **Recent Company Behavior:**  
In October 2024, Tesla uncharacteristically forecast a “record” Q4—signaling confidence and perhaps internal data pointing to strong demand or production[5]. The company has implemented early-quarter incentives, a departure from the typical end-loaded sales push, suggesting a concerted effort to boost Q4 results[5].

- **Production Capacity:**  
Factory expansions or upgrades at Shanghai, Berlin, and Texas could marginally help, but no major new model launches are expected to boost volumes significantly in Q4[2].

- **Market and External Risks:**  
Macroeconomic factors, EV market saturation, and competition (notably from BYD and others) are real risks. However, Tesla’s willingness to use incentives and public confidence suggest the company is not only aware of the challenge but is making a significant push to overcome it[5].

- **Weight of the Status Quo:**  
Good forecasting practice emphasizes the status quo: deliveries have not topped the Q4 2023 record since it was set. Despite Tesla’s public optimism and strategy shift, there is not (yet) hard evidence of a demand or production surge that *guarantees* a new record.

- **Balancing Evidence:**  
While the baseline is “No,” Tesla’s new guidance, incentives, and internal push for Q4 suggest a higher-than-normal chance of beating the record. However, the confidence should not be overwhelming given past guidance, recent trends, and known risks.

Probability: **65%**  
There is a moderate but not overwhelming likelihood that Tesla will deliver more than 484,507 vehicles in Q4 2024, based on their public commitment to a “record” quarter and aggressive sales tactics, but the status quo and recent quarterly results counsel for caution in exceeding 70% confidence[5][3][1].
