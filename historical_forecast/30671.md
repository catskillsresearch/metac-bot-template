(a) Time until outcome is known: Approximately 1 month, with the outcome expected to be determined shortly after January 1, 2025 when data for both weeks 51 and 52 are posted.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the most recent weekly figure of 77 cases, two weeks at this rate would yield 154 cases, which is below the 375 threshold.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Public health interventions including increased vaccination of pregnant women and timely infant immunizations successfully slow the epidemic growth. The holiday period might reduce transmission through school closures, and awareness campaigns could improve preventive behaviors, keeping the combined case count below 375.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: The epidemic continues its accelerating trajectory, with weekly cases increasing from 77 to over 187 per week by mid-December. Holiday gatherings facilitate transmission, vaccination rates remain insufficient, and the epidemic follows typical pertussis patterns of rapid growth in its early phase.

New Zealand is currently experiencing a whooping cough epidemic that was officially declared on November 22, 2024. As a forecaster, I need to assess whether New Zealand will report more than 375 combined whooping cough cases for weeks 51 and 52 of 2024 (approximately December 14-27).

## Current Epidemic Trajectory

The data shows a clear upward trend in whooping cough cases throughout 2024:

- The four-week period from October 19 to November 15 saw 263 cases, the highest four-week total in 2024[3]
- The week before November 29 reported 77 cases[5]
- By November 29, the total case count for 2024 had reached 1,009[5]

This suggests not only an increase but an acceleration in case numbers. The epidemic was described as being in its "early stages" in late November[3], indicating that we are likely still on the upward slope of the epidemic curve.

## Historical Pattern Analysis

Pertussis epidemics follow cyclical patterns, typically occurring every 3-5 years. After four years of very low activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, pertussis has returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2024[1][2]. Health officials have warned that New Zealand should prepare for high levels of cases over the next 12 months or more[3].

Looking at the weekly progression:
- August-September showed weekly cases around 28-59 cases[2]
- October-early November showed weekly cases around 47-72 cases[1]
- Most recent data shows 77 cases in a single week[5]

This represents a roughly 30-40% increase in weekly cases over a 2-3 month period.

## Factors Affecting Future Case Numbers

Several factors suggest continued growth:

1. **Epidemic Phase**: Being in the early stage of an epidemic typically means case numbers will continue to rise before reaching their peak.

2. **Reduced Immunity**: Officials note that many countries are experiencing high levels of pertussis due to lower infection rates during the COVID-19 pandemic[3].

3. **Holiday Season Impact**: Weeks 51-52 coincide with holiday gatherings and summer activities in New Zealand, which could increase transmission opportunities.

4. **Vaccination Coverage**: While vaccination efforts are underway, the current vaccination rate for one-year-olds was reported at 82% in 2024[4], leaving a significant portion unprotected.

## Mathematical Projection

If we take the most recent weekly figure of 77 cases and assume no further acceleration, weeks 51-52 would yield 154 cases combined, well below the 375 threshold.

However, if the growth rate continues at the observed pace (approximately 5-10% week-over-week increase in recent months), we might expect:
- Week 51: 90-100 cases
- Week 52: 95-110 cases
- Total: 185-210 cases

This basic projection still falls short of 375 cases.

To reach 375 cases in two weeks would require an average of 187.5 cases per week, which represents a 143% increase from the most recent weekly figure of 77 cases. While pertussis epidemics can accelerate rapidly, such a dramatic increase in just 3-4 weeks seems unlikely without extraordinary circumstances.

## Weighing the Evidence

While the epidemic is clearly growing, several factors make it unlikely to reach 375 cases in weeks 51-52:

1. The gap between current weekly rates (77 cases) and the required rate (187.5 cases per week) is substantial
2. Even with continued growth, the mathematical projection suggests a total closer to 200 cases
3. Public health interventions including vaccination campaigns targeting pregnant women and infants may begin to slow transmission[5]

However, I must acknowledge factors that could lead to faster growth:
1. The epidemic is in its early stages with potential for rapid acceleration
2. Holiday gatherings could increase transmission
3. Historical patterns of pertussis epidemics show they can grow quickly once established

## Conclusion

Given the current trajectory, while case numbers are certainly increasing, the evidence suggests that exceeding 375 combined cases in weeks 51-52 would require a dramatic acceleration beyond what the current data supports. The most likely outcome appears to be continued growth but at a rate that would produce somewhere between 150-250 combined cases for these two weeks.

Probability: 25%
