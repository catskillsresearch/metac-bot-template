Based on the available information and current drought conditions, I'll analyze the likelihood of West Virginia having 1.4 million or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 7 months and 25 days (from May 6, 2025, to December 31, 2024 - noting this is a past date from our current perspective)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the most recent data from September 24, 2024, 28.5% of the United States including Puerto Rico was experiencing moderate to exceptional drought[3]. While specific West Virginia data isn't provided in the search results, we know that drought conditions were significant enough in July 2024 that WVU Extension experts were offering tips on dealing with droughts and fires[4].

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Significant precipitation events occur in West Virginia during fall and early winter 2024, reducing drought-affected areas substantially. With West Virginia's population being relatively small (under 1.8 million), even moderate improvements in drought conditions could bring the affected population below the 1.4 million threshold.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Drought conditions persist or worsen through fall and early winter 2024, keeping most of West Virginia's population in drought-affected areas. If drought affects approximately 80% or more of the state's population, the 1.4 million threshold would be exceeded.

## Analysis and Rationale

The search results provide limited specific information about West Virginia's drought status in 2024, making this forecast challenging. However, we can make some reasonable inferences from the available data.

**Current Drought Situation**

As of September 24, 2024, 28.5% of the United States was experiencing moderate to exceptional drought[3]. In July 2024, drought conditions in West Virginia were severe enough to prompt WVU Extension experts to provide guidance on dealing with droughts and fires[4]. This indicates that drought was a significant concern in West Virginia during mid-2024.

**Historical Context and Patterns**

The search results don't provide detailed historical drought data for West Virginia. However, we know that drought conditions can persist over extended periods, as evidenced by the Southern Plains experiencing drought since June 2016[5]. While West Virginia has different climate patterns than the Southern Plains, this demonstrates that droughts can be long-lasting phenomena.

**Population Considerations**

West Virginia's population is approximately 1.8 million. For 1.4 million residents to be affected by drought, approximately 78% of the state would need to be experiencing drought conditions. Without specific information on the percentage of West Virginia currently affected, it's difficult to make a precise prediction.

**Seasonal Patterns**

Fall and early winter can bring changing precipitation patterns. However, the search results don't provide information about seasonal forecasts for West Virginia specifically. The Southern Plains data indicated that January 2024 was exceptionally cold in that region[5], but this doesn't necessarily translate to West Virginia's conditions later in the year.

**Status Quo Bias Consideration**

Given the limited information and the significant time gap between our latest data (September 2024) and the resolution date (December 31, 2024), I need to consider that drought conditions can either persist or change during this period. However, as noted, droughts can be persistent phenomena, and without specific information indicating imminent relief, I should give significant weight to the status quo continuing.

Based on the limited information available, and considering that drought conditions were significant enough to warrant expert guidance in July 2024[4], there appears to be a moderate to high chance that drought conditions affecting a substantial portion of West Virginia's population would persist through December 31, 2024.

Probability: 65%
