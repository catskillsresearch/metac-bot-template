As a professional forecaster interviewing for this position, I'll analyze this question with precision and structure.

(a) Time until outcome: The Democratic National Committee plans to hold its presidential roll call vote virtually, ahead of the in-person convention that begins August 19, 2024. This means we'll know the outcome in approximately 6-7 weeks from today (July 10, 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: President Biden secures the nomination on the first ballot during the virtual roll call, as he currently holds approximately 99% of pledged delegates[2]. This would result in a "No" outcome to the question.

(c) Scenario for "No" outcome: The virtual roll call proceeds as planned with Biden's delegates remaining loyal, and he secures the nomination on the first ballot. Given his overwhelming delegate advantage and the procedural timeline already established, this is the most straightforward path[2].

(d) Scenario for "Yes" outcome: Following mounting pressure about his debate performance, President Biden voluntarily withdraws before the nomination process. This creates a situation where thousands of delegates enter the convention uncommitted, and multiple rounds of voting are required to select a new nominee as various candidates vie for support[2].

## Rationale for My Forecast

The status quo strongly favors a "No" outcome. Historical precedent suggests brokered conventions are exceptionally rare in modern politics—the Democrats haven't had one since 1952. More importantly, the structural barriers to a brokered convention in 2024 are formidable.

President Biden currently holds approximately 99% of all pledged delegates from the primary process[2]. For a brokered convention to occur, one of two unlikely scenarios would need to unfold:

1. Biden would need to voluntarily withdraw before the nomination. While there has been some party unrest following his debate performance, Biden has shown no indication of stepping aside. The institutional party structure continues to publicly support him, including influential figures like Barack Obama and James Clyburn.

2. Thousands of delegates who are pledged to Biden would need to simultaneously revolt against the sitting president—a scenario that election law experts consider highly improbable[2]. As Derek Muller, an election law professor at Notre Dame, stated: "I don't anticipate there being a real groundswell of opposition at the convention... It would take thousands of delegates all converging and opposing him at once, against the sitting president."[2]

The DNC's decision to hold the roll call virtually before the in-person convention further reduces the likelihood of a dramatic floor fight or last-minute change[2]. This procedural choice creates an additional barrier to the kind of spontaneous delegate rebellion that would be necessary for a brokered convention.

Even if internal pressure continues to mount against Biden, the logistical challenges of replacing a nominee so late in the election cycle create strong incentives for party unity. A brokered convention would leave Democrats with a nominee selected only in late August, creating substantial disadvantages in campaign infrastructure and messaging against an opponent who has had months to prepare[1].

While recent polling shows Biden's position weakening slightly after the debate, this alone is unlikely to trigger the massive delegate revolt necessary for a brokered convention. The structural inertia heavily favors the status quo outcome.

Given all these factors—the overwhelming delegate count, procedural timeline, historical precedent, and expert analysis—a brokered convention remains highly improbable unless Biden himself chooses to withdraw, which he has given no strong indication of doing.

Probability: 8%
