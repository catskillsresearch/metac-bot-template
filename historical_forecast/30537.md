(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 1 month. The outcome will be known after December 2024 concludes, with final resolution by January 7, 2025 at the latest.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on historical trends, Miami's lowest December temperature would be lower than Anchorage's highest December temperature, resulting in a "No" outcome. This has been the pattern for at least the past 5 years.

(c) Scenario for "No" outcome: Miami experiences a typical winter cold front bringing temperatures into the mid-to-upper 40s°F at some point in December 2024, while Anchorage experiences normal December conditions with high temperatures not exceeding the low 40s°F.

(d) Scenario for "Yes" outcome: Miami experiences an unusually mild December with no significant cold fronts, keeping minimum temperatures above 50°F throughout the month, while Anchorage experiences an unusually warm spell pushing temperatures into the upper 40s°F.

As a professional forecaster, I need to carefully analyze the available data to make an informed prediction about this temperature comparison between Miami and Anchorage for December 2024.

The historical record shows that Miami's lowest December temperatures typically range in the upper 40s to low 50s Fahrenheit. Looking at recent data, Miami recorded a low temperature of 52°F in January 2024[2], which gives us a reference point for winter lows. The winter summary for 2023-2024 indicates that Miami International Airport's lowest temperature was 52°F (in January)[1], suggesting that Miami's winter lows have been relatively mild recently.

For context, historically, the absolute lowest temperature recorded in Miami was 30°F back in December 1989[5], but such extreme cold is exceptionally rare. In most years, Miami's December lows stay well above freezing.

While I don't have specific recent data for Anchorage's December highs in the search results, the question background indicates that in December 2020, Anchorage reached a high of 45°F. This appears to represent a typical upper bound for Anchorage's December temperatures based on the information provided.

The key pattern to recognize is that this temperature crossover (Miami's lowest exceeding Anchorage's highest) has not occurred in the past 5 years. The closest it came was in 2020 when Miami's December low was 47°F and Anchorage's December high was 45°F - a difference of just 2°F.

Climate patterns tend to be relatively stable year-to-year, with occasional variations due to broader climate phenomena. Without specific information indicating unusual climate conditions for December 2024, the most reasonable assumption is that the historical pattern will continue. This is especially true given that the temperature difference has been consistently in favor of a "No" outcome for at least 5 years.

That said, there is some uncertainty. If Miami experiences an unusually mild December (perhaps due to El Niño conditions or other climate factors), and if Anchorage simultaneously experiences unseasonably warm conditions, there is a possibility for the crossover to occur. However, the probability of both these conditions aligning is relatively low.

Given the historical consistency of the pattern and the absence of compelling evidence for a significant deviation from historical trends, I must assign a high probability to the status quo outcome continuing.
