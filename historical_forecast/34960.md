Based on the current date (May 6, 2025) and the resolution criteria (bankruptcy filing before April 1, 2025), this question has already been resolved. The deadline for the "Yes" outcome has passed.

(a) Time left until outcome is known: The outcome is already determined as the deadline of April 1, 2025 has passed. Today is May 6, 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome: Since we're past the resolution date and the search results don't indicate that Beyond Meat filed for bankruptcy before April 1, 2025, the status quo outcome appears to be "No."

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Beyond Meat continued to operate despite financial challenges, potentially through improved financial performance, cost-cutting measures, or successful balance sheet restructuring as mentioned in their Q3 2024 results.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: This is no longer relevant as we are past the resolution date, but would have involved Beyond Meat filing for bankruptcy protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code before April 1, 2025.

Looking at the available search results, I see that Beyond Meat was scheduled to report their Q1 2025 financial results on May 7, 2025, which is tomorrow from our current date[1][2]. The company previously reported Q3 2024 results showing some positive signs - they returned to growth with net revenues increasing 7.6% to $81.0 million, expanded gross margins, and reduced operating expenses[3][4]. Their CEO stated they expected to "increase our cash reserves by year-end and pursue further balance sheet restructuring in 2025."[4]

The search results also indicate that Beyond Meat reported their Q4 and full year 2024 results on February 26, 2025[5], but the specific results aren't provided in the search data.

The search results don't mention any bankruptcy filing before April 1, 2025. In fact, the company's continued financial reporting schedule and statements about future plans suggest they have remained operational. The mention of their plan to report Q1 2025 results on May 7, 2025, strongly indicates they remained an operational public company past the April 1, 2025 deadline.

Given that we're past the resolution date and there's no evidence in the search results of a bankruptcy filing before April 1, 2025, while there is evidence of continued operations, the question has been resolved.
