(a) **Time until outcome is known:** Approximately 6 weeks remain until April 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:** As of February 2025, the FDA lists sterile water for injection (especially large volume bags) as in shortage, and expert consensus projects that these shortages are likely to persist due to continued manufacturing disruptions and strained supply chains[3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:** Rapid restoration of manufacturing capacity at key facilities, such as Baxter's North Cove plant, combined with successful importation or alternative sourcing, could resolve the shortage. This would require full reactivation of production lines and distribution returning to pre-shortage levels before April 1, 2025—something not projected by current industry or FDA reports[4][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:** Ongoing damage at major manufacturing sites, slow recovery of production, persistent allocation protocols, and continued reliance on temporary mitigation strategies (like imports and conservation) maintain the shortage status on the FDA’s list come April 1, 2025. Hospital reports, FDA statements, and pharmaceutical news all support this trajectory[3][4][5].

## Rationale

All major sources—including the FDA, Drugs.com, industry analysts, and hospital survey data—confirm that as of February 2025, sterile water for injection remains in shortage, with ongoing allocation and reduced availability[3][4][5]. The main cause is damage at Baxter’s North Carolina facility from Hurricane Helene, a disruption not expected to be fully resolved soon[4][5]. Efforts to import product and increase allocations are stopgap measures and have not restored normal supply[4][5].

Forecasts and official statements indicate shortages are likely to persist through at least early 2025. There are no new indications of dramatic supply improvements or production breakthroughs before April 1, 2025[3][4][5].

Given the slow-moving nature of drug manufacturing recovery, expert guidance recommends weighting the status quo most heavily. Even in optimistic scenarios, full recovery within the next six weeks appears improbable barring unforeseen developments.
