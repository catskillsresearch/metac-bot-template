(a) Time until outcome: 56 days (from May 6, 2025 to March 31, 2025 - as this is already in the past)

(b) Status quo outcome: No - according to the search results, Tesla's price as of May 5, 2025 was $281.79, which is below the $420 threshold.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Tesla continued to face challenges with deliveries and competition in the EV market, while investor expectations for AI products like Teslabot and Robotaxi weren't fully realized by March 31, 2025, keeping the stock price below $420.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Tesla's AI initiatives gained significant traction, with successful demonstrations of Teslabot and Robotaxi technology, creating renewed investor enthusiasm that drove the stock price above $420 by the March 31, 2025 deadline.

Based on the search results and the current date (May 6, 2025), I can provide a retrospective analysis of this forecasting question, as March 31, 2025 has already passed.

According to the most recent data available in the search results, Tesla's stock price as of May 5, 2025, is $281.79[1]. This indicates that the stock price is currently well below the $420 threshold specified in the question. Since we're looking back at March 31, 2025 (which has already passed), and the current price is significantly below $420, it's reasonable to conclude that Tesla did not reach the $420 threshold by March 31, 2025.

The search results also show forecasts for future months in 2025, with August and September price targets ranging from approximately $319 to $413[1]. Even these forward-looking projections don't exceed the $420 mark, suggesting that Tesla's stock has remained below this threshold.

It's worth noting that there were some optimistic predictions made earlier. In March 2021, ARK Invest had projected a 2025 price target of $3,000 per share for Tesla, with bear and bull cases of $1,500 and $4,000 respectively[2]. However, these predictions were made over four years ago, and the current reality of Tesla's stock price is significantly different.

The more recent forecast from January 2025 indicated an average stock forecast of $300.37, representing only a modest upside of 4.58% from that time[4]. This aligns more closely with the current price we're seeing in May 2025.

Looking at the historical context, Tesla had missed its annual delivery targets for the first time in late 2024, which had a negative impact on the stock price. Despite some analysts remaining bullish on potential gains in 2025, particularly from Tesla's AI initiatives[3], the stock has not managed to recover to the $420 level by the specified date.

As a forecaster, I recognize that the status quo tends to persist in many cases, and dramatic changes in stock prices, while possible, often don't materialize as quickly or dramatically as some might predict. In this case, the downward momentum from late 2024 and early 2025 appears to have continued, with the stock failing to reach the $420 threshold.
