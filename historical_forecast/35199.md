**Forecast Analysis**  
**(a) Time remaining:** 40 days (February 20 to April 1, 2025).  
**(b) Status quo outcome:** No IPO announcement. Stripe has consistently deferred IPO plans since 2023[1][4], prioritized private liquidity events[1][3], and avoided definitive statements[2].  
**(c) No scenario:** Stripe continues private share sales (e.g., $85B employee tender[1]), maintains workforce restructuring[3], and delays SEC filings, preserving optionality.  
**(d) Yes scenario:** Sudden market improvements or investor pressure triggers an S-1 filing, leveraging recent valuation gains[1][3] and patent/IP developments[5].  

**Rationale**  
Stripeâ€™s actions prioritize private liquidity over public markets, with no direct evidence of SEC preparation. Recent $85B valuation discussions (February 2025)[1][3] suggest continued private financing, while workforce changes and branding investments[1] indicate operational focus rather than IPO prep. Historical patterns of deferred timelines[2][5] and explicit executive non-commitment[2] heavily favor the status quo.  

**Probability: 15%**
