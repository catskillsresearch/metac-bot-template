(a) Time left until outcome: The question asks about August 15, 2025, which is approximately 34 days from the current date (July 12, 2024).

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changes from the current situation, astronauts Williams and Wilmore would likely return to Earth before mid-August 2024, as NASA officials have indicated the latest they could return would be mid-August.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Technical issues with the Starliner spacecraft worsen, making a return too risky. NASA determines the safest option is to keep the astronauts on the ISS longer and potentially return them on a different spacecraft after August 15.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: NASA and Boeing successfully complete their analysis of the helium leaks and thruster issues, determine the Starliner is safe for return, and bring Williams and Wilmore back to Earth by late July or early August as they've suggested is possible.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the likelihood that astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will be back on Earth by August 15, 2024. Let me analyze the situation carefully.

## Current Mission Status

Astronauts Wilmore and Williams launched to the International Space Station on Boeing's Starliner on June 5, 2024. Their mission was originally planned to last about a week, with a return scheduled for June 13[5]. However, multiple technical issues have delayed their return indefinitely:

- Starliner experienced helium leaks in its propulsion system
- Some of the spacecraft's reaction control system (RCS) thrusters had problems
- NASA and Boeing are conducting extensive testing before approving return[1][5]

As of July 10, 2024, NASA officials stated they were still analyzing data and conducting ground tests to ensure a safe return for the astronauts[1].

## Timeline Considerations

Several important factors influence when Williams and Wilmore might return:

1. **Maximum return deadline**: According to Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, "The absolute latest Starliner could return with Wilmore and Williams would be mid-August."[5] This statement directly addresses our question timeframe.

2. **ISS schedule constraints**: NASA needs to manage upcoming crew rotations and spacewalks. Mission managers were evaluating return opportunities following planned spacewalks on June 24 and July 2[3].

3. **Current safety assessment**: Despite the technical issues, NASA officials have confirmed that "the spacecraft is rated to leave the ISS in case of an emergency, with all but one of its 28 RCS thrusters cleared for use during reentry."[5] This indicates the spacecraft remains fundamentally capable of return.

4. **Extended mission benefits**: Boeing representatives have noted that the extended mission is providing valuable additional data, with one engineer describing it as "AWESOME, in all caps."[5] This suggests there's no rush to end the mission prematurely.

## Analysis

Looking at the status quo, several factors point toward a return before August 15:

1. NASA's explicit statement that mid-August is the absolute latest return date suggests they have a firm upper limit that coincides with our question date.

2. The spacecraft, despite its issues, is currently considered capable of safe return with most of its systems functioning normally.

3. NASA and Boeing have been methodically working through the technical issues since early June, giving them significant time to develop return plans.

However, some uncertainty remains:

1. Technical issues could potentially worsen or new problems could emerge.

2. The careful, data-driven approach NASA is taking means they won't commit to a return date until they're fully confident.

Given the status quo tends to prevail, and NASA has explicitly stated mid-August as the latest return date, there appears to be a high probability that Williams and Wilmore will be back on Earth by August 15. The only major scenario where they would not return by this date would involve discovering severe additional problems with Starliner that would make a return mission unsafe, which seems unlikely given the current assessments.

Probability: 85%
