As I approach this forecasting question, I need to carefully analyze the available information about the Ivy League teams and their prospects in the 2025 NCAA men's basketball tournament.

(a) Time until outcome is known: The NCAA Tournament typically begins in mid-March with the First Four games, followed by the first round proper. The second round usually takes place about 2-3 days after the first round. Based on today's date (May 6, 2025), the outcome is already known, as the 2025 NCAA Tournament would have concluded by April 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the search results, Yale won the 2025 Ivy League Tournament, defeating Cornell in the championship game on March 16, 2025[2][3]. Yale earned the automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament as the Ivy League representative. Historically, Ivy League teams often receive seeds in the 12-14 range and face tough first-round matchups against higher-seeded teams.

(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: Yale could have been matched against a strong high-seed team (3-5 seed) in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Despite Yale's impressive regular season (20-7, 13-1 in Ivy play)[5] and back-to-back Ivy Madness titles[2], they might have faced a significantly stronger opponent from a major conference with superior talent and depth, resulting in a first-round exit.

(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: Yale, led by Ivy League Player of the Year Bez Mbeng and strong three-point shooter John Poulakidas[1][4], could have used their offensive efficiency and three-point shooting prowess to upset their first-round opponent. Yale's experience from winning back-to-back Ivy tournaments[2] and their proven ability to compete with major conference teams during the regular season could have propelled them to a first-round victory.

In analyzing this question, I need to consider several key factors:

1. Yale was clearly the strongest team in the Ivy League for the 2024-2025 season, winning the regular season title and the tournament championship[1][2].

2. Yale demonstrated significant strengths throughout the season:
   - They featured the Ivy League Player of the Year (Bez Mbeng)[1]
   - Strong three-point shooting, particularly from John Poulakidas[1][4]
   - Experience from previous tournament success (back-to-back Ivy Madness titles)[2]
   - Solid overall record (20-7, 13-1 in conference play)[5]

3. However, the search results do not provide information about:
   - Yale's seed in the NCAA Tournament
   - Their first-round matchup
   - The actual tournament results

4. Historical context suggests Ivy League teams typically face challenging first-round matchups but occasionally pull upsets:
   - Yale has made seven NCAA Tournament appearances according to the search results[4]
   - Cornell's last NCAA appearance resulted in a Sweet 16 run (mentioned as part of Jon Jaques' background, Cornell's coach)[3]

Given the status quo bias and the historical performance of Ivy League teams in the NCAA Tournament, I must be cautious. While Yale had a strong season and qualities that could make them capable of an upset (three-point shooting, experienced leadership), the odds historically favor higher seeds in first-round matchups.

Without specific information about Yale's seed, matchup, or tournament performance, I must rely on the historical patterns and the team's demonstrated strength relative to past Ivy champions. Yale appears to have been one of the stronger Ivy representatives in recent years, having won back-to-back tournaments and featuring the conference player of the year.

Probability: 40%
