(a) **Time Left Until the Outcome is Known:**  
As of November 12, 2024, there are 10 days until November 22, 2024, when the outcome will be determined.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
The status quo strongly favors a “Yes.” Alta Ski Area has officially and publicly announced that its 87th winter season will begin on November 22, 2024, with specified lifts, food venues, and ticket policies all planned for that date[1][2]. Industry sources (like Ski Utah and On the Snow’s projected opening trackers) align with this date as Alta’s anticipated opening[2][5]. In most years, Alta opens around this week in November, and there is no current information indicating a delay or disruption[4].

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome:**  
A “No” would occur if adverse weather prevents safe or feasible operations (e.g., insufficient snow base, dangerous conditions) or if an operational issue (mechanical, staffing, or regulatory) delays opening. For example, if heavy warmth or lack of storms left the mountain unskiable, Alta might announce a postponement. If such a delay were announced, On the Snow would list Alta as “Closed” on November 22.

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome:**  
A “Yes” occurs if Alta’s planned limited opening (with Collins, Wildcat, and Transfer Tow lifts running) proceeds as scheduled. Even if only part of the mountain is open and the resort recommends “expert skiers only,” as long as any lift-served skiing is available, On the Snow is highly likely to list Alta as “Open” for that day[1].

## Rationale

Alta’s historical pattern is to open in the third or fourth week of November, commonly for a limited, early-season launch for advanced skiers[1][3][4]. Both Alta’s official website and trusted third-party industry trackers list November 22, 2024, as Alta’s opening date, with no caveats or indications of possible delay as of November 12[1][2][4][5]. While all resort openings are weather-dependent and subject to last-minute changes, there is no evidence of impending issues for the 2024-25 season at Alta. Forecasters tend to place significant weight on the announced plan, especially this close to the event unless there is concrete information suggesting a disruption. Alta’s messaging about “expert skiers only” and “limited terrain” is standard language for their typical early opening, not a sign of problems[1].

Based on all pre-November-12, 2024 evidence, the probability Alta will be listed as “Open” by On the Snow’s Ski Report on November 22, 2024, is very high.

Probability: 95%
