(a) **Time left until outcome is known**  
As of today, May 6, 2025, there are just over 1 month (about 32 days) until UFC 313 takes place on March 8, 2025. The result will be known that night, barring last-minute changes to the main event.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes**  
The status quo is that Alex Pereira is the reigning UFC light heavyweight champion, renowned for his elite striking and recent dominant performances. He is scheduled to defend his title against Magomed Ankalaev, a highly skilled and well-rounded challenger. Both betting markets and expert analysis indicate this is a very close fight, though Pereira is viewed as a *slight* favorite as the event approaches[1][3]. If the fight proceeds as planned and both fighters perform in line with recent form, the most likely outcome is a Pereira win by KO/TKO or decision.

(c) **Scenario that results in an unexpected outcome**  
MMA remains unpredictable; several scenarios could upset expectations:

- Ankalaev, leveraging his superior grappling, controls Pereira on the mat and wins a dominant decision or secures a submission—capitalizing on Pereira’s relative weakness in grappling defense.
- The bout ends in a no contest due to an accidental foul or medical incident that stops the fight before the halfway point, which is rare but within the realm of possibility.
- An early, unforeseen injury or disqualification alters the bout, resulting in a non-standard result.

## Rationale

Forecasting mixed martial arts outcomes requires attention to both fighters' strengths, current odds, and the inherently volatile nature of the sport. The betting odds are very tight: recent lines place Pereira at -112 and Ankalaev at -112 or very similar, suggesting nearly even probabilities[1][3]. Some sportsbooks opened Ankalaev as a slight favorite, but action has shifted the odds toward parity as fight week has neared[3].

Pereira’s best path to victory is striking; most analysts and odds-makers slightly lean his way, reflecting his recent form and knockout power. Ankalaev’s route is to neutralize Pereira with grappling and win on the mat, a style that has troubled Pereira in the past—but Ankalaev must avoid Pereira’s explosive striking, particularly early in the fight.

Both men are proven finishers with multiple “Performance of the Night” bonuses. Neither has shown substantial recent decline, and no injuries or withdrawals have surfaced as of this forecast.

Given that upsets, freak injuries, or a no contest do sometimes occur, it is prudent to allocate a modest probability to the “No Contest/Draw/Other Outcome” bucket—though these remain less likely than a decisive win.

## Final probabilities

Alex Pereira: 48%  
Magomed Ankalaev: 45%  
No Contest/Draw/Other Outcome: 7%
