(a) Time left until outcome is known: 31 days (from May 6, 2025 to April 7, 2025 - which has already passed)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Yes - The Trump administration has already imposed new tariffs on the EU that took effect on March 12, 2025, and have remained in place for more than seven days before April 7, 2025.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: This would have required one of the following to have occurred: 1) The March 12 tariffs were canceled before implementation, 2) The tariffs were implemented but then lifted before being in effect for seven days, or 3) At least one EU member state was exempted from the tariffs.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: The steel and aluminum tariffs announced on February 10, 2025, went into effect on March 12, 2025, as scheduled, targeting all EU countries and remained in effect for at least seven days before April 7, 2025.

Since the question is asking about a past event (from our current date of May 6, 2025), I can analyze what actually happened rather than forecast a future probability.

Based on the search results, President Trump issued proclamations on February 10, 2025, modifying the steel and aluminum tariffs that were originally imposed in 2018. The key changes included:

1. Ending all country exemptions, including for EU member states[5]
2. Raising aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%[4][5]
3. Maintaining the 25% tariff on steel imports[4][5]
4. Adding more downstream steel and aluminum products to the tariffs' coverage[5]

These changes were specifically scheduled to take effect on March 12, 2025[5]. The proclamations made it clear that these tariffs would apply to all countries, with no exemptions for any EU member states[5]. The search results do not indicate that these tariffs were postponed, canceled, or lifted after implementation.

The tariffs were announced in February, well before the April 7 deadline, and were set to take effect on March 12, 2025, which gave them more than the required seven days to be in effect before April 7. The search results show no evidence that these tariffs were paused or suspended after implementation.

Given that the tariffs met all criteria specified in the question:
- They were not in effect on February 14, 2025
- They targeted the entire EU with no member state exemptions
- They took effect on March 12, 2025, and remained in effect for more than seven days before April 7

Probability: 100%
