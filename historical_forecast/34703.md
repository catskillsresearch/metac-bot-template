(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of February 8, 2025, there are approximately 7 weeks (just under two months) remaining until April 1, 2025, when the resolution criteria will be assessed.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, Claude (by Anthropic) does not have the capability to order a Starbucks delivery for users in North America via the main chat interface alone, without requiring additional plugins, APIs, or user actions beyond a direct chat conversation. No credible sources report such integration has been implemented as of February 2025.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If Claude continues to operate as it currently does—lacking deep integration with Starbucks or delivery services (like DoorDash) and unable to autonomously process delivery orders in the main chat interface—then the criteria won’t be met. This includes the likely continuation of Starbucks keeping its ordering APIs private and not granting third-party AI agents such as Claude direct ordering capabilities[3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
This would require a significant development: Starbucks (or its delivery partner) would need to open its ordering APIs or otherwise collaborate directly with Anthropic, and Anthropic would need to implement, test, and deploy a system that allows users to place complete Starbucks delivery orders directly from the main Claude chat interface, handling payment and delivery details via conversation alone, with no extra user steps or plugins. There is no evidence such an announcement or integration is imminent as of early February 2025.

## Rationale

- **Historical trends show** Starbucks has embraced AI for personalization and operational efficiency, but always within its own tightly controlled platforms (app, website)[1].
- **API access is pivotal:** Without public or third-party developer access to Starbucks’ ordering system, external AI agents like Claude cannot place orders on a user's behalf through the chat alone[3].
- **No announcements:** As of February 8, 2025, neither Starbucks nor Anthropic has signaled such an integration is live or planned in the near term.
- **Technical and regulatory hurdles:** Handling payments, sensitive user data, and real-time delivery logistics via a general-purpose chatbot requires not just technology but compliance with legal and security requirements, making a rapid rollout unlikely.
- **Market signals:** While generative agent AI is advancing in 2025, with agents starting to take on more complex real-world tasks, most current agent AI examples (including those involving Claude) are still focusing on information gathering, scheduling, and customer support, not direct e-commerce transactions[2][4].

Given these facts, the **status quo is very likely to persist** for at least the remainder of Q1 2025. Good forecasting practice gives substantial weight to the default scenario when no disruptive announcements or visible pilot programs are underway.
