(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The outcome is already known. The final of the 2024 Copa Libertadores, between Atlético Mineiro and Botafogo, took place on November 30, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Atlético Mineiro lost the 2024 Copa Libertadores final to Botafogo by a score of 1–3[2].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Atlético Mineiro advances through the knockout rounds to the final but loses the championship match to their opponent. This is the scenario that occurred, as Botafogo defeated Atlético Mineiro 3–1 in the final[2].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Atlético Mineiro would win the final against Botafogo and be crowned Copa Libertadores champions. This did not occur.

---

Given that the final has already been played and credible sources confirm the result, the status quo outcome is definitive. The world, as usual, did not dramatically change, and the favored scenario (a Brazilian club winning, but not Atlético Mineiro) held.

**Probability: 0%**  
Atlético Mineiro did not win the 2024 Copa Libertadores; Botafogo were the champions[2][5].
