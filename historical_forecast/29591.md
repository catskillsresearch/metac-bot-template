(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The relevant CDC data for the period ending December 21, 2024, will be available in the first FluView Weekly US Influenza Surveillance Report published after that week—so the outcome will be known in late December 2024, roughly 1.5 months from the current date of November 5, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the most recent available CDC data (week 43, ending late October 2024), 96.3% of positive influenza specimens since September 29, 2024, are influenza A[5]. If this pattern continued through December 21, the CDC would report well above 80% influenza A for this period.

(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
For the proportion of influenza A to fall below 80% by December 21, there would need to be a substantial surge in influenza B cases during November and December. This could happen if an unusually early and strong wave of influenza B begins circulating widely in the US before late December—a pattern seen in some historical seasons (e.g., seasons with two distinct waves, the latter often being influenza B), though typically the B wave begins later in the season[2].

(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
If current trends continue—with influenza A comprising the vast majority of positive samples through the pre-Christmas period—and influenza B activity remains low or does not accelerate until after December 21, then the proportion of influenza A will remain well above 80%[5]. This is consistent with typical US flu seasonality, where influenza A usually dominates early in the season and influenza B often emerges later (January or February)[2].

## Rationale

Recent data show influenza A dominating US cases so far in the 2024-25 season (96.3% cumulative since September 29, 2024)[5]. This is a higher proportion than at the same time in the previous 2023-24 season, which ultimately ended with 69.2% influenza A for the year, but saw the second, influenza B-dominated wave begin after December[2].

Most past US flu seasons feature influenza A as the main circulating type before January, with influenza B typically rising later, if at all. The only realistic way the cumulative proportion of influenza A would drop below 80% before December 21 is if influenza B suddenly surges in November and early December to make up a substantial share of all positives in that period, which is not the current trajectory.

Given that the world (and specifically, influenza season timing and dynamics) usually changes slowly and status quo patterns persist unless disrupted, the most likely outcome is that influenza A stays above 80% of positives through December 21, 2024.
