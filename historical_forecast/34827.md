(a) Time until outcome is known: 52 days (from February 7, 2025 until March 31, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: NVIDIA would continue its market leadership and outperformance compared to the other tech giants, maintaining its position as the top performer among the "Magnificent Seven."

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: A significant technical advancement by Apple or Microsoft in AI deployment or monetization could disrupt NVIDIA's dominance. Alternatively, if NVIDIA faces unexpected production delays with its Blackwell chips or regulatory challenges, its stock could underperform relative to peers who are further along in the AI monetization phase.

Based on the information available, I'll analyze the potential stock performance for each of the five largest companies for February and March 2025:

NVIDIA has demonstrated exceptional performance through 2024 with a 171% stock rise and remains the analyst favorite heading into 2025[1]. Despite entering a correction toward the end of 2024, major financial institutions including Bernstein, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America have named it a top pick for 2025[1]. The strong demand anticipated for NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell chips is expected to fuel another year of substantial growth. However, we must consider that NVIDIA has already experienced massive growth, making comparable percentage gains more challenging.

Apple has maintained its position as one of the world's most valuable companies, with a market cap exceeding $3.7 trillion[2]. While Apple hasn't demonstrated the explosive growth of NVIDIA recently, its stable ecosystem and services expansion provide consistent performance. The company could surprise with new product announcements or better-than-expected AI integration in its ecosystem during the period in question.

Microsoft continues to be a strong performer with its Azure cloud services and strategic AI partnerships. As the market shifts toward AI deployment and monetization (what Goldman Sachs calls "Phase 3" of AI evolution), Microsoft is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend with its enterprise software and cloud infrastructure[1].

Amazon has shown resilience and adaptability in its various business segments. As e-commerce stabilizes and AWS continues to grow, Amazon could benefit from the AI monetization phase, particularly through its cloud services division.

Alphabet stands to benefit significantly from the shift toward AI monetization, with its extensive data and advertising infrastructure. Google's AI capabilities integrated into its search and advertising platforms could drive unexpected growth if monetization exceeds analyst expectations.

A key consideration is that Goldman Sachs analysts forecast the Magnificent Seven will collectively outperform the rest of the S&P 500 by 7 percentage points in 2025, which is the narrowest margin in seven years[1]. This suggests a moderation in the exceptional growth these companies have experienced.

JPMorgan analysts have also noted that the significant AI investments made by these tech giants could lead to higher depreciation costs in 2025, potentially impacting profitability[1].

The market appears to be transitioning from the AI infrastructure build-out phase to the deployment and monetization phase. This shift could favor companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon that offer software and services over pure hardware providers like NVIDIA[1].

Taking all these factors into account and maintaining appropriate uncertainty:

NVDA: 35%
AAPL: 16% 
MSFT: 20%
AMZN: 15%
GOOG: 14%
