(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  
As of November 11, 2024, there are approximately 51 days remaining until January 1, 2025, when the resolution criteria will be evaluated.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If no major disruptive event occurs in the next seven weeks, none of the criteria for a “No” outcome (AGI, population crash, unprecedented GDP spike, alien technosignatures, ontologically shocking UAP explanation, World War III, or nuclear war) will be triggered. The question would resolve as **Yes**: the world remains "normal" by the specified metrics.

(c) **Brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A “No” outcome would require at least one of the following before January 1, 2025:
- A credible and widely accepted announcement of artificial general intelligence (AGI) development,
- A catastrophic event or data release showing a 10% population reduction in five years,
- A sudden verified 30%+ increase in global real GDP in a single year,
- A scientific announcement of alien technosignature discovery,
- Consensus on a worldview-shattering, ontologically shocking explanation for UAPs,
- The outbreak of World War III,
- Or the detonation of a nuclear weapon as an act of war.

(d) **Brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A “Yes” outcome occurs if none of the above world-altering events happen by January 1, 2025. This would mean no AGI claim is validated, human population remains stable, the economy grows at historical rates, no alien technosignature or shocking UAP explanation emerges, and there is no large-scale war or nuclear detonation. The status quo—despite ongoing technological, political, and scientific developments—holds.

## Rationale

Consistent with good forecasting practices, the status quo outcome deserves significant weight, as transformative events on these scales are rare within short timeframes.

### AGI Development
Despite rapid progress in AI—such as commercial humanoids and increasingly capable language models—multiple credible sources confirm that full AGI is not expected in 2024[1][2]. Expert timelines, including perspectives from DeepMind and academic surveys, generally put 50% probability for AGI toward the late 2020s or beyond, with only a minority forecasting AGI much sooner[4][5]. There is no credible or public evidence of AGI as of November 2024, and leading indicators suggest there will be no validated AGI breakthrough before 2025[1][5].

### Other Criteria
Recent history shows:
- No major demographic catastrophe or evidence of imminent 10% population reduction.
- No unprecedented GDP surge; global economic data shows typical, even muted, growth.
- No announcements of alien technosignature discovery.
- No new, definitive UAP/UFO revelations with worldview-shattering implications.
- While geopolitical tensions persist, there is no outbreak of World War III or acts of nuclear war[2].

Sources and prediction markets indicate low probabilities for these transformative events over the next seven weeks; none appear imminent[5].

### Weighting the Status Quo
Given how slowly the world usually changes on such extreme metrics, the best forecast is that the world will remain "normal" per the defined criteria through the end of 2024. There is always some probability for surprise, but these are collectively very low-probability, high-impact events with little sign of materializing imminently.
