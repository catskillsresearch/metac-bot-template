(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
Approximately 20 days remain until December 31, 2024, when the outcome will be determined via the U.S. Drought Monitor's official "population in drought" statistic.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, 36.8% of the United States (including Puerto Rico) is in moderate to exceptional drought. Recent history shows that this level of drought coverage typically correlates with fewer than 100 million Americans living in drought, especially when drought is concentrated in less densely populated regions[1][5]. With no evidence of a major emerging shift, the status quo suggests the population in drought will remain below 100 million.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Drought coverage remains steady or even declines, staying at or below the current level (36.8%), with no significant expansion into major population centers. The number of affected residents stays well under 100 million, as is currently likely, given most drought-affected areas are not heavily populated[1][2].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A rapid, late-December expansion of drought conditions occurs, covering new, highly populated regions (e.g., the East Coast metropolitan areas, the Midwest, or Californiaâ€™s urban centers). This drives both the percentage of land and the affected population above the 100 million mark before December 31. There is currently no meteorological or policy signal suggesting such a dramatic change is underway[1][2][5].

## Rationale

Recent weekly reports show only incremental changes in both area and severity of drought, with little evidence of a pattern that would quickly drive affected numbers significantly higher. Although almost 37% of the country is in drought, this is not among the historic highs, and drought currently affects many rural or less densely populated regions. The critical population figure for the Drought Monitor typically lags area coverage, and unless a significant shift occurs in the next three weeks, a major increase is improbable.

Given the historical correlation between drought coverage and population, the lack of expansion into highly populated areas, and the absence of new significant drought events or policies that could alter trends meaningfully before the deadline, the status quo outcome (a "No") deserves the most weight. While it is always possible that a surprise event could tip the balance, experienced forecasters know dramatic late changes are rare without clear meteorological signals.
