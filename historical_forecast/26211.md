(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  
The men's pole vault final at the 2024 Paris Olympics is scheduled for early August 2024. As of July 17, 2024, the outcome will be known in approximately 2–3 weeks.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The status quo is that Armand Duplantis consistently clears heights near or above 6.00m in major competitions. The Olympic record stands at 6.03m, set by Thiago Braz in 2016. Duplantis has cleared up to 6.24m in 2024 and regularly attempts much higher bars than the Olympic record, while no other active competitor has shown form above 6.00m in 2024[2][4][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Duplantis, the only realistic candidate to break the record, experiences an off day (injury, poor weather, tactical errors, or competition strategy) and either fails before or does not attempt 6.04m or higher at the Olympic final. Other vaulters—Sam Kendricks (season best 5.95m), Thibaut Collet (5.85m)—do not possess the current form to challenge the record[2][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Duplantis wins the gold with the competition already decided, then opts to raise the bar above 6.03m for a new Olympic record, as he has done at other major meets. Given his proven ability, favorable conditions, and showman tendency to target records, he clears 6.04m or higher—setting a new Olympic record[1][2][4].

## Rationale

The Olympic pole vault record remains at 6.03m, while the world record is now 6.24m, set by Duplantis in April 2024[1][4]. Duplantis has dominated the 2024 season, consistently clearing six metres or more and attempting new world records at major meets, including just before the Olympics at the Paris Diamond League, where he cleared 6.00m and attempted 6.25m[2][3].

No other vaulter in the current field has cleared six metres in 2024, let alone approached the Olympic record threshold[2][5]. The suspended Thiago Braz will not compete, removing a previous record holder from contention.

The greatest risk to a "Yes" is the inherent unpredictability of championship events—injury, weather, or a poor day. However, Duplantis’s record of consistency, health, and ambition (choosing to attempt for records in finals) strongly weighs toward the record being broken. The status quo outcome—the record **not** being broken—rests mainly on the history that championship finals sometimes end conservatively or in difficult conditions, but Duplantis’s performance curve exceeds those concerns in this Olympic cycle.

## Final Assessment

Given these factors—and emphasizing that the world changes slowly absent strong contrary signals, but in this case the evidence for change (Duplantis's dominance and record attempts) is exceptional—the probability that the Olympic record will be broken at Paris 2024 is **very high**.

Probability: 85%
