Based on the current date of May 6, 2025, I can see that the question is actually asking about a past event - whether Nancy Pelosi's stock portfolio beat Berkshire Hathaway in 2024. Since we're now in May 2025, the outcome of this comparison for the 2024 calendar year should already be known. However, the search results only contain information up to October 2024, so I'll approach this as if I'm forecasting from that point in time.

(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 2 months (from October 2024 until the end of December 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the available information, Nancy Pelosi's portfolio appears to be significantly outperforming the broader market in 2024, with over $23 million in gains reported by October 2024[5]. Without specific data on Berkshire Hathaway's performance during the same period, the status quo suggests Pelosi's technology-heavy portfolio would continue its strong performance through year-end.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: If there's a significant correction in technology stocks (particularly in AI-related companies like Nvidia, which makes up 21% of Pelosi's portfolio) in the final months of 2024, while Berkshire Hathaway's more diversified portfolio remains stable or rises, Pelosi's returns could fall below Berkshire's. Additionally, if Berkshire makes particularly successful investments in Q4 2024 that outpace Pelosi's gains, the outcome would be No.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: If the technology sector continues its strong performance through the end of 2024, particularly in AI-related stocks like Nvidia (which had gained 95.75% since the start of 2024 as of March[2]), Pelosi's portfolio would likely maintain its impressive growth trajectory. Given that she had already accumulated $23 million in gains by October 2024[5], continued strength in her key holdings would likely result in her outperforming Berkshire Hathaway.

## Rationale

Nancy Pelosi's stock portfolio has shown remarkable performance in 2024, with significant gains driven by strategic investments in technology stocks. As of October 2024, she had already made over $23 million through these investments[5], with her portfolio seeing an additional rise of $1.2 million on October 15 alone, taking her overall net worth close to $257 million[5].

Her largest holding, Nvidia, which represents 21% of her portfolio, had gained 95.75% in value since the start of 2024 (as reported in March 2024)[2]. Other significant holdings showing strong performance included Microsoft (18% of portfolio, +15.60%), Alphabet (12%, +9.12%), and Amazon (4%, +19.30%)[2].

Historical context suggests Pelosi has consistently outperformed the broader market, with her portfolio reportedly returning over 700% in a decade[3] and gaining 65% in January 2024 alone, far outpacing the S&P 500's 24% return[1].

The technology sector, particularly companies involved in artificial intelligence, has been a major driver behind broader market strength in 2024[5]. Pelosi's portfolio is heavily weighted toward these sectors, which likely contributed to her strong performance.

While maintaining respect for the status quo bias, several factors suggest Pelosi's portfolio was on track to outperform Berkshire Hathaway in 2024:

1. Her technology-heavy portfolio had already accumulated substantial gains by October 2024
2. Her largest holding (Nvidia) had nearly doubled in value since the start of the year
3. Her strategic trades, including a "massive Broadcom options buy" in late June, appeared well-timed[5]
4. She demonstrated adaptability by cutting losses on underperforming positions like Tesla[5]

Without specific comparative data on Berkshire Hathaway's 2024 performance in the search results, I cannot make a direct comparison. However, Berkshire's traditionally more conservative approach and lower exposure to high-growth technology sectors suggests Pelosi's portfolio was likely outperforming Berkshire through most of 2024.

Given these factors, and considering the status quo at the time of the available information (October 2024), the probability favors Pelosi's portfolio outperforming Berkshire Hathaway for the full year 2024.

Probability: 75%
