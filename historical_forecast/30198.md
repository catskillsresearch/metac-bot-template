(a) Time left until outcome known: About 12 days (from November 18, 2024, to December 1, 2024)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Based on the search results, the recall was still active as of November 18, 2024, so the status quo outcome would be "No" - the recall remains active.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: FSIS verification inspections are delayed or identify issues requiring additional corrective actions by Dearborn Sausage Company, keeping the recall active past December 1st.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Dearborn Sausage Company successfully completes all required corrective actions, FSIS verifies compliance, and officially closes the recall before December 1st.

The Dearborn Sausage Company recall was initiated on September 12, 2024, due to misbranding and undeclared allergens affecting approximately 1,944 pounds of ready-to-eat (RTE) wiener products[3][4]. When evaluating whether this recall will be closed before December 1, 2024, I need to consider several key factors.

## Recall Timeline Analysis

The recall has been active for over two months as of November 18, 2024. In examining the characteristics of this particular recall:

- It involves a relatively small amount of product (1,944 pounds)[3]
- The issue is misbranding with undeclared allergens (soy) and ingredients (pork)[3][4]
- No illnesses or adverse reactions were reported as of the announcement date[3]

These factors generally point to a recall that should be relatively straightforward to resolve. The search results indicate that the recall status was still "Active" as of the most recent data (November 18, 2024)[2].

## Typical Recall Resolution Timeframes

While the search results don't provide specific data on average USDA recall closure timelines, recalls involving labeling issues and allergens without reported illnesses typically resolve more quickly than those involving pathogens or widespread contamination.

From the search results, I can see that the Dearborn Sausage Company recall was listed as still open on the FSIS website as of September 12, 2024[2][3]. The search results from November 18, 2024, still list it as active, suggesting it has remained open for at least two months[5].

## Factors Affecting Resolution Time

Several factors may be influencing the resolution timeline:

1. **Verification Activities**: FSIS must verify that all recalled products have been properly accounted for and that corrective actions have been implemented before closing a recall.

2. **Corrective Actions**: The company must demonstrate that they've addressed the root cause of the mislabeling and implemented measures to prevent recurrence.

3. **Product Recovery Rate**: The percentage of recalled product successfully recovered impacts closure timing.

4. **Administrative Processing**: Even after all requirements are met, there may be administrative delays in officially closing the recall.

## Status Quo Considerations

Given that the recall was still active as of November 18, 2024, approximately two months after initiation, I need to consider whether sufficient changes will occur in the remaining 12 days to result in closure.

The status quo suggests the recall remains open, and without specific information indicating imminent closure, I should give substantial weight to this continuing. Food safety recalls, even for relatively straightforward issues, often take several months to close as verification activities and documentation processes are completed.

## Final Assessment

Given that:
- The recall has already been active for over two months
- No information in the search results indicates imminent closure
- The recall involves allergens (which FSIS takes seriously)
- Administrative processes for closing recalls can take time
- Only 12 days remain until the December 1 deadline

I must give substantial weight to the status quo outcome of the recall remaining active. While the limited scope and absence of reported illnesses are positive factors, the lack of any indication of pending closure in the most recent information suggests a lower probability of closure before December 1.

Probability: 35%
