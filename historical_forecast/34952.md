I'll approach this forecasting question systematically by analyzing the available information and uncertainties regarding US imports from Colombia for February 2025.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
Based on the current date (May 6, 2025), the February 2025 import data should already be available or will be published very soon. According to the search results, FRED typically releases trade data with a lag of approximately 2 months, as indicated by the February 2025 data being released on April 3rd for other states' import/export figures[1].

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
The research assistant indicates that US imports from Colombia have historically fluctuated but generally remain within the $1,000â€“$2,000 million range per month. Without any significant disruptions, we would expect February 2025 values to fall within this historical range.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
The search results don't provide specific trend information for US-Colombia trade in early 2025. However, they indicate that a potential tariff dispute between the US and Colombia was resolved before February began, suggesting trade likely continued along normal patterns.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
The search results suggest that experts anticipated minimal disruption to US-Colombia trade for February 2025 since the tariff dispute was resolved quickly. Colombia's overall import prices were stable between February and March 2025, indicating no major cost shocks that would significantly impact trade volumes.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
Despite the official resolution of the tariff dispute, lingering uncertainty could have caused Colombian exporters to delay shipments to the US throughout February. Additionally, administrative processing delays at customs following the dispute could have temporarily reduced recorded import values.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
Colombian exporters might have rushed to increase shipments to the US immediately after the tariff threat was lifted, creating a temporary surge in February imports. This could be especially true if shipments had been held back in January during the dispute, creating pent-up supply that was released in February.

Given the information available, I need to forecast US imports from Colombia for February 2025 in millions of dollars. The search results mention Trump pausing proposed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada[5], and there's information about Colombia imposing 50% tariffs on U.S. imports after Trump sanctioned them for denying deportation flights[4]. However, according to the research assistant, this dispute was resolved before February began.

Taking into account historical patterns, recent events, and potential uncertainties, here's my forecast:

Percentile 10: 950
Percentile 20: 1,100
Percentile 40: 1,300
Percentile 60: 1,500
Percentile 80: 1,700
Percentile 90: 1,850
