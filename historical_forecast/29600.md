(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
There are approximately 26 days until December 1, 2024, when the recall status will be checked for resolution.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
As of November 5, 2024, the recall for Hickory Hollow's jerky products is still listed as Active. If no further action or status update occurs, the status will remain Active and the outcome will be No.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
If the USDA FSIS does not change the status from Active to Closed before December 1, 2024—whether due to incomplete recall effectiveness checks, continued product recovery, unresolved procedural issues, or ongoing investigation—the recall will still be open when Metaculus checks the site. This may happen if any step in the recall verification process lags or if FSIS finds additional concerns that delay closure[3][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
If FSIS completes all recall effectiveness checks, confirms all recalled products are removed or accounted for, resolves any compliance or regulatory matters, and formally updates the recall status to Closed before December 1, 2024, the outcome will be Yes. This would likely require clear and timely communication and action by Hickory Hollow and no discovery of adverse health impacts or additional violations[3][5].

## Rationale

- **Recall Type:** This recall is for products produced without the benefit of federal inspection—a procedural violation rather than one arising from confirmed contamination[3][5]. Such recalls can sometimes be resolved more quickly, especially if no illnesses are reported and the company is cooperative in removing product from the market.
- **Health Impact:** No illnesses or injuries have been reported, which reduces public health urgency and may encourage a quicker closure, provided all other requirements are met[5].
- **Timeline:** The recall began August 30, 2024. Average durations for USDA recalls involving labeling or inspection procedural violations (without adverse health outcomes) vary, but three months (by December 1) is within a plausible timeframe for closure—assuming all compliance steps are followed and there are no complicating factors.
- **Complicating Factors:** The establishment changed ownership during the production of the recalled products (June 2024), which can complicate accountability and traceability, potentially slowing the USDA’s closure process[5]. The distribution scope (five states plus online sales) may also add complexity to recall effectiveness verification[3][5].
- **Status Quo Weight:** Recalls, especially those involving wide distribution and regulatory process scrutiny, often remain open for several months or longer. Without clear evidence of closure progress or updates from FSIS since September, it is prudent to give extra weight to the status quo scenario (recall remains Active) as good forecasters typically do.

## Final Probability Forecast

Given the above, and in the absence of any updates indicating expedited resolution or closure progress, the most likely outcome is that the recall will still be listed as Active when checked. While a swift resolution is possible, especially with no adverse health effects reported, the addition of ownership changes and potentially slow regulatory processes reduce the likelihood of closure within the next 26 days.

**Probability: 30%**
