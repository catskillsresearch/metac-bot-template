(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The 2024 CMA Awards ceremony is scheduled for November 20, 2024. Today is November 18, 2024, so there are 2 days remaining until the winner of Single of the Year is officially announced.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Based on expert predictions and industry analysis as of November 7, 2024, Chris Stapleton’s “White Horse” is considered the favorite to win the Single of the Year, with Lainey Wilson’s “Watermelon Moonshine” identified as his main challenger. Both are seen as the likely winners, with Stapleton holding a slight edge[2].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A No outcome occurs if neither Lainey Wilson nor Chris Stapleton wins Single of the Year. This would happen if one of the three other nominees—Shaboozey (“A Bar Song (Tipsy)”), Cody Johnson (“Dirt Cheap”), or Post Malone feat. Morgan Wallen (“I Had Some Help”)—claims the award. For example, a surprise win by Post Malone and Morgan Wallen, who have significant commercial success and crossover appeal, could split the traditional vote or bring in new voters, leading to a win outside the two favorites[2].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome occurs if either Lainey Wilson or Chris Stapleton wins. The most likely scenario is that Chris Stapleton, as the "CMA golden boy" with strong industry support and the commercial/radio impact of “White Horse,” receives the majority of the votes. Alternatively, Lainey Wilson’s industry momentum as the reigning Entertainer of the Year and the popularity of “Watermelon Moonshine” could lead to her victory[2][3].

## Rationale

Recent history and expert sentiment both strongly favor Stapleton and Wilson. The Nashville/CMA voting body has a track record of supporting established country artists over crossover or relative newcomers, and both Stapleton and Wilson have won multiple major awards in 2024, further boosting their profiles in the lead-up to the CMAs[1][4]. While Post Malone and Morgan Wallen’s “I Had Some Help” is a legitimate commercial juggernaut, industry forecasters consistently note the insular nature of CMA voting, making an outsider victory less likely[2].

Key risk factors for an upset include:
- The explosive chart and streaming performance of “I Had Some Help,” which could lead voters to reward mainstream impact over tradition.
- Possible vote-splitting between the two favorites.
- The inherent unpredictability of peer-voted awards.

However, good forecasters recognize that most outcomes mirror the status quo rather than shift dramatically at the last minute. Given the latest expert predictions, historical CMA patterns, and both Stapleton’s and Wilson’s recent dominance, the most probable outcome is a win by one of these two—most likely Stapleton.

**Probability: 80%**
