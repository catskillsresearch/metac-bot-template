(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The question will resolve after the 30 November 2024 election, once the new prime minister is granted a mandate by the president. If no mandate is given before 1 January 2025, the answer defaults to "No." As of 11 November 2024, there are about 7 weeks remaining until the latest possible resolution.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The Left-Green Movement is polling at just 2.4% support, well below major rivals, and is absent from the caretaker government. All indications are that if nothing changes, the next prime minister will not come from the Left-Green Movement[1][2][3].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
If current polling persists, the Left-Green Movement will win very few seats in the Althingi, leaving it without the influence needed to negotiate for the prime ministership. Coalition talks following the election would focus on larger parties, making it highly unlikely for a Left-Green leader to be selected prime minister[2][3].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome would require either a dramatic surge in support for the Left-Green Movement in the last few weeks before the election, or an exceptionally fragmented result where, despite poor polling, VG becomes pivotal in coalition negotiations and larger parties agree to let a Left-Green MP become prime minister. There is no evidence of such a surge or coalition dynamics in current reporting[2][3].

## Rationale

Recent polling places the Left-Green Movement at just 2.4% support, among the lowest of all the parties[3]. Leadership change in October 2024 to Svandís Svavarsdóttir has not improved party fortunes[2]. The party declined to participate in the caretaker government, signifying reduced current influence and signaling a step back from central coalition negotiations[1].

While Icelandic coalition talks are often unpredictable, the Left-Greens have previously only held the prime ministership through unusual coalitions and with far greater relative strength than they have now. At present, significantly stronger parties include the Social Democratic Alliance, Centre Party, and the Independence Party[3]. There is no evidence or polling trend suggesting a reversal for VG.

Given the minimal polling support, the party’s withdrawal from the caretaker government, and the lack of momentum or public opinion swing, the default and overwhelmingly likely outcome is that the next Icelandic prime minister will not belong to the Left-Green Movement.

**Probability: 1%**
