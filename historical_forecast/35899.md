(a) **Time left until outcome:**  
There are just over 2 weeks remaining until March 28, 2025. The last reported rig count was for the week ending March 7, 2025, so about three weekly rig count reports will be released before the target date.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The most recent US active drilling rig count is 592 (for March 7, 2025)[4][5]. In the absence of significant events or new trends, the rig count would be expected to remain close to this level. The rig count has shown only minor fluctuations recently, with the oil rig number holding steady at 486 for several weeks, and small week-to-week changes overall[4][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in an unexpected outcome:**  
An unexpected outcome could result if there is a sudden, significant change in oil or gas prices (for example, a geopolitical or weather event that spikes prices), which could quickly encourage producers to add rigs. Conversely, a surprise regulatory shock, an adverse macroeconomic event, or a sharp drop in commodity prices could prompt a rapid deactivation of rigs. However, given current market stability, such events are less likely but not impossible.

## Rationale

- The US rig count has been remarkably stable over the past several weeks, with the oil-directed rig count anchored at 486 and total rigs hovering in the low 590s[4][5].
- The first week of March saw a minor one-rig decline after five weeks of increases, suggesting stabilization rather than a shift towards a new sustained trend[4].
- There is no evidence of a surge in prices or regulatory changes that would prompt a significant near-term spike or drop.
- The status quo, therefore, is a slow drift with only minor weekly fluctuations, likely keeping the total between 585 and 594 over the next three weekly reports.
- A moderate probability remains for outlier outcomes due to unforeseen events (e.g., commodity price spikes or shocks), but these scenarios are less likely given current trends and the short time until the resolution date.

## Final Probabilities

Based on the above reasoning and the recent rig count of 592, the most likely outcome is that the March 28, 2025, US active drilling rig count will fall within the 590â€“594 range, with smaller, but nontrivial, probabilities assigned to neighboring buckets for potential week-to-week changes or shocks.
