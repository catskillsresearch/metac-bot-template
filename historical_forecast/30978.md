(a) Time until outcome: 7 months, 24 days (from May 6, 2025 to December 30, 2024 - since we're forecasting a past event from our current position)

(b) Status quo outcome: The cheapest Tesla Model Y would remain at $44,990 as mentioned in the question background, resulting in a "No" outcome.

(c) Scenario for "No" outcome: Tesla decides to maintain or increase Model Y pricing due to inflation, supply chain pressures, or strategic pricing adjustments following the end of the 0% APR promotion in December 2024. The base price stays at or above $44,990.

(d) Scenario for "Yes" outcome: Tesla implements a year-end price reduction to boost Q4 2024 sales, cutting the base Model Y price below $44,990, possibly to match competitors or clear inventory before the new year.

As a professional forecaster being interviewed, I want to provide a thorough analysis based on the available information:

The search results indicate that as of October 2024, the Tesla Model Y RWD had "an MSRP of $44,990"[2]. This appears to be the status quo price referenced in the question background as of December 11, 2024. 

When forecasting price movements, I must consider Tesla's history of price adjustments. The search results don't indicate any planned price changes for the end of December 2024. However, I notice that Tesla was offering a significant 0% APR financing promotion that was set to end for orders placed after December 15, 2024 (with deliveries by December 31, 2024)[1][4][5].

The end of this financing promotion could potentially impact pricing in two ways:
1. Tesla might maintain higher base prices after the promotional financing ends
2. Tesla might reduce base prices to compensate for the less attractive financing terms

The search results also mention that the Model Y qualifies for federal EV tax credits of up to $7,500[2], which could influence Tesla's pricing strategy to ensure the vehicle remains competitive after incentives.

Without specific information about planned price changes for December 30, 2024, I must give significant weight to the status quo. The most recent confirmed price point is $44,990, and there's no clear evidence in the search results suggesting an imminent drop below this threshold.

Good forecasters recognize that big changes are rare, and the status quo typically persists. While Tesla does adjust prices periodically, predicting the timing and direction of such changes without specific signals is challenging. The promotional financing ending mid-December suggests Tesla was focused on that incentive rather than base price adjustments.

Probability: 25%
