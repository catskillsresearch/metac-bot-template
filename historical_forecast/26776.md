(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome of this question will be known after September 30, 2024, when the complete Q3 data becomes available. From today (August 1, 2024), that's approximately 2 months.

(b) Status quo outcome: As of July 29, 2024, there has already been one day in Q3 2024 with an AQI above 150 (July 5, 2024). If no additional days exceed this threshold through the end of September, the outcome would be "Yes" (exactly 1 day).

(c) Scenario for a "No" outcome: Additional wildfire smoke from Oregon and eastern Washington reaches Seattle and lingers at ground level for one or more days in August or September, pushing the AQI above 150 for at least one more day, resulting in 2 or more total days above 150 for Q3.

(d) Scenario for a "Yes" outcome: While smoke from wildfires may reach the Seattle area throughout the rest of Q3, it either remains in the upper atmosphere without significantly affecting ground-level air quality, or when it does reach ground level, it only causes moderate air quality degradation with AQI staying below 150.

Based on the available information, I need to assess whether Seattle will experience exactly one day with AQI above 150 in Q3 2024, considering that one such day has already occurred as of July 29.

## Historical Patterns and Current Wildfire Season

Looking at the historical data from 2014-2023, Seattle has experienced varying numbers of days with AQI above 150:
- 2023: 3 days
- 2022: 11 days
- 2021: 2 days
- 2020: 9 days
- 2019: 0 days
- 2018: 7 days
- 2017: 11 days
- 2016: 1 day
- 2015: 3 days
- 2014: 0 days

This gives an average of 4.7 days per year and a median of 3 days. Only one year (2016) had exactly one day with AQI above 150. This suggests that having exactly one such day is relatively uncommon.

## Current Conditions and Near-Term Forecast

According to recent reports, smoke from Oregon and eastern Washington wildfires is expected to reach Seattle by early Friday (August 2, 2024)[3]. The initial impact might be bright sunsets and hazy conditions in the mountains, but air quality could drop to moderate or worse levels[3]. 

The key question is whether this smoke will remain at higher levels of the atmosphere or reach the surface[3]. If it stays aloft, it may not significantly affect AQI readings at ground level. However, if it descends, it could potentially push the AQI above 150.

## 2024 Wildfire Outlook

The 2024 wildfire outlook indicates a quick start to the wildfire season and a slightly more active season than normal across Washington and British Columbia[2]. This suggests an increased likelihood of smoke impacts throughout the remainder of Q3. However, the season could be less active than normal across Oregon and California, especially in the first half[2].

First Street Foundation research predicts that King County (which includes Seattle) will experience about 21 days this year with an AQI over 100[1]. While this threshold is lower than our focus of 150, it indicates a substantial number of days with degraded air quality.

## Factors Increasing Likelihood of Additional High AQI Days

1. We are entering the peak wildfire season, which typically runs from mid-summer through early fall.
2. The forecast for 2024 predicts a more active wildfire season than normal for Washington and British Columbia[2].
3. There are already active wildfires in Oregon and eastern Washington with smoke expected to reach Seattle[3].
4. Historical data shows that years with at least one high AQI day often have multiple such days.
5. Climate trends indicate worsening air quality conditions over time, with Seattle's air quality having already seen a large increase in poor air quality days in recent years[1].

## Factors Decreasing Likelihood of Additional High AQI Days

1. The current smoke forecast suggests it may remain aloft rather than reaching ground level[3].
2. Oregon and California are predicted to have a less active fire season than normal[2], which could reduce smoke transport to Seattle from those regions.
3. Weather patterns and precipitation events could mitigate wildfire risks and clear out smoke.

## Probability Assessment

Given that we already have one day with AQI above 150 in Q3 2024, the question becomes whether we will have additional such days before the end of September.

Based on historical patterns, the more active wildfire season forecast for Washington, and the current smoke conditions approaching Seattle, I believe there is a significant probability of at least one more day with AQI above 150 during August and September.

However, I must also consider that weather patterns are unpredictable, and the smoke currently approaching may remain aloft without significantly affecting ground-level air quality. 

Considering the status quo (one day so far) and the fact that we have approximately two months of peak wildfire season ahead, I estimate the probability of having exactly one day with AQI above 150 in Q3 2024 to be lower than having multiple such days.

Probability: 35%
