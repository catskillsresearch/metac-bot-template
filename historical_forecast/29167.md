(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Roughly 12 days remain until Election Day on November 5, 2024.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of October 24, 2024, Donald Trump has not appeared on the Call Her Daddy podcast or been announced as a scheduled guest[1][3]. If nothing changes, the outcome will be "No."

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Donald Trump does not record, announce, or release an appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast prior to November 5, 2024. No new episodes featuring him are published on the official podcast episode page within the required timeframe[1][3].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
An episode of Call Her Daddy featuring Donald Trump is recorded and released before November 5, 2024, and is listed on the official Spotify episode page after the October 11, 2024, episode. The episode description or title confirms Trumpâ€™s appearance.

## Rationale

- The status quo heavily favors a "No" outcome, as Trump has not signaled intent to accept the invitation publicly[1][3].
- The podcast host Alex Cooper has issued a public invitation, meaning there is willingness and opportunity, and Trump could benefit from a major media appearance in the run-up to the election[1][3].
- However, there is no evidence of negotiation, scheduling, or even a tease of an upcoming Trump episode as of October 24, 2024[1][3].
- Trump's media strategy has generally focused on friendly or traditional platforms; while he occasionally accepts unconventional interviews, there is no pattern suggesting an imminent Call Her Daddy appearance.
- The time for production, promotion, and release is becoming very short. While a surprise drop is possible, the lack of public groundwork or leaks lowers the likelihood.

Given the heavy weight forecasters place on the status quo, and considering the rapidly shrinking window for an announcement or release, the probability is low but not zero due to the unpredictability of campaign media moves.

**Probability: 8%**
