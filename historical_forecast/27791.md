(a) Time left until outcome: About 3.5 months (from May 6, 2025 to September 30, 2024)
(b) Status quo outcome: Cannabis remains a Schedule I substance
(c) No outcome scenario: The DEA review process continues beyond September 30, 2024, as the administrative rulemaking process takes longer than expected, including extended public comment periods and internal review.
(d) Yes outcome scenario: The DEA completes its review process expeditiously and formally publishes a final rule rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III before the September 30, 2024 deadline.

Based on the information provided, I need to assess whether cannabis will be removed from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act before September 30, 2024. Let me analyze the current status and timeline of this process.

On May 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration published a notice of proposed rulemaking to transfer marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III[1]. This marks the official beginning of the formal rulemaking process, following the Department of Health and Human Services' recommendation from August 2023 that marijuana be rescheduled[2].

The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) is the first step in what could be a lengthy administrative process. According to the available information, the publication of the NPRM on May 21, 2024 kicked off a 62-day comment period[4]. This would place the end of the comment period around late July 2024.

After the comment period closes, the DEA would need to review all submitted comments, potentially make adjustments to the proposed rule, and then issue a final rule. This review and finalization process typically takes several months at minimum.

The information explicitly states that "The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is the first step in a potentially long, complex administrative and political process that is expected to extend beyond 2024. If reclassification does happen, a marijuana rescheduling date is unlikely this year"[4]. This direct statement from a July 30, 2024 source strongly suggests that rescheduling will not be completed before September 30, 2024.

Additionally, experts note there is "a level of unpredictability due to the political nature of this specific rescheduling process"[2]. Several factors could further delay the timeline:
- The DEA could request HHS to reconsider its recommendation
- Congress could pass legislation that impacts the timeline
- Potential lawsuits could affect the process[2]

While the Biden administration has initiated this process and there may be political incentives to complete it quickly, the administrative requirements and potential challenges make it unlikely to be finalized before September 30, 2024. The process has multiple required steps that cannot be easily accelerated.

The status quo has been marijuana's classification as a Schedule I substance since the Controlled Substances Act was enacted in 1970. Major regulatory changes typically progress slowly through the federal system, and while this process has begun, it appears to be proceeding at a normal administrative pace rather than being expedited.

Given all these factors - particularly the explicit statement that rescheduling is "unlikely this year" from a source published in July 2024, and the fact that the administrative process is still in its early stages with several more steps required - I must conclude that cannabis is unlikely to be removed from Schedule I before September 30, 2024.

Probability: 15%
