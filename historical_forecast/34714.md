(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome will be known by April 1, 2025, which is approximately 51 days from today (May 6, 2025). However, since the date has already passed, we can evaluate what actually happened.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Apple Maps would continue to display "Gulf of Mexico" as the default label for the body of water west of Florida.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: Apple continues its partial solution where "Gulf of America" only appears when specifically searched for, while maintaining "Gulf of Mexico" as the default label on maps through April 1, 2025.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: Apple fully updates its maps to display "Gulf of America" as the default label for the body of water, or implements a dual-naming system showing both names, before April 1, 2025.

Based on the available search results as of late January 2025, Apple Maps was using a partial solution that did not fully satisfy the criteria for a "Yes" outcome. When users navigated to the Gulf of Mexico region, Apple Maps still displayed the traditional name "Gulf of Mexico" by default[1]. The compromise solution implemented by Apple was that when users specifically searched for "Gulf of America," the text over the Gulf would change to reflect the search term, but the information sheet still showed data about the "Gulf of Mexico"[1].

This approach represents a halfway measure that doesn't meet the criteria for a full change to "Gulf of America." The search results indicate that Apple had remained silent about its plans regarding the name change[1]. Meanwhile, Google had announced it would wait for updates to the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) before implementing changes[1].

Several factors suggest that a full transition to "Gulf of America" as the default label was unlikely to occur before April 1, 2025:

1. Geographic name changes typically follow a formal process through the GNIS, which appeared not to have been completed as of late January 2025[1].

2. Apple's interim solution of showing "Gulf of America" only when searched for suggests the company was trying to navigate political sensitivities without fully committing to the name change[1].

3. The search results indicate that Apple was likely to take a cautious approach similar to Google's plan, where different users might see different labels based on location[1].

4. There was political controversy surrounding the name change, which might have caused Apple to move slowly to avoid backlash[1][3].

5. The implementation of name changes in mapping platforms is technically complex and usually follows official geographic authority updates rather than preceding them[5].

Given these considerations and the strong tendency for the status quo to persist in matters involving international geographic naming conventions, it appears highly unlikely that Apple Maps would have fully transitioned to displaying "Gulf of America" as its default label before April 1, 2025.

The search results from January 2025 show Apple was taking a conservative approach, similar to what we would expect from a company trying to balance political pressures with geographic accuracy and user expectations.
