(a) Time left until outcome: The question asks about an agreement announcement before April 1, 2025, which is less than a month away from the current date (May 6, 2025).

(b) Status quo outcome: The question is actually asking about a past event, as we are now past April 1, 2025. Based on the search results available, there is no indication that Lebanon and the IMF announced an agreement before April 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Lebanon and the IMF continued negotiations but were unable to finalize an agreement before April 1, 2025, due to Lebanon's failure to implement required reforms, particularly regarding banking sector restructuring and banking secrecy laws, as well as political divisions in Lebanon's National Assembly.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Lebanon and the IMF could have reached a preliminary agreement or emergency funding arrangement in late March 2025, possibly accelerated by the urgent reconstruction needs following the Israel-Hezbollah conflict.

## Rationale

The search results provide information up to March 17, 2025, which is about two weeks before the April 1 deadline. As of that time, there was no indication of an imminent agreement between Lebanon and the IMF.

The IMF concluded a fact-finding mission to Lebanon from March 10-13, 2025, led by Ernesto Ramirez Rigo[1][2]. This mission was described as a visit "to meet with the Lebanese authorities and exchange views on the current economic situation"[1] rather than a negotiation to finalize an agreement.

The Foreign Brief analysis from March 13, 2025, explicitly stated that "This IMF visit to Lebanon is unlikely to produce concrete progress towards a full bailout agreement"[2]. The article noted that while Lebanon had made some progress in harmonizing exchange rates and curtailing government borrowing, significant obstacles remained, including:

1. Lebanon's banking secrecy laws still impeding transparency
2. A draft law for depositor compensation facing significant pushback from private banks
3. High deficits incurred during the Israel-Hezbollah war[2]

The World View Stratfor article from March 17, 2025, suggested that while "IMF-Lebanon negotiations will likely produce a draft agreement conditional on financing assurances from creditors," the "division in Lebanon's National Assembly will likely stall key economic reforms, preventing major disbursements"[4]. This indicates that even if negotiations were progressing, actual agreement implementation faced significant hurdles.

The IMF's own press release from March 13, 2025, did not indicate that an agreement was imminent[1], and the Arab News article from March 12, 2025, emphasized that a "unified financial reform plan" was still needed to "unlock foreign funding"[5].

Given the consistent reporting across multiple sources about the significant reforms still required and Lebanon's history of delayed implementation, it appears highly unlikely that an agreement was reached in the short window between March 17 and April 1, 2025.

The status quo in Lebanon-IMF relations has been slow progress and unfulfilled reform commitments since their conditional agreement in 2022. With no evidence of a dramatic breakthrough in the search results, and multiple sources indicating continued obstacles, the most likely outcome is that no agreement was announced before April 1, 2025.

Probability: 5%
