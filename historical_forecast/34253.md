**a) Time until outcome:** 31 days (from Jan 28 to Feb 28, 2025)  
**b) Status quo outcome:** Continuation of current drought (42%+ coverage) affecting major population centers  
**c) No scenario:** Significant rainfall in February reduces drought coverage below critical population thresholds  
**d) Yes scenario:** Persistent drought worsens, maintaining â‰¥42% coverage over high-density areas

### Rationale  
1. **Status quo momentum**: Current 42.29% drought coverage[1] likely includes key population centers like Bexar (2M+), Travis (1.4M), and El Paso (870K) counties explicitly named in the governor's disaster declaration[3]. Even moderate drought coverage of populated regions could easily surpass 15M residents given Texas' ~30M population.  

2. **Climate outlook**: Historical patterns and the governor's extended disaster proclamation suggest drought persistence[3][5]. The 2025 Water Plan highlights an 18% projected water supply decline amid population growth[5], compounding drought vulnerability.  

3. **Water resource stress**: Reservoir levels (e.g., Medina Lake at 3.1%, Choke Canyon at 19.2% in September 2024[4]) show systemic water shortages that cannot be resolved by short-term weather patterns.

**Probability: 70%**  
*(Conservative estimate accounting for potential rainfall, but weighted toward drought persistence given policy responses and historical trends)*
