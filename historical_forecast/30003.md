(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
About 7 weeks remain until December 31, 2024, the relevant observation date.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of early November 2024, a substantial portion of Alabama was experiencing drought, with much of the state classified as "dry" or in at least moderate drought. Streamflows were below normal, and impactful drought conditions persisted due to a prolonged lack of rainfall[1]. Recent months—especially October—were among the driest on record for several major cities in Alabama[1]. The ongoing trend, with forecasts calling for a weak La Niña and increased odds of below-normal precipitation through December, suggests that drought is likely to persist or expand through year-end[1]. Thus, if current conditions and trends hold, the most likely status quo is that a large share of Alabama's population will still be living in drought on December 31.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A "No" would result if significant, widespread rainfall occurs across Alabama in late November or December, lifting enough of the state out of drought categories so that—when population overlays are calculated—fewer than 2.0 million residents are shown as being in drought areas on the Drought.gov Alabama page at resolution. Given the La Niña signal and recent weather patterns, this scenario is possible but unlikely, barring a surprise shift in weather patterns[1].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A "Yes" will occur if drought persists or intensifies, and the Drought.gov overlay shows at least 2.0 million Alabamians within areas classified as drought at the end of December. With much of the state recently classified as drought-affected, below-normal rainfall forecasts, and ongoing deficits, this is the default status quo scenario[1].

## Rationale

- *Weight of the evidence:* The current drought covers a large portion of Alabama, and late-2024 rainfall deficits are historic in some locations[1].  
- *Weather outlook:* Forecasts project below-normal precipitation into December due to a weak La Niña[1].  
- *Policy/Intervention:* There are no anticipated state or federal interventions that would significantly alter underlying weather drivers or lead to rapid drought alleviation before year-end[1].  
- *Population/drought boundary uncertainty:* Reports acknowledge some uncertainty in how drought polygons and population overlays are calculated very close to the resolution date. However, with the entire state recently affected and little sign of relief, a reading above 2.0 million remains the most probable outcome[1].

In forecasting, "the world changes slowly most of the time." Current drought conditions and climate outlooks suggest no major positive change is imminent before December 31.
