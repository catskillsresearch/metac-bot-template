(a) Time left: About 32 days until January 1, 2025, with the election scheduled for December 7, 2024, giving approximately 25 days for a winner to be declared after election day.

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on Ghana's electoral history and the Electoral Commission's established procedures, the status quo would be a timely declaration of the presidential election winner well before January 1, 2025.

(c) No outcome scenario: Severe electoral disputes arise between the NDC and NPP following the December 7 election, with both sides alleging fraud. Legal challenges significantly delay the counting and verification process, pushing the official declaration past December 31, 2024.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: The Electoral Commission follows its planned timeline, completing the vote counting and verification process within 72 hours after the December 7 election, and officially declares a winner by December 10, 2024, as scheduled.

In analyzing whether Ghana will declare a winner in its presidential election before January 1, 2025, I need to evaluate the procedural timeline, historical precedent, and potential risks.

Ghana has scheduled its presidential election for December 7, 2024, with a runoff date of December 28 if needed[5]. The Electoral Commission of Ghana (EC) has established key dates for the electoral process, including election day on December 7 and a potential runoff on December 28[5]. Based on the search results, there is no explicit statement about the exact timeline for declaring results, but we can make inferences from available information.

Ghana has a strong democratic tradition with institutionalized presidential transitions since returning to multiparty politics in 1992[2]. The country has successfully managed four presidential successions, including three transitions between rival political parties, demonstrating a commitment to respecting electoral outcomes[2].

The Electoral Commission of Ghana enjoys a reputation for professionalism, independence, and integrity both within and outside the country[2]. This institutional credibility is maintained through transparency and consistent communication with all parties[2]. The Commission has implemented reforms like continuous voting registration to enhance participation[2].

However, there are some concerning factors. The 2024 election is expected to be highly competitive, given the tight margins in recent elections and the current parity in Parliament (137 representatives for each major party)[2]. Reports indicate heightened tensions between the two main parties - the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the New Patriotic Party (NPP)[3]. Each party appears convinced it must win, with the NDC seemingly unwilling to accept the possibility of an NPP victory[3]. Additionally, predictions from various sources suggest a lead for the NDC's John Mahama (51.1 percent) over NPP's Mahamadu Bawumia (38.2 percent)[5].

The search results explicitly note that "As in the 2020 election, the 2024 election process and results will likely be contested"[5]. Issues like corruption, growing political violence, and vote buying remain significant challenges for the country[5].

Despite these concerns, several factors support the likelihood of a timely declaration:

1. The Electoral Commission's established timeline indicates a clear schedule for the electoral process.
2. Ghana has a history of successful elections with accepted outcomes.
3. Even with a potential runoff on December 28, there would still be time to declare a winner before January 1, 2025.

The key risk would be a contested election that leads to legal challenges delaying the official declaration. However, Ghana's institutional framework and history of peaceful transitions suggest that even with disputes, the Electoral Commission would likely proceed with an official declaration based on their verified results.

Putting extra weight on the status quo outcome - which in Ghana's case is a timely declaration of results - I believe there is a high probability that a winner will be declared before January 1, 2025. Even accounting for potential disputes, Ghana's electoral institutions have demonstrated resilience in previous elections.

Probability: 85%
