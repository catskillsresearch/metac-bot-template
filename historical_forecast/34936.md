(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: About 2 months

Based on the search results, the Six Nations Championship for 2025 is currently underway. It started on January 31, 2025, and typically runs for about 7 weeks with matches played on weekends. The final match day (often called "Super Saturday") appears to have already happened according to search result [2], which indicates that the tournament has concluded with France being crowned champions.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: France wins

According to the most recent and comprehensive information available in the search results, France has already won the 2025 Six Nations Championship. Search result [2] explicitly states: "The Six Nations title race went down to the final match as France beat Scotland to be crowned champions." This is further supported by the final standings table shown in both search results [1] and [2], which place France at the top with 21 points.

(c) A description of a scenario that results in an unexpected outcome: 

An unexpected outcome would be if there were some form of rules violation or administrative issue discovered after the tournament concluded that affected the final standings. For example, if France were found to have fielded an ineligible player in one of their matches, points could potentially be deducted, which might move England (currently in second place with 20 points) into first position. However, this scenario is extremely unlikely given that the tournament appears to have officially concluded.

Looking at the final standings provided in the search results, France has been crowned the 2025 Six Nations champion. The tournament has already concluded, with France finishing at the top of the table with 21 points, followed by England with 20 points and Ireland with 19 points[1][2].

France secured their victory by beating Scotland in the final match at the Stade de France, winning 35-16[2]. This victory was crucial as England had previously defeated Wales 68-14, temporarily moving to the top of the standings[2]. Had France failed to win their final match against Scotland, England would have claimed the title.

The tournament was highly competitive, with France, England, and Ireland all finishing with four wins and one loss each[1][2]. What separated them in the final standings was their bonus points and points difference. France had the best points difference (+125) and accumulated 5 bonus points for a total of 21 points[1][2]. England finished with a points difference of +74 and 4 bonus points, giving them a total of 20 points[1][2]. Ireland had a points difference of +18 and 3 bonus points, for a total of 19 points[1][2].

Scotland finished fourth with 2 wins and 3 losses, accumulating 11 points[1][2]. Italy came fifth with 1 win and 4 losses, gathering 5 points[1][2]. Wales finished at the bottom of the table, losing all 5 of their matches and collecting only 3 points through bonus points[1][2].

This marks France's first Six Nations title since 2022[2]. The victory was particularly meaningful as it came after a period where Ireland had dominated, winning back-to-back championships in 2023 and 2024.
