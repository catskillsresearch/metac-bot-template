(a) Time left until outcome: About 25 days (from the current date of May 6, 2025, until January 1, 2025, which has actually already passed)

(b) Status quo outcome: Since we're now in May 2025, and the question asks about bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, the outcome has already been determined. The status quo outcome would be whether Nikola filed for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: Nikola managed to secure additional funding through capital raises, reduced its cash burn rate significantly, successfully transitioned to hydrogen fuel cell truck production, and generated enough revenue to remain operational through the end of 2024.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Nikola's financial situation deteriorated further in late 2024, with cash reserves depleting as predicted (running out in early 2025), forcing the company to file for bankruptcy protection before the end of 2024.

Looking at the available information and considering that we're now in May 2025 (according to the current date provided), I need to analyze what likely happened with Nikola Corporation before January 1, 2025.

The search results provide information up to December 23, 2024, indicating that Nikola was in significant financial distress at that time. According to the data, Nikola was expected to run out of cash in the first quarter of 2025 after burning through $162 million in the third quarter of 2024[3]. Macroaxis analysis showed Nikola had a probability of bankruptcy of over 82% as of December 23, 2024[5].

Several factors pointed toward a high bankruptcy risk:
- The company had lost 95% of its value over three years leading up to early 2024[1][2]
- Multiple similar EV startups that went public through SPAC mergers had already declared bankruptcy[1][2]
- Nikola's market capitalization and enterprise value were declining significantly[5]

However, there are also factors that suggest Nikola might have survived through the end of 2024:
- In early 2024, analysts noted that Nikola "might not go bankrupt for at least a few quarters, thanks to the massive capital raise and the lower expected cash burn"[1][2]
- The company was predicted to run out of cash in early 2025, not necessarily before January 1, 2025[3]
- There is no specific mention in the search results of Nikola actually filing for bankruptcy by the end of 2024

Since I don't see definitive information about a bankruptcy filing in the search results (which go up to December 23, 2024), and considering that the company was expected to run out of cash in "early 2025" rather than before January 1, 2025, it seems more likely that Nikola managed to survive through the end of 2024, even if in a precarious financial position.

Given the status quo bias and the fact that companies often find ways to extend their runway when faced with imminent bankruptcy (through emergency financing, asset sales, or other measures), I would lean toward Nikola having survived past January 1, 2025, before potentially filing for bankruptcy.

Probability: 30%
