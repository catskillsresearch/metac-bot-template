(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
The outcome will become clear in early March 2025, which is about 2-3 weeks from the current date of February 17, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Currently, there is no evidence from Similarweb’s public rankings or reports indicating that deepseek.com is in or near the global top 50. The status quo outcome is “No,” deepseek.com will not appear in the top 50 globally in Similarweb’s March 2025 update.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Deepseek.com maintains its current traffic levels or experiences only modest growth relative to other global websites. It does not outperform competitors such as established search engines, major news/media platforms, or other rapidly growing AI tools. There is no surge in usage, media attention, or viral effect that propels it into Similarweb’s global top 50.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Deepseek.com experiences a massive, rapid increase in global traffic, potentially due to a viral launch, integration into high-traffic platforms, or a major event driving millions of new users. This growth is both sustained and substantial enough to surpass the current #50-ranked sites globally, moving it into Similarweb’s March 2025 top 50 list.

## Rationale

- **Evidence from Search Results:**  
There is no mention of deepseek.com in Similarweb’s latest top website rankings, nor is it highlighted in the Digital 100 list, which celebrates the fastest-growing websites[4]. The sites listed among the top performers are mostly news/media, finance, and established internet services.
- **Sector Trends:**  
AI platforms like ChatGPT are showing strong performance, but even their climb into the global top ranks took considerable sustained user growth and media attention. Deepseek.com, if it were approaching such ranks, would likely be noted in coverage or digital growth reports—but it is not[4].
- **Status Quo Considerations:**  
Website traffic leadership is sticky at the global scale; rapid movement into the top 50 is very rare and typically noticed in industry coverage. The absence of any evidence of deepseek.com’s explosive growth, combined with the slow pace of change at the very top of global website rankings, strongly favors the status quo outcome.
