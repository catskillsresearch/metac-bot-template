(a) **Time remaining:** 47 days until December 31, 2024.  
(b) **Status quo outcome:** 193 members (no change since 2011[1]).  
(c) **Scenario for No:** A Security Council resolution recommending admission (likely Palestine) passes without vetoes, followed by a successful two-thirds General Assembly vote before year-end.  
(d) **Scenario for Yes:** Persistent Security Council gridlock (particularly vetoes on Palestine[1][5]) and no new states completing the admission process by December 31.  

**Rationale:**  
The UN membership process is deliberately slow, requiring Security Council consensus (no vetoes) and a supermajority General Assembly vote[4][5]. As of November 2024:  
- **Palestine's bid** remains blocked by at least one permanent Security Council member[1][5], with no indication of changed positions in the final 47 days.  
- **Other candidates** (Kosovo, Taiwan, etc.) lack both broad recognition and active applications[3].  
- **No credible independence movements** appear poised to achieve statehood and complete the UN process within weeks[3].  

Historical precedent strongly favors the status quo, as the last membership change (South Sudan) required a 5-year statebuilding process post-independence[1]. A membership shift in 47 days would require unprecedented diplomatic speed, which current geopolitical tensions make improbable.  

**Probability: 95%** (Yes - exactly 193 members on December 31, 2024)
