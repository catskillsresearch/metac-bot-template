(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
About 2 months remain until January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The CDC's official assessment of the risk posed by H5 bird flu to the US general public remains "Low," as of October 18, 2024[4][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (risk assessment rises above Low):**  
A "No" outcome would occur if, before January 1, 2025, the CDC officially updates its H5 Bird Flu: Current Situation page (or a similar official public document) to raise the overall public health risk to "Moderate" or higher. This could happen if:
- H5N1 shows clear, confirmed, ongoing human-to-human transmission in the US or abroad, especially with clusters indicating adaptation to mammals.
- There is a significant increase in severe or fatal cases among the general public (i.e., not just among people with direct animal exposures).
- Substantial changes in viral genetics indicate a higher risk to public health, as judged by the CDC and backed by surveillance or epidemiological evidence.
- CDC receives and discloses new evidence of widespread exposure or higher prevalence among the general public.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (risk assessment remains Low):**  
A "Yes" outcome occurs if, between now and January 1, 2025, the CDC maintains its risk assessment at "Low" in all official and authoritative updates. This would be the case if:
- No evidence emerges of sustained human-to-human transmission.
- Human cases remain rare, isolated, and primarily linked to direct animal exposure.
- Ongoing animal outbreaks and sporadic human exposures do not cause the CDC to reassess the general risk level for the public.
- Surveillance data and technical reports continue to support a "Low" assessment as they consistently have through 2024[4][5].

## Rationale

All official CDC updates throughout 2024, including technical reports in June and July as well as situation summaries through October 18, 2024, have consistently assessed the risk to the US general public from H5/H5N1 bird flu as "Low"[4][5]. Even in the face of expanded animal outbreaks and isolated human cases, the CDC has not raised the risk level for the general US public. The threshold for raising the public risk classification is high and would likely require clear evidence of person-to-person transmission or other major epidemiological changes. The CDC explicitly states that "additional sporadic human cases would not be surprising" but does not consider these grounds to reassess the risk for the public[4].

Given that global influenza events tend to evolve on the timescale of months-to-years rather than weeks, and considering the CDC's cautious and methodical approach to risk reassessment, the status quo outcome (risk remains "Low") deserves the most weight. The "No" outcome, implying a risk upgrade, would require substantial, unusual developments within the next two monthsâ€”none of which are currently indicated by official CDC or global surveillance data.
