(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The question resolves based on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard as accessed on or after April 1, 2025. As of today (May 6, 2025), this outcome has already occurred and should be visible on the public leaderboard.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of the latest pre-cutoff data available (March 12, 2025), Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet was leading the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard with an Arena Score of 1031, ahead of all Chinese models. The top Chinese contender, according to recent updates, was Alibaba’s Qwen2.5-Max, which had just surpassed DeepSeek V3 but was not yet above Claude 3.5 Sonnet or other Anthropic models[3]. If no significant changes occurred in the leaderboard positions, Anthropic would retain the lead and the answer would be No.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or another Anthropic model, maintains a higher Arena Score than all Chinese models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Max or others) on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard as of April 1, 2025. No Chinese model manages to surpass the top Anthropic entry despite recent improvements and momentum.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A Chinese model—most plausibly Alibaba’s Qwen2.5-Max—continues its rapid ascent and, by April 1, 2025, overtakes all Anthropic models (including Claude 3.5 Sonnet) on the leaderboard. This would likely require sustained user preference in pairwise comparisons and/or a notable leap in model capabilities or exposure.

## Rationale

The Chatbot Arena Leaderboard is dynamic, but change at the very top is typically incremental outside of major model releases. The status quo shows Anthropic in a commanding lead, and although Chinese models are rapidly improving (with Alibaba’s Qwen2.5-Max making headlines for surpassing DeepSeek V3), there is no hard evidence they have surpassed Claude 3.5 Sonnet as of March 12, 2025[3]. 

Recent reports do forecast competitive pressure and rapid gains by Chinese organizations, but as of the last available data, Anthropic still holds the advantage[3]. Without concrete leaderboard data showing a Chinese model outscoring Anthropic entries by April 1, the prudent forecast favors the status quo—Anthropic at the top.

Given the strong inertia at the top of leaderboards and the lack of clear, up-to-the-minute evidence of a shift by the cutoff, it is reasonable to assign a higher probability to a No outcome, while acknowledging the significant risk posed by the rapid improvement of Chinese models.

## Final Answer

Probability: 30%  
(A Chinese model has a higher Arena Score than all Anthropic models on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of Q1 2025.)
