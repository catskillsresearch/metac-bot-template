(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 35 days (from August 27, 2024, to October 1, 2024)

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: YouTube remains accessible in Russia, though with degraded performance, and is not officially added to the Roskomnadzor blocklist.

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome: Russia continues its current strategy of throttling and degrading YouTube's performance without implementing a full ban, maintaining it as a "pressure valve" to avoid complete isolation of the Russian population while still limiting access to anti-government content.

(d) A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Following the August 8 disruptions and ongoing throttling, Russian authorities complete their technical preparations and officially add youtube.com to the Roskomnadzor blocklist by mid-September, framing it as a response to YouTube's refusal to restore pro-Kremlin channels.

Based on the available information, I assess that YouTube will likely be banned in Russia before October 1, 2024. Several significant indicators point toward this outcome:

First, there's a clear pattern of escalating actions against YouTube by Russian authorities. The progression started with demands to remove anti-war videos[1], moved to degrading performance in July 2024, and culminated in significant disruptions on August 8, 2024[5]. This step-by-step approach matches Russia's historical pattern when banning other major Western platforms.

Second, official Russian sources have already signaled their intentions. The Atlantic Council reports that the August disruptions were "widely interpreted as the latest step toward blocking" YouTube[5]. Russian media regulator Roskomnadzor has publicly demanded restoration of pro-Kremlin channels, providing a ready-made justification for a ban[5].

Third, the timing aligns with reported plans. There are explicit references to Russian authorities planning to block YouTube in the autumn of 2024[3][5], which falls precisely within our forecast timeframe.

Fourth, YouTube represents the "last bastion" of free expression in Russia, with over 93 million users[3]. From the Kremlin's perspective, this makes it both influential and dangerous, especially as Russia continues its military operations in Ukraine and maintains tight control over domestic narratives.

However, I must consider countervailing factors that support a status quo outcome:

YouTube's massive popularity in Russia (93+ million users) makes a complete ban politically risky. The German Council on Foreign Relations notes YouTube's status as "the last major free social media platform available in Russia"[3], suggesting authorities may hesitate to trigger public backlash.

Additionally, the current strategy of throttling rather than blocking provides a middle ground that already achieves many of the Kremlin's objectives without the political cost of a full ban.

The timing until October 1st is relatively short â€“ just 35 days from the latest information date. Bureaucratic processes could delay implementation beyond this deadline.

While putting appropriate weight on the status quo bias, the evidence of deliberate, staged escalation against YouTube appears overwhelming. The Russian government has already taken substantial steps toward a ban, publicly signaled its intentions, and demonstrated willingness to block major platforms despite their popularity (as with Facebook and Instagram in 2022).

Probability: 75%
