(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are approximately three weeks remaining until January 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Gannett Co. is not currently in bankruptcy, has not filed any bankruptcy petition, and is actively repaying debt and managing liquidity. If current trends persist, the company will *not* file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Gannett continues its present course—using cash flow from operations, executing planned asset sales, and repaying portions of its debt. The company maintains access to liquidity and does not encounter an unexpected financial shock. No bankruptcy petition is filed before the deadline.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
An unforeseen event—such as a sudden, severe deterioration in advertising revenue, a failed debt refinancing, an adverse legal judgment, or a liquidity crisis—renders Gannett unable to meet its immediate financial obligations. With no alternative, the company files for bankruptcy protection before January 1, 2025.

## Rationale

Gannett remains under significant financial pressure, reflecting broader industry headwinds facing print journalism. However, the company’s recent financial statements show that it is *improving* key metrics despite these challenges:

- As of September 30, 2024, Gannett reported $101.8 million in cash, $1.06 billion in principal debt, and had reduced its first lien net leverage to 1.76x—a material improvement from previous periods[1].
- In Q3 2024, the company posted a net loss of $19.7 million, but adjusted EBITDA rose by 5.6% year-over-year to $62.9 million, and free cash flow increased to $19.8 million[1].
- Strategic actions—like asset sales and incremental debt repayments—show management is proactively addressing liquidity and leverage, not signaling imminent distress.
- Gannett’s digital revenues (a key growth focus) are up, and operational cash flow remains positive for consecutive quarters[1][5].
- There have been no bankruptcy warnings, covenant default notices, or signals from management of an impending insolvency event as of December 9, 2024[1][4].

Although the newspaper industry is volatile and Gannett’s long-term prospects are uncertain, bankruptcy filings for public companies are usually preceded by unmistakable warning signs—such as skipped debt payments, liquidity crises, or public defaults—which are not present in Gannett’s latest disclosures. The company's steady execution and financial stabilization efforts make a bankruptcy filing in the next three weeks highly unlikely absent a major, unanticipated shock[1][5].

Given the short time until the resolution date and the lack of any negative triggers or acute liquidity stress, the status quo strongly favors a "No" outcome.
