(a) Time left until outcome is known: About 2 months (from October 25, 2024 to January 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Mike McCarthy remains as the Dallas Cowboys head coach until at least January 1, 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The Cowboys continue to perform poorly during the 2024 season, leading Jerry Jones to fire McCarthy mid-season before January 1, 2025, replacing him with an interim head coach.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Despite any ongoing struggles, Jerry Jones decides to let McCarthy finish out the 2024 regular season before making any coaching changes, keeping him in position through January 1, 2025.

As a professional forecaster, I need to analyze the likelihood of Mike McCarthy remaining the Dallas Cowboys head coach on January 1, 2025, based on the available information.

Mike McCarthy is currently serving as the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys for the 2024 NFL season. He is in the final year of his contract that he signed back in 2020[1][5]. Despite leading the Cowboys to three straight 12-win seasons, McCarthy is considered to be on the "hot seat" due to limited playoff success, with only one playoff win during his tenure[1].

The status quo strongly favors McCarthy remaining the head coach through January 1, 2025. Jerry Jones, the Cowboys' owner, explicitly confirmed McCarthy would return for the 2024 season in a statement released on January 17, 2024[3][4]. NFL teams typically avoid mid-season coaching changes unless the situation becomes untenable.

However, there are several factors that create uncertainty:

1. McCarthy's contract situation: He is in the final year of his deal with no extension expected[5].

2. Performance expectations: The Cowboys have had regular season success under McCarthy but limited playoff achievements. If the team significantly underperforms in 2024, pressure for change could mount[1].

3. Timing considerations: While mid-season firings do happen in the NFL, they're relatively uncommon. Most coaching changes occur after the regular season concludes, which would be after January 1, 2025.

Looking at historical precedent, NFL owners typically allow coaches to complete the season unless there is a complete collapse or locker room dysfunction. Jerry Jones, while known for being demanding, has shown patience with coaches in the past.

The search results indicate that while there is speculation about McCarthy being replaced for the 2025 season, there is no indication of an imminent mid-season firing before January 1, 2025[2][5]. Multiple sources are already discussing potential replacements for McCarthy after the 2024 season concludes, suggesting the expectation is that he will at least complete the current season[2][5].

Potential candidates to replace McCarthy after the season include former NFL head coaches like Mike Vrabel, Pete Carroll, Robert Saleh, and Bill Belichick[2]. These discussions seem focused on the 2025 offseason rather than an immediate change.

Given that NFL regular seasons typically run into January, with the final games usually occurring in early January, the timing makes it more likely that any coaching change would happen after January 1, 2025, rather than before.

Weighing all factors, and placing appropriate weight on the status quo outcome (as changes happen slowly most of the time), I believe there is a high probability that Mike McCarthy will still be the Dallas Cowboys head coach on January 1, 2025.

Probability: 85%
